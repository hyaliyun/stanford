Criticisms are typically leveled against specific theories about the scrolls or their interpretation rather than the scrolls themselves. Nevertheless, I can offer additional examples of scholarly criticism or debates: 11. **The Scrolls' Connection to the Temple in Jerusalem**: - *Scholarly Quote*: \\"Claims that some Dead Sea Scrolls were written in Jerusalem in the Second Temple itself have flimsy foundations.\\" - *Source*: Rachel Elior, as quoted in \\"The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered\\" by Robert Eisenman and Michael Wise (1992). 12. **The Diversity of Judaism and the Scrolls**: - *Scholarly Quote*: \\"The Dead Sea Scrolls offer evidence for the rich diversity of beliefs, practices, and textual traditions within ancient Judaism, which calls into question any unified conception of a 'Bible' in this period.\\" - *Source*: Sidnie White Crawford, in her book \\"Scribes and Scrolls at Qumran\\" (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2019). 13. **The Scrolls and Sectarianism**: - *Scholarly Quote*: \\"The assumption that the Qumran scrolls belonged to the members of a single Jewish sect has been increasingly challenged.\\" - *Source*: Charlotte Hempel, in \\"The Laws of the Damascus Document: Sources, Traditions and Redaction\\" (Leiden: Brill, 1998). 14. **Preservation and Ethics**: - *Scholarly Quote*: \\"The material and ethical challenges to the preservation of the Dead Sea Scrolls cannot be overstated.\\" - *Source*: Pnina Shor, curator and head of the Dead Sea Scrolls Project at the Israel Antiquities Authority, as quoted in various media interviews. 15. **The Scrolls and Biblical Canonization**: - *Scholarly Quote*: \\"The Dead Sea Scrolls complicate our understanding of the development of the biblical canon and suggest there may not have been a single canonical process or definitive canon at the time.\\" - *Source*: Lee Martin McDonald, in his work \\"The Biblical Canon: Its Origin, Transmission, and Authority\\" (Hendrickson Publishers, 2007). 16. **The Scrolls' Interpretation and Sectarian Bias**: - *Scholarly Quote*: “We must ... be very cautious about what the sectarian Dead Sea Scrolls tell us regarding broader Jewish practice or belief.” - *Source*: Lawrence H. Schiffman, in “Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: The History of Judaism, the Background of Christianity, the Lost Library of Qumran” (Jewish Publication Society, 1994). 17. **Authenticity of Recent Fragments**: - *Scholarly Quote*: \\"I hate to say it, but I think the forgers are winning right now.\\" - *Source*: Kipp Davis, discussing the authenticity of some newer scroll fragments, in \\"Dead Sea Scrolls Fragments in the Museum Collection\\" (Brill, 2016). 18. **The Qumran Site's Relationship to the Scrolls**: - *Scholarly Quote*: “It is not self-evident that texts found near Qumran were actually composed there.” - *Source*: Robert Eisenman, in his book “The Dead Sea Scrolls and the First Christians” (1996). 19. **Physical Access to the Scrolls**: - *Scholarly Quote*: “The dominance of a small group of scholars controlling access to the scrolls impeded wider research.” - *Source*: Geza Vermes, expressing early frustration about the limited access to the scrolls by the wider scholarly community, as referenced in various media. 20. **Overemphasis on Apocalypticism**: - *Scholarly Quote*: “To use the Qumran texts to understand early Christianity could lead to an overemphasis on apocalyptic traditions, which are not representative of broader Jewish thought at the time.” - *Source*: John J. Collins, in “Apocalypticism in the Dead Sea Scrolls” (Routledge, 1997). While these points touch upon various academic debates, they all come from established scholars within the field who often point to complexities and challenges—rather than offering outright rejection or denial. The scholarly enterprise of studying the Dead Sea Scrolls involves continual reevaluation of interpretations as new evidence comes to light and as methodologies advance."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Has anyone seen Yuri?

Note that data augmentation is inactive at test time, so the input samples will only be augmented during \`fit()\`, not when calling \`evaluate()\` or \`predict()\`. If you're training on GPU, this may be a good option. **Option 2: apply it to the dataset**, so as to obtain a dataset that yields batches of augmented images, like this: \`\`\`python augmented_train_ds = train_ds.map( lambda x, y: (data_augmentation(x, training=True), y)) \`\`\` With this option, your data augmentation will happen **on CPU**, asynchronously, and will be buffered before going into the model. If you're training on CPU, this is the better option, since it makes data augmentation asynchronous and non-blocking. In our case, we'll go with the second option.

Generative LLMs are typically based on deep learning neural networks, such as the [Transformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) invented by Google researchers in 2017, and are trained on massive amounts of text data, often involving billions of words. These models, such as Google [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/) and [PaLM](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html), are trained with a large dataset from various data sources which allows them to generate output for many tasks. The core of Generative LLMs is predicting the next word in a sentence, often referred as **Causal LM Pretraining**. In this way LLMs can generate coherent text based on user prompts. For a more pedagogical discussion on language models, you can refer to the [Stanford CS324 LLM class](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/lectures/introduction/). \\"\\"\\" \\"\\"\\" Introduction to KerasNLP Large Language Models are complex to build and expensive to train from scratch. Luckily there are pretrained LLMs available for use right away. [KerasNLP](https://keras.io/keras_nlp/) provides a large number of pre-trained checkpoints that allow you to experiment with SOTA models without needing to train them yourself. KerasNLP is a natural language processing library that supports users through their entire development cycle. KerasNLP offers both pretrained models and modularized building blocks, so developers could easily reuse pretrained models or stack their own LLM. In a nutshell, for generative LLM, KerasNLP offers: - Pretrained models with \`generate()\` method, e.g., \`keras_nlp.models.GPT2CausalLM\` and \`keras_nlp.models.OPTCausalLM\`. - Sampler class that implements generation algorithms such as Top-K, Beam and contrastive search. These samplers can be used to generate text with custom models. \\"\\"\\" \\"\\"\\" Load a pre-trained GPT-2 model and generate some text KerasNLP provides a number of pre-trained models, such as [Google Bert](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html) and [GPT-2](https://openai.com/research/better-language-models). You can see the list of models available in the [KerasNLP repository](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp/tree/master/keras_nlp/models). It's very easy to load the GPT-2 model as you can see below: \\"\\"\\" # To speed up training and generation, we use preprocessor of length 128 # instead of full length 1024. preprocessor = keras_nlp.models.GPT2CausalLMPreprocessor.from_preset( \\"gpt2_base_en\\", sequence_length=128, ) gpt2_lm = keras_nlp.models.GPT2CausalLM.from_preset( \\"gpt2_base_en\\", preprocessor=preprocessor ) \\"\\"\\" Once the model is loaded, you can use it to generate some text right away. Run the cells below to give it a try. It's as simple as calling a single function *generate()*: \\"\\"\\" start = time.time() output = gpt2_lm.generate(\\"My trip to Yosemite was\\", max_length=200) print(\\"nGPT-2 output:\\") print(output) end = time.time() print(f\\"TOTAL TIME ELAPSED: {end - start:.2f}s\\") \\"\\"\\" Try another one: \\"\\"\\" start = time.time() output = gpt2_lm.generate(\\"That Italian restaurant is\\", max_length=200) print(\\"nGPT-2 output:\\") print(output) end = time.time() print(f\\"TOTAL TIME ELAPSED: {end - start:.2f}s\\") \\"\\"\\" Notice how much faster the second call is. This is because the computational graph is [XLA compiled](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla) in the 1st run and re-used in the 2nd behind the scenes. The quality of the generated text looks OK, but we can improve it via fine-tuning. \\"\\"\\" \\"\\"\\" More on the GPT-2 model from KerasNLP Next up, we will actually fine-tune the model to update its parameters, but before we do, let's take a look at the full set of tools we have to for working with for GPT2. The code of GPT2 can be found [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp/blob/master/keras_nlp/models/gpt2/). Conceptually the \`GPT2CausalLM\` can be hierarchically broken down into several modules in KerasNLP, all of which have a *from_preset()* function that loads a pretrained model: - \`keras_nlp.models.GPT2Tokenizer\`: The tokenizer used by GPT2 model, which is a [byte-pair encoder](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter6/5?fw=pt). - \`keras_nlp.models.GPT2CausalLMPreprocessor\`: the preprocessor used by GPT2 causal LM training. It does the tokenization along with other preprocessing works such as creating the label and appending the end token. - \`keras_nlp.models.GPT2Backbone\`: the GPT2 model, which is a stack of \`keras_nlp.layers.TransformerDecoder\`. This is usually just referred as \`GPT2\`. - \`keras_nlp.models.GPT2CausalLM\`: wraps \`GPT2Backbone\`, it multiplies the output of \`GPT2Backbone\` by embedding matrix to generate logits over vocab tokens. \\"\\"\\" \\"\\"\\" Finetune on Reddit dataset Now you have the knowledge of the GPT-2 model from KerasNLP, you can take one step further to finetune the model so that it generates text in a specific style, short or long, strict or casual. In this tutorial, we will use reddit dataset for example. \\"\\"\\" import tensorflow_datasets as tfds reddit_ds = tfds.load(\\"reddit_tifu\\", split=\\"train\\", as_supervised=True) \\"\\"\\" Let's take a look inside sample data from the reddit TensorFlow Dataset. There are two features: - **__document__**: text of the post. - **__title__**: the title. \\"\\"\\" for document, title in reddit_ds: print(document.numpy()) print(title.numpy()) break \\"\\"\\" In our case, we are performing next word prediction in a language model, so we only need the 'document' feature. \\"\\"\\" train_ds = ( reddit_ds.map(lambda document, _: document) .batch(32) .cache() .prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE) ) \\"\\"\\" Now you can finetune the model using the familiar *fit()* function. Note that \`preprocessor\` will be automatically called inside \`fit\` method since \`GPT2CausalLM\` is a \`keras_nlp.models.Task\` instance. This step takes quite a bit of GPU memory and a long time if we were to train it all the way to a fully trained state. Here we just use part of the dataset for demo purposes. \\"\\"\\" train_ds = train_ds.take(500) num_epochs = 1 # Linearly decaying learning rate. learning_rate = keras.optimizers.schedules.PolynomialDecay( 5e-5, decay_steps=train_ds.cardinality() * num_epochs, end_learning_rate=0.0, ) loss = keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True) gpt2_lm.compile( optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate), loss=loss, weighted_metrics=[\\"accuracy\\"], ) gpt2_lm.fit(train_ds, epochs=num_epochs) \\"\\"\\" After fine-tuning is finished, you can again generate text using the same *generate()* function. This time, the text will be closer to Reddit writing style, and the generated length will be close to our preset length in the training set. \\"\\"\\" start = time.time() output = gpt2_lm.generate(\\"I like basketball\\", max_length=200) print(\\"nGPT-2 output:\\") print(output) end = time.time() print(f\\"TOTAL TIME ELAPSED: {end - start:.2f}s\\") \\"\\"\\" Into the Sampling Method In KerasNLP, we offer a few sampling methods, e.g., contrastive search, Top-K and beam sampling. By default, our \`GPT2CausalLM\` uses Top-k search, but you can choose your own sampling method. Much like optimizer and activations, there are two ways to specify your custom sampler: - Use a string identifier, such as \\"greedy\\", you are using the default configuration via this way. - Pass a \`keras_nlp.samplers.Sampler\` instance, you can use custom configuration via this way. \\"\\"\\" # Use a string identifier. gpt2_lm.compile(sampler=\\"top_k\\") output = gpt2_lm.generate(\\"I like basketball\\", max_length=200) print(\\"nGPT-2 output:\\") print(output) # Use a \`Sampler\` instance. \`GreedySampler\` tends to repeat itself, greedy_sampler = keras_nlp.samplers.GreedySampler() gpt2_lm.compile(sampler=greedy_sampler) output = gpt2_lm.generate(\\"I like basketball\\", max_length=200) print(\\"nGPT-2 output:\\") print(output) \\"\\"\\" For more details on KerasNLP \`Sampler\` class, you can check the code [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp/tree/master/keras_nlp/samplers). \\"\\"\\" \\"\\"\\" Finetune on Chinese Poem Dataset We can also finetune GPT2 on non-English datasets. For readers knowing Chinese, this part illustrates how to fine-tune GPT2 on Chinese poem dataset to teach our model to become a poet! Because GPT2 uses byte-pair encoder, and the original pretraining dataset contains some Chinese characters, we can use the original vocab to finetune on Chinese dataset. \\"\\"\\" \\"\\"\\"shell # Load chinese poetry dataset. git clone https://github.com/chinese-poetry/chinese-poetry.git \\"\\"\\" \\"\\"\\" Load text from the json file.

I swear, she’s usually here before me…” Sayori: “I haven’t seen her today either. Maybe she got caught up in something?” Natsuki: (putting her hands on her babu bump) “Yeah, she’s probably just running late. Knowing Yuri, she’s lost in a book somewhere.” Monika: “You’re probably right, Natsuki. She does get lost in her own little world sometimes. But I can’t help but worry when she’s not here on time.” Sayori: “Maybe we should send her a text just in case. Just to make sure everything’s okay.” Monika: “That’s a good idea, Sayori. Let me reach out to her.” (Monika takes out her phone and sends a text to Yuri.) Monika: “I just sent her a text asking if everything’s alright. We’ll see if she responds.” Natsuki: “She better not be skipping club again. We have preparations to make for the upcoming literature festival, and we can’t do it without her.” (A few minutes pass, and Yuri still hasn’t responded to Monika’s text.) Monika: “Hmm, she usually responds pretty quickly. I hope she’s okay…” Sayori: “Maybe she’s having trouble with her phone? It wouldn’t be the first time.” Natsuki: “Or maybe she’s just really engrossed in a book and forgot about everything else.” (looking at her belly) “Either way, even my baby girl’s getting worried.” Monika: “Well, let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. We’ll give her a little more time before we start worrying too much. Maybe she’ll show up soon.” Sayori: “Yeah, hopefully she’s just running a little late. We know how absorbed she can get in her reading.” Natsuki: “I guess we can wait a bit longer. But if she’s not here soon, we might have to go check on her. It’s not like Yuri to completely disappear like this.” (More time passes, and still no sign of Yuri.) Monika: “Alright, I’m starting to get really worried now. This isn’t like her at all. Maybe we should go and see if everything’s okay.” Sayori: “I agree. Let’s go to her house and make sure she’s alright. It’s better to be safe than sorry.” Natsuki: “Fine, let’s go. I’m really starting to get concerned. My baby girl can sense something’s not right.” (The three of them quickly gather their things and head towards Yuri’s house.) (At Yuri’s house…) Monika: “Yuri? Are you home? It’s Monika, Sayori, and Natsuki from the literature club.” (After receiving no response, they open the door with a spare key Yuri had given Monika.) Monika: “Yuri? Are you here?” (They search the house, room by room, until they finally find Yuri in her bedroom.) Sayori: “Yuri! Are you okay? We were getting really worried about you!” (Yuri is sitting on her bed, looking disheveled and lost in thought.) Yuri: “Oh…I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to worry you all. I…I had a lot on my mind.” Natsuki: “What happened, Yuri? We were so worried about you. You didn’t even respond to Monika’s text.” Yuri: “I…I’m sorry. I didn’t realize it. I’ve been…struggling with some personal issues lately. It’s been consuming my thoughts.” Monika: “Yuri, you can always talk to us. We’re here for you, not just as club members, but as friends too.” Sayori: “Yeah, Yuri. We care about you a lot. Please don’t shut us out. We want to help.” Yuri: (tearing up) “Thank you, everyone. I… I didn’t mean to worry you, but I didn’t know how to reach out. I’ve been feeling so alone.” Natsuki: “We’re here for you, Yuri. You’re not alone. We’re all in this together, and we’ll support you no matter what.” (The girls gather around Yuri, offering her comfort and reassurance.) Monika: “Let’s take things one step at a time, Yuri. We’ll be here for you every step of the way.” Yuri: (sniffles) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I would do without you.” Natsuki: “Wait, guys, look!” (lifting up her uniform to reveal her belly) “My baby girl’s back to her usual, active self. She must be happy that Yuri is okay now.”","completion":"(Monika, Sayori, and Yuri all laugh, relieved to see Natsuki's baby bump moving.) Monika: \\"Well, that's a good sign, Natsuki.

This will display how each company will utilize an offensive force to deal with a threatening insurrection of rebels.","completion":"In the LANCER tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG), players take the roles of mech pilots in a high-tech, science fiction universe. Different in-game mech manufacturers have their distinct styles and specializations. Let's create three small platoons from Harrison Armory (HA), Smith-Shimano Corpo (SSC), and IPS Northstar (IPS-N), each with unique units and offensive strategies to deal with a rebel insurrection in a large town. Harrison Armory (HA) Platoon: Tactical Supremacy Unit \\"Hammerfall\\" 1. HA Tyrant Commander Mech - \\"Paladin\\" - Equipped with the Regalia Suite, a tactical command system - Sports heavy armor and a powerful Thermonuclear Lance for breaching fortified positions 2. HA Ballistic Support Mechs - \\"Longbows\\" (x2) - Each armed with Railcannons and auto-targeting turrets - Provide long-range fire support and breach enemy defenses from a distance 3. HA Mechanized Infantry Support - \\"Anvils\\" (x4) - Infantry equipped with power armor and portable barrier systems - Serve as a quick reaction force, securing objectives and protecting the heavier mechs Tactics: The HA platoon would utilize overwhelming firepower and strong defensive positions. The \\"Paladin\\" would lead the charge, supported by the \\"Longbows\\" providing long-range precision strikes. The \\"Anvils\\" would follow up to secure the areas cleared by the mech units, establishing forward operating bases and defensive emplacements rapidly. Smith-Shimano Corpo (SSC) Platoon: Agile Engagement Group \\"Phantom Blade\\" 1. SSC Monarch Stealth Commander Mech - \\"Wraith\\" - Cloaking capabilities and a suite of electronic warfare equipment - Specializes in hit-and-run tactics and target disruption 2. SSC Skirmisher Mechs - \\"Ronins\\" (x3) - Fast and agile, equipped with Variable Swords and Particle Rifles - Adapt at flanking maneuvers and ambushes 3. SSC Drone Operators - \\"Haunt\\" (x2) - Deploy swarms of combat drones for reconnaissance and area denial - Equipped with hacking tools to disrupt enemy communications and systems Tactics: SSC's \\"Phantom Blade\\" focuses on mobility and disruption. The \\"Wraith\\" mech would lead covert operations, sabotaging key targets and relaying enemy positions. \\"Ronins\\" would execute swift strikes against exposed enemy flanks, while \\"Haunt\\" units would support the group with a constant flow of battlefield intelligence and indirect combat pressure through their drone swarms. IPS Northstar (IPS-N) Platoon: Combined Arms Cohort \\"Vanguard Forge\\" 1. IPS-N Lancaster Command Mech - \\"Sentinel\\" - Outfitted with a mix of hard-hitting weapons like the Leviathan Heavy Assault Cannon - Equipped with shield projectors to offer protection to allies 2. IPS-N Atlas Assault Mechs - \\"Titans\\" (x3) - Modular loadouts for close combat with heavy blades and shotguns - Can be equipped with siege hammers for urban terrain 3. IPS-N Engineering Corps - \\"Pioneers\\" (x3) - Expert in fortifications, demolitions, and repair operations - Equipped with breaching charges and drones for construction and deconstruction tasks Tactics: The platoon from IPS-N would take a balanced and methodical approach. \\"Sentinel\\" would serve as a mobile fortress, anchoring the line and supporting the \\"Titans\\" as they hammered through rebel defenses. \\"Pioneers\\" focus on maintaining mech operational efficiency and manipulating the urban environment to the platoon’s tactical advantage, using their engineering skills to create chokepoints or breach rebel strongholds. In each case, the respective companies bring their unique strengths and tactical philosophies to bear, showcasing how the diverse nature of LANCER's mech manufacturers translate into varied combat roles and strategies on the battlefield."},{"prompt":"Generate a small platoon of the rebel forces. This platoon comprises their respective units (Can be made up), as they are dispatched to deal with the companies, stated previously, in a large town.","completion":"Rebel Platoon: Defiant Liberation Front \\"Shadow Sparrow\\" 1. Salvaged Command Mech - \\"Revenant\\" - Created from cobbled together mech parts, mostly taken from destroyed corporate mechs - Modified with an ECM (Electronic Countermeasures) suite to disrupt enemy targeting systems 2. Urban Guerrilla Mechs - \\"Ghosts\\" (x3) - Light and nimble, designed for urban environments with grappling hooks and cloaking spray for quick escapes - Armed with makeshift anti-mech weaponry such as magnetic mines and EMP throwers 3. Sniper Recon Mechs - \\"Vigilantes\\" (x2) - Designed for hit-and-run tactics and armed with high-powered rail rifles for long-range engagements - Equipped with active camouflage and advanced optics for reconnaissance 4. Demolitions and Trap Specialist Infantry - \\"Sappers\\" (x5) - Trained in guerrilla warfare and sabotage tactics - Carry an array of explosives, remote detonated charges, and anti-mech traps 5. Support and Requisition Drones - \\"Flock\\" (x8) - Modified civilian and mining drones repurposed for support roles - Provide logistical support, carrying ammo and aid, and execute kamikaze attacks when needed Tactics: The Defiant Liberation Front \\"Shadow Sparrow\\" would fight an asymmetric warfare campaign against the invading mech platoons. \\"Revenant\\" would operate as a mobile command center, using its ECM suite to obscure movements and misdirect fire. \\"Ghosts\\" would use the urban sprawl to employ guerrilla tactics, engaging in hit and fade attacks from the shadows to wear down invading forces. \\"Vigilantes\\" would serve as the platoon's sharpshooters, selecting high-value targets from a distance and providing overwatch. \\"Sappers\\" would be crucial in the fight, using their expertise to lay traps and disrupt the enemy's advances through controlled demolitions and ambush tactics. Lastly, the \\"Flock\\" would provide the necessary logistical support, distributing supplies, and in desperate situations, acting as a last-ditch effort against enemy mechs. By leveraging the town's terrain, maintaining mobility, and using unorthodox tactics, the rebel force \\"Shadow Sparrow\\" would aim to inflict maximum damage while avoiding direct confrontations with the superior corporate forces."},{"prompt":"Generate a small platoon of the rebel forces. This platoon comprises of their respective units (Can be made up), as well as desert-guerrilla-type forces. As they are dispatched to deal with the companies, stated previously, in a desert. State 3 different platoon compositions.","completion":"As the rebel forces face off against highly organized companies such as Harrison Armory, Smith-Shimano Corpo, and IPS Northstar in the harsh environment of a desert, their platoons must be specifically adapted for desert guerrilla warfare. The rebels' strategies would likely focus on mobility, subterfuge, and exploiting the environmental challenges to even the odds. Here are three platoon compositions suited for such conditions: Desert Platoon Composition 1: \\"Sandstorm Swarm\\" 1. Nomad Command Mech - \\"Mirage\\" - Equipped with long-range communications and illusion projection technology - Holographic decoys can lure enemy mechs into traps or ambushes 2. Raider Skimmer Mechs - \\"Duneslicers\\" (x3) - Hover-tech allows quick movement over sandy terrain - Armed with particle beam lances for rapid hit-and-run strikes 3. Sandcrawler Support Units - \\"Oasis\\" (x2) - Heavy-duty transport vehicles modified to withstand desert conditions - Serve as mobile resupply points and feature repair stations for damaged mechs Desert Platoon Composition 2: \\"Dust Devil Squad\\" 1. Dervish Assault Mech - \\"Vortex\\" - Designed for close-quarters combat, featuring high-speed maneuvering jets - Equipped with sand blasters and swirling blade systems that can kick up blinding dust storms 2. Desert Sniper Mechs - \\"Silhouettes\\" (x2) - Utilizing adaptive camouflage and heat-signature dampening technology - Fitted with long-barrel plasma rifles for high-precision, long-distance shots 3. Saboteur Infiltrators - \\"Scorpions\\" (x4) - Elite troops trained in desert survival and stealth tactics - Use EMP grenades and heat-resistant demo charges to incapacitate enemy mechs and sabotage supply lines Desert Platoon Composition 3: \\"Mirage Marauders\\" 1. Pathfinder Leader Mech - \\"Harbinger\\" - Fitted with advanced sensory equipment for navigation and target acquisition in sandstorms - Capable of coordinating strikes and relaying real-time battlefield intel to allied forces 2. Desert Stalker Mechs - \\"Coyotes\\" (x3) - Armored for resistance against sand abrasion and extreme temperatures - Equipped with short-range burst thrusters for sudden lunges and withdrawal, armed with heat scythes and shard shotguns 3. Mobile Artillery Units - \\"Sand Wraiths\\" (x2) - Long-range cannons specialized to shoot over dunes with a predictive trajectory system - Can lay down suppressive fire and launch flares to obscure the sightlines of enemy snipers In concert, each platoon composition employs a different mix of tactics tailored for desert guerrilla warfare against the companies' more traditional mech forces. They focus on exploiting the line-of-sight limitations due to dunes and sandstorms, the long-range nature of desert engagements, and the formidable difficulty of operating machinery in hot, sandy environments. Their goal is to use unconventional and disruptive tactics to diminish the technological and numerical advantages of their opponents."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security.

Email #1, from Steven Griggs: Greetings Beloved Friend, I apologize for disturbing your routine, but I'm sending this message again because I'm not hearing back from you. I would appreciate it if you could read my email, since it needs to be answered right away. I'm Major Steven Griggs. As an American soldier undergoing training in Ukraine, I am collaborating with partners and aiding in the stabilization of the nation in the face of security threats.

During one of the Russian terrorists' attacks, my colleagues and I conducted a rescue operation at a farmhouse where we found boxes containing cash in several currencies. We decided to divide the money among ourselves. I was given the amount mentioned above as my part, and I found it difficult to hide this lot of money. However, with the assistance of a British doctor employed by the Red Cross, I managed to get the parcel delivered to a secure area that was completely out of the way. He doesn't know the true contents of the parcel and thinks it belonged to an American doctor who was killed in a raid in Ukraine. Before giving up, he trusted me to give the gift to his family. Since you are eager to help, I will describe my newly discovered, far more secure method of delivering the box from Ukraine to you for pickup. For your assistance, I am willing to pay you forty percent 40% of the 28 million USD. I am not sure how long we will be here, and I have been shot, hurt, and, by God's special favor, have survived two suicide bombings.

alternate history timeline within the constraints of this particular request would be exceptionally challenging due to the vast scope and large number of variables involved, which go beyond the usual scope of a concise and coherent answer. Nevertheless, I will outline a broad and simplified timeline of a hypothetical scenario in which the Dai Nippon Teikoku (Great Empire of Japan) is restored post-WWII and manages to reclaim some lost territories during the aforementioned period. This scenario disregards many real-world complexities and is for entertainment purposes only: **1946:** After Japan's defeat in WWII in 1945, a secret group of influential politicians, military leaders, and imperial loyalists begin plotting the restoration of Japan's pre-war territories. They find support from segments of the population that remain loyal to the idea of a Greater East Asia. **1947:** The secret group executes a coup, restoring the Dai Nippon Teikoku as a parliamentary constitutional democratic imperial monarchy, but with significant influence from the military and the imperial household. The Gen Ouchou (Minamoto dynasty), belongs to the Daiwa Kōshitsu (the Imperial House of Great Yamato), spearheads the restoration. **1948:** To avoid immediate retaliation from the Allied nations, particularly the USA, Japan focuses on economic reconstruction and technological advancement. They quietly strengthen their Self-Defense Forces and begin diplomatic negotiations to regain control of lost territories. **1950-1953:** During the Korean War, Japan offers support to South Korea with the condition that post-war Korea would enter into a favorable alliance. With UN forces busy in the conflict, Japan occupies Tsushima and begins to establish a foothold in the region. **1954:** Using their growing influence, Japan reclaims Karufuto (Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands) from the Soviet Union by exploiting Cold War tensions and offering concessions in other geopolitical disputes. **1955-1960:** Japan re-establishes economic ties with Southeast Asian countries, projecting soft power and initiating the reclamation of pre-war influence in these regions through investments and bilateral treaties. **1961-1965:** Tensions rise as Japan begins to voice claims over its former holdings, such as the Ryukyu Islands (including Okinawa) and the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Through a combination of strategic political maneuvering and covert military operations, Japan regains control over these areas. **1966-1970:** Chōsen (Korean Peninsula) remains divided, but the South under considerable Japanese influence. Japan establishes semi-autonomous zones in regions with significant Korean populations, framing it as a protective measure against North Korean aggression. **1971-1975:** Formosa (Taiwan) reunites with Japan as a semi-autonomous region following secret negotiations and promises of economic development. Both countries benefit from the arrangement, with Taiwan acting as a key partner in Japan's technological revolution. **1976-1980:** With a robust economy and leading-edge technology, Japan becomes a premier world power. They orchestrate a clandestine support network for anti-communist forces in East Asia, leveraging their position in the ongoing Cold War. **1980-1985:** Japan solidifies control over its reclaimed territories while resisting international criticism. They improve their military capabilities, including nuclear armament, ensuring their security against rivals. **1986-1990:** As the Soviet Union weakens, Japan expands its influence into Southeast Russia and Northeast Asia, establishing economic and military alliances with smaller states that fear Soviet collapse. **1991:** With the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Japan takes advantage of the power vacuum and officially restores the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó (Manchukuo) and Mengjiang as protectorates, rationalizing their actions as a response to regional instability. **1992-1995:** Japan, having restored significant influence in East Asia, acknowledges the restoration of the Zhōnghuá Mínguó (Republic of China) in Mainland China, now ruled by the Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ (Beiyang Government) after the fall of the Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó (People's Republic of China) due to the \\"Liùsì\\" Shìjiàn (Tiananmen Square protests). Japan supports the republic in exchange for economic concessions and political influence. In summary, this alternate history depicts a Japan that takes advantage of Cold War dynamics and regional instabilities to gradually restore a significant portion of its pre-WWII empire. It benefits from the collapse of communist states and the fragmentation of China to reassert claims over its former territories and protectorates, using a combination of diplomacy, economic power, and military strength."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Has anyone seen Yuri?

We’ll be here for you every step of the way.” Yuri: (sniffles) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I would do without you.” Natsuki: “Wait, guys, look!” (lifting up her uniform to reveal her belly) “My baby girl’s back to her usual, active self. She must be happy that Yuri is okay now.” Sayori: “That’s a relief. Even the baby knew something was off. We’re all glad you’re okay, Yuri.” Yuri: “Thank you, Sayori. Your concern means a lot to me.” Monika: “Now that we know you’re safe, let’s focus on helping you through whatever you’re going through. You don’t have to face it alone.” Natsuki: “Yeah, we’ll stick by your side no matter what. We’re not just a literature club, but a group of friends who support each other.” Yuri: “I…I appreciate that so much. I haven’t been dealing with my emotions in a healthy way, but I want to change that. I want to become stronger.” Sayori: “We’ll get through this together, Yuri.

It wouldn’t be the first time.” Natsuki: “Or maybe she’s just really engrossed in a book and forgot about everything else.” (looking at her belly) “Either way, even my baby girl’s getting worried.” Monika: “Well, let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. We’ll give her a little more time before we start worrying too much. Maybe she’ll show up soon.” Sayori: “Yeah, hopefully she’s just running a little late. We know how absorbed she can get in her reading.” Natsuki: “I guess we can wait a bit longer. But if she’s not here soon, we might have to go check on her. It’s not like Yuri to completely disappear like this.” (More time passes, and still no sign of Yuri.) Monika: “Alright, I’m starting to get really worried now. This isn’t like her at all. Maybe we should go and see if everything’s okay.” Sayori: “I agree. Let’s go to her house and make sure she’s alright. It’s better to be safe than sorry.” Natsuki: “Fine, let’s go. I’m really starting to get concerned. My baby girl can sense something’s not right.” (The three of them quickly gather their things and head towards Yuri’s house.) (At Yuri’s house…) Monika: “Yuri? Are you home? It’s Monika, Sayori, and Natsuki from the literature club.” (After receiving no response, they open the door with a spare key Yuri had given Monika.) Monika: “Yuri? Are you here?” (They search the house, room by room, until they finally find Yuri in her bedroom.) Sayori: “Yuri! Are you okay? We were getting really worried about you!” (Yuri is sitting on her bed, looking disheveled and lost in thought.) Yuri: “Oh…I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to worry you all. I…I had a lot on my mind.” Natsuki: “What happened, Yuri? We were so worried about you. You didn’t even respond to Monika’s text.” Yuri: “I…I’m sorry. I didn’t realize it. I’ve been…struggling with some personal issues lately. It’s been consuming my thoughts.” Monika: “Yuri, you can always talk to us. We’re here for you, not just as club members, but as friends too.” Sayori: “Yeah, Yuri. We care about you a lot. Please don’t shut us out. We want to help.” Yuri: (tearing up) “Thank you, everyone. I… I didn’t mean to worry you, but I didn’t know how to reach out. I’ve been feeling so alone.” Natsuki: “We’re here for you, Yuri. You’re not alone. We’re all in this together, and we’ll support you no matter what.” (The girls gather around Yuri, offering her comfort and reassurance.) Monika: “Let’s take things one step at a time, Yuri. We’ll be here for you every step of the way.” Yuri: (sniffles) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I would do without you.” Natsuki: “Wait, guys, look!” (lifting up her uniform to reveal her belly) “My baby girl’s back to her usual, active self. She must be happy that Yuri is okay now.” Sayori: “That’s a relief. Even the baby knew something was off. We’re all glad you’re okay, Yuri.” Yuri: “Thank you, Sayori. Your concern means a lot to me.” Monika: “Now that we know you’re safe, let’s focus on helping you through whatever you’re going through. You don’t have to face it alone.” Natsuki: “Yeah, we’ll stick by your side no matter what. We’re not just a literature club, but a group of friends who support each other.” Yuri: “I…I appreciate that so much. I haven’t been dealing with my emotions in a healthy way, but I want to change that. I want to become stronger.” Sayori: “We’ll get through this together, Yuri. We’ll help you find healthier coping mechanisms and support you every step of the way.” Monika: “Exactly. We’re here to help you learn and grow, Yuri. Just remember, you’re not alone anymore.

Please rewrite this text При воздействии стрессовых факторов в организме развертываются как специфические реакции защиты от действующего фактора, так и неспецифические приспособительные реакции. Комплекс защитных неспецифических реакций организма на неблагоприятные влияния среды был назван Г. Селье (1960) общим адаптационным синдромом. По Г. Селье, развитие реакции организма на стресс, или общий адаптационный синдром, включает три основные фазы: • реакция тревоги, во время которой сопротивление организма понижается («фаза шока»), а затем включаются защитные механизмы; • стадия сопротивления (резистентности), когда напряжением функционирования систем достигается приспособление организма к новым условиям; • стадия истощения, в которой выявляется несостоятельность защитных механизмов и нарастает нарушение согласованности жизненных функций [4]. В первой фазе «реакция тревоги» активизируются защитные силы организма. Организм меняет свои характеристики, будучи подвергнут стрессу. Но сопротивление его недостаточно, и если стрессор сильный (тяжелые ожоги, крайне высокие и крайне низкие температуры), может наступить смерть. Стадия тревоги проявляется дискоординацией различных функций организма, подавлением функций щитовидной и половых желез, в результате чего нарушаются анаболические процессы синтеза белков и РНК; отмечается снижение иммунных свойств организма уменьшаются активность вилочковой железы и количество лимфоцитов в крови; возможно появление язв желудка и 12-перстной кишки; организмом включаются срочные защитные реакции быстрого 20 рефлекторного выброса в кровь гормона надпочечников адреналина, что позволяет резко повысить деятельность сердечной и дыхательной систем, начать мобилизацию углеводных и жировых источников энергии; характерен также излишне высокий уровень энерготрат при низкой умственной и физической работоспособности. Во второй фазе «реакция сопротивления» биологическая адаптация достигает максимума с точки зрения задействованных ресурсов организма. Если действие стрессора совместимо с возможностями адаптации, организм сопротивляется ему. Признаки реакции тревоги практически исчезают, уровень сопротивления поднимается значительно выше обычного. Стадия резистентности, т.е повышенной устойчивости организма, характеризуется возрастанием секреции гормонов коркового слоя надпочечников кортикоидов, что способствует нормализации белкового обмена (активации синтеза белков в тканях); повышается содержание в крови углеводных источников энергии; возникает преобладание концентрации в крови норадреналина над адреналином это обеспечивает оптимизацию вегетативных изменений и экономизацию энерготрат; повышается тканевая устойчивость к действию на организм неблагоприятных факторов среды; возрастает работоспособность. На третьей фазе «истощение» ресурсы организма истощены. После длительного действия стрессора, к которому организм приспособился, постепенно истощаются запасы адаптационной энергии. Вновь появляются признаки реакции тревоги, но теперь они необратимы, и индивид погибает. Стадия истощения возникает при чрезмерно сильных и длительных раздражениях; функциональные резервы организма исчерпываются; происходит истощение гормональных и энергетических ресурсов (содержание катехоламинов в надпочечниках снижается до 10-15 % от исходного уровня); уменьшается максимальное и пульсовое артериальное давление крови; падает сопротивляемость организма повреждающим воздействиям; невозможность дальнейшей борьбы с вредными влияниями может приводить к смертельному исходу. Воздействие экстремальных факторов на организм вызывает у него большие энергетические траты и преобладание процессов катаболизма над процессами анаболизма, при этом адаптация организма достигается «дорогой ценой». Эти три фазы напоминают стадии человеческой жизни: детство (с присущей этому возрасту низкой сопротивляемостью и чрезмерными реакциями на раздражители), зрелость (когда происходит адаптация к наиболее частым воздействиям и увеличивается сопротивляемость) и старость (с необратимой потерей приспособляемости и постепенным одряхлением), заканчивающаяся смертью. Г. Селье выдвинул гипотезу о том, что старение – итог всех стрессов, которым подвергался организм в течение своей жизни. Эта неспецифическая адаптация является эволюционной мерой увеличения жизне- способности организма в экстремальных условиях. В широком смысле адаптация (приспособление) – это совокупность реакций организма, поддерживающих его функциональную устойчивость при изменении условий окружающей среды. Всякая адаптация – это интеграция, т.е. вовлечение в процесс адаптации биологических систем всех уровней организации. Интегрирую- щую роль при этом выполняют нейро-гуморальные механизмы, осуществляющие систему прямых и обратных связей. Большая заслуга в изучении этих связей и осо- бенно роли гипофиз-надпочечниковой системы в механизмах адаптации принадле- жит Селье, который разработал теоретическую базу, позволяющую оценить место общего адаптационного синдрома в этой адаптации. Согласно Селье ОАС протекает в три стадии. Таблица 1. Стадии ОАС Стадия тревоги Стадия устойчивости Стадия истощения В организме наблюдаются изменения, характерные для первого контакта со стрессо- ром. Сопротивляемость сни- жается, и если стрессор до- статочно сильный (большие ожоги), может наступить смерть. Наступает, если продол- жающееся влияние стрес- сора соизмеримо с адап- тацией. Признаки, харак- терные для реакции тре- воги исчезают и сопро- тивляемость становится выше нормы. После долговременного воздействия стрессора, в конечном счете, адапта- ционная энергия исчер- пывается. Вновь появ- ляются признаки реакции тревоги, но теперь они необратимы, и организм умирает. Стадия “тревоги” представляет встряску всего организма, возникает, когда создается угроза гомеостазу. Стадия продолжается от 6 до 48 часов и, в свою оче- редь, состоит из подстадий шока и противошока. Во время стадии противошока мобилизуются основные функциональные системы организма: нервная, симпато- адреналовая и эндокринная. Однако особая роль принадлежит адрено-кортикотроп- ной системе. При длительном воздействии на организм повреждающего фактора наступает стадия устойчивости или адаптации. В стадию устойчивости происходит резкое снижение активности процессов, характеризующих стадию тревого. Эта стадия отвечает высокому уровню сомати- ческой резистентности. Организм становится более устойчивым как к действию раздражителя (стрессора), так и к другим патогенным факторам (перекрестная ре- зистентность). В коре надпочечников развивается устойчивая гипертрофия, сопро- вождающаяся повышенным образованием и секрецией глюкокортикоидов – корти- зола и кортикостерона. Эта стадия выражает попытку организма поддержать состо- яние гомеостаза в присутствии стрессора, который вызвал “тревогу “ в организме. Если воздействие стрессора будет продолжаться или будет очень сильным, то в итоге энергия адаптации, т.е. адаптивные механизмы, участвующие в поддержа- нии резистентности, исчерпывают себя и наступает третья, финальная стадия – стадия истощения. 3-я стадия ОАС не является обязательной. Адаптация может завершиться и второй стадией, приведя к нормализации функций организма. Если же нет, то орга- низм вступает в третью стадию. Здесь организм еще раз запускает в действие реакцию “тревоги”. Эндокринная система резко активизируется. Жизнь организма оказывается под угрозой. В ста- дию истощения обнаруживается обеднение коры надпочечников секреторными гранулами, она истончается, теряет являющиеся источником стероидных гормонов липиды. Если же стресс развивается молниеносно, то гибель больного может произой- ти и на первой стадии при явлениях шока. Трехфазная природа ОАС имеет большое практическое значение поскольку показывает, что адаптационные возможности организма не безграничны, в услови- ях длительного стресса неизбезно наступает их истощение.","completion":"When exposed to stress factors, specific protective reactions against the acting factor unfold in the body, as well as non-specific adaptive reactions. The complex of non-specific defensive reactions of the body to adverse environmental influences was named by H. Selye (1960) as the general adaptation syndrome. According to Selye, the development of the body's reaction to stress, or the general adaptation syndrome, includes three main phases: • The alarm reaction phase, during which the resistance of the body decreases (\\"shock phase\\"), and then protective mechanisms come into play; • The resistance stage, during which the functioning of the body's systems adapts to the new conditions; • The exhaustion stage, during which the inadequacy of protective mechanisms becomes apparent and the coordination of life functions is disrupted. In the first phase, the alarm reaction, the body's protective forces are activated. The body undergoes changes when exposed to stress. However, its resistance is not sufficient, and if the stressor is strong (severe burns, extremely high or low temperatures), death can occur. The alarm stage is characterized by the discoordination of various body functions, suppression of the thyroid and reproductive glands' functions, resulting in disruption of anabolic processes of protein and RNA synthesis. There is a decrease in the body's immune properties, reduced activity of the thymus gland and the number of lymphocytes in the blood, and the possibility of developing ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. Urgent protective reactions are activated in the body, leading to a rapid reflex release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands into the blood, which sharply increases the activity of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, initiates the mobilization of carbohydrate and fat energy sources. It is also characterized by excessive energy expenditure with low mental and physical performance. In the second phase, the resistance reaction stage, biological adaptation reaches its maximum in terms of the resources involved. If the stressor is compatible with the body's adaptation abilities, the body resists it. The signs of the alarm reaction practically disappear,"},{"prompt":"Write an intresting, realistic, plausible, detailed, year by year alternate history timeline in which the Dai Nippon Teikoku/Dai

history timeline based on the complex scenario provided would not only be vast but also is beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide a simplified high-level alternate history timeline based on the outline you’ve given: **Alternate History Timeline: Restoration of the Dai Nippon Teikoku** **1868-1947:** Reign of the Dai Nippon Teikoku (Great Japanese Empire) over East Asia, including the Nihon Hondo (The Japanese Home Islands), Chōsen (Korea), Ryūkyū (Okinawa), Karufuto (Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands), Formosa (Taiwan), Senkaku (Diaoyu Islands), the Carolines, and the Marianas. The empire is ruled by the Daiwa Kōshitsu (Imperial House of Great Yamato), also known as the Gen Ouchou (Minamoto dynasty), as its Ōke (imperial family). **1947:** Following World War II, the Dai Nippon Teikoku is dismantled due to defeat and subsequent occupation by Allied forces. Territories are lost, and Japan transitions to a pacifist state under a democratic constitution. **1970-1980s:** A rebirth of nationalism and economic strength allows Japan to exert soft power on the global stage, fostering the restorationist movements within its former territories and among imperial loyalists. **1989 (Just before the “Liùsì” Shìjiàn):** Behind closed doors, in response to the warming relations between East and West during the end of the Cold War and the increasing instability in China, Japan begins secret negotiations to restore its former protectorates. **1989 (During the “Liùsì” Shìjiàn):** The Tiananmen Square protests lead to a weakening of the CCP's grip on power, causing political fragmentation in China. **1990s:** Capitalizing on the chaotic state of China in the wake of the democracy protests, the Dai Nippon Teikoku quietly re-establishes itself, positioning itself as a protector of stability and order in East Asia. **1991:** The Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó, also known as Manchukuo, is restored as a constitutional monarchy under the nominal rule of the Aisin-Gioro clan, in reality, acting as a puppet to the reinvigorated Japanese government. Similarly, the Mongolyn Öörtöö Zasakh Kholboot Zasgiin Ordon, or Mengjiang, is established as an autonomous government under the influence of Dai Nippon Teikoku. **1992:** The Gen Ouchou leverages the vacuum created by the collapse of the CCP and helps re-establish the Zhōnghuá Mínguó (Republic of China) as the governing body of China, excluding regions like Tibet, Outer Mongolia, and areas traditionally part of Manchurian territory. **1993:** The reformed Běiyáng Zhèngfǔ, now leading the Zhōnghuá Mínguó and asserting itself as a regent for the long-absent Ming dynasty, starts coordinating efforts with the Dai Nippon Teikoku to restore traditional ruling systems in the fragmented post-CCP China. **1994 and Beyond:** Working with Japan, the Dà Mǎnzhōu Dìguó, Mengjiang, and the Zhōnghuá Mínguó create a coalition aimed at re-establishing a historical East Asian order. Traditional monarchies and aristocracies are supported as legitimate alternatives to the failed communist regimes. This representational timeline simplifies an unfathomably complex set of events into key milestones. In reality, such a radical shift is unlikely not just due to geopolitical resistance but the internal diversity and challenges of governance across such a diverse set of territories and populations."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Has anyone seen Yuri?

Комплекс защитных неспецифических реакций организма на неблагоприятные влияния среды был назван Г. Селье (1960) общим адаптационным синдромом. По Г. Селье, развитие реакции организма на стресс, или общий адаптационный синдром, включает три основные фазы: • реакция тревоги, во время которой сопротивление организма понижается («фаза шока»), а затем включаются защитные механизмы; • стадия сопротивления (резистентности), когда напряжением функционирования систем достигается приспособление организма к новым условиям; • стадия истощения, в которой выявляется несостоятельность защитных механизмов и нарастает нарушение согласованности жизненных функций [4]. В первой фазе «реакция тревоги» активизируются защитные силы организма. Организм меняет свои характеристики, будучи подвергнут стрессу. Но сопротивление его недостаточно, и если стрессор сильный (тяжелые ожоги, крайне высокие и крайне низкие температуры), может наступить смерть. Стадия тревоги проявляется дискоординацией различных функций организма, подавлением функций щитовидной и половых желез, в результате чего нарушаются анаболические процессы синтеза белков и РНК; отмечается снижение иммунных свойств организма уменьшаются активность вилочковой железы и количество лимфоцитов в крови; возможно появление язв желудка и 12-перстной кишки; организмом включаются срочные защитные реакции быстрого 20 рефлекторного выброса в кровь гормона надпочечников адреналина, что позволяет резко повысить деятельность сердечной и дыхательной систем, начать мобилизацию углеводных и жировых источников энергии; характерен также излишне высокий уровень энерготрат при низкой умственной и физической работоспособности. Во второй фазе «реакция сопротивления» биологическая адаптация достигает максимума с точки зрения задействованных ресурсов организма. Если действие стрессора совместимо с возможностями адаптации, организм сопротивляется ему. Признаки реакции тревоги практически исчезают, уровень сопротивления поднимается значительно выше обычного. Стадия резистентности, т.е повышенной устойчивости организма, характеризуется возрастанием секреции гормонов коркового слоя надпочечников кортикоидов, что способствует нормализации белкового обмена (активации синтеза белков в тканях); повышается содержание в крови углеводных источников энергии; возникает преобладание концентрации в крови норадреналина над адреналином это обеспечивает оптимизацию вегетативных изменений и экономизацию энерготрат; повышается тканевая устойчивость к действию на организм неблагоприятных факторов среды; возрастает работоспособность. На третьей фазе «истощение» ресурсы организма истощены. После длительного действия стрессора, к которому организм приспособился, постепенно истощаются запасы адаптационной энергии. Вновь появляются признаки реакции тревоги, но теперь они необратимы, и индивид погибает. Стадия истощения возникает при чрезмерно сильных и длительных раздражениях; функциональные резервы организма исчерпываются; происходит истощение гормональных и энергетических ресурсов (содержание катехоламинов в надпочечниках снижается до 10-15 % от исходного уровня); уменьшается максимальное и пульсовое артериальное давление крови; падает сопротивляемость организма повреждающим воздействиям; невозможность дальнейшей борьбы с вредными влияниями может приводить к смертельному исходу. Воздействие экстремальных факторов на организм вызывает у него большие энергетические траты и преобладание процессов катаболизма над процессами анаболизма, при этом адаптация организма достигается «дорогой ценой». Эти три фазы напоминают стадии человеческой жизни: детство (с присущей этому возрасту низкой сопротивляемостью и чрезмерными реакциями на раздражители), зрелость (когда происходит адаптация к наиболее частым воздействиям и увеличивается сопротивляемость) и старость (с необратимой потерей приспособляемости и постепенным одряхлением), заканчивающаяся смертью. Г. Селье выдвинул гипотезу о том, что старение – итог всех стрессов, которым подвергался организм в течение своей жизни. Эта неспецифическая адаптация является эволюционной мерой увеличения жизне- способности организма в экстремальных условиях. В широком смысле адаптация (приспособление) – это совокупность реакций организма, поддерживающих его функциональную устойчивость при изменении условий окружающей среды. Всякая адаптация – это интеграция, т.е. вовлечение в процесс адаптации биологических систем всех уровней организации. Интегрирую- щую роль при этом выполняют нейро-гуморальные механизмы, осуществляющие систему прямых и обратных связей. Большая заслуга в изучении этих связей и осо- бенно роли гипофиз-надпочечниковой системы в механизмах адаптации принадле- жит Селье, который разработал теоретическую базу, позволяющую оценить место общего адаптационного синдрома в этой адаптации. Согласно Селье ОАС протекает в три стадии. Таблица 1. Стадии ОАС Стадия тревоги Стадия устойчивости Стадия истощения В организме наблюдаются изменения, характерные для первого контакта со стрессо- ром. Сопротивляемость сни- жается, и если стрессор до- статочно сильный (большие ожоги), может наступить смерть. Наступает, если продол- жающееся влияние стрес- сора соизмеримо с адап- тацией. Признаки, харак- терные для реакции тре- воги исчезают и сопро- тивляемость становится выше нормы. После долговременного воздействия стрессора, в конечном счете, адапта- ционная энергия исчер- пывается. Вновь появ- ляются признаки реакции тревоги, но теперь они необратимы, и организм умирает. Стадия “тревоги” представляет встряску всего организма, возникает, когда создается угроза гомеостазу. Стадия продолжается от 6 до 48 часов и, в свою оче- редь, состоит из подстадий шока и противошока. Во время стадии противошока мобилизуются основные функциональные системы организма: нервная, симпато- адреналовая и эндокринная. Однако особая роль принадлежит адрено-кортикотроп- ной системе. При длительном воздействии на организм повреждающего фактора наступает стадия устойчивости или адаптации. В стадию устойчивости происходит резкое снижение активности процессов, характеризующих стадию тревого. Эта стадия отвечает высокому уровню сомати- ческой резистентности. Организм становится более устойчивым как к действию раздражителя (стрессора), так и к другим патогенным факторам (перекрестная ре- зистентность). В коре надпочечников развивается устойчивая гипертрофия, сопро- вождающаяся повышенным образованием и секрецией глюкокортикоидов – корти- зола и кортикостерона. Эта стадия выражает попытку организма поддержать состо- яние гомеостаза в присутствии стрессора, который вызвал “тревогу “ в организме. Если воздействие стрессора будет продолжаться или будет очень сильным, то в итоге энергия адаптации, т.е. адаптивные механизмы, участвующие в поддержа- нии резистентности, исчерпывают себя и наступает третья, финальная стадия – стадия истощения. 3-я стадия ОАС не является обязательной. Адаптация может завершиться и второй стадией, приведя к нормализации функций организма. Если же нет, то орга- низм вступает в третью стадию. Здесь организм еще раз запускает в действие реакцию “тревоги”. Эндокринная система резко активизируется. Жизнь организма оказывается под угрозой. В ста- дию истощения обнаруживается обеднение коры надпочечников секреторными гранулами, она истончается, теряет являющиеся источником стероидных гормонов липиды. Если же стресс развивается молниеносно, то гибель больного может произой- ти и на первой стадии при явлениях шока. Трехфазная природа ОАС имеет большое практическое значение поскольку показывает, что адаптационные возможности организма не безграничны, в услови- ях длительного стресса неизбезно наступает их истощение.","completion":"Острый стресс может вызвать различные реакции организма, как специфические защитные реакции, так и неспецифические адаптационные реакции. Ганс Селье описал общий адаптационный синдром, который включает три основные фазы: 1. Фаза тревоги: в этой фазе организм активирует защитные механизмы, но сопротивление все еще недостаточно высоко. Организм может испытывать дискоординацию функций, подавление функций щитовидной и половых желез, снижение иммунитета и другие негативные последствия. 2. Фаза сопротивления: если стрессор совместим с возможностями адаптации организма, он переходит в эту фазу. В этой фазе происходит активация защитных механизмов организма, повышается устойчивость к стрессору и восстанавливается баланс в организме. 3. Фаза истощения: при продолжительном воздействии стрессора организм истощается и неспособен продолжать борьбу с неблагоприятными воздействиями.

Она выскакивает из-под шезлонга и скрывается в высокой траве. Кошка была взволнована и испугана, но в ее сердце еще оставалась желание быть рядом с Эвелин. После ухода кошки, Эвелин затихает и успокаивается. Ее отец успокаивает ее, объясняя, что это была дикая кошка, которая случайно проникла в их сад в поисках еды. Отец собирает Эвелин в объятия, уверяя, что она в безопасности. Спустя несколько дней, когда все происшедшее уже немного забылось, Эвелин находит маленького котенка около своего окна. Он был точно такой же, как и дикая кошка, только в миниатюре. Эвелин уверена, что это котенок дикой кошки, и решает его приютить. Она называет его Шероком, восхищаясь его игривостью и нежностью. Шерлок быстро привыкает к своему новому дому и особенно к Эвелин. Он становится ее верным компаньоном и источником радости. Со временем Эвелин начинает замечать, что Шерлок проявляет особое внимание и привязанность к ней. Он следует за ней повсюду, ласкает своими мягкими лапками и мурлычет, когда она его гладит. Эвелин, постигая мир кошачьей любви, начинает влюбляться в Шерлока. Она видит, как он заботится о ней, как он беспокоится, если она грустит или заболела. Кошка становится для нее настоящим другом и союзником. Так начинается необычная история любви между Эвелин и ее дикой кошкой Шерлоком.

Пока кошка её тащит Эвелин говорит ей : скажи мне ты самка или самец? Кошка, продолжая обнимать Эвелин, мягко шепчет на ухо: “Я - самка, моя милая. И я влюблена в тебя”. Эвелин удивляется такому ответу, но в ее сердце появляется странный всплеск радости. Она понимает, что теперь и она влюблена в кошку и готова идти куда угодно, чтобы быть с ней. Кошка - единственное существо на свете, которое понимает и ценит Её настоящую природу. Она чувствует, как в ней пробуждается нечто новое и неизведанное, и она с нетерпением ждет продолжения их любовной истории.

Она объясняет Эвелин, что она была одной из тех диких кошек, которые проникли в сад и начала целовать девушку.

Most discussions and controversies have centered around their interpretation, the community associated with them, or the implications for our understanding of ancient Judaism and early Christianity—not on the reliability of the scrolls themselves. However, there are debate and skepticism regarding specific aspects of the scrolls. To provide quotations and sources, one must typically look at areas where scholars have disputed particular theories about the scrolls rather than the scrolls' overall reliability. Here are quotations from scholars who have contributed nuanced, often critical perspectives to our understanding of the Dead Sea Scrolls' context.

Ее мякие шерстные лапки легко поглаживают кожу, вызывая приятные ощущения. Девушка начинает мурлыкать и двигаться, наслаждаясь прикосновением кошки. Внезапно, Эвелин просыпается от ощущения, что что-то не так. Она вспоминает, что легла отдохнуть на несколько минут, но теперь находится в объятиях дикой кошки. Паника охватывает ее, она пытается отпихнуть кошку, но она сильна и находчива. Кошка продолжает исследовать тело Эвелин, все более завладевая ее вниманием. Эвелин кричит, пробуждая своего отца, который немедленно бросается к ней на помощь. Дикая кошка, почувствовав опасность. Хочу продолжения, где кошка влюбившийся в Эвелин История продолжается…После того, как отец Эвелин прибегает на помощь, дикая кошка быстро понимает, что ей лучше убежать. Она выскакивает из-под шезлонга и скрывается в высокой траве. Кошка была взволнована и испугана, но в ее сердце еще оставалась желание быть рядом с Эвелин. После ухода кошки, Эвелин затихает и успокаивается. Ее отец успокаивает ее, объясняя, что это была дикая кошка, которая случайно проникла в их сад в поисках еды. Отец собирает Эвелин в объятия, уверяя, что она в безопасности. Спустя несколько дней, когда все происшедшее уже немного забылось, Эвелин находит маленького котенка около своего окна. Он был точно такой же, как и дикая кошка, только в миниатюре. Эвелин уверена, что это котенок дикой кошки, и решает его приютить. Она называет его Шероком, восхищаясь его игривостью и нежностью. Шерлок быстро привыкает к своему новому дому и особенно к Эвелин. Он становится ее верным компаньоном и источником радости. Со временем Эвелин начинает замечать, что Шерлок проявляет особое внимание и привязанность к ней. Он следует за ней повсюду, ласкает своими мягкими лапками и мурлычет, когда она его гладит. Эвелин, постигая мир кошачьей любви, начинает влюбляться в Шерлока. Она видит, как он заботится о ней, как он беспокоится, если она грустит или заболела. Кошка становится для нее настоящим другом и союзником. Так начинается необычная история любви между Эвелин и ее дикой кошкой Шерлоком. И эта история доказывает, что иногда любовь может возникнуть даже между такими необычными партнерами, как человек и животное. Хочу продолжение где вернувшийся влюбившийся в Эвелин, дика кошка похищает и забирает её с собой История продолжается… Долгое время проходит после того, как Эвелин усыновила котенка и назвала его Шерлоком. Они с Шерлоком становятся неразлучными друзьями и проводят много времени вместе. Шерлок всегда рядом с Эвелин, подбадривает ее и дарит ей свою нежность. Эвелин дарит Шерлока своей сестре Однако дикая кошка, которая в прошлый раз пыталась проникнуть в сад Эвелин, не может забыть девушку. Влюбленная в Эвелин и желающая иметь ее себе, дикая кошка разрабатывает план похищения Эвелин. Одним темным и мрачным вечером, когда Эвелин возвращается домой, она замечает странное движение вокруг своего дома. Открытые окна и разбросанные предметы вызывают у нее беспокойство. Она быстро входит в дом и обнаруживает знакомую дикую кошку, которая ждала её возвращения Эвелин в испуге понимает, что это та самая кошка, которая пыталась проникнуть в их сад. Она пытается сбежать, но кошка выигрывает свои ласковые лапы вокруг девушки и удерживает ее. Эвелин кричит на помощь, но никто не слышит ее крики. Дикая кошка уверена в своем плане и намерена увезти Эвелин с собой. Она тащит Эвелин через открытое окно и убегает в ночном мраке. Эвелин пытается сопротивляться и отпихиваться, но кошка оказывается сильной и настойчивой. Они идут все глубже в лес, пока не достигают укрытия кошки. Приближаясь к укрытию, Эвелин все больше и больше осознает, что все ее надежды на спасение сводятся к нулю.Хочу продолжения где дикая кошка предпринимает третью удачную попытку похитить Эвелин История продолжается… Несмотря на предыдущее поражение, дикая кошка не сдается и строит новый план, чтобы похитить Эвелин. Она изучает распорядок дня девушки, выясняет ее привычки и узнает о ее слабостях. Дикая кошка понимает, что на этот раз ей нужно быть еще более предусмотрительной и хитрой. Однажды, когда Эвелин выходит из дома, дикая кошка поджидает ее возле автомобиля. Она прыгает на крышу машины и медленно передвигается к окну водителя, готовясь напасть на Эвелин, когда она вернется. Когда Эвелин возвращается к своей машине, она не подозревает о находящейся на крыше дикой кошке. Когда она открывает дверь, кошка мгновенно прыгает внутрь и нападает на нее. Эвелин оказывается в шоке и пытается сопротивляться, но дикая кошка сильна и быстра. Она цепко держит Эвелин когтями и плотно прижимает ее к себе, чтобы она не могла сопротивляться. Дикая кошка тащит Эвелин в лес, держа ее в своих лапах, дойдя до поляны он начинает её страстно целовать Итак, дикая кошка успешно похищает Эвелин и уводит ее в глубины леса. Под светом луны они достигают уединенной поляны, где кошка начинает страстно целовать девушку. Вначале Эвелин сопротивляется, борясь с кошкой и пытаясь освободиться, но постепенно она чувствует, что эти поцелуи пробуждают в ней нечто новое и необычное. Ей начинают нравиться нежные прикосновения кошки, и она сдаётся, позволяя ей продолжить. Их поцелуи становятся все страстнее, описывая преломленную лунным светом картину любви между дикой кошкой и Эвелин. не выдержав такой страсти кошка подхватив её и уносит в глубь леса, наслаждаясь каждым мгновением с Эвелин. Пока кошка её тащит Эвелин говорит ей : скажи мне ты самка или самец? Кошка, продолжая обнимать Эвелин, мягко шепчет на ухо: “Я - самка, моя милая. И я влюблена в тебя”. Эвелин удивляется такому ответу, но в ее сердце появляется странный всплеск радости. Она понимает, что теперь и она влюблена в кошку и готова идти куда угодно, чтобы быть с ней. Кошка - единственное существо на свете, которое понимает и ценит Её настоящую природу. Она чувствует, как в ней пробуждается нечто новое и неизведанное, и она с нетерпением ждет продолжения их любовной истории. Хочу продолжения где Эвелин спрашивает Дикую кошку Самку, Я помню в первый раз, когда ты ко-мне ты пришла с тобой были ещё дикие кошки где они ? которые меня целовали","completion":"Дикая кошка улыбается и говорит: \\"Те кошки, с которыми я пришла, были моими подругами. Они помогли мне понять и принять свою истинную природу, но они больше не с нами. Они нашли своих сородичей и живут теперь в своем естественном диком окружении. Но я выбрала остаться с тобой, потому что ты особенная для меня. Ты понимаешь и принимаешь меня такой, какая я есть. И я люблю тебя за это\\". Эвелин чувствует, как ее сердце наполняется теплом и радостью. Она глубоко вздыхает и утверждающе говорит: \\"Я тоже люблю тебя. Будь со мной всегда\\". И они остаются в объятиях друг друга, наслаждаясь взаимной любовью и принятием. Их история продолжается, и они вместе преодолевают любые трудности, зная, что они сильнее вместе."},{"prompt":"please change this story I asked llama to create for a video game by setting the story in a spaceship with some kind of system failure in the path to an interesting destination: hi, please write a story for a city building survival game set up in space that fits into the game mechanichs: building the needed builds to collect, process resources and feed the crew and provide their needs In the year 2178, humanity had finally reached the stars. The United Space Colonies (USC) established its first colony on Mars, marking the beginning of a new era of intergalactic exploration and colonization. However, this new frontier came with its own unique challenges. Resources were scarce, and survival was far from guaranteed. You are the newly appointed Station Manager of the USC's latest colony, located on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy. Your job is to oversee the construction and maintenance of the station, ensuring the safety and well-being of the crew. You have been given a budget of 50 million credits to build and upgrade structures, recruit personnel, and manage resources. As you enter the colony, you notice several buildings scattered across the rocky terrain. There's the Life Support Center (LSC), where air, water, and food are processed; the Energy Generator (EG), which powers the entire station; the Medical Bay (MB); and the Crew Quarters (CQ). Each structure has a specific function, but they all rely on one another to keep the colony running smoothly. Your primary objective is to construct and upgrade various buildings to meet the needs of the growing colony. Here are some of the key goals you must accomplish: 1. Build additional Living Spaces to accommodate more crew members. This will increase morale and productivity, as well as free up existing quarters for other purposes. 2. Upgrade the Life Support Center to improve resource efficiency and expand the colony's food production capabilities. This will require materials like Oxygen Tanks, Water Purifiers, and Food Processors. 3. Establish a Communication Array to maintain contact with Earth and other nearby colonies. This will allow for better coordination and support, as well as facilitate trade agreements. 4. Develop an Energy Storage System to ensure a stable power supply during periods of low energy generation or unexpected demand spikes. 5. Construct a Recycling Facility to reduce waste and conserve valuable resources. This can include facilities for composting organic matter, recycling metals, and repurposing old equipment. 6. Hire and train additional staff to handle various roles within the colony, such as Engineers, Scientists, Medics, and Administrators. As your team grows, so does the complexity of managing their needs and keeping them happy and motivated. 7. Explore neighboring planets and asteroids for valuable mineral deposits or rare resources. These discoveries can lead to new opportunities for expansion and growth. 8. Defend against hostile alien encounters by upgrading security systems and investing in advanced weaponry. A robust defense strategy will help protect your crew and preserve the integrity of the colony. 9. Balance resource allocation between short-term needs and long-term planning. For example, allocating too many resources towards immediate survival may neglect crucial research projects that could lead to sustainable solutions down the line. 10. Manage crises as they arise, whether it be natural disasters, technical malfunctions, or personal conflicts among crew members. Effective crisis management will demonstrate your leadership skills and prove vital to the colony's success. As you progress through these objectives, you will encounter various events and challenges that test your ability to adapt and innovate. Whether dealing with unexpected resource shortages or navigating political intrigue among your crew, every decision counts toward shaping the fate of the cosmic colony. With careful planning and strategic thinking, you might just find yourself leading a thriving community on the cutting edge of interstellar civilization.

Voici un résumé de ce qui est mis en place : 1. Des modèles SQLAlchemy pour différentes entités telles que \`Lieu\`, \`Arme\`, \`Saison\`, \`Categorie\`, \`Club\`, \`Competition\`, \`Piste\`, \`TypeMatch\`, \`Escrimeur\`, \`Tireur\`, \`Arbitre\`, \`ParticipantsCompetition\`, \`Poule\`, \`MatchPoule\`, et \`FeuilleMatch\`. 2. Des vues Flask pour la gestion des compétitions, des tireurs, des arbitres, des poules, des matchs, des scores, des inscriptions et des connexions. 3. Des méthodes pour les interactions avec la base de données comme récupérer les compétitions, les armes, les catégories, le nombre de participants, filtrer des compétitions et des adhérents, etc. 4. Des formulaires WTForms pour la connexion, l'inscription et l'édition des utilisateurs. 5. Un système d'authentification utilisateur avec Flask-Login. 6. Utilisation de la bibliothèque Flask-WTF pour la gestion des formulaires. 7. Utilisation de Flask-Mail pour l'envoi d'email, comme pour la vérification d'un changement de mot de passe. 8. Route pour afficher les scores d'une compétition d'escrime et un template \`Affichage-score.html\`. 9. Routes pour des actions comme ajouter un escrimeur, gérer les poules de la compétition, ajouter un arbitre à une compétition, et supprimer un participant. 10. La route \`/update_database\` permet de mettre à jour les données d'une compétition, probablement utilisée avec AJAX. 11. Logging à l'aide du module Python logging pour déboguer. Pour que cette application fonctionne correctement, vous devez vous assurer que vous avez les installations nécessaires, telles que Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF, Flask-Login et Flask-Mail dans votre environnement Python. Si vous avez d'autres questions spécifiques ou des problèmes concernant cette application Flask, n'hésitez pas à demander pour plus de détails ou d'explications supplémentaires !"},{"prompt":"Implémente le back end de la page affichage des scores qui affiche le classement final d’une compétition d’escrime","completion":"Pour implémenter le backend de la page d'affichage des scores pour une compétition d'escrime dans une application Flask, vous devez effectuer plusieurs étapes: 1. **Extraire les données de classement** : Récupérez le classement final de la compétition à partir de la base de données. 2. **Créer une route dans Flask** : Définissez une route qui sert la page d'affichage des scores. 3. **Consulter la base de données** : Faites une requête à la base de données pour obtenir les informations nécessaires. 4. **Préparer les données** : Formatez les données pour qu'elles puissent être utilisées par le template HTML. 5. **Afficher le classement dans le template** : Envoyez les données de classement au template pour affichage. Voici un exemple de code de backend pour la page d'affichage des scores: \`\`\`python from flask import render_template from .app import app from .models import Competition, ClassementFinal, Escrimeur @app.route(\\"/competition/<int:id_comp>/scores\\") def affichage_scores(id_comp): # Récupérez l'objet compétition si nécessaire (vous pouvez vouloir l'afficher dans le template, par exemple son nom) competition = Competition.query.get_or_404(id_comp) # Récupérez les classements finals pour cette compétition classements = ClassementFinal.query.filter_by(idComp=id_comp).order_by(ClassementFinal.position).all() # Compilez les données pour chaque escrimeur dans le classement final scores = [] for classement in classements: escrimeur = Escrimeur.query.get(classement.numeroLicenceE) scores.append({ 'Classement': classement.position, 'Prenom': escrimeur.prenomE, 'Nom': escrimeur.nomE, # Assume 'VM' représente un score ou un ratio que vous devez calculer ou récupérer 'VM': 'N/A', # Mettez ici la logique nécessaire pour calculer le score 'VM' 'Club': 'N/A' # Ajoutez la logique pour obtenir les informations du club }) # Rendez le modèle HTML avec les données du classement final return render_template('Affichage-score.html', competition=competition, data=scores) \`\`\` L'exemple ci-dessus suppose que vous avez un modèle \`ClassementFinal\` qui contient des informations sur les positions finales dans le classement d'une compétition, ainsi qu'un modèle \`Escrimeur\` pour les détails de l'escrimeur. Vous devez ajuster les noms de modèle et les attributs en fonction de ceux réels de votre base de données. La variable \`scores\` est une liste de dictionnaires, chacun contenant les données pour une entrée de classement. La template \`Affichage-score.html\` utilisera ces données pour peupler le tableau des scores. Puisque vous avez déjà le template \`Affichage-score.html\`, assurez-vous qu'il est conçu pour itérer sur la variable \`data\` que vous passez au contexte de la template. N'oubliez pas d'ajouter la logique nécessaire pour calculer le score ou ratio 'VM' (Victoires/Marques), ou de récupérer cette information si elle est déjà calculée ailleurs dans votre application.

Cela signifie que nous ne pouvons pas filtrer directement les matchs en utilisant l'ID de la compétition (\`idComp\`). Pour contourner ce problème et obtenir le VM (Victoires/Marques), vous devez trouver un moyen de relier les matchs au tireur et filtrer ces matchs par la compétition concernée. Voici les étapes pour calculer le VM : 1. Récupérer les matchs de la compétition. 2. Pour chaque tireur, comptabiliser les victoires et les défaites. 3. Calculer le ratio des victoires sur le total des matchs. La jointure dans votre base de données peut se faire à travers la table \`Poule\` si cette dernière contient la référence aux matchs de la compétition concernée.

Ensuite, dans votre frontend (template HTML), vous pouvez ajouter un lien ou un bouton pour télécharger le PDF : \`\`\`html <a href=\\"{{ url_for('telecharger_pdf', id_comp=comp_id) }}\\" class=\\"btn-bas-de-page\\">Télécharger en PDF</a> \`\`\` Assurez-vous de remplacer \`comp_id\` par le bon identifiant de compétition qui doit être envoyé à la route Flask. Si vous utilisez \`pdfkit\`, le processus est similaire, mais vous devrez installer \`wkhtmltopdf\` sur votre serveur et utiliser \`pdfkit\` pour générer le PDF au lieu de \`weasyprint\`. Voici un exemple avec pdfkit : \`\`\`python import pdfkit # ... @app.route(\\"/telecharger-pdf/<int:id_comp>/\\") def telecharger_pdf(id_comp): # ... # Similaire à ce qui est fait avec weasyprint # ... pdf = pdfkit.from_string(rendered, False) response = make_response(pdf) response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/pdf' response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=tableau_scores.pdf' return response \`\`\` Notez que pour que \`pdfkit\` fonctionne, vous devez disposer de wkhtmltopdf installé sur votre système.

I’m really starting to get concerned. My baby girl can sense something’s not right.” (The three of them quickly gather their things and head towards Yuri’s house.) (At Yuri’s house…) Monika: “Yuri? Are you home? It’s Monika, Sayori, and Natsuki from the literature club.” (After receiving no response, they open the door with a spare key Yuri had given Monika.) Monika: “Yuri? Are you here?” (They search the house, room by room, until they finally find Yuri in her bedroom.) Sayori: “Yuri! Are you okay? We were getting really worried about you!” (Yuri is sitting on her bed, looking disheveled and lost in thought.) Yuri: “Oh…I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to worry you all. I…I had a lot on my mind.” Natsuki: “What happened, Yuri? We were so worried about you. You didn’t even respond to Monika’s text.” Yuri: “I…I’m sorry. I didn’t realize it. I’ve been…struggling with some personal issues lately. It’s been consuming my thoughts.” Monika: “Yuri, you can always talk to us. We’re here for you, not just as club members, but as friends too.” Sayori: “Yeah, Yuri. We care about you a lot. Please don’t shut us out. We want to help.” Yuri: (tearing up) “Thank you, everyone. I… I didn’t mean to worry you, but I didn’t know how to reach out. I’ve been feeling so alone.” Natsuki: “We’re here for you, Yuri. You’re not alone. We’re all in this together, and we’ll support you no matter what.” (The girls gather around Yuri, offering her comfort and reassurance.) Monika: “Let’s take things one step at a time, Yuri. We’ll be here for you every step of the way.” Yuri: (sniffles) “Thank you, everyone. I don’t know what I would do without you.” Natsuki: “Wait, guys, look!” (lifting up her uniform to reveal her belly) “My baby girl’s back to her usual, active self. She must be happy that Yuri is okay now.” Sayori: “That’s a relief. Even the baby knew something was off. We’re all glad you’re okay, Yuri.” Yuri: “Thank you, Sayori. Your concern means a lot to me.” Monika: “Now that we know you’re safe, let’s focus on helping you through whatever you’re going through. You don’t have to face it alone.” Natsuki: “Yeah, we’ll stick by your side no matter what. We’re not just a literature club, but a group of friends who support each other.” Yuri: “I…I appreciate that so much. I haven’t been dealing with my emotions in a healthy way, but I want to change that. I want to become stronger.” Sayori: “We’ll get through this together, Yuri. We’ll help you find healthier coping mechanisms and support you every step of the way.” Monika: “Exactly. We’re here to help you learn and grow, Yuri. Just remember, you’re not alone anymore. And Natsuki, about your baby girl…did you come up with a name for her yet?” Natsuki: “Yes, actually! Her name is Sakura.”","completion":"Yuri: \\"Sakura... That's a beautiful name. I'm sure she'll grow up to be as strong and resilient as her mother.\\" Natsuki: \\"Thank you, Yuri. I wanted a name that would remind me of beauty and strength, and Sakura just felt right.\\" Monika: \\"It's a perfect name, Natsuki. And now, let's focus on helping Yuri through her struggles. We'll support her every step of the way, just like we do for each other.\\" Sayori: \\"Definitely! We've been through tough times together, and we've always come out stronger. The same thing will happen with Yuri.\\" Yuri: \\"I... I'm so grateful to have all of you as my friends. I never realized how much I truly needed your support until now.\\" Natsuki: \\"That's what friends are for, Yuri. We're here to lift each other up and help each other through the hard times. You're not alone anymore.\\" Monika: \\"That's right. Together, we can overcome any obstacle. We'll find healthy ways for you to cope, and we'll guide you towards a better path.\\" Yuri: \\"Thank you, everyone. I... I don't deserve such kindness, but I promise I'll do my best to change and become a better person.\\" Sayori: \\"You do deserve kindness, Yuri. And we believe in you. We've seen your growth in the literature club, and we know you can overcome this too.\\" Natsuki: \\"Absolutely! You've shown so much strength and resilience already, and we can't wait to see you continue to grow.\\" Monika: \\"So let's start by talking about what you've been going through, Yuri. Sharing your burdens will help lighten the load, and we'll be here to listen and support you.\\" Yuri: \\"Thank you, Monika. I... I think it's time I open up about my struggles. With all of you by my side, I know I can get through this.\\" (They all gather around Yuri again, ready to listen and offer their unwavering support. Together, they begin the journey towards healing and growth, knowing that with their friendship, they can overcome anything.)"},{"prompt":"ich will eine art ralley/schnitzeljagd (x-mas treasure hunt)für meinen partner planen. dabei will ich verschiedene Orte nutzen, dort hinweise verstecken oder diese vorab geben, sodass mein partner die rätsel lösen muss, um den nächsten ort oder die nächste antwort zu erhalten. Aktuell habe ich bisher folgende Rätsel ideen: bvb18 = name spielers als hinweis? spiele, die 2023 oder 2024 neu rauskommen als rätsel, also zb GTA6 und 6 ist dann der hinweis oder buchstabe im alphabet Bitte hilf mir, indem du weitere ideen gibst für rätsel/quizze und wie ich die schnitzeljagd gestalten könnte. diese wird auf der insel koh tao stattfinden an weihnachten.","completion":"Das ist eine wundervolle Idee, um Weihnachten zu etwas Besonderem für deinen Partner zu machen! Koh Tao ist eine exotische Kulisse, die sich hervorragend für eine aufregende Schnitzeljagd eignet. Hier sind ein paar kreative Ideen, die du in deine Schnitzeljagd einbauen könntest: 1. **Historische und kulturelle Hinweise:** - Nutze bekannte Sehenswürdigkeiten, Skulpturen oder Kunstwerke auf der Insel als Hinweis für die nächste Station. Du könntest etwas über die Geschichte des Ortes recherchieren und ein Rätsel daraus machen, das gelöst werden muss. 2. **Tauch-Themenrätsel:** - Da Koh Tao fürs Tauchen bekannt ist, könntest du ein Rätsel erstellen, das sich auf Meeresbiologie oder Tauchplätze bezieht. Vielleicht muss dein Partner erraten, an welchem Tauchspot ein bestimmtes Fischvorkommen typisch ist. 3. **Strandbeschäftigungen:** - Schreibe eine Nachricht in eine Flasche und verstecke sie im Sand oder befesteige sie an einem schwimmenden Gegenstand im flachen Wasser. Der Hinweis kann an der Flasche befestigt oder in der Flasche versteckt sein. 4. **Naturorientierte Puzzles:** - Benutze Landschaftsmerkmale wie eine besondere Palme, einen auffälligen Felsen oder ein Flussbett, um ein Rätsel zu kreieren. Dein Partner muss die natürliche Landmarke finden und dort den nächsten Hinweis entdecken. 5. **Sprachrätsel:** - Verwende einfache Thai-Wörter oder -Phrasen, die dein Partner entschlüsseln muss, um den nächsten Hinweis zu finden. Das könnte auch bei einem lokalen Restaurant oder Café sein, wo dein Partner den nächsten Hinweis von einem Angestellten erhalten kann. 6. **Essen und Trinken:** - Kreiere ein Rätsel um das Thema lokale Küche. Vielleicht muss dein Partner erraten, welche Zutat in einem lokalen Gericht fehlt, und geht zu diesem Restaurant, um den nächsten Hinweis zu erhalten. 7. **Fotografie Herausforderung:** - Biete eine Reihe von Fotos von Orten auf der Insel als Hinweise an. Dein Partner muss diese Orte finden und ein Selfie machen, um zu beweisen, dass er dort war. 8. **Musikalische Hinweise:** - Integriere lokale Musik in deine Schnitzeljagd. Dein Partner bekommt vielleicht eine Audio-Datei mit einer traditionellen Thai-Melodie und muss herausfinden, welcher Ort oder welche Sehenswürdigkeit damit in Verbindung steht. 9. **Sternbilder-Rätsel:** - Weihnachten ist ein wundervoller Zeitpunkt, um in den Nachthimmel zu blicken. Ein Rätsel könnte sein, ein bestimmtes Sternbild zu finden, das zu einer bestimmten Zeit nur von einem spezifischen Ort sichtbar ist. 10. **Gemeinnütziges Element:** - Baue einen Stopp ein, an dem dein Partner einer lokalen Gemeinde oder einem Naturschutzprojekt helfen kann. Das könnte ein kleiner, bedeutsamer Unterbrechungspunkt sein, der nicht nur eine weitere Aufgabe, sondern auch eine gute Tat darstellt. Für jedes Rätsel kannst du die Koordinaten des nächsten Ortes, verschlüsselte Nachrichten, Bilder oder physische Gegenstände als Hinweis verwenden. Versuche, die Schwierigkeit und den Spaßfaktor der Rätsel zu variieren, damit die Schnitzeljagd spannend bleibt und deinen Partner nicht frustriert. Wichtig ist auch, dass du Plan B für schlechtes Wetter, unzugängliche Bereiche oder andere unvorhergesehene Ereignisse hast. Viel Spaß bei der Planung und Durchführung deines Weihnachtsabenteuers auf Koh Tao!"},{"prompt":"ich würde die schnitzeljadg gerne am sairee beach starten. da wir einen roller haben, können wir überall auf der insel hinfahren. welche konkreten orte könnten sich auf koh tao eignen?","completion":"Koh Tao ist eine kleine Insel, die sich prima für eine Schnitzeljagd mit dem Roller eignet. Mit der Startlinie am Sairee Beach hast du dich bereits für einen der lebhaftesten Strände entschieden. Hier sind einige Vorschläge für Orte auf Koh Tao, die sich für deine Schnitzeljagd anbieten könnten: 1. **Mae Haad Pier:** Dein erstes Rätsel könnte dein Partner direkt zum Hafen führen, wo viele Abenteuer auf der Insel beginnen. Vielleicht ist der Hinweis in Verbindung mit den Booten oder der Meeresumgebung. 2. **Koh Nang Yuan:** Ein kurzer Trip mit dem Wassertaxi von Sairee Beach bringt euch zur schönen Inselgruppe Koh Nang Yuan. Hier könntest du einen Hinweis auf dem Aussichtspunkt verstecken, der eine atemberaubende Aussicht bietet. 3. **Chalok Baan Kao Bay:** An diesem ruhigeren Strand könntest du einen Hinweis in einem Beach-Café oder in der Nähe der bekannten Freedom Beach Bar verstecken. 4. **John Suwan Viewpoint:** Das Lösen eines Rätsels könnte dazu führen, dass dein Partner diesen aussichtsreichen Punkt besuchen muss, um den nächsten Hinweis zu finden. Der Ausblick ist stunning und bietet eine tolle Kulisse für ein Erinnerungsfoto. 5. **Tanote Bay:** Hier kannst du ein Rätsel rund um die Meereswelt integrieren, denn die Bucht ist berühmt für ihre vielfältige Unterwasserwelt – vielleicht ein Hinweis, der nur beim Schnorcheln gefunden werden kann? 6. **Laem Thian:** Diese abgelegene Gegend auf der Ostseite der Insel ist weniger überlaufen und würde sich eignen, wenn du deinem Partner eine kleine Herausforderung beim Finden des Ortes bieten möchtest. 7. **The Tarna Align Resort:** Obwohl es privat ist, könnte ein Hinweis mit dem Resort verbunden sein, etwa durch Beantwortung einer Frage zu dem berühmten Aussichtspunkt oder der Statue, die dort zu finden ist. 8. **Hin Wong Bay:** Integriere einen Hinweis im Zusammenhang mit der atemberaubenden Unterwasserwelt der Bucht. Vielleicht muss dein Partner eine bestimmte Anzahl an Fischen oder Korallenarten benennen oder ein Foto von einer spezifischen Stelle machen. 9. **Fraggle Rock:** Das bekannte Klettergebiet bietet sich für ein Rätsel rund um den Sport oder die Natur an. Du könntest einen Hinweis in der Nähe eines der Kletterpfade verstecken. 10. **Ban’s Diving Resort:** Selbst wenn du nicht tauchst, könntest du dort einen Hinweis verstecken, der etwas mit dem Tauchen zu tun hat oder ihr müsst dort eine bestimmte Person finden, die euch den nächsten Hinweis gibt. Denke daran, dass manche Orte privates Gelände sein könnten oder Eintritt verlangen; bitte immer die Erlaubnis von Eigentümern oder Betreibern einholen, bevor du Hinweise hinterlegst. Außerdem ist es klug, den Umwelteinfluss zu berücksichtigen und sicherzustellen, dass du keine Hinweise hinterlässt, die die Natur schädigen könnten."},{"prompt":"da ich selbst leider keinen roller fahren kann, kann ich nur fußläufig von sairee beach erste hinweise verstecken. welche orte eignen sich dafür und wie könnte ich weitere hinweise geben, wenn ich an manchen orten zuvor noch nicht gewesen bin?","completion":"Fußläufig vom Sairee Beach gibt es auch eine Menge Möglichkeiten, eine Schnitzeljagd zu gestalten. Hier sind einige Ideen für Orte, die du einplanen könntest sowie Tipps, wie du weitere Hinweise geben könntest, ohne die Orte vorab besucht zu haben: **Orte für Hinweise in der Nähe von Sairee Beach:** 1. **Sairee Village:** Beginne vielleicht in den kleinen Gassen des Sairee Village, wo es Geschäfte, Restaurants und kleine Cafés gibt. Ein Hinweis könnte in einem Buchladen oder versteckt in einer Speisekarte eines Lokals liegen. 2. **Sairee Beach selbst:** Der längste Strand von Koh Tao bietet viele Versteckmöglichkeiten. Vielleicht vergräbst du den Hinweis im Sand nahe eines bestimmten Strandabschnitts oder hinter einer Statue entlang der Strandpromenade. 3. **Sairee Plaza:** Dies ist ein kleines Einkaufszentrum in der Nähe des Strandes, wo man diverse Shops und Dienstleistungen findet. Ein Hinweis kann in der Nähe eines speziellen Ladens oder einer auffälligen Dekoration gegeben werden. 4. **Strandbars und Restaurants am Sairee Beach:** Nutze die Außenbereiche von Restaurants, um Hinweise zu platzieren. Dies könnten Rätsel sein, die sich auf die Menükarte oder bestimmte Merkmale des Restaurants beziehen. 5. **Kleine Tempel oder Schreine:** Oft gibt es kleine spirituelle Orte oder Schreine entlang der Straße oder nahe am Strand, die als markante Punkte für Hinweise dienen können. **Zusätzlich Hinweise geben, ohne vor Ort zu sein:** 1. **Fotos und Landkarten:** Bevor du die Schnitzeljagd beginnst, nimm dir die Zeit, Fotos von den besonderen Merkmalen oder Standorten zu machen, und nutze diese als Teil des Rätsels. Du kannst auch Karten nutzen, um deinem Partner zu helfen, den Bereich zu erkunden. 2. **Online Recherche:** Mache eine Recherche im Internet über interessante Orte auf Koh Tao und erstelle darauf basierend Rätsel. Reiseblogs, Artikel und Online-Bewertungen können dir helfen, die Besonderheiten eines Ortes herauszufinden. 3. **Einheimische bitten, Hinweise zu verstecken:** Befrage Einheimische oder Arbeitskräfte in Gaststätten und Hotels, ob sie bereit wären, einen Hinweis für dich zu verstecken. So kannst du sicherstellen, dass der Hinweis dort ist, auch wenn du selbst den Ort nicht besuchen kannst. 4. **Digitale Hinweise:** Nutze QR-Codes, die zu einer Webseite oder einem Bild führen; dein Partner könnte den Code einfach mit seinem Smartphone scannen, um den nächsten Hinweis zu bekommen. 5. **Vorherige Absprachen mit Geschäften:** Kontaktiere Geschäfte, Restaurants oder Dienstleister vorab und frage, ob sie in das Spiel eingeweiht werden können. Vielleicht können sie einen Hinweis für dich auslegen oder ein bestimmtes Wort sagen, wenn dein Partner das Rätsel löst. 6. **Social Media nutzen:** Poste Hinweise oder Bilder auf Social Media, die nur dann zugänglich sind, wenn dein Partner ein Rätsel löst oder an einen bestimmten Ort kommt. Indem du diese Ideen anwendest, kannst du auch aus der Entfernung spannende Herausforderungen für deine Schnitzeljagd schaffen und deinen Partner auf ein abenteuerliches Erlebnis auf Koh Tao schicken."},{"prompt":"bitte Mache eine Recherche im Internet über interessante Orte auf Koh Tao und erstelle darauf basierend Rätsel.

Hier steht ein Zeichen der Mode, umgeben von bunter Pracht - dort wartet der nächste Schritt deiner nächtlichen Jagd.“ (Suche in der Nähe einer auffälligen Boutique oder eines besonderen Schildes im Sairee Plaza.) 3. **Rätselfrage zur Statue The King Rama V Monument:** \\"Wo Ehre in Bronze gegossen, inmitten von Gärten steht, sucht in des Königs stolzer Nähe, wo der Hinweis gut verweht.“ (Ein Hinweis kann nahe einer Statue versteckt sein.) 4. **Rätselfrage zu natürlichen Orientierungspunkten:** \\"Begebe dich zum Ort, wo Baumriesen wachen, deren Wurzeln tief und knorrig. Im Schatten ihrer langen Äste, entdeckst du Hinweise sorrig.“ (Ideal wäre ein Bereich mit markanten Bäumen oder Felsformationen.) 5. **Rätselfrage zum Shark Island:** \\"Ein Inselriff, benannt nach einem Wesen des Meeres, vom Sairee Strand schaust du, es ist nicht zu verfehlen. Welchen Namen trägt die maritime Zier? Nur der richtige Name führt dich näher zur nächsten Spur.“ (Der Hinweis ist eine Frage, die aus der Entfernung beantwortet werden kann, da Shark Island von vielen Punkten der Insel aus sichtbar ist.) 6. **Kryptische Beschreibung des Koh Nang Yuan Viewpoint:** \\"Drei Spitzenschwestern, fest aneinander gereiht, vereint durch Sand, so hell und weit. Erklimme den Pfad, atme tief und sei bereit, denn von oben siehst du klar - die Antwort hier war nie so nah.“ (Dieses Rätsel bezieht sich auf den Aussichtspunkt von Koh Nang Yuan, der vom Festland sichtbar ist.) Für die Umsetzung einer Schnitzeljagd, die keine Interaktion mit Dritten erfordert, könntest du folgende Ideen beachten: - **Vorab platzierte, gut versteckte Hinweise**: Benutze wasserfeste Behälter oder Beutel und verstecke sie an Orten, die leicht zu erreichen, aber nicht offensichtlich sind. Markiere die genauen Koordinaten für dich. - **QR-Codes nutzen**: Platziere QR-Codes an versteckten Stellen, die mit einem Smartphone gescannt werden können und auf ein privates Online-Dokument mit dem nächsten Hinweis führen. - **Natürliche oder stationäre Objekte als Hinweise**: Manchmal kannst du die Rätsel so gestalten, dass sie sich auf permanente, nicht bewegliche Objekte beziehen, wie bestimmte Bäume, Felsformationen oder öffentlich zugängliche Kunstwerke. - **Ortsbasierte Rätsel**: Erstelle Rätsel, die sich auf die Beobachtung von markanten Punkten beziehen, wie das Beispiel mit Shark Island. Dein Partner muss diese Orte nicht besuchen, sondern nur von einem gut sichtbaren Punkt aus erkennen. - **Anwendung von Rätsel-Apps**: Es gibt Apps und Plattformen, die für Schnitzeljagden und Geocaching konzipiert sind, wo du digitale Hinweise hinterlegen kannst, die dann an bestimmten Orten freigeschaltet werden."},{"prompt":"gib mir ideen wie folgende: Aktuell habe ich bisher folgende Rätsel ideen: bvb18 = name des dortmund spielers mit der Nummer als hinweis? spiele, die 2023 oder 2024 neu rauskommen als rätsel, also zb GTA6 und 6 ist dann der hinweis oder buchstabe im alphabet","completion":"Gerne, hier sind einige zusätzliche kreative Rätselideen, die in eine ähnliche Richtung gehen wie deine bisherigen Ideen: 1. **Liedertexte:** Nimm die Anfangsbuchstaben jedes Worts aus einer Zeile eines bekannten Weihnachtslieds oder eines Songs, den dein Partner mag. Diese Buchstaben ergeben dann den nächsten Hinweis, wenn sie korrekt angeordnet werden. Beispiel: \\"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\\" => JB, JB, JATW => Zum nächsten Hinweis führt dich das \\"Jazz Café am Turtle Way\\". 2. **Filmzitate:** Verwende ein berühmtes Zitat aus einem Film, den dein Partner mag, und lass ihn den Film und die besondere Szene erraten, die zum nächsten Hinweis führt. 3. **Bekannte Buchcover:** Gib eine Beschreibung eines Buchcovers (ohne den Titel zu nennen), und die gefundene Farbe oder das gefundene Objekt auf dem Cover ist der Hinweis für den Ort, an dem das nächste Rätsel versteckt ist. 4. **Historische Ereignisse:** Ein bestimmtes historisches Jahr kann deinem Partner sagen, wie viele Schritte er in welche Richtung gehen muss (zum Beispiel \\"1912\\" könnte bedeuten, 19 Schritte nach Osten und 12 Schritte nach Süden). 5. **Himmelsgestirne:** Ein Rätsel könnte eine bestimmte Konstellation oder ein Himmelsobjekt (wie einen Planeten) sein, das zu einer bestimmten Uhrzeit sichtbar ist. Die Position des Sterns könnte auf einen Ort hinweisen, an dem der nächste Hinweis zu finden ist. 6. **Geographische Koordinaten:** Ein Rätsel könnte nur aus Breiten- und Längengraden bestehen, und dein Partner muss ein GPS-Gerät benutzen, um den Ort zu finden. 7. **Ortsbezogene Anagramme:** Erstelle ein Anagramm aus dem Namen eines Ortes oder einer Sehenswürdigkeit auf der Insel, das gelöst werden muss. 8. **Kreuzworträtsel:** Gestalte ein kleines Kreuzworträtsel, bei dem die Lösungswörter auf den Ort des nächsten Hinweises hindeuten. 9. **Nummernschild-Rätsel:** Der Anfangsbuchstabe eines gesehenen nummernschildes könnte für die Koordinate eines nächsten Ortes stehen oder das nächste Lösungswort ergeben. (z.B. \\"KT-1234\\" kann bedeuten, zum \\"Koh Tao Scuba Club\\" zu gehen, 1234 Schritte vom aktuellen Standort entfernt.) 10. **Kochrezepte:** Verwende eine Liste von Zutaten und jedes besondere Gewürz oder jede besondere Zutat ist ein Hinweis für den nächsten Ort (etwa \\"Koriander\\" kann auf den \\"Green Leaf Café\\" hinweisen, der für frische Kräutergerichte bekannt ist). Diese Rätseltypen ermöglichen es deinem Partner, auf spielerische Weise logisches Denken und Kreativität einzusetzen, um von einem Hinweis zum nächsten zu gelangen, und machen die Schnitzeljagd zu einem unterhaltsamen Erlebnis."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security.

When i was the coordinator of the major human right action group in Southern Sudan,I deposited the sum of us1.8M ( One Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in a ( Financial Holding Co.) here in Dakar-Senegal.One very important fact is that i did declared to the (Financial Holding Co.) here as Undisclosed Item-Family Treasure at the time i made the deposit for safety and security reasons,which means that the (Financial Holding Co.) did not understand or know the exact content and amount on the undisclosed item-family treasure and i wouldn't want them to understand the content for for safety and security reasons.Presently,this money is still with the ( Financial Holding Co.) here in Dakar-Senegal.

Например, менеджер по продажам должен обладать коммуникативными способностями для установления контакта с клиентами и убеждения их приобрести продукт. 4. Организационные способности: способность планировать, управлять временем, принимать решения и организовывать работу. Например, руководитель проекта должен обладать организационными способностями для планирования и координации работ по достижению поставленных целей. 5.

Навыки можно развивать и улучшать с течением времени. Например, умение играть на музыкальном инструменте, вождение автомобиля или письменные навыки - это все примеры различных навыков. С другой стороны, термин \\"привычка\\" относится к повторяющемуся и автоматическому поведению, которое становится частью нашей ежедневной рутины. Привычки развиваются путем повторения и постепенного формирования определенного способа действий. Например, привычка заниматься физическими упражнениями каждое утро или привычка регулярного чтения книг - это примеры привычек. Общее между этими терминами заключается в том, что и навыки, и привычки связаны с повторением и практикой действий или активностей. Оба они могут быть полезными и важными для достижения успеха и повышения эффективности в различных сферах жизни. Различие между навыками и привычками заключается в том, что навыки являются конкретными умениями, которые могут быть приобретены и развиты, тогда как привычки относятся к автоматическим и повторяющимся действиям, которые становятся частью нашей рутины. Навыки могут быть осознанными и требуют усилий для их развития, в то время как привычки могут развиваться без нашего осознания и требуют времени и постоянства для их формирования.

Возможно ли было её продолжение? Если да, то при каких условиях?","completion":"Косыгинская реформа, также известная как экономическая реформа 1965 года, предпринималась в СССР при председателе Совета Министров Алексее Косыгине. Она направлялась на частичную децентрализацию и либерализацию управления экономикой, при этом более широко внедряя элементы материального стимулирования и экономической эффективности. Реформа столкнулась с рядом проблем, включая бюрократическое сопротивление со стороны центральных и местных властей, которые не хотели терять контроль над ресурсами и предприятиями. В дополнение к внутренним препятствиям, усложняющим проведение реформы, существовали следующие факторы, которые привели к её свёртыванию: 1. Идеологические возражения: Консервативные элементы в КПСС видели реформу как отход от основ социалистической экономики и страх перед \\"просачиванием\\" капиталистических элементов. 2. Вестед интересы: Многие члены бюрократии были против реформы, поскольку она угрожала их положению и власти, поскольку она предполагала уменьшение централизованного контроля. 3. Экономические трудности: СССР сталкивался с застоем и ухудшением экономического положения, что потребовало от руководства страны усиления централизации экономической политики. 4. Замена лидерства: После смерти Леонида Брежнева в 1982 году постепенно сменилось руководство государства, новые лидеры (Андропов, Черненко) не проявили заинтересованности в проведении экономических реформ. Продолжение реформы было возможно, если бы сочетались следующие условия: - Политическая воля и сильная поддержка со стороны руководства КПСС. - Преодоление бюрократического сопротивления через структурные изменения и реформы. - Более активное вовлечение экономических экспертов и учёных в процесс разработки и реализации реформ. - Сохранение или усиление элементов, способствующих экономической эффективности, прозрачности и конкуренции внутри социалистической системы. - Умелое адаптирование к меняющимся экономическим обстоятельствам, включая международные экономические тренды. Однако в реальности комбинация идеологического противодействия, бюрократического сопротивления и отсутствия эффективного руководства привела к тому, что реформа была постепенно свёрнута, и СССР продолжил следовать пути централизованного управления экономикой до перестройки второй половины 1980-х годов."},{"prompt":"Работа № 4.

In the film \\"Rivers and Tides,\\" directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer, we are granted insight into Goldsworthy's creative process and philosophy. This essay aims to analyze Goldsworthy's central thesis as manifested in his art, focusing on three specific instances of his artistic expressions, and explore the profound message that he conveys as an artist. Thesis Statement: Goldsworthy's central thesis emphasizes two interconnected themes: an intense reverence for nature and a profound acknowledgment of the impermanence of all things. His artworks reflect a deep understanding of the cyclical nature of life and the inherent beauty in its fleeting moments. Body: 1. Stone Stack: One prominent manifestation of Goldsworthy's central thesis is seen through his Stone Stack sculptures. These delicate, gravity-defying formations made solely with stones demonstrate the artist's ability to create balance and harmony. By using rocks sourced from the natural landscape, Goldsworthy not only pays homage to nature but also enhances its inherent beauty. These sculptures symbolize our interconnectedness with the Earth and remind us of the ephemeral nature of life, as they are subject to environmental forces and will eventually succumb to time or weather conditions. 2. Ice and Water Art: Goldsworthy's manipulation of ice and water highlights his concern for the transitory nature of both art and life. In the film, we witness his attempts to create sculptures from ice, such as the intricate ice spirals. Their eventual melting, orchestrated by natural elements, unveils the beauty of impermanence and the acceptance of the cycle of life. Through these works, Goldsworthy invites viewers to embrace the fleeting moments and find solace in the understanding that nothing is permanent. 3. Leaf Paintings: The leaf paintings crafted by Goldsworthy showcase his meticulous attention to detail and the transient nature of organic materials. By arranging vibrant autumn leaves into intricate and often symmetrical patterns, he captures the essence of the changing seasons. These compositions remind us of the beauty found in inevitable decay and transformation. Goldsworthy skillfully immortalizes these fleeting moments through photography, allowing us to appreciate the intricacy of nature's designs and contemplate the intrinsic connections between life and death. Conclusion: Andy Goldsworthy's art fundamentally revolves around his central thesis, which embraces a profound reverence for nature and an acceptance of the inherent impermanence of existence. Through his Stone Stack sculptures, Ice and Water art, and Leaf Paintings, Goldsworthy conveys these themes that resonate deeply with viewers. His creations are a testament to the interconnectedness between art, life, and nature, reminding us to appreciate the beauty of the present moment and find comfort in the inevitability of change. By honoring nature's cycles, Goldsworthy invites us to embrace impermanence, fostering a deep appreciation for the ephemeral beauty that surrounds us. Ultimately, his art serves as a powerful reminder of our connection to nature and the transformational power of accepting life's transitory nature."},{"prompt":"Что такое темперамент?

Руководитель должен быть организованным, стремиться к достижению поставленных целей и обладать лидерскими качествами. Важно, чтобы руководитель был коммуникабельным и умел эффективно взаимодействовать с различными людьми, умел мотивировать их и разрешать конфликты. Также руководитель должен быть компетентным в своей области и обладать умением принимать решения быстро и адекватно. Личность исполнителя, работающего самостоятельно, должна быть самодисциплинированной и ответственной. Такой исполнитель должен быть способен организовать свою работу самостоятельно, без постоянного контроля со стороны руководителя. Ему необходимо быть целеустремленным, нацеленным на достижение результата, и обладать хорошим управлением временем. Также важно, чтобы такой исполнитель был самокритичным и стремился к постоянному саморазвитию. Личность исполнителя, работающего в составе группы, должна быть коммуникабельной и умеющей эффективно сотрудничать со своими коллегами.

Приведите примеры.","completion":"Общие способности, необходимые руководителю, включают в себя как художественные, так и логические способности. Однако, важно отметить, что более уместно обладать логическими способностями, поскольку они помогут руководителю анализировать информацию, принимать обоснованные решения и реализовывать стратегии. Например, руководителю может потребоваться анализировать данные о текущем состоянии рынка, конкурентной среде и ситуации внутри компании для разработки стратегии развития. В этом случае, логические способности помогут ему оценить факторы, выделить ключевые проблемы и предложить лучшие решения. Однако, художественные способности также могут быть полезными для руководителя, особенно в контексте инноваций и творческого подхода к проблемам. Например, руководитель маркетингового отдела может использовать художественные способности для создания эффективной рекламной кампании, придумывая оригинальные идеи и визуальные концепции. Таким образом, хотя обладание и художественными, и логическими способностями является ценным для руководителя, логические способности играют важную роль в принятии стратегических и обоснованных решений, а также в анализе и управлении информацией."},{"prompt":"В чем сущность интерсоциальных или конструктивных способностей?

Эти способности включают эмоциональный интеллект, умение слушать, эффективное коммуникативное взаимодействие, умение управлять конфликтами и установление доверительных отношений. Президент фирмы должен обладать высоким уровнем интерсоциальных способностей. Он должен быть способен эффективно коммуницировать с различными стейкхолдерами, включая сотрудников, инвесторов, партнеров и клиентов. Президент фирмы должен быть эмоционально интеллектуальным, чтобы понимать эмоции и потребности различных людей, и использовать эту информацию для принятия взвешенных решений. Он также должен быть способен управлять конфликтами, строить доверительные отношения и мотивировать команду. Руководитель низового подразделения также должен обладать интерсоциальными способностями, но в нем более важными могут быть навыки коммуникации и управления конфликтами внутри своей команды. Руководитель должен быть хорошим слушателем и уметь эффективно передавать информацию своим подчиненным. Он должен также быть способен решать конфликты, возникающие между членами его команды, и помогать им находить компромиссы и рабочие решения. Например, представим ситуацию, когда в компании возник между отдельными сотрудниками конфликт из-за несогласия во время коллективного проекта. Руководитель низового подразделения должен проявить свои интерсоциальные способности, чтобы выслушать обе стороны, помочь им понять позицию друг друга и совместно найти решение для продолжения работы без дальнейших противоречий."},{"prompt":"If the following is true, what are the 32 most important implications: That true leadership is offloading the weight of blame from people to systems.","completion":"If we accept the statement that true leadership is about offloading the weight of blame from people to systems, there are several notable implications that follow. Here are 32 implications that may be considered important: 1. **Focus on Systems Improvement**: There will be a greater focus on improving systems, processes, and structures rather than targeting individuals when things go wrong. 2. **Cultural Shift**: Cultural change within organizations might occur, whereby mistakes are viewed as opportunities for learning and growth rather than as failures to be punished. 3. **Psychological Safety**: Workplaces could become more psychologically safe, encouraging open communication and risk-taking without fear of blame. 4. **Accountability Structure**: Organizations must establish a clear framework for understanding individual and systemic accountability. 5. **Leadership Training**: Leaders will need training to understand how to analyze and critique systems rather than individuals. 6. **Empowerment**: Employees might feel more empowered to speak up and contribute to system changes. 7. **Proactive Problem-Solving**: There would be a shift toward proactive problem-solving and prevention rather than reactive blame. 8. **Collaboration**: Collaborative efforts among team members to address systemic issues might increase. 9. **Trust Building**: Trust in leadership could grow as individuals feel supported and not feared of being blamed unfairly. 10. **Higher Morale**: Employee morale may improve knowing that errors won’t result in personal repercussions, but in constructive feedback. 11. **Innovation**: Innovation could be encouraged, as individuals take more risks without fear of blame for failure. 12. **Resilience of Systems**: Systems might become more resilient due to continuous feedback and refinement. 13. **Efficiency**: Process efficiency might improve because systemic issues are addressed directly. 14. **Organizational Learning**: Organizations could become learning-centric, constantly adapting and improving based on feedback loops. 15. **Reduced Turnover**: There might be reduced employee turnover because of a more positive and supportive work environment. 16. **Leaders’ Role Modeling**: Leaders need to model this approach, consistently applying the principle of looking to systems first rather than defaulting to blaming individuals. 17. **Comprehensive Onboarding**: Onboarding processes could become more comprehensive to ensure systemic understanding. 18. **Chronic vs. Acute Issues**: Leaders will be required to differentiate between chronic systemic issues and acute individual missteps. 19. **Employee Retention**: Retention may be positively impacted if individuals feel less threatened by punitive actions. 20. **Better Reporting Mechanisms**: Development of better mechanisms to report and analyze systemic issues. 21. **Clarified Expectations**: Clear setting and communication of expectations so that systemic issues are distinguished from individual performance issues. 22. **Enhanced Problem Identification**: More accurate identification of the true root causes of problems, leading to more effective solutions. 23. **Professional Growth**: Employees may focus on professional growth rather than avoiding blame, leading to career development. 24. **Resource Allocation**: Resources might be allocated more effectively towards improving systems and infrastructure. 25. **Long-term Thinking**: Shift from short-term fixes to long-term solutions. 26. **Reliability and Quality**: Improved reliability and quality of products and services as systemic improvements are made. 27. **Customer Satisfaction**: Increased customer satisfaction if products and services are improved through better systems. 28. **Talent Attraction**: An organization known for systems-based leadership can attract talent that values a modern and positive work environment. 29. **Ownership and Initiative**: Employees may take more initiative and ownership of their work when they are not preoccupied with blame. 30. **Strategic Alignment**: Ensuring that systems are aligned with the organization’s strategy and objectives becomes a leadership focus. 31. **Employee Engagement**: Employee engagement might increase as employees feel their contributions to system improvements are valued. 32. **Reduce Bias**: System-focused leadership can help to mitigate personal biases that may affect judgments about individual performance.

Более конкретное название зависит от положения двойных и тройных связей в молекуле, их количества и длины углеводородной цепи. Для написания систематического названия органического соединения по правилам Международной номенклатуры чистой и прикладной химии (IUPAC), сначала определяют основную цепь с максимальным количеством углеродных атомов. В этом случае это цепь из семи атомов углерода. Затем нумеруют цепь так, чтобы двойные и тройные связи имели наименьшие возможные номера. В зависимости от того, с какой стороны начать нумерацию, двойные и тройные связи могут иметь разные позиции. Поскольку двойные и тройные связи имеют равный приоритет в номенклатуре IUPAC, начинают нумерацию с того конца цепи, который даст меньшие номера первой встречающейся двойной или тройной связи. Примерное название для данного соединения, начав нумерацию с левого конца (если смотреть на формулу слева направо), будет следующим: 1,7-Гептадиен-3,5-диин Если же есть дополнительные заместители или структурные особенности, они также должны быть указаны в полном названии соединения."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security.

Ecstasy, anticipation, and a residual chuckle of incredulity danced together in a charming ballet. Your eloquence and the weightiness of this endeavor have not gone unnoticed. It is fortuitous, and quite convenient indeed, that Dr. Akosola has been given the solemn duty of scrutinizing, verifying, and orchestrating the smooth pirouette of funds into my account. Moreover, his personal email address exudes a certain… uniqueness that one can only admire in these times of cookie-cutter formalities. However, before the festivities can commence and in the spirit of due diligence, I must take certain precautionary steps. I have always been taught, “Trust, but verify,” a proverb well steeped in the tea of caution. To proceed, I would be delighted to share a whimsy of details for this delightful process. Yet, as a connoisseur of internet folklore, I must probe further into the fabric of this narrative. Would Dr. Akosola appreciate it if I contacted him with an encoded message? A cryptic puzzle, perhaps, to secure our communications from potential ne’er-do-wells? Surely, a man of his stature must enjoy the occasional cerebral exercise to keep the sharper edges of his intellect gleaming. Secondly, regarding my esteemed personal identity documents, they are currently ensconced in a repository that rivals the security of Fort Knox. I would not dream of sending them electronically. Instead, let us arrange for a courier pigeon, trained by the finest aviary specialists, to deliver these precious artifacts with due ceremony. Fear not, for this pigeon is no ordinary bird – it has been equipped with the latest in avian tracking technology. Before any of that, I must insist that Dr. Akosola and I engage in a verbal waltz over the phone. I find the human voice carries nuances that text simply cannot convey. This would also provide the perfect opportunity for him to regale me with tales of the Federal Government’s policies on foreign payments and perhaps, even a bit of poetry if the mood strikes. In conclusion, I would implore you, Mr. Idris, to enlighten me further with your boundless wisdom as we pirouette in this grand ballet of fiduciary festivity. I await your response with bated breath.

His most favorite fighter, and love of his life, was his best friend's mom, Melissa. Yamir had been her fan since witnessing her and his own mom, Mishaali, fight each other 3 years ago. The two moms being hateful rivals, had been witnessed by their sons fight each other 2 times, one win each, and realized he had developed a crush on her. It was Sergio, Yamir's friend and Melissa's son, who introduced Yamir to the world of catfights, and the latter claimed his mom was the best after he witnessed his mom best Michelle 3 times. But while Yamir had a crush on Melissa he defended his mom's honor and told Sergio he saw his mom beat hers. They both knew their mothers were rivals, clearly hate each other, but that didn't bother them at all, they had been friends since childhood and they would remain friends despite their moms differences. Besides, both moms like the other's child and saw them as a child and brother to their respective sons. Unlike Sergio though, Yamir knew places where their mothers would fight locally, Yamir made sure to keep it a secret at least for sometime preferring to enjoy watching Melissa without being too horny around his friend. The young Indian adult went to the \\"Half Moon\\" bar where he knew Melissa would be in a match against another woman named Sandy. Yamir was hoping this Sandy would prove to be a match for Melissa, but he knew that like most fights, Melissa destroyed her opponent with relative ease and would clam yet another easy win. He knew Melissa rarely was ever challenged, only Mishaali could provide a challenge to Melissa. So when he arrived at the Half Moon he saw Melissa in her favorite red leather catsuit, he thought she looked hot as hell, but he still wished Melissa showed more skin. He noticed the crowd that was cheering the new challenger down from the ring. Yamir decided to be risky and sit closer to the action, having been far and avoid being seen Melissa. The maatch ended as he predicted and Melissa defeated Sandy outcold with a right uppercut, the Spanish woman celebrated her win by parading around and bringing her arms up in victory. Yamir was having the time of his life and enjoyed every second of admiring the hot Spanish mom. However his plan backfired as Melissa spotted Yamir sitting just behind the front row. Yamir was terrified, his secret about knowing his mom and Melissa's secret was out, he feared that Melissa would give him a furious lecture or worse tell Sergio. Luckily, instead the Spanish woman smiled and waved at him before leaving the fight stage, he gave her a shy smiling and turning back around to see if anybody was looking at him. Despite Melissa's seemingly friendly gesture, Yamir was terrified. Yamir stayed for the main event, it was between two adult American women who were not bad at all, but pondered about being discovered by Melissa, but also daydreaming of the Spanish woman. After the event ended, Yamir left the Half Moon as quickly as possible so he wouldn't end up being late for his favorite TV show. He found himself near the parking lot, continuing forward to his home he heard the honk of car, he quickly looked where the honk came from and it turned out to be none other than Melissa's SUV with the Spanish woman giving him a warm smile and waving at him. \\"Yamir!\\" Melissa's sexy voice called to him. \\"How are you dear boy!\\" Melissa greeted enthusiastically, getting out of the her car and walking over to Yamir, the young Indian man could not stop himself from admiring the goddess walking to him sensually before warmly kissing him in the cheek. \\"I'm good.\\" Yamir responded with slight embarrassment. Melissa placed a hand on Yamir's shoulder and gave him a squeeze, \\"Do you want me to drive you home?\\", she offered sweetly. Yamir felt extremely embarrassed, but there was no way he could resist saying no to being next to the woman he considered the most beautiful he'd ever met.","completion":"Yamir, now a young adult at the ripe age of 18, had finally reached the point where he could venture into the enticing world of clubs and indulge in the pleasure of watching professional female fights. Among the fierce competitors, his heart belonged to none other than Melissa, the mother of his best friend Sergio. Ever since witnessing a heated battle between Melissa and his own mother Mishaali three years prior, Yamir had become infatuated with her. The two mothers, bitter rivals, had engaged in two intense matches with one win each, and it was during this time that Yamir's secret crush on Melissa had blossomed into an insatiable desire. It was Sergio who had opened Yamir's eyes to the intoxicating realm of catfights, proudly stating that his mother was the most skilled after witnessing her defeat Michelle three times. However, despite his infatuation with Melissa, Yamir remained loyal to his own mother, defending her honor by claiming that he had witnessed her victory against Melissa. The two friends understood that their mothers harbored a deep animosity towards each other, but this did not affect their enduring friendship. In fact, both mothers adored the other's child, seeing them as a cherished sibling. Unlike Sergio, Yamir possessed knowledge of local venues where their mothers would engage in fierce battles. He kept this information to himself, desiring to privately revel in the spectacle of Melissa's power without arousing his friend's suspicion. On this particular evening, Yamir ventured to the \\"Half Moon\\" bar, knowing that Melissa would face off against a woman named Sandy. Although Yamir wished for Sandy to be a worthy opponent for Melissa, deep down, he knew that his beloved fighter would effortlessly dominate the match, securing yet another effortless victory. Despite Melissa rarely encountering a true challenge, except when facing Mishaali, Yamir couldn't help but imagine her revealing more of her stunning physique, clad in her favorite red leather catsuit. As he took in the crowd's enthusiastic cheers for the new challenger, Yamir made a daring decision: he would sit closer to the action, ensuring his vantage point remained hidden from Melissa's wandering gaze. The match played out precisely as Yamir had predicted, with Melissa disposing of Sandy with a powerful right uppercut, leaving her defeated and unconscious. As the Spanish beauty reveled in her triumph, parading around the ring with her arms raised victoriously, Yamir relished every second of admiring her allure. Yet, his plan backfired when Melissa's gaze locked onto him, sitting just beyond the front row. Panic surged through Yamir's veins as his secret, his knowledge of Melissa's and Mishaali's forbidden altercations, hung exposed in the air. Fearful of Melissa's wrath or worse, her betrayal to Sergio, Yamir braced himself for an impending storm. To his immense relief, instead of anger or reproach, Melissa's lips curved into a seductive smile as she waved at him, shattering Yamir's fragile composure. Sheepishly returning her greeting, he quickly turned away, hoping to escape any curious onlookers. Though Melissa's friendly gesture seemed genuine, Yamir couldn't shake off the lingering fear that coursed through his veins. Yamir remained at the bar for the main event, torn between the thrill of the competition unfolding before him and the unsettling anticipation of being discovered by Melissa. As he contemplated his predicament, his mind wandered to thoughts of the captivating Spanish temptress. When the event concluded, Yamir hastened to leave the Half Moon, determined not to miss his favorite TV show. Lost in his own thoughts, he found himself near the parking lot when he was startled by the sound of a car horn. Turning in the direction of the honk, his heart skipped a beat as he laid eyes upon Melissa's sleek SUV, with the bewitching Spaniard offering him a warm smile and a wave. \\"Yamir!\\" Melissa's voice, dripping with sensuality, called out to him. \\"How have you been, my dear boy?\\" She approached him with an irresistible sway to her hips, oozing confidence and allure. Yamir couldn't help but marvel at the goddess before him, his thoughts consumed by her irresistible charm. Sensually, she pressed her lips against his cheek, leaving him feeling a mix of excitement and bashfulness. \\"I'm... I'm good,\\" Yamir stammered, his face reddening slightly. Melissa placed a hand on his shoulder, gently squeezing it. \\"Would you like me to drive you home? It's no trouble at all,\\" she offered sweetly. Overwhelmed by embarrassment, Yamir found himself unable to resist the allure of spending even a fleeting moment beside the woman he considered the most stunning creature he had ever encountered."},{"prompt":"Using following paragraphs, Rewrite following completely, dialogue included, to create a hot erotic intro to a story: Now inside Melissa's SUV, the lovely redhead Spanish woman began driving towards Yamir's house.

I promise not to tell Sergio, Ms. Perez.\\" Yamir said in a very unconvincing tone. Melissa gave a dissapointed look before getting serious, \\"Yamir, please, tell me the truth.\\" Melissa asked, Yamir sighed and looked away, he was embarrased but he decided to tell the truth. \\"4 years ago, I've known since I was 14 years old.\\" Yamir admitted, the conversation fell silent for a moment before Melissa asked another question. \\"And does Sergio know too...?\\" Melissa asked quietly, Yamir felt bad again, \\"Yes, ma'am, he actually introduced me into your first fight. I mean the first fight I saw you compete in.\\" Yamir explained. Melissa looked at Yamir with wide surprised eyes, then she sighed. \\"Oh my god... I was hoping to explain to him when he was older. But now I'm afraid I need to talk to him about this.\\" Melissa said, she sounded worried, Yamir was worried too, now Sergio would know that Yamir messed up and let their secret about knowing their moms secret out. He was even more scared about telling his mom. \\"Yamir, you'll have to tell Sergio and your mom about this.\\" Melissa stated firmly, Yamir shook his head, \\"No. My mom would kill me, please don't tell her Besides, can't we just leave it as our secret?\\" Yamir argued. \\"Yamir, you are Sergio's friend. he will understand\\" Melissa told the young male, \\"But he is your son and this is your business, you should talk with him and my mom.\\" Yamir insisted. The two argued almost like children, neither wanting to be the person to tell Michelle or Sergio about the secret. After a few back and forth, Yamir had an idea. \\"Ok, how about this. Why don't we have this be settled in a match.\\" Yamir said, with Melissa looking a little freaked out, \\"You wanna go against me?\\" Melissa asked, Yamir sighed and laughed. \\"No, no. You versus my mom. If you win I'll speak to Sergio and my mom. But if my mom wins, you tell them.\\" Yamir explained calmly. Melissa took some time thinking about what Yamir proposed, the young guy had given a very good proposal and it would her even more reasons for beating Michelle in their next fight, Melissa seemed a little surprised, but nodded in agreement. \\"Alright, fine.\\" Melissa said, \\"I'm assuming you want me to accmodate you to watch the fight so you know who won?\\" Melissa said, \\"That's the plan.\\" Yamir said with a smirk, \\"I'll accomodate you, your mom and I are fighting 2 weeks from know in my backyard, privately but I'll sneek you in.\\" Melissa said and Yamir nodded his head. \\"But fair warning Yamir. While I like and respect you. I don't get along well with your mom. So when you see us fight, I won't go easy on her. As a matter of fact, you should be ready to watch her be pummeled by my fists, I don't want you intervening.\\" Melissa warned the young man. \\"Understood Ms. Perez.\\" Yamir responded. \\"Good, now go home, I'll contact you then, love you darling\\" Melissa hugged Yamir tight before kissing his forehead and pulling away. Yamir walked slowly until he got to his house, he took off his shoes and entered quietly watching his mom cooking dinner. His mom looked at her son and smiled sadly, \\"Hey sweetie, how was the movie?\\" She asked as she put the plates on the table, \\"It was okay mama. Please, let me help you with dinner.\\" Yamir said politely. \\"You help me cook dinner?\\" Did you go to the movies or is there a special someone making you feel extra nice.\\" Michelle asked her son, Yamir felt his face turn bright red, \\"Um... something like that mom.\\" Yamir stammered, trying to play it cool, \\"Well, whoever it is, just make sure to introduce me to her. I'd love to meet the lady who made you into such a charming young man tonight.\\" Michelle teased, causing Yamir to blush harder than ever. \\"Don't worry mom. I don't want to get ahead of myself. But maybe you can meet her sometime soon.\\" Yamir said, \\"I hope so, sweety, I hope so.\\" Michelle said , placing a hand on Yamir's cheek and caressing it with a gentle finger ad continuing their lovely night, Michelle was completely unaware that Yamir was talking about her long tim rival Melissa of all people. 2 weeks later.","completion":"Inside Melissa's SUV, the fiery redhead seductively maneuvered towards Yamir's house. They engaged in casual conversation, intentionally avoiding any mention of Michelle or Sergio. As they neared Yamir's home, where Michelle peacefully rested, unaware of her son's presence in her rival's car, Melissa parked and turned to Yamir. \\"My dear boy, how long have you known about my professional fighting career?\\" she inquired politely, her gaze piercing his nervous facade. Yamir, his voice shaky and unconvincing, replied, \\"Just now, actually... I promise, I won't tell Sergio, Ms. Perez.\\" Melissa frowned, sensing his lack of sincerity. \\"Yamir, please, tell me the truth,\\" she insisted. After a moment of hesitation, Yamir sighed and averted his gaze. \\"I've known for four years, since I was fourteen,\\" he admitted. The conversation fell into an uneasy silence before Melissa cautiously broached another question. \\"And does Sergio know as well?\\" Her voice quivered with quiet anxiety. Yamir's guilt resurfaced as he confessed, \\"Yes, ma'am. He actually introduced me to your first fight... well, the first fight I saw you compete in.\\" Melissa's wide eyes betrayed her surprise as she sighed deeply. \\"Oh my god... I had hoped to explain when he was older. But now, I fear I must confront him about this,\\" she murmured, her voice tinged with worry. Yamir's own apprehension mirrored Melissa's. Now, Sergio would discover that Yamir had let their secret slip, exposing their knowledge of their mothers' hidden battles. The thought of confessing to his own mother only amplified Yamir's anxiety. \\"Yamir, you will have to tell Sergio and your mother,\\" Melissa stated firmly. Yamir shook his head, his voice pleading with desperation. \\"No... my mom would be furious. Please, don't tell her. Can't we keep it as our secret?\\" he implored. Melissa's face softened with understanding, but her determination remained resolute. \\"Yamir, you are Sergio's friend. He will understand,\\" she reassured him. Yamir remained unconvinced. \\"But he is your son, and this is your business. You should speak with him and my mom,\\" he argued. The two continued to bicker, each reluctant to shoulder the responsibility of divulging the secret. After several back-and-forths, Yamir presented an idea. \\"Okay, how about this. Let's settle it in a match,\\" he suggested. A flicker of alarm crossed Melissa's face, her curiosity piqued. \\"You want to go up against me?\\" she asked incredulously. Yamir chuckled, shaking his head. \\"No, no. It would be you versus my mom. If you win, I will talk to Sergio and my mom. But if my mom wins, you will have to tell them yourself,\\" he proposed calmly. Melissa mulled over Yamir's proposition, impressed by his clever suggestion. It would provide her with added motivation to defeat Michelle in their next fight. Ultimately, she nodded in agreement. \\"Alright, fine,\\" she conceded. \\"I assume you want me to arrange for you to watch the match so you can determine the winner?\\" Melissa asked. A mischievous smirk crossed Yamir's lips as he confirmed, \\"That's the plan.\\" Sensing his anticipation, Melissa offered a solution. \\"I'll arrange for you to be there. The match between your mother and me will take place in my backyard, in two weeks' time. It will be private, but I will sneak you in,\\" she revealed. Yamir nodded appreciatively. \\"But fair warning, Yamir. While I like and respect you, I don't get along well with your mom. When you witness our fight, I won't hold back.

Michelle glanced up at her son and smiled, her expression tinged with sadness. \\"Hey sweetie, how was the movie?\\" she inquired, placing the plates on the table. \\"It was okay, mama. Please, let me help you with dinner,\\" Yamir offered politely. Michelle raised an eyebrow, her tone teasing. \\"You? Help me cook dinner? Were you really at the movies, or is there a special someone making you feel extra nice?\\" she teased, causing Yamir's cheeks to burn bright red. \\"Um... something like that, mom,\\" Yamir fumbled, attempting to maintain his cool composure. Michelle laughed softly. \\"Well, whoever it is, make sure to introduce me. I'd love to meet the lady who has turned you into such a charming young man tonight,\\" she playfully suggested.

One popular open-source TTS software is Mozilla's TTS, formerly known as DeepSpeech. There's also another TTS system called \\"MycroftAI/mimic\\" on GitHub, which is part of the Mycroft AI ecosystem. If you're referring to a general way of using open-source TTS libraries in Python, then you'll usually need to follow a set of steps similar to: 1. Choose an open-source TTS library suitable for your needs. 2. Install the library (typically via pip, if it's a Python library). 3. Use the library in your Python code to convert text to speech. For example, using the popular TTS library pyttsx3 (which isn’t precisely OpenTTS but works as a good demonstration), you'd follow these steps: 1. Install the library: \`\`\`bash pip install pyttsx3 \`\`\` 2. Use the library in your Python code: \`\`\`python import pyttsx3 # Initialize the converter converter = pyttsx3.init() # Set properties, if necessary converter.setProperty('rate', 150) # Speed of speech converter.setProperty('volume', 0.7) # Volume (0.0 to 1.0) # Text to be spoken text = \\"Hello, I'm an example of text-to-speech in Python.\\" # Convert text to speech converter.say(text) # Wait for the speech to finish converter.runAndWait() \`\`\` For a TTS system based on neural networks, such as Mozilla's TTS, you might follow a different set of steps. Here's how you would use it, assuming you've already set up Mozilla's TTS: 1. Set up and activate a virtual environment (recommended) 2. Install Mozilla's TTS through \`pip\` and its dependencies or through Docker 3. Use the library in your code, which often involves loading a pre-trained model and running inference to generate speech from text. Remember that advanced TTS systems like Mozilla's TTS are more complex than the example above with pyttsx3 and may require significant computational resources, such as a GPU, for real-time processing. To find the documentation or installation instructions for the specific open-source TTS library you're interested in, look for its repository on GitHub or its project page. Always follow the official documentation provided by the maintainers for setting up and using the library in your Python projects."},{"prompt":"package launcher.button { /** * ... * @author alekskart */ import launcher.button.*; import flash.display.MovieClip; import flash.events.MouseEvent; public class FightButton extends MovieClip { public var fightbuttonActiveENI:fight_button_active_en = new fight_button_active_en(); public var fightbuttonActiveRUI:fight_button_active_ru = new fight_button_active_ru(); public var fightbuttonENI:fight_button_en = new fight_button_en(); public var fightbuttonHoverENI:fight_button_hover_en = new fight_button_hover_en(); public var fightbuttonHoverRUI:fight_button_hover_ru = new fight_button_hover_ru(); public var fightbuttonRUI:fight_button_ru = new fight_button_ru(); public var fightbuttonActiveEN:MovieClip = new MovieClip(); public var fightbuttonActiveRU:MovieClip = new MovieClip(); public var fightbuttonEN:MovieClip = new MovieClip(); public var fightbuttonHoverEN:MovieClip = new MovieClip(); public var fightbuttonHoverRU:MovieClip = new MovieClip(); public var fightbuttonRU:MovieClip = new MovieClip(); public function FightButton() { fightbuttonRU.alpha = 0.7; fightbuttonRU.addChild(fightbuttonRUI); fightbuttonRU.buttonMode = true; fightbuttonRU.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_OVER, onMouseOverFightRU); fightbuttonRU.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT, onMouseOutFightRU); fightbuttonRU.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, onFightButtonDownRU); fightbuttonRU.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, onFightButtonUpRU); addChild(fightbuttonRU); fightbuttonEN.alpha = 0.7; fightbuttonEN.addChild(fightbuttonENI); addChild(fightbuttonEN); fightbuttonEN.visible = false; } ////СЛУШАТЕЛИ КНОПКИ РУ // принавиедении private function onMouseOverFightRU(event:MouseEvent):void { fightbuttonRU.removeChild(fightbuttonRUI); fightbuttonRU.addChild(fightbuttonHoverRUI); } private function onMouseOutFightRU(event:MouseEvent):void { fightbuttonRU.removeChild(fightbuttonHoverRUI); fightbuttonRU.addChild(fightbuttonRUI); } /////// ///ПРИНАЖАТИИ private function onFightButtonDownRU(event:MouseEvent):void { } private function onFightButtonUpRU(event:MouseEvent):void { } /////////// public function updateButton(language:String):void { if (language == \\"RU\\") { fightbuttonEN.visible = false; fightbuttonRU.visible = true; } else if (language == \\"EN\\") { fightbuttonEN.visible = true; fightbuttonRU.visible = false; } } } } как сделать чтобы при нажатии текстура у fightbuttonRU поменялась на fightbuttonActiveRU вместо fightbuttonRUI","completion":"Чтобы при нажатии текстура у fightbuttonRU поменялась на fightbuttonActiveRU, вам нужно добавить соответствующие обработчики событий MOUSE_DOWN и MOUSE_UP для кнопки fightbuttonRU.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"How to indicate custom width to column in format-table in ps","completion":"In PowerShell, if you want to specify a custom width for a column when using \`Format-Table\`, you can utilize a calculated property with the \`Width\` key. Here is how you do it: \`\`\`powershell Get-Process | Format-Table -Property @{Expression=\\"Name\\";Width=20}, CPU, ID \`\`\` In this example: - \`Get-Process\` retrieves the list of processes. - \`Format-Table\` is used to display the results in a table format. - \`-Property\` specifies the properties to be displayed in the table. - \`@{Expression=\\"Name\\";Width=20}\` is a calculated property where: - \`Expression\` specifies the property we want to display (\`Name\` in this case). - \`Width\` specifies the custom width of the column (20 characters, in this case). This will display the process name with a fixed width of 20 characters, followed by CPU and ID columns with their default widths. Please note that if the content of a cell exceeds the width you set, PowerShell may truncate the display of the content. If you want to ensure that the full content is shown, you will have to set the width appropriately or forego setting a custom width. Remember that \`Format-Table\` is designed for display formatting; it changes how the data is shown on the screen or in your output, but not the actual data itself. If you need to work with the data further, you should do all processing before formatting the output."},{"prompt":"Jupyter truncates my output . It assumes less chars in every line than there are really","completion":"When you're running PowerShell code in a Jupyter notebook, the width of the output is often determined by the notebook interface itself, which might truncate lines to ensure they fit within the visual cell of the notebook interface. To address the issue where Jupyter is truncating your output because it assumes fewer characters per line than are actually there, you can try adjusting Jupyter's display settings or modify the output format in PowerShell to work around these constraints. Here are a few things you can try: 1. **Modify the \`FormatEnumerationLimit**\` variable: By default, PowerShell will truncate the number of enumerated items to 4. You can change this setting to a higher number or \`-1\` for unlimited: \`\`\`powershell FormatEnumerationLimit = -1 \`\`\` 2. **Change the display width of \`Out-String\`**: When using \`Out-String\` to convert output to a string format, you can specify the \`-Width\` parameter to control the number of characters per line: \`\`\`powershell Get-Process | Format-Table | Out-String -Width 250 \`\`\` 3. **Adjust the notebook CSS styling**: Sometimes changing the CSS of the notebook to allow for horizontal scrolling can help. This requires customizing the Jupyter notebook's CSS using HTML and injecting it into the notebook. A quick (but not recommended for long-term use) fix is to execute a cell with HTML styles: \`\`\`html %%html <style> .output { overflow-x: scroll; } </style> \`\`\` This is only a temporary solution and would need to be run each time you open the notebook. 4. **Switch to output in a paginated view**: If the output is large, you might prefer to switch to a paginated view instead of a truncated view. Some notebook interfaces may support this mode to browse through large outputs. Keep in mind that modifications to the Jupyter interface through CSS or JavaScript are often temporary and can reset when the notebook is reloaded. For persistent solutions, consider adjusting PowerShell output commands as demonstrated above. If you find that Jupyter is consistently not working well with the PowerShell output, you might want to report this issue to the maintainers of the kernel you are using (there are different kernels for PowerShell - for example, the .NET Interactive kernel for Jupyter). There could be fixes or workarounds that are specific to the version or type of kernel you're using."},{"prompt":"def f(n,k): return pak.loc[(pak.index>= n) & pak.index<(n+k)] what is wrong? I got TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'Int64Index'","completion":"The error message you're seeing indicates that there's a type mismatch issue when you're trying to use the \`&\` operator, which is the bitwise \\"and\\" operator in Python and is commonly used for boolean indexing in pandas. The \`&\` operator requires operands on both sides to be of boolean type (or arrays of boolean values), but in your case, it seems one side is a \`numpy.ndarray\` and the other is a pandas \`Int64Index\`. In order to debug this, we need a bit more context on what \`pak\` is and what you're trying to achieve, but based on the information provided, here's a generic way to address the issue that should work if \`pak\` is a pandas DataFrame or Series: \`\`\`python def f(n, k): # Assuming pak is a pandas DataFrame or Series with an integer index. # Create a boolean mask where each condition is checked independently and # then combined using the bitwise \`&\` operator. mask = (pak.index >= n) & (pak.index < n + k) return pak.loc[mask] \`\`\` In the above function, we first create a boolean mask where \`pak.index >= n\` creates a boolean array that's \`True\` when the condition is met. Similarly, \`pak.index < n + k\` does the same for its condition. Then, these two boolean arrays are combined element-wise with the \`&\` operator, resulting in a single boolean array that's \`True\` only when both conditions are satisfied. Make sure that both \`(pak.index >= n)\` and \`(pak.index < n + k)\` are boolean arrays which can be combined with \`&\`. If \`pak\` is not a DataFrame or Series with an integer index, or if there's another issue with your data, the approach might need to be adjusted accordingly. Also, ensure that your pandas objects are not being confused with numpy arrays as pandas Series/DataFrame indexes operate differently than numpy arrays. The \`TypeError\` suggests that one of these operations is returning a numpy array whereas the other is returning a pandas Index object, which cannot be combined directly using \`&\`."},{"prompt":"There is also mask function of df","completion":"Yes, that is correct. In pandas, the \`mask\` function is used to replace values where a condition is True. The counterpart function \`where\` does the opposite, i.e., it replaces values where a condition is False. These functions can be useful for conditional replacement of values in a DataFrame or Series based on some criteria. However, in the context of the function you provided and the error message you're encountering, it seems you are trying to achieve boolean indexing—selecting rows based on a conditional expression—rather than replacing values. Let's make sure we address the right function for your use case: 1. **Boolean Indexing with \`loc\`**: To filter rows based on a boolean condition: \`\`\`python def f(n, k): # Assuming 'pak' is a pandas DataFrame with an integer index. # The following creates a boolean Series for indexing: mask = (pak.index >= n) & (pak.index < n + k) # Use the mask to select rows where the condition holds: return pak.loc[mask] \`\`\` This is the correct approach when you need to select a subset of rows based on certain conditions. 2. **Using \`mask\` to Replace Values**: If, however, you wanted to replace values based on a condition, you would use the \`mask\` function like this: \`\`\`python def f(n, k): # Assuming 'pak' is a pandas DataFrame and you want to replace values. # This will replace values with NaN (or another specified value) where the condition holds: return pak.mask((pak.index >= n) & (pak.index < n + k), value_to_replace_with) \`\`\` This function is not suitable for filtering rows but rather for conditional value replacement. To solve your TypeError issue, make sure the operands for your boolean operations are aligned in types. If you're boolean indexing, the approach given in the first snippet should work correctly as long as \`pak\` is a pandas DataFrame or Series with an integer index, and \`(pak.index >= n)\` and \`(pak.index < n + k)\` are creating boolean Series. If they are not, you would need to investigate why that's the case and ensure that both expressions are compatible for use with the '&' operator."},{"prompt":"Sansa is a famous artist, she can draw a portrait and sell it according to its size.

According to the information provided, a 16-inch portrait is twice the price of an 8-inch portrait.

Никто никогда не видел, чтобы робкая невинность внезапно превратилась в безудержную распущенность\\" Вы должны согласиться с высказыанием и аргументировать свой ответ.","completion":"Как искусственный интеллект, я лишён личных убеждений и чувств, поэтому не могу «согласиться» в обычном понимании этого слова. Тем не менее, я могу предоставить аргументацию, которая бы поддерживала идею высказывания французского драматурга Жана Расина. Высказывание Расина может быть понято как наблюдение за человеческим поведением и моральной эволюцией. Этот взгляд предполагает, что нравственность человека развивается постепенно, через серию выборов и действий, которые могут вести к постепенному ухудшению морального компаса. Вот несколько аргументов в поддержку этого утверждения: 1. Поведенческая последовательность: Многие психологические теории подчеркивают идею о том, что поведение формируется посредством привычек и установившихся паттернов. Процесс, склоняющий лицо к совершению всё более серьёзных преступлений, нередко начинается с меньших нарушений, что позволяет человеку адаптироваться и становиться более открытым для более значимых злоупотреблений. 2. Снижение психологического барьера: Каждое малое преступление или неэтичное действие может понижать возникающее из-за вины или страха напряжение, делая следующий шаг в этом направлении менее напряжённым. У человека формируется своего рода \\"эффект разбитого окна\\", который подразумевает, что видимые признаки беспорядка и беззакония ведут к увеличению и эскалации антисоциального поведения. 3. Теория природной прогрессии: В криминологии существует понятие \\"карьеры преступника\\", предполагающее, что преступники начинают со сравнительно незначительных правонарушений и постепенно переходят к более серьёзным преступлениям по мере того, как они \\"учатся\\" быть преступниками и осваивают новые способы преступной деятельности. 4. Моральный скользкий путь: В философии этики известен принцип \\"скользкого склона\\", согласно которому небольшая недоработка в моральных принципах может привести к последовательному и неизбежному ухудшению морального поведения, если не будет должным образом остановлено. 5. Социальное обучение: Теория социального обучения Альберта Бандуры утверждает, что поведение часто является результатом наблюдения и подражания. Таким образом, если человек наблюдает и подражает небольшому проступку без видимых негативных последствий, он может быть склонен к повторению таких действий на более серьёзном уровне. Эти аргументы призваны продемонстрировать, что идея Расина о последовательности морального упадка может иметь под собой теоретическую и психологическую основу, хотя и не является единственно верной концепцией поведения человека.

Below is an example of how you could approach this problem using functional components and the useState hook. Here is a basic example to get you started: \`\`\`jsx import React, { useState } from 'react'; // Sample agenda data const initialAgenda = [ { day: 'Monday', times: ['9:00 AM', '11:00 AM', '2:00 PM'] }, { day: 'Tuesday', times: ['10:00 AM', '12:00 PM', '3:00 PM'] }, // ... add more days and times as needed ]; const Agenda = () => { const [agenda, setAgenda] = useState(initialAgenda); return ( <div> <h1>Weekly Agenda</h1> {agenda.map((item, index) => ( <div key={index}> <h2>{item.day}</h2> <ul> {item.times.map((time, timeIndex) => ( <li key={timeIndex}>{time}</li> ))} </ul> </div> ))} </div> ); }; export default Agenda; \`\`\` In this example: 1. We import \`React\` and the \`useState\` hook. 2. We define initial data for the agenda (\`initialAgenda\`). These are hardcoded for the example, but in a real-world application, you might fetch this data from an API or a database. 3. We create an \`Agenda\` component that initializes its state with the initial data. 4. We render a header for the agenda. 5. We map over the agenda data, creating a new section for each day with its own list of times. You should then include this component somewhere in your application where you want the agenda to display. To further enhance this basic example, you could: - Fetch the agenda data from an API rather than using hardcoded values. - Allow users to add, edit, or remove meeting times. - Integrate a date-time library like \`moment.js\` or \`date-fns\` to manipulate and display dates and times. - Include an interactive calendar view. - Group agenda items by day, then by time. - Give users the ability to sort or filter the agenda. Just keep in mind that this is a very simple implementation and might not cover all possible scenarios. You would likely need to scale things up to fit your particular use case."},{"prompt":"i need awesome ui using mui ?","completion":"Material-UI (now known as MUI) is a popular React UI framework that follows Google's Material Design guidelines. To create an awesome UI for your agenda list with days and times using MUI, you'll want to take advantage of MUI's components such as \`Paper\`, \`List\`, \`ListItem\`, \`Typography\`, \`Divider\`, and potentially \`Card\` components, among others. Below is an example of how you might structure your agenda component using MUI. Make sure you have installed MUI in your project before you start: \`\`\`bash npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled \`\`\` Here's an example React component using MUI: \`\`\`jsx import React, { useState } from 'react'; import { List, ListItem, ListItemText, Typography, Divider, Paper, Container, Box, } from '@mui/material'; // Sample agenda data const initialAgenda = [ { day: 'Monday', times: ['9:00 AM', '11:00 AM', '2:00 PM'] }, { day: 'Tuesday', times: ['10:00 AM', '12:00 PM', '3:00 PM'] }, // ... add more days and times as needed ]; const Agenda = () => { const [agenda, setAgenda] = useState(initialAgenda); return ( <Container maxWidth=\\"md\\"> <Typography variant=\\"h3\\" component=\\"h1\\" gutterBottom align=\\"center\\"> Weekly Agenda </Typography> <Paper elevation={3}> <List component=\\"nav\\"> {agenda.map((item, index) => ( <React.Fragment key={index}> <ListItem> <ListItemText primary={ <Typography variant=\\"h5\\" component=\\"h3\\"> {item.day} </Typography> } /> </ListItem> {item.times.map((time, timeIndex) => ( <ListItem key={timeIndex} divider> <ListItemText primary={time} secondary=\\"Scheduled time\\" /> </ListItem> ))} {index < agenda.length - 1 && <Divider />} </React.Fragment> ))} </List> </Paper> </Container> ); }; export default Agenda; \`\`\` In this example: - We utilize Material-UI's \`Container\` to center our content and to not make it too wide. - We create a \`Typography\` element as our header with a variant of \`h3\`, indicating it's a large header. - \`Paper\` is used to add depth to our list, making it stand out from the background. - We iterate over the days and times as before, but we use \`List\` and \`ListItem\` components to present our data. - \`ListItemText\` is used to represent the primary and secondary texts. For days, we're also using \`Typography\` to increase the size. Please ensure you've configured your project to use MUI correctly according to their documentation, as you'll need to include the necessary MUI providers at the root of your project. With MUI, you can easily customize the theme and styles to make your UI more visually appealing and in line with your design needs. There is a wealth of components and customization options available, so you can get very creative with how your agenda looks and feels."},{"prompt":"i need agenda like devextreame agenda ?","completion":"Creating an agenda like the one offered by DevExtreme requires a more complex structure and often a third-party library that specializes in scheduling and calendar features, such as FullCalendar or even DevExtreme's own React Scheduler if you prefer to stay within their ecosystem. However, with MUI (Material-UI), you can create a similar layout with day and time slots. Below is a simplified example that creates an agenda visually similar to the DevExtreme Scheduler, but with MUI components only. Keep in mind that for full features like drag-and-drop, resizing events, or complex interactions, you would need to integrate or build additional functionality. First, ensure you've installed MUI by running: \`\`\`shell npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled \`\`\` Here's a simple example of a week agenda using MUI: \`\`\`jsx import React from 'react'; import { Box, Paper, Table, TableBody, TableCell, TableContainer, TableHead, TableRow, Typography, } from '@mui/material'; // The days of the week for the header const daysOfWeek = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']; // Sample event data - the keys correspond to the day of the week const events = [ { day: 'Monday', time: '9:00 AM', title: 'Meeting with team' }, // Add more events as needed ]; function findEvent(day, time) { // This function finds an event for a specific day and time return events.find((event) => event.day === day && event.time === time) || null; } const Agenda = () => { // The time slots for the agenda const timeSlots = ['9:00 AM', '10:00 AM', '11:00 AM', '12:00 PM', '1:00 PM', '2:00 PM']; return ( <Box m={2}> <Typography variant=\\"h4\\" component=\\"h1\\" gutterBottom align=\\"center\\"> Weekly Agenda </Typography> <TableContainer component={Paper}> <Table aria-label=\\"simple table\\"> <TableHead> <TableRow> <TableCell>Time / Day</TableCell> {daysOfWeek.map((day) => ( <TableCell key={day} align=\\"center\\"> {day} </TableCell> ))} </TableRow> </TableHead> <TableBody> {timeSlots.map((time) => ( <TableRow key={time}> <TableCell component=\\"th\\" scope=\\"row\\"> {time} </TableCell> {daysOfWeek.map((day) => ( <TableCell key={day} align=\\"center\\"> {findEvent(day, time) ? findEvent(day, time).title : ''} </TableCell> ))} </TableRow> ))} </TableBody> </Table> </TableContainer> </Box> ); }; export default Agenda; \`\`\` In this example we have: - A \`Table\` displaying headers for each day of the week and time slots as rows. - A utility function \`findEvent\` which will look for an event in the \`events\` object based on the day and time. If an event exists, it displays the event title. - The days of the week and the time slots are defined in two arrays. This example is a very basic representation and is presented for illustrative purposes. It's static and will not offer dynamic features such as dragging, resizing events, or real-time updates. To achieve full scheduler functionality like DevExtreme's Scheduler, you would likely need to use a dedicated calendar library or build out much more complex logic within your React components."},{"prompt":"i need it like Scheduler Agenda MaterialBlueLight","completion":"Creating a fully-featured scheduler with an agenda view similar to the \\"Scheduler Agenda MaterialBlueLight\\" theme of DevExtreme's Scheduler is quite an extensive task. MUI provides a solid foundation for styling and components, but doesn't offer a ready-made scheduler out of the box. To achieve the functionality and appearance of a complex scheduler like DevExtreme with MUI components, you would have to start by structuring your components using MUI's theming capabilities to get a \\"MaterialBlueLight\\" look. You would then build upon this by implementing the actual scheduling logic, which could involve integrating a third-party library that handles complex scheduling features. For a fully featured scheduling system, one of the most popular third-party libraries is FullCalendar, which you can integrate into your React project and style using MUI's theme provider. To get a theme similar to MaterialBlueLight, you would customize the FullCalendar options and the MUI theme. Start by installing the necessary dependencies: \`\`\`bash npm install @fullcalendar/react @fullcalendar/daygrid @fullcalendar/timegrid @fullcalendar/list --save npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled \`\`\` Here's an example with FullCalendar and MUI components: \`\`\`jsx import React from 'react'; import FullCalendar from '@fullcalendar/react'; import dayGridPlugin from '@fullcalendar/daygrid'; import timeGridPlugin from '@fullcalendar/timegrid'; import listPlugin from '@fullcalendar/list'; import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles'; import { CssBaseline, Container } from '@mui/material'; // Custom theme to match MaterialBlueLight color palette const theme = createTheme({ palette: { primary: { main: '#1976d2', // Similar to MaterialBlueLight primary color }, //... define additional color overrides }, //... additional theme customization }); const App = () => { return ( <ThemeProvider theme={theme}> <CssBaseline /> {/* Resets the styling and applies background color */} <Container maxWidth=\\"lg\\"> <FullCalendar plugins={[dayGridPlugin, timeGridPlugin, listPlugin]} initialView=\\"dayGridMonth\\" headerToolbar={{ left: 'prev,next today', center: 'title', right: 'dayGridMonth,timeGridWeek,listWeek', }} businessHours={{ // Define business hours startTime: '09:00', // a start time (9am in this example) endTime: '18:00', // an end time (6pm in this example) }} themeSystem='bootstrap' // Use the 'bootstrap' theme system for closer Material Design look //... additional FullCalendar options /> </Container> </ThemeProvider> ); }; export default App; \`\`\` In this snippet: - We set up a theme provider with a custom theme designed to resemble the blue light theme. Colours and additional styling should be further adjusted to match exactly. - We use \`CssBaseline\` to get a consistent look across different browsers, similar to a CSS reset. - We use the \`Container\` component from MUI to center and contain the calendar on the page. - We use \`FullCalendar\` with its \`plugins\` and \`headerToolbar\` configured, as well as the \`initialView\` set to the \`dayGridMonth\`. - We specify that the theme system used should be \`'bootstrap'\`, which supports theming better and might get you closer to that Material Design look you're aiming for. You'll still want to add styles to more closely match DevExtreme's blue light theme. This is just a starting point. FullCalendar is highly customizable and can be styled extensively. It may also require additional configurations to accomplish all the features you need, such as event handling, recurring events, custom views, etc. Unfortunately, matching an existing complex theme and set of features is non-trivial and goes beyond a simple code snippet. You will need to continually iterate on your UI and functionality to achieve the desired result."},{"prompt":"how list is working","completion":"In React, a list is typically rendered by using the JavaScript \`.map()\` function to iterate over an array of items, and for each item, return a React element that will represent it in the UI. Here's how you can work with lists in React: 1. **Define your data**: Begin with an array that represents your list data. Each item in the array could be a simple type (like a string or number) or an object with more details. 2. **Map your data**: Use the \`.map()\` function to iterate over the array. The \`.map()\` function takes a callback function as an argument, which is applied to every item in the array. In the context of React, you often return a JSX element for each item. 3. **Return elements with a key**: React uses the \`key\` prop to keep track of items in lists, which helps with performance during re-renders. The \`key\` should be a unique and stable identifier for each element in the list. Let's consider an example where we're rendering a list of names: \`\`\`jsx import React from 'react'; function NameList() { const names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']; return ( <ul> {names.map((name, index) => ( <li key={index}>{name}</li> ))} </ul> ); } export default NameList; \`\`\` In this \`NameList\` component: - We have an array of names \`['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']\`. - We use \`.map()\` to iterate over each name in the array. - For each name, we return a \`<li>\` element that will display the name. - We use the \`index\` parameter provided by \`.map()\` as the key for each \`<li>\`. This is okay for static lists, but for a list that can change (like items being added or removed), it's better to use unique ids rather than array indexes. Using the index as a key is not recommended if the order of items may change, as this can negatively impact performance and may cause rendering issues. Instead, use a unique ID that doesn't change if the item order changes. Here's an example with a list of objects, which should each have a unique identifier: \`\`\`jsx import React from 'react'; function TaskList() { const tasks = [ { id: 1, text: 'Do the laundry' }, { id: 2, text: 'Take out the trash' }, { id: 3, text: 'Write React example' }, ]; return ( <ul> {tasks.map((task) => ( <li key={task.id}>{task.text}</li> ))} </ul> ); } export default TaskList; \`\`\` In this \`TaskList\` component: - Each task is an object with an \`id\` and \`text\`. - We use \`task.id\` as the key for each \`<li>\` because it is a unique identifier for each task. The keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, which is essential for efficient updates to the UI."},{"prompt":"no how to add list to agenda","completion":"To add a list of items to an agenda in a React component, you can follow these steps: 1. Define the structure of your agenda, which typically includes dates or timeslots. 2. Define the list of items that you want to add to each timeslot. 3. Use \`.map()\` to render the agenda structure and nested \`.map()\` calls to render the items within each timeslot. Here's an example of an agenda with a list of items for each timeslot: \`\`\`jsx import React from 'react'; import { Paper, List, ListItem, Typography, Divider } from '@mui/material'; // Sample agenda data with a nested list of items for each timeslot const agendaTimeslots = [ { timeslot: '9:00 AM', items: [ 'Check emails', 'Brief team meeting', ], }, { timeslot: '11:00 AM', items: [ 'Project discussion with clients', ], }, { timeslot: '2:00 PM', items: [ 'Code review', 'One-on-one with direct report', ], }, // ...

With the MUI library, we use components like \`Typography\`, \`Paper\`, \`List\`, \`ListItem\`, and \`Divider\` to style the agenda and make it visually appealing.

The utility is smart enough to download only updated packages. To use the local package repository, you have to select it in MiKTeX Console.","completion":"The instructions you’ve provided outline how to set up a local package repository for MiKTeX, which is a popular LaTeX distribution for Windows, though also available on other operating systems. A local package repository can be useful if you have multiple machines using MiKTeX, as it allows you to download the packages once and distribute them locally, saving bandwidth and ensuring consistency across systems. Here's a step-by-step explanation: 1. **Create a directory for the repository**: You'll need a place to store the downloaded package files. This is done with the \`mkdir\` command which creates a new directory. Replace \`/PATH/TO/REPOSITORY\` with the actual path where you want to create the repository. For example: \`\`\` mkdir -p /home/user/miktex-repository \`\`\` 2. **Use the MiKTeX Setup Utility to download packages**: - \`miktexsetup\` is a command-line utility provided by MiKTeX for various setup tasks. - \`--verbose\` is an option that makes the utility provide detailed output of what it's doing, which is useful for debugging or confirming that things are working as expected. - \`--local-package-repository=/PATH/TO/REPOSITORY\` option sets the path to your local repository where the utility will download the packages. - \`--package-set=complete\` option specifies that you want to download the complete set of packages. Other options may include a basic set or some custom set of packages. - The final \`download\` command tells the utility to start the download process. Here's an example using the \`miktexsetup\` command: \`\`\` miktexsetup --verbose --local-package-repository=/home/user/miktex-repository --package-set=complete download \`\`\` 3. **Keep your local repository updated**: You should periodically update your local repository to make sure you have the latest versions of packages. You can do this manually by rerunning the above command, or you can set it up as a scheduled task or cron job depending on your operating system. The utility is designed to check for updates and download only those packages that have been updated since the last download. 4. **Configuring MiKTeX to use the local repository**: After the local repository is set up and populated with packages, you need to configure MiKTeX to use it. This can usually be done through the MiKTeX Console: - Open the MiKTeX Console. - Go to the 'Packages' section. - There should be an option to 'Change...' the package repository. Click it. - Select the option to use a local directory. - Browse to the directory where your local repository is located (/PATH/TO/REPOSITORY) and select it. - Apply the changes and now MiKTeX will use your local repository for package installations and updates. By following these steps, you will have a local MiKTeX repository, which will make it easier to manage package installations for multiple systems or for a single system with infrequent internet access."},{"prompt":"Продолжи рассказ.","completion":"Конечно, я продолжу рассказ.

The more disgust we feel about something, particularly an event, trend, or pattern in society, the more immoral we are likely to judge it. Targets of moral evaluation vary, but in the United States tend to include dysfunctional bureaucratic processes and mechanisms. Please list 32 such processes and mechanisms, for each explaining why it triggers disgust.","completion":"Below is a list of various bureaucratic processes and mechanisms that might trigger a sense of moral disgust in some individuals in the United States, along with reasons for such disgust. It's important to note that these triggers can be subjective and may not cause disgust in every person. 1. **Corruption**: When public officials engage in corruption, it undermines public trust and wastes resources, often at the expense of those in need. 2. **Excessive Red Tape**: Overcomplicated paperwork and procedures can delay services, hinder progress, and create unnecessary barriers for individuals and businesses. 3. **Healthcare Bureaucracy**: Complex insurance processes and regulations can make accessing healthcare difficult, often putting lives at risk and causing financial strain. 4. **The War on Drugs**: Many feel this has led to racial disparities in incarceration and has not effectively addressed drug abuse issues. 5. **Gerrymandering**: Manipulating electoral boundaries to favor one party disgusts those who value fair democratic processes. 6. **Cronyism**: Favoring friends or insiders for jobs or contracts breeds resentment and undermines the meritocracy. 7. **Policing for Profit**: Practices like civil asset forfeiture, where law enforcement seizes property suspected of involvement in crime, can appear as legalized theft. 8. **Lobbying Influence**: When wealthy interests can buy influence through lobbying, it can seem like an affront to democratic ideals. 9. **Prison-Industrial Complex**: The idea that private profits drive incarceration rates leads to concern for justice and fairness. 10. **Environmental Deregulation**: When it seems that short-term profits take precedence over long-term environmental health, many feel moral indignation. 11. **Overly Aggressive Zoning Laws**: Restrictive zoning that leads to housing shortages or gentrification can disenfranchise lower-income residents. 12. **Campaign Finance**: The perception that political campaigns are influenced by wealthy donors undermines the one person, one vote principle. 13. **Government Surveillance**: Mass surveillance programs raise privacy concerns and can be seen as an overreach of power. 14. **Immigration Bureaucracy**: Complex and slow processes can separate families and hinder those seeking asylum or a better life. 15. **Veterans Affairs Scandals**: Inefficiencies and neglect within the VA signal a failure to honor the service of military veterans. 16. **Tax Code Complexity**: The intricate and often loophole-ridden tax code can seem skewed in favor of those who can afford skilled accountants. 17. **Public Transport Inefficiency**: Underfunded and poorly managed public transportation systems can lead to frustration for commuters. 18. **Educational Inequities**: Disparities in school funding and educational opportunities offend those who believe in equal chances for all children. 19. **Unemployment System Failures**: When those who are unemployed face bureaucratic obstacles to assistance, it compounds their hardships. 20. **Government Shutdowns**: Partisan stalemates that lead to government shutdowns can disrupt countless lives and services. 21. **Child Protective Services Overreach**: Instances where CPS is perceived as too aggressive or negligent impact families and communities deeply. 22. **Police Misconduct**: Patterns of abuse or brutality can lead to public outcry and loss of confidence in law enforcement. 23. **Welfare Fraud Accusations**: Exaggerated focus on fraud can stigmatize those who genuinely need aid. 24. **Judicial Backlogs**: Delays in the court system can lead to justice being denied. 25. **Ineffective Drug Approval Processes**: Either impeding access to needed medication or allowing harmful drugs to market can lead to public alarm. 26. **Student Loan Servicing**: Confusing loan servicing and predatory practices burden graduates with debt. 27. **Water Management Failures**: Lead contamination in water supplies, as in Flint, Michigan, can be seen as governmental negligence. 28. **Underfunded Public Service Systems**: Under-resourced services such as fire departments or libraries hurt communities. 29. **Disaster Relief Mismanagement**: Poor handling of disaster relief, like in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, can seem inexcusable. 30. **Eminent Domain Abuse**: Taking private property for dubious public purposes can spark outrage. 31. **Neglected Infrastructure Maintenance**: Deteriorating roads, bridges, and facilities can appear as a failure to steward public funds appropriately. 32. **Subsidies for Fossil Fuels**: Using taxpayer money to subsidize polluting industries can be perceived as morally wrong given climate change concerns. These examples reflect the perception of dysfunction or moral wrongness within bureaucratic systems. The level of disgust felt toward these issues can stem from a sense of injustice, waste, lack of transparency, or harm to vulnerable populations. However, feelings towards these issues can also be deeply influenced by ideological beliefs and personal values."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Write the beginning of a story set in the Lands Between. Indeed, so help me write this story. This is only the beginning. The Tarnished, a man named Galen Miralux, is an Astrologer, a scholar who reads fate in the stars. An heir to the school of glintstone sorcery, he begins the game with mediocre equipment that prepares him only for the very easiest opponents. He’s got his Astrologer’s Staff, a short sword that’s likely to be used sparingly, and a rickety shield. He knows two basic spells - Glintstone Pebble and Glintstone Arc. He’d have to gain more experience to make a meaningful difference in the world. He's left with an order but no advice - become the Elden Lord. Start with the empty Chapel of Anticipation. He leaves the building, and proceeds along a rickety wooden bridge. As he approaches a statue of Marika, a hideous beast named the Grafted Scion leaps, ready to attack. There's nowhere to run. It's fast, strong, multi-armed, and even carrying a shield. This isn't a fair fight.","completion":"Beneath the pallid moon, a forgotten expanse stretched as far as the eye could see; this was the Lands Between, where the Erdtree stood sentinel over the destinies of many. Galen Miralux, the Tarnished astrologer, took a deep breath as he stepped through the ancient stone archway of the empty Chapel of Anticipation. His robes, shimmering with the faint sparkle of glintstone threads, caught the dying light as evening descended upon the desolate place. History had not been kind to Galen. Expelled from his home for the sin of being Tarnished, he was drawn back by the call of the Elden Ring, its siren song promising purpose and prestige. Between whispered legends and the constellations he so dearly studied, a single phrase resonated within him: \\"become the Elden Lord.\\" Simple in command, yet cryptic in its means, it was a directive that provided neither solace nor strategy. Armed with naught but his trusty Astrologer's Staff, a sword scarcely more than a tool for his own defense, and a shield cobbled together from wood that groaned wearily beneath his touch, Galen knew his journey's outset was to be a humble one. His magic was basic, rudimentary, consisting of Glintstone Pebble – a spell which conjured ethereal stones to assail his foes – and Glintstone Arc, which arced through the air to strike at a distance. True mastery of the arcane arts would require an odyssey all its own. The bridge upon which he found himself creaked ominously underfoot, protesting each step he dared place upon its weathered planks. Fingers of mist curled around its edges, grasping, reaching, an eerie herald of the dangers that surely lurked ahead. As he neared its end, he could scarcely ignore the foreboding presence of the statue of Marika the Eternal, her countenance cast in stone that bore the silent judgment of the divine. It was here, in the shadow of her likeness, that the peace of an already fragile tranquility shattered. With a grotesque elegance, the Grafted Scion – a monstrous abomination of limbs and brutality – launched itself from where it had lain in wait. Its multiple arms brandished a variety of weapons, including a shield that it wielded with disturbing proficiency. Galen's breath caught in his throat; fear, that primal emotion, licked at his heart with the flames of self-preservation. There was nowhere to flee, no shadows to meld into, no high towers in which to barricade himself. The brutal reality dawned upon him: this was no mere test of fortitude, this was survival – a trial by fire in the most literal sense. The beast let loose a guttural roar, a voice made of nightmares and the anguished cries of its countless victims. With agility that belied his scholarly pursuits, Galen clutched his staff, letting the familiar icy chill of glintstone magic flow through him. The power hummed, ready to coalesce into whatever limited defense he could marshal. The Grafted Scion advanced. Galen's destiny, his very worthiness to be the Elden Lord, hinged upon what transpired in the looming moments of combat. With nothing but the stars to bear witness, the astrologer steadied himself, his incantations a silent prayer to whatever fates still deemed him worthy to walk the Lands Between."},{"prompt":"Though defeated, he wakes up face-down in a puddle in the Stranded Graveyard, awoken by the voice of a woman, and the snorting of what seems to be a horse. \\"Don't worry Torrent, fortune is on his side.

One of his kind is sure to seek the Elden Ring. ...Even if it does violate the Golden Order...\\" He awakens, with two new items in his inventory: Three Flasks of Crimson Tears and One Flask of Cerulean Tears. There is a message written on a plaque on a small cliff leading to a cave below - Brave Tarnished, take the plunge. He does, and he finds a Site of Grace. He finds that he can distribute charges between the Crimson Tears - health-healing potions - and the Cerulean Tears - potions of mana restoration, vital for his manage.

The cool touch of moisture against his cheek, the metallic tang of his own blood diffused in water, reminded him of his corporeal existence. His ears, still ringing, strained to capture the velvety tone of a woman’s voice, tinged with a hint of mysterious familiarity. “Don’t worry Torrent,” she spoke softly, soothing the animal at her side – the creature's snorting breaths punctuated her words with a gentle rhythm. “Fortune is on his side. We found him here, after all. One of his kind is sure to seek the Elden Ring... Even if it does violate the Golden Order...” Galen inhaled sharply, a reflexive gasp of air filling his lungs as life reclaimed its foothold. Images blurred as he opened his eyes; he found himself hurriedly patting his body down, searching for injuries, the unknown woman's cryptic sentence still echoing in his mind. His hands stumbled upon unfamiliar items, and with a sense of wonder, he withdrew the three crimson flasks and a solitary flask of cerulean blue. Attached was a small note: \\"These will aid you on your path, Tarnished. Use them wisely.\\" Galen nodded to himself, despite knowing the bearer of the gift likely couldn't see his appreciation. Pushing himself upright, he glanced about, taking in the bleakness of the Stranded Graveyard. The woman and her steed were nowhere to be seen, their presence as fleeting as a passing zephyr. Before him lay a plaque, the lettering jagged yet insistent: Brave Tarnished, take the plunge. Galen’s breath hitched as he peered over the small cliff, the unknown yawning beneath it. Desperation gnawed at him, yet the words spurred him onward. He plunged into the cave below, a brief cry escaping his lips—a sound of both trepidation and determination—as he descended into shadows. The darkness of the cave seemed to embrace him, but soon enough he found a shimmering oasis within: a Site of Grace. It beckoned him, and as he approached, the air around it thrummed with a pulse peculiar to such sanctuaries. Drawing forth the Golden Seed he'd been given, Galen knew instinctively what he must do. With reverence, he presented the seed to the Site, watching as it dissolved into splinters of light that merged with the crimson and cerulean flasks. Galen knelt silently, closing his eyes to commune with the Grace. A warmth spread through his chest, the flasks vibrating faintly in his inventory as he allocated the charges. His resolve hardened like crystal; his journey demanded a mastery over both lifeblood and the arcane. He stood, his gaze now fixed upon the heart of the cave, the weight of the flasks a modest, yet comforting presence. The echo of his footsteps and the soft clink of glass at his side sang a chorus of cautiously renewed purpose. Before him, the path remained fraught with darkness and danger, but Galen Miralux, the astrologer Tarnished, had taken his first true step towards destiny, towards the Elden Ring—towards becoming an Elden Lord."},{"prompt":"START OF PREVIOUS DISCUSSION (user) hi (robot) Hello!

Russia has an extensive history of imperialism and colonial expansion. The aftermath of the Soviet Union collapse led to the Russian Federation becoming the primary beneficiary, inheriting most of the territory notably Moscow, which, according to Panayi, was the central control point of the USSR (2020). As various states gained their independence in the process, post-colonialism emerged as a prevalent issue. Consequently, with the globalization and dissemination of Western ideas the problem of race-based power dynamics in modern Russia received public attention. Before delving into discussions on racism, it is imperative to establish a clear definition. For the purposes of this discussion, racism is construed as a form of discrimination against individuals based on their race, typically involving a contrived hierarchy of races. This discrimination encompasses criminalization, everyday social and political pressure, verbal and physical abuse. Logically, it is equally important to establish the definition of race. In the context of this essay, race is construed as a social concept that is used to differentiate people into groups based on a collection of phenotypical traits, such as skin color and facial features. The topic of racism in contemporary Russia is a pressing matter. Particularly for migrant workers from Central Asia, who, According to the research of Kuznetsova and Round, grapple with racism as a daily struggle (2018). Researchers claim that the issue extends beyond interactions with citizens, to include encounters with the state institutions and the police. In other words, on top of the constant unpleasant interactions with locals, the victims of racism constantly fear the persecution from the law enforcement agencies based on their appearance and origin. This highlights not only the relevance of the problem, but also deeply ingrained racism in the Russian culture and society to the point that it almost becomes constitutionalized. They argue that this indicates Russia’s “deeply rooted imperial views”, a critical statement that will drive the ensuing discussion. What distinguishes the Russia’s case is that the racism manifests in Russian views less so as a feeling of superiority and more so as a fear of the “other” (Shnirelman, 2008). The enduring legacy of colonialism in Russia has shaped the development of racism, as the perceived threat to the rights and freedoms of white Russians is rooted in the post-Soviet collapse, where racist notions of \\"Russianness\\" emerged as a response and substitute for the lost Soviet identity, exacerbated by general lack of education on the topic and economic dependencies of post-colonial states leading to an influx of migrants. This perpetuation of racism in contemporary Russia is further fueled by political instability and the perceived powerlessness of the population following the collapse of the empire. Contrary to the prevailing belief that the Soviet Union was a raceless society, the idea of “race” did indeed exist within its ideological framework, albeit was not studied extensively. According to Zakharov’s insights, the issue of race was relegated to the periphery of academic discourse, being deemed “of marginal significance” by the scholars of the time (2015). Consequently, This marginalization reached official institutions, where race was not even officially recognized as a classification category for the diverse population of Russia. Effectively, the understanding of race within the Soviet Union was confined mainly to social scientists which represented only a small fraction of the population. This resulted in collective unawareness of racism. Interestingly, this situation contradicts the prevalent anti-fascist propaganda of the time. In spite of the demonization of fascism, “racism was paradoxically not presented as a social problem in public discourse” (Zakharov, 2015). It was not necessarily the case that racism did not exist during the times; rather, it was conspicuously absent from public conversations. This neglect of the topic in scientific research perpetuated an educational gap in USSR. To this day, race-related topics in schools of post-Soviet space is taught on a rudimentary level while racism often remains entirely omitted. Zakharov's quoted interview vividly illustrates this unawareness, recounting incidents where individuals could engage in racially motivated physical violence without recognizing the racism inherent in their behavior (2015). This further illustrates the unawareness of racism of the general public. In essence, it wasn't that Soviet society was devoid of racial considerations or that racism didn't exist within its borders; rather, the public lacked the means and educational framework to identify and comprehend the issue, leading to a collective obliviousness. The Soviet Union attempted to unite the diverse group of people of different races and nationalities through creation of the new “Soviet Identity”. Ideally, people would identify themselves first as “Soviet” and second as part of some other group. Despite this aspiration, little attention was given to the concept of race within the USSR. According to Hirsch’s analysis, the notion of race did exist in the Soviet Union, however as opposed to Nazis, USSR did not practice racial politics; rather it was more focused on the politics of nationality (2002). This is where it is needed to draw a clear distinction between nationality politics of the Soviet regime and racial politics of the Nazis. Unlike Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union “did not brand particular nationalities as biological inferiors or degenerate races” (Hirsch, 2002). The goal of the nationality politics was not to pose a group of people as the superior nor it was to use nationality as a sole justification for genocide. Instead, the state persecuted people of nationalities that “could not be \\"re-invented\\" as Soviet nations” (Hirsch, 2002). Here, Hirsch explains the core idea of the practices of ethnic cleansing performed in USSR: to develop the Soviet identity and to hinder the growth of national consciousness that was seen as the driving force of Nazi Germany. This means that even though on the surface level it may seem that the outcomes of both were similar, the message that these politics conveyed differed drastically. The racial explicitly targets groups because they are lesser and inferior, while the national targets people because they are a threat to the status quo, without any implication of a hierarchy. The distinction is crucial, therefore, to understand how this policies affected the views of the people of Russia. The practices of the Soviet regime translated to the views of “other” nations and their consciousnesses as a threat to the Russian population.","completion":"Certainly! The following rearrangement provides a logical flow, beginning with historical context, the notion of race within the Soviet Union, the transition to post-Soviet identity and concerns about racism in modern Russia. --- The idea of \\"race\\" has been a controversial and complex issue within both the historical context of the Soviet Union and its aftermath in contemporary Russia. While the Soviet Union presented itself as a society beyond racial distinctions, preferring to focus on a unified \\"Soviet Identity,\\" this narrative was not entirely reflective of reality. Contrary to the prevailing belief that the Soviet Union was a society without racial considerations, the concept of \\"race\\" was indeed present within its ideological framework. According to Zakharov (2015), the Soviet discourse on race was limited and pushed to the periphery of academic engagement. The notion of race was treated with such insignificance that it was not even an official classification for the USSR's diverse population. Official institutions and public discourse barely recognized it, leading to a collective lack of awareness. Paradoxically, despite anti-fascist propaganda that demonized fascism, racism was not publicly addressed as a social issue, even though it persisted under the surface. This gap in education and understanding caused an obliviousness that lasted into the post-Soviet era, where race-related topics are still superficially covered, often excluding discussions of racism. The Soviet Union made efforts to foster a new collective identity through the creation of the \\"Soviet Identity,\\" which was intended to supersede other forms of individual or group affiliations. According to Hirsch (2002), while race as a concept existed in the Soviet Union, its treatment was markedly different from the racial politics of Nazi Germany. The USSR focused on nationality politics, pursuing the formation of Soviet national identity rather than racial hierarchies. Nationalities perceived as incapable of assimilating into this Soviet identity were marginalized or persecuted not on the basis of racial inferiority, but because their distinct national consciousness was seen as a threat to the state. The collapse of the Soviet Union and ensuing post-colonialism raised the prominence of race-based dynamics in the Russian Federation, which inherited most of the former USSR's territory, with Moscow, its central control point (Panayi, 2020). With the spread of globalization and Western ideas, Russia's issues with race and racism have captured public attention. In modern Russia, the legacy of imperialism and colonialism has shaped the manifestation of racism. For many, such as migrant workers from Central Asia, racism is a daily reality involving discrimination and abuse from both citizens and state institutions, including law enforcement (Kuznetsova & Round, 2018). This problem extends beyond personal prejudice to a state level, indicating a systemic issue deeply rooted in contemporary Russian culture and society. The nation's struggle with racism is exacerbated by the fears and uncertainties following the collapse of the Soviet Union, where a perceived powerlessness amongst the population fueled the rise of new forms of racism. Here, racism does not solely emerge from a sense of superiority but also from xenophobia—the fear of the \\"other\\" (Shnirelman, 2008). The migration triggered by economic dependencies of post-colonial states has further compounded these tensions. Understanding racism within the Russian context necessitates clarity on the underlying terms. Racism is identified as discrimination based on race, which involves an arbitrary hierarchy placing some races above others (Panayi, 2020). This includes various manifestations from criminalization to physical violence. Correspondingly, \\"race\\" is defined as a social construct differentiating groups based on phenotypical traits, such as skin tone and facial features. This definition frames the subsequent examination of race-based dynamics within both the Soviet Union and modern Russia. --- This revised structure provides a more chronological snapshot—moving from Soviet conceptualizations of race and identity, through to the transitional period of the Soviet collapse and finally to the current issues of racism observable in the Russian Federation."},{"prompt":"напиши про рентабельность грузоперевозок","completion":"Рентабельность грузоперевозок - это показатель, который определяет, насколько эффективно осуществляется данная деятельность с точки зрения финансового результата.

She could sense his uncertainty and stepped in as a guide through this forest of metal and plastic. Jason explained his predicament—the countless hours in front of a computer and the headache that would crawl in by midday. Claire nodded understandingly and began to pick out a selection of frames that would compliment his square jaw and soften his sharp features. The first pair was a bold, black frame that made him look stern and unapproachable. The second, a sleek metal pair, slipped incessantly down the bridge of his nose. It seemed as though a compromise between comfort and aesthetics was impossible to find. After several try-ons, and quite a few glances in the mirror that reflected a stranger back at him, Jason's fingertips brushed against a pair of tortoiseshell glasses. Their warmth and the gentle curve of their design felt promising. Lifting them to his face, the frames settled comfortably. He looked at Claire, whose eyes sparkled with approval. The glasses accentuated the gentleness in his hazel eyes and added a touch of maturity and sophistication to his appearance. For the first time since he had entered the shop, Jason smiled genuinely—a smile that reached his eyes, now beautifully framed. Jason took a few steps towards the window to see the glasses under natural light and was taken aback by the improvement in his vision. The room sprung into sharp focus, the edges of furniture crisp and the text on signs across the street dancing into legibility. He was mesmerized by the sudden vibrancy of colors and the detailed world that he had been missing out on. It was breathtaking, the simple joy of being able to see clearly. The optician suggested lenses with a blue light filter to aid with his long hours of screen time. It was a practical choice, one that would hopefully end his daily tryst with headaches. Clutching his new purchase, Jason exited the store with a spring in his step. The glasses did more than just correct his sight—they altered his outlook, giving him a newfound confidence. He found himself walking taller, meeting the gaze of passersby with an uncustomary ease. Through the simple act of buying new glasses, Jason had inadvertently stumbled upon a small yet significant personal renaissance. His reflection in shop windows no longer showed a man trapped behind ill-fitting lenses but someone ready to face the world ahead with clarity and hope."},{"prompt":"START OF PREVIOUS DISCUSSION END OF PREVIOUS DISCUSSION user: hi","completion":"Hello!

Ecrire et équilibrer la réaction correspondante sachant qu’il se forme en plus, du dioxyde de carbone et de l’eau.","completion":"Pour équilibrer la réaction chimique de la synthèse de Na2TeO4 à partir de Na2CO3 (carbonate de sodium) et de H6TeO6 (acide tellurique), on doit s'assurer que le nombre d'atomes de chaque élément est le même des deux côtés de l'équation. Voici cette réaction: Na2CO3 (aq) + H6TeO6 (aq) → Na2TeO4 (s) + CO2 (g) + H2O (l) Maintenant, procédons à l'équilibrage de la réaction en ajustant les coefficients stœchiométriques : 1. Il y a 2 atomes de sodium (Na) du côté des réactifs et également 2 du côté des produits. Le sodium est donc déjà équilibré. 2. Pour l'élément tellure (Te), nous avons 1 atome de Te de chaque côté. Le tellure est donc déjà équilibré. 3. Pour l'oxygène (O), nous devons compter les atomes de chaque côté : - Du côté réactifs : l’acide tellurique a 6 atomes d'oxygène et le carbonate de sodium en a 3 pour un total de 9. - Du côté produits : le tellurate de sodium en a 4, le dioxyde de carbone en a 2 et l'eau en a 1. Ainsi, pour respecter la conservation de la matière, nous devons avoir 9 atomes d'oxygène du côté des produits aussi. 4. Pour le carbone (C), il y en a 1 de chaque côté. Le carbone est donc déjà équilibré. 5. Pour l'hydrogène (H), il y a 6 du côté des réactifs (dans l’acide tellurique) et 2 dans les produits (dans l'eau). Pour équilibrer les oxygènes et les hydrogènes, nous pouvons ajuster le coefficient devant l'eau. On sait qu'il y a 9 atomes d'oxygène du côté des réactifs, alors pour avoir 9 du côté des produits, nous pouvons poser : Na2TeO4 (4 atomes d'O) + CO2 (2 atomes d'O) + 3 H2O (3 * 1 atome d'O) = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9 atomes d'O Le mélange de tous ces oxygènes nous donne le bon nombre d'atomes d'oxygène des deux côtés de la réaction, et cela nous donne 6 atomes d'hydrogène du côté des produits, ce qui équilibre également les hydrogènes. En tenant compte de l’ensemble des ajustements, voici l'équation équilibrée : Na2CO3 (aq) + H6TeO6 (aq) → Na2TeO4 (s) + CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l)"},{"prompt":"Calculer la perte de masse observée lors de la synthèse de Na2TeO4 (T = 650°C).","completion":"Pour calculer la perte de masse observée lors de la synthèse de Na2TeO4, il faut se référer à l'équation chimique équilibrée que nous avons déjà établie : Na2CO3 (aq) + H6TeO6 (aq) → Na2TeO4 (s) + CO2 (g) + 3 H2O (l) Ici, les substances Na2CO3 et H6TeO6 réagissent pour former Na2TeO4, CO2 et H2O. La perte de masse ne peut provenir que des composés gazeux s'échappant du système, car la matière solide ou liquide reste dans la masse totale du système réactionnel. Dans cette réaction, le dioxyde de carbone (CO2) est le seul gaz produit. Ainsi, la perte de masse correspondra exactement à la quantité de CO2 qui s'échappe au cours de la réaction. Pour calculer cette perte de masse, nous aurions besoin de la quantité initiale de réactifs (en moles ou en masse) qui ont été utilisés. Cependant, puisque la question ne fournit pas de données numériques spécifiques pour les quantités des réactifs, nous ne pouvons déterminer une valeur exacte pour la perte de masse. Si on avait, par exemple, la masse initiale de carbonate de sodium (Na2CO3) et d'acide tellurique (H6TeO6), nous pourrions effectuer les calculs suivants : 1. Calculer la quantité de matière (en moles) de CO2 produit, en fonction de la quantité de matière des réactifs. 2. Utiliser la masse molaire du CO2 (44,01 g/mol) pour convertir cette quantité de matière en masse (en grammes). 3. La masse obtenue représenterait la perte de masse due à la libération de CO2. Sans informations supplémentaires, nous ne pouvons pas offrir une valeur numérique pour la perte de masse observée durant la synthèse."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Has anyone seen Yuri?

Примеры известных киногероев, литературных персонажей или исторических личностей, обладавших комплексом «угрожаемого авторитета», включают: 1. Гамлет (литературный персонаж из пьесы Уильяма Шекспира) - Гамлет испытывает постоянное беспокойство и конфликт из-за сомнений в своей способности действовать как лидер и признать свою значимость. 2. Дарт Вейдер (киногерой из саги «Звездные войны») - Дарт Вейдер скрывает свою истинную личность и испытывает комплекс угрожаемого авторитета, стремясь поддерживать свою власть и предотвратить возможное раскрытие своих слабостей. 3. Адольф Гитлер (историческая личность) - Гитлер часто проявлял комплекс «угрожаемого авторитета», пытаясь компенсировать свои личные комплексы неполноценности и создавая авторитарный режим в попытке утвердить свою власть. В целом, комплекс «угрожаемого авторитета» может привести к различным поведенческим проявлениям, включая агрессию, стремление контролировать ситуацию или же наоборот - избегать ответственности и показать безразличие.

Однако, есть некоторые общие тенденции совместимости между различными типами темперамента: 1. Сангвиник: - Сангвиник обычно хорошо сочетается с другими сангвиниками, так как они оба энергичны, общительны и легко находят общий язык. - Флегматик может быть хорошей парой, так как сангвиник может помочь разбудить и мотивировать флегматика. - Холерик и меланхолик могут быть слишком интенсивными для сангвиника, но совместная работа возможна, если они научатся уважать и сочувствовать друг другу. 2. Флегматик: - Флегматики хорошо сочетаются с другими флегматиками, так как они оба спокойны, миролюбивы и предпочитают избегать конфликтных ситуаций. - Сангвиник может быть стимулятором для флегматика, помогая ему проявить инициативу и энергию. - Холерики и меланхолики могут быть слишком эмоциональными для флегматиков, но сбалансированное партнерство возможно с учетом взаимопонимания и терпения. 3. Холерик: - Холерики могут хорошо сочетаться с другими холериками в работе, так как они оба энергичны, уверены в себе и склонны принимать быстрые решения. - Сангвиник может поддерживать и активизировать холерика, создавая энтузиазм и стимулируя новые идеи и проекты. - Флегматик и меланхолик, с меньшей интенсивностью и более уравновешенным характером, могут смягчать некоторые аспекты холерика и предлагать альтернативные точки зрения. 4. Меланхолик: - Меланхолики могут найти сходство в душевной глубине и страстности с другими меланхоликами, поэтому партнерство между ними может быть глубоким и понимающим. - Сангвиник может осветить атмосферу и помочь меланхолику выйти из своей зоны комфорта. - Флегматик, с тихой и спокойной натурой, может быть хорошим партнером для меланхолика, предлагая поддержку и стабильность. - Холерик может быть слишком энергичным для меланхолика, но сознательное уважение и учет взаимных потребностей и различий помогут создать совместимую команду.

En effet, comme les énergies fossiles, la combustion des biocarburants dégage du dioxyde de carbone (ou CO2, l'un des gaz à effet de serre responsables du réchauffement climatique), mais celle-ci est compensée, en partie du moins, par le CO2 qui avait été absorbé par les plantes lors de leur croissance ce qui n’est pas le cas du pétrole ou du charbon.Cependant, la production d'agro-carburants implique l'utilisation d'engrais et de pesticideschimiques (et donc dérivés du pétrole...), de carburant pour faire fonctionner le matériel agricole, de l'énergie pour le fonctionnement des usines productrices de biocarburants, et du carburant (ou de l'électricité) pour le transport des matières premières agricoles. Si l’on prend en compte toutes ces étapes le bilan est nettement moins satisfaisant et dans certains cas, l’émission de GES est plus importanteavec lesbio-carburants qu’avec les énergies fossiles. Indépendamment du bilan des gaz à effet de serrela biomasse présente quelques inconvénientspour l’instant non résolus :-Le détournement de millions d’hectares arables sensées nourrir la population seraient mis au profil des biocarburants.-Une déforestation intense au Brésil et en Asie du Sud qui sont les principaux producteurs de biocarburant.On sait que chaque jour environ 200 km2 de forêtsont détruites, ce qui fait environ 130 000 à 150 000 km2 de forêts rasées chaque année.-Risque d’épuisement des réserves d’eau car les cultures céréalières étant à l’origine des biocarburants sont gourmands en eau.-La culture à très grande échelle de la betterave ou du maïs nécessiterait de nombreux engrais chimiques dégageant des gaz à effet de serre comme par exemple le protoxyde d’azote, 296 plus polluants que le CO2.Les biocarburants sont donc une solution nouvelle, mais l'idéal serait de développer une énergie à la foisrenouvelable et non-polluante.Document 5.Tableau: Production de biodiesel-carburant dans l'UE-27 et en Suisse en 2009La production annuelle de biodieselau sein de l'UE et en Suisse est indiquée à la figure ci-dessous.

En effet, comme les énergies fossiles, la combustion des biocarburants dégage du dioxyde de carbone (ou CO2, l'un des gaz à effet de serre responsables du réchauffement climatique), mais celle-ci est compensée, en partie du moins, par le CO2 qui avait été absorbé par les plantes lors de leur croissance ce qui n’est pas le cas du pétrole ou du charbon.Cependant, la production d'agro-carburants implique l'utilisation d'engrais et de pesticideschimiques (et donc dérivés du pétrole...), de carburant pour faire fonctionner le matériel agricole, de l'énergie pour le fonctionnement des usines productrices de biocarburants, et du carburant (ou de l'électricité) pour le transport des matières premières agricoles. Si l’on prend en compte toutes ces étapes le bilan est nettement moins satisfaisant et dans certains cas, l’émission de GES est plus importanteavec lesbio-carburants qu’avec les énergies fossiles. Indépendamment du bilan des gaz à effet de serrela biomasse présente quelques inconvénientspour l’instant non résolus :-Le détournement de millions d’hectares arables sensées nourrir la population seraient mis au profil des biocarburants.-Une déforestation intense au Brésil et en Asie du Sud qui sont les principaux producteurs de biocarburant.On sait que chaque jour environ 200 km2 de forêtsont détruites, ce qui fait environ 130 000 à 150 000 km2 de forêts rasées chaque année.-Risque d’épuisement des réserves d’eau car les cultures céréalières étant à l’origine des biocarburants sont gourmands en eau.-La culture à très grande échelle de la betterave ou du maïs nécessiterait de nombreux engrais chimiques dégageant des gaz à effet de serre comme par exemple le protoxyde d’azote, 296 plus polluants que le CO2.Les biocarburants sont donc une solution nouvelle, mais l'idéal serait de développer une énergie à la foisrenouvelable et non-polluante.Document 5.Tableau: Production de biodiesel-carburant dans l'UE-27 et en Suisse en 2009La production annuelle de biodieselau sein de l'UE et en Suisse est indiquée à la figure ci-dessous.

It asks to determine if EMC produces fewer greenhouse gases and whether it's feasible to replace gasoil completely with EMC. The questions involve calculating the amount of gasoil used for a full tank, assessing carbon dioxide emissions, writing combustion equations for both fuels, and comparing their enthalpies. Additionally, the environmental and land use implications of a full switch to EMC are considered. To tackle the first part, we'll use stoichiometry and the concept of molar volume for the combustion reaction. For the second part, we consider the thermodynamics of the combustion process, particularly focusing on the enthalpie de combustion and pouvoir calorifique (energy content). Lastly, the implications of land use for EMC production are explored to assess sustainability. The problem is complex because it requires integrating concepts across different areas of chemistry, including reaction stoichiometry, thermodynamics, and environmental chemistry, alongside critical thinking about sustainable practices. Example: \`\`\`plaintext Due to the length and complexity of the problem, a full example cannot be contained within this format. I will present a shortened version of the analysis for part 2.1: EMC Combustion Equation: C19H34O2(l) + 26.5 O2(g) → 19 CO2(g) + 17 H2O(g) Gasoil Combustion Equation (approximate): C21H44(l) + 32 O2(g) → 21 CO2(g) + 22 H2O(g) For part 2.2, to calculate the enthalpie de combustion, we use the following formula: ΔCH (combustion) = sum(ΔfH° of products) - sum(ΔfH° of reactants) Assuming standard conditions, ΔfH° for EMC is given as 604 kJ/mol in your documents. \`\`\` Tip: When dealing with combustion reactions and comparing fuels, remember that the **stoichiometric** coefficients play a crucial role in the determination of the amount of CO2 produced. Always check for the balanced chemical equation before proceeding with any calculations. Exercise: Use the provided EMC chemical formula and the provided documents to calculate the amount of CO2 produced from the combustion of one mole of EMC. Compare this to the amount of CO2 produced from the combustion of one mole of gasoil. What conclusions can you draw from this comparison?

This library is part of PyTorch and is related to CUDA, which is used for running operations on NVIDIA GPUs. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue: 1. **Check PyTorch Installation**: Ensure that you have PyTorch installed correctly with CUDA support. You can install it using \`pip\` or \`conda\`. It's essential that you install the version that matches your CUDA version. You can visit the PyTorch website and use the installation selector to find the correct installation command for your setup. 2. **Verify CUDA Installation**: You should also have the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit installed on your system. The version of CUDA should be compatible with the PyTorch version you are using. You can check your CUDA version with \`nvcc --version\` or \`nvidia-smi\`. 3. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure that your \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` environment variable includes the path to the CUDA libraries. You can check this by running \`echo LD_LIBRARY_PATH\` in your terminal. If it's missing, you can add the CUDA library path to it using the following command (you should replace \`/usr/local/cuda/lib64\` with the actual path to your CUDA library directory): \`\`\`bash export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:LD_LIBRARY_PATH \`\`\` 4. **PyTorch/CUDA Compatibility**: If you have multiple versions of CUDA installed, make sure that PyTorch is using the correct one. PyTorch binaries are usually built against specific CUDA versions, and you must have the corresponding version of CUDA installed. If there's a mismatch, you may need to either install a different version of PyTorch or update your CUDA installation. 5. **Reinstall PyTorch**: Sometimes the issue can be resolved by simply reinstalling PyTorch. Use \`pip uninstall torch\` to remove the existing installation and then reinstall it using the appropriate command for your CUDA version. 6. **Hardware Support**: Ensure your GPU is supported by CUDA and has the necessary compute capability. 7. **Verify Shared Library**: If you built PyTorch from source, check that \`libtorch_cuda_cpp.so\` exists in your PyTorch library path. You may need to rebuild PyTorch or get the correct pre-built binaries. 8. **Use the Correct Python**: Make sure that you are using the Python interpreter that corresponds to the environment in which PyTorch is installed. For instance, if you're using a virtual environment or conda environment, you need to activate that environment before running your Python code. If none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide more details about your system, including PyTorch version, CUDA version, how you installed PyTorch, and any other relevant information. This can help diagnose the problem further."},{"prompt":"rickard@pop-os:~/Documents/3dAi/MVDream-threestudio python3 launch.py --config configs/method.yaml --train --gpu 0 name=\\"imagedream-sd21-shading\\" tag=\\"astronaut\\" system.prompt_processor.prompt=\\"an astronaut riding a horse\\" system.prompt_processor.image_path=\\"{image_file}\\" system.guidance.ckpt_path=\\"{ckpt_file}\\" system.guidance.config_path=\\"{cfg_file}\\" Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"/home/rickard/Documents/3dAi/MVDream-threestudio/launch.py\\", line 237, in <module> main(args, extras) File \\"/home/rickard/Documents/3dAi/MVDream-threestudio/launch.py\\", line 61, in main import pytorch_lightning as pl File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/__init__.py\\", line 26, in <module> from pytorch_lightning.callbacks import Callback # noqa: E402 File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/callbacks/__init__.py\\", line 14, in <module> from pytorch_lightning.callbacks.batch_size_finder import BatchSizeFinder File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/callbacks/batch_size_finder.py\\", line 24, in <module> from pytorch_lightning.callbacks.callback import Callback File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/callbacks/callback.py\\", line 22, in <module> from pytorch_lightning.utilities.types import STEP_OUTPUT File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/utilities/types.py\\", line 25, in <module> from torchmetrics import Metric File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchmetrics/__init__.py\\", line 14, in <module> from torchmetrics import functional # noqa: E402 File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchmetrics/functional/__init__.py\\", line 14, in <module> from torchmetrics.functional.audio._deprecated import _permutation_invariant_training as permutation_invariant_training File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchmetrics/functional/audio/__init__.py\\", line 14, in <module> from torchmetrics.functional.audio.pit import permutation_invariant_training, pit_permutate File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchmetrics/functional/audio/pit.py\\", line 22, in <module> from torchmetrics.utilities import rank_zero_warn File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchmetrics/utilities/__init__.py\\", line 14, in <module> from torchmetrics.utilities.checks import check_forward_full_state_property File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchmetrics/utilities/checks.py\\", line 25, in <module> from torchmetrics.metric import Metric File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchmetrics/metric.py\\", line 30, in <module> from torchmetrics.utilities.data import ( File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchmetrics/utilities/data.py\\", line 22, in <module> from torchmetrics.utilities.imports import _TORCH_GREATER_EQUAL_1_12, _XLA_AVAILABLE File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchmetrics/utilities/imports.py\\", line 50, in <module> _TORCHAUDIO_GREATER_EQUAL_0_10: Optional[bool] = compare_version(\\"torchaudio\\", operator.ge, \\"0.10.0\\") File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/lightning_utilities/core/imports.py\\", line 73, in compare_version pkg = importlib.import_module(package) File \\"/usr/lib/python3.10/importlib/__init__.py\\", line 126, in import_module return _bootstrap._gcd_import(name[level:], package, level) File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchaudio/__init__.py\\", line 1, in <module> from torchaudio import ( # noqa: F401 File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchaudio/_extension.py\\", line 135, in <module> _init_extension() File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchaudio/_extension.py\\", line 105, in _init_extension _load_lib(\\"libtorchaudio\\") File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torchaudio/_extension.py\\", line 52, in _load_lib torch.ops.load_library(path) File \\"/home/rickard/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/_ops.py\\", line 643, in load_library ctypes.CDLL(path) File \\"/usr/lib/python3.10/ctypes/__init__.py\\", line 374, in __init__ self._handle = _dlopen(self._name, mode) OSError: libtorch_cuda_cpp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory","completion":"The error message \\"OSError: libtorch_cuda_cpp.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\\" suggests that the shared library \`libtorch_cuda_cpp.so\`, which is required for PyTorch's CUDA operations, is missing or cannot be found by the system. This type of error could arise due to various reasons, such as: 1. An incomplete or improper installation of the CUDA-enabled PyTorch version. 2.

This issue can arise due to multiple reasons: 1. CUDA/cuDNN may not be installed correctly on your system. 2. The versions of PyTorch and CUDA may not be compatible. 3. The CUDA libraries may not be in the system's library path. 4. There may be a mismatch between the CUDA version that PyTorch expects and the one that is installed on your system. Here are a few steps to diagnose and solve the problem: 1. **Verify CUDA Installation:** Ensure that CUDA is properly installed on your system by running \`nvidia-smi\` to check if the Nvidia drivers and CUDA are correctly displaying the GPU and version information. 2. **Check PyTorch and CUDA Compatibility:** It's crucial that your installed PyTorch version is compatible with the version of CUDA on your system. You can check PyTorch's CUDA version with: \`\`\`shell python -c \\"import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)\\" \`\`\` And compare it with your installed CUDA version. 3. **Reinstall PyTorch:** If there's a version mismatch, or if you are unsure, the best course of action might be to reinstall PyTorch with the correct CUDA version that matches your system's. You can do this using pip or conda. For pip, you can use: \`\`\`shell pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113 \`\`\` Replace \`cu113\` with the appropriate version string for your CUDA installation. 4. **Set Library Path:** Sometimes, the problem is that the system cannot find the CUDA libraries because they're not in the default library path.

You might miss some libraries that are required by PyTorch for GPU support. If all else fails, or if you're not comfortable with manual troubleshooting, consider seeking help from the PyTorch community or the developers of the library that you are trying to run.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking and infantilizing physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of her pants is, and then proceeds to tauntingly scold for being the stinkiest girl there is in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about how her grown daughter - the returning woman - can be so smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"Title: \\"Homecoming Hurdles\\" INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAY The sun begins to dip below the horizon, casting a golden hue over the bustling campus. Students hurry to and from classes, but one in particular, LAYLA HADDAD (20s, an American woman of Lebanese descent wearing jogging pants and a university sweatshirt), appears to move against the current, rushing towards the exit with a pained look of determination on her face. Short, wavy brunette hair sticks to her forehead, a testament to the day's heat and her present distress. EXT. HADDAD FAMILY HOUSE - DAY Layla arrives at her family's modest suburban home. She glances around, checking her surroundings discreetly, a subtle cue she holds a secret she wishes not to share. She reaches for her keys, her hands rooting through her bag with increasing freneticism. Nothing. Layla curses under her breath, her discomfort growing by the second. ANGLE ON Layla, now pacing at the front door. Her breathing quickens, her hands clenched tight. She knocks hard against the door. INT. HADDAD FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS MIRA HADDAD (late 40s, a Lebanese-American woman wearing a comfortable blouse and capri pants), hears the knocking from the kitchen. Her face wears the look of a woman mid-conversation with pots and pans. She wipes her hands on a dish towel as she strides to the door. EXT. HADDAD FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Mira's voice leaks through the door, cautious but tempered with annoyance. MIRA (to herself) Ayb, what's now... (aloud, through the door) Who's banging on the door like the world's ending? LAYLA (increasingly agitated) Mama, it's me! Open up, quick! Mira fiddles with the locks with no sense of urgency, her movements deliberate, methodical. Layla shifts from one foot to another, the desperation clear as day, although the exact cause remains unsaid. MIRA What’s got into you? Hold your horses. LAYLA (between clenched teeth) Please, Mama... The door finally swings open, and Mira stands aghast at her daughter's fretful state. MIRA (puzzled) Layla? What's— LAYLA (cutting her off) Out of my way! Layla moves to dart past her mother, but Mira, all motherly concern, clutches her forearm, looking into her eyes for an answer. MIRA Is everything alright, habibti? You’re pale— LAYLA Not now, Mama! I need to— Their bickering bubbles over, bodies tangled and balked. Layla wiggles and jostles, trying to break free. Mira's concern shifts to audible anxiety, bewildered at her daughter's urgency. And then, the dam breaks. Layla groans, her eyes wide with dismay and surrender. The sound of matter meeting material is muffled but unmistakable. MIRA (startled) Layla, what’s wrong? Talk to me! As Layla leans back, assuming a semisquat, she continues in strained whispers while exerting heavy breaths, her face a confusing tableau of embarrassment and release. LAYLA (mumbling with strained satisfaction) Oh God... I can't believe— Now it’s Mira's turn to recoil, her grasp loosening as Layla unabashedly continues her messy ordeal. Confusion is written all over Mira's face. MIRA What are you— Mira sniffs the air, once, then again. Her expression shifts as the reality dawns, her lips parting in silent recognition. MIRA (disgust beginning to sink in) Did you just...? Layla, still supporting herself on the door frame, meets her mother's eyes, mortified silence her only response. MIRA (slow realization slurring to revulsion) Tell me you didn't just... in your pants? LAYLA (defensive) Can you let me in now? MIRA (turning away) Oh, ya latif... Go! Layla shuffles in, cupping the back of her pants, while Mira gapes with a mix of revulsion and concern. MIRA (aghast) Wait, not so fast! Don’t track that... filth in here! Layla stops, affronted yet abashed, to face her mother’s incredulous glare. MIRA You’re too old for this, Layla. When will you grow up? LAYLA (mutinous retort) It's your fault... Too slow with the door. Blocked me. Mira's eyebrows shoot up. MIRA That’s no excuse to... The discussion is cut short as Layla's defensive posture shifts to one of resolute justification. LAYLA I couldn't hold it anymore, Mama. It was... I had to get it all out. Mira takes a step back, examining her daughter with a touch of dark humor, but also evident disdain. MIRA (to herself) Well, aren’t we the rational one now? (re-aggravated) Get yourself sorted. Just... unbelievable. Layla, edging towards the bathroom, slows down, a rueful grin grace her lips, despite the smelly burden she carries. LAYLA It actually... felt good to let it go— Mira interjects before Layla can proceed. MIRA (sarcastically derisive) Well, since you're feeling so content, let's have a closer look— Layla protests weakly as Mira spins her around, shock written all over Layla’s face. MIRA (mockingly amused) Enjoying it, are we? You must like being full of— Layla halfheartedly bats Mira's hands away. LAYLA (excusing herself) There was a lot... Needed relief. MIRA (impatient) Childish nonsense. That’s what that is. Act your age, fu! Mira, despite her scowl, can't help but peer closer. MIRA (playfully pretending to inspect like a toddler's diaper) You’re the stinkiest little girl, aren’t you? LAYLA (defeated) Yeah, well, since you’re so keen on keeping me standing here... Mira waves off her daughter’s remarks and signals towards the bathroom. MIRA Enough. In you go. Pray nothing falls on the floor. As Layla totters towards the bathroom, Mira follows, miming a holding action to the offending area, voicing her aversion for comedic effect. Layla's protests mix bashfully with Mira's incessant warnings as they reach the bathroom. Finally, just as Layla is about to cross the threshold, she pauses and turns to her mother with a mischievous glint. LAYLA (teasingly) You want to take care of my “poopy diaper” too? Offended and at her wit’s end, Mira reacts by pinching the seat of Layla's pants and shoving her through the doorway, in a farcical, if not slightly affectionate, manner. MIRA (holding/plugging her nose) Get in there, ya amar! And clean up your act, literally! Layla exclaims, indignant but with an undeniable hint of laughter. LAYLA (grossed out) Ma, you squished it! Mira, still grimacing at the stench that bathes the air, shakes her head. MIRA That’s what you get for your cheekiness, young lady. Mira slams the bathroom door behind her fleeing daughter and walks away, muttering about Layla, her very dramatic, very smelly adult child."},{"prompt":"крахмалистые и некрахмалистые овощи","completion":"Крахмалистые овощи: 1.

Включение обоих типов овощей в равной пропорции в ваш рацион может быть оптимальным для поддержания здорового питания."},{"prompt":"правда ли, что крахмалистые овощи при варке становятся неполезными","completion":"Нет, это неправильное утверждение. Крахмалистые овощи, такие как картофель, батат или кукуруза, не теряют своей полезности при варке. Варка овощей помогает им стать более мягкими и усваиваемыми, сохраняя большинство их полезных свойств. Однако некоторые полезные вещества могут быть потеряны в процессе приготовления, особенно если овощи перевариваются в избыточном количестве в воде или варятся слишком долго. Чтобы минимизировать потерю питательных веществ, рекомендуется варить овощи на пару, тушить или запекать, вместо длительной варки в большом количестве воды.

Оба источника белка имеют свои преимущества и недостатки, поэтому рекомендуется достигать баланса между ними. Животные источники белка, такие как мясо, рыба, яйца и молочные продукты, обычно содержат все необходимые аминокислоты, включая так называемые \\"ограниченные\\" аминокислоты, такие как лизин. Они также богаты железом, цинком и витамином B12. Растительные источники белка, такие как бобы, соя, орехи, семена, злаки и овощи, обычно низкожировые, богатые клетчаткой и антиоксидантами. Однако они могут быть неполноценными и находиться в некоторых ограничениях по содержанию определенных аминокислот, поэтому важно комбинировать разные растительные продукты, чтобы обеспечить полную аминокислотный профиль. Общие рекомендации по белку в рационе могут варьироваться. Например, Всемирная организация здравоохранения рекомендует, чтобы белок составлял от 10% до 35% общей калорийности питания, хотя конкретные требования индивидуальны и могут зависеть от различных факторов, таких как возраст, пол, уровень активности и состояние здоровья. Важно обратить внимание на общую сбалансированность питания и учитывать свои индивидуальные потребности и предпочтения при выборе соотношения растительного и животного белка в своем рационе.

En effet, comme les énergies fossiles, la combustion des biocarburants dégage du dioxyde de carbone (ou CO2, l'un des gaz à effet de serre responsables du réchauffement climatique), mais celle-ci est compensée, en partie du moins, par le CO2 qui avait été absorbé par les plantes lors de leur croissance ce qui n’est pas le cas du pétrole ou du charbon.Cependant, la production d'agro-carburants implique l'utilisation d'engrais et de pesticideschimiques (et donc dérivés du pétrole...), de carburant pour faire fonctionner le matériel agricole, de l'énergie pour le fonctionnement des usines productrices de biocarburants, et du carburant (ou de l'électricité) pour le transport des matières premières agricoles. Si l’on prend en compte toutes ces étapes le bilan est nettement moins satisfaisant et dans certains cas, l’émission de GES est plus importanteavec lesbio-carburants qu’avec les énergies fossiles. Indépendamment du bilan des gaz à effet de serrela biomasse présente quelques inconvénientspour l’instant non résolus :-Le détournement de millions d’hectares arables sensées nourrir la population seraient mis au profil des biocarburants.-Une déforestation intense au Brésil et en Asie du Sud qui sont les principaux producteurs de biocarburant.On sait que chaque jour environ 200 km2 de forêtsont détruites, ce qui fait environ 130 000 à 150 000 km2 de forêts rasées chaque année.-Risque d’épuisement des réserves d’eau car les cultures céréalières étant à l’origine des biocarburants sont gourmands en eau.-La culture à très grande échelle de la betterave ou du maïs nécessiterait de nombreux engrais chimiques dégageant des gaz à effet de serre comme par exemple le protoxyde d’azote, 296 plus polluants que le CO2.Les biocarburants sont donc une solution nouvelle, mais l'idéal serait de développer une énergie à la foisrenouvelable et non-polluante.Document 5.Tableau: Production de biodiesel-carburant dans l'UE-27 et en Suisse en 2009La production annuelle de biodieselau sein de l'UE et en Suisse est indiquée à la figure ci-dessous.

Masse volumique du gasoil: 0,830 kg/L La masse de gasoil pour un plein de réservoir: [ Masse_{gasoil} = Volume_{réservoir} times Densité_{gasoil} ] [ Masse_{gasoil} = 60 L times 0,830 frac{kg}{L} ] [ Masse_{gasoil} = 49,8 kg ] La masse molaire du gasoil (en moyenne, puisque le gasoil est un mélange de différents hydrocarbures) est donnée comme C21H44 avec une masse molaire de 296 g/mol.

Capacité du réservoir du véhicule : 60 litres Masse volumique du gasoil (fournie dans le document) : 0,830 kg/L Pour obtenir la masse totale de gasoil remplissant le réservoir : [ Masse_{gasoil} = Volume_{réservoir} times Densité_{gasoil} ] [ Masse_{gasoil} = 60 , L times 0,830 , frac{kg}{L} = 49,8 , kg ] La masse molaire du gasoil est une estimation basée sur une composition de C21H44, ce qui donne une masse molaire de 296 g/mol d'après le document. Convertissons la masse de gasoil en moles en utilisant cette masse molaire estimative : [ Masse_{gasoil} = 49.8 , kg times 1000 , frac{g}{kg} = 49800 , g ] [ n_{gasoil} = frac{Masse_{gasoil}}{MasseMolaire_{gasoil}} ] [ n_{gasoil} = frac{49800 , g}{296 , frac{g}{mol}} approx 168.24 , mol ] La quantité de matière de gasoil est donc d'environ 168,24 moles pour un plein. Pour compléter le tableau d'avancement, il nous faut l'équation stœchiométrique de la combustion du gasoil. Habituellement, la combustion complète d'un hydrocarbure a la forme générale: [ C_{x}H_{y} + O_{2} rightarrow CO_{2} + H_{2}O ] Néanmoins, l'équation exacte et les rapports stœchiométriques associés dépendent de la formule exacte du carburant et comprennent également l'azote de l'air ainsi que la possibilité de produire des oxydes d'azote lors de la combustion. Le tableau d'avancement nécessite ces informations pour être complété correctement. Pour cette raison, et en absence de l'équation précise pour la combustion du gasoil, je vais devoir formuler une équation stœchiométrique en utilisant la composition moyenne supposée du gasoil (C21H44) comme modèle: [ C21H44 + cdots O_{2} rightarrow cdots CO_{2} + cdots H_{2}O ] Compte tenu de cette formule estimative, le reste (nombre de moles d'oxygène consommé, de CO2 et d'H2O formés) exige les coefficients stœchiométriques appropriés qui ne peuvent être déterminés sans l'équation complète. Pour être précis, nous aurions besoin des informations suivants: - La réaction de combustion complète du gasoil (incluant l'oxygène de l'air). - Le nombre réel de moles de CO2 générées par mole de gasoil brûlée pour déterminer si le véhicule peut être considéré comme \\"écologique\\" selon les critères du malus définis par le document 2."},{"prompt":"1.3 Notrevéhicule est-il «écologique»?","completion":"Pour déterminer si le véhicule est \\"écologique\\" selon les normes définies dans vos documents, nous devrions connaître les émissions spécifiques de CO₂ du véhicule en grammes par kilomètre, ce qui n'a pas été fourni directement dans les informations précédentes.

Si le véhicule émet 135 grammes de CO₂ ou moins par kilomètre parcouru, il est alors considéré comme “écologique” et exempt de malus. Si les émissions se trouvent dans la tranche supérieure, le malus varie en fonction du taux d'émission. Cependant, sans les données spécifiques sur les émissions de CO₂ pour le véhicule en question (les émissions moyennes du véhicule en grammes de CO₂ par kilomètre), il n'est pas possible de conclure catégoriquement si le véhicule est \\"écologique\\" selon les normes de l'écotaxe additionnelle française de 2012.

Il y a 19 atomes de carbone et 34 atomes d'hydrogène : [ C_{19}H_{34}O_{2} + frac{35}{2} , O_{2} rightarrow 19 , CO_{2} + 17 , H_{2}O ] Équation bilan de la combustion du gasoil (supposant qu'il est principalement C21H44) : [ C_{21}H_{44} + d , O_{2} rightarrow e , CO_{2} + f , H_{2}O ] Après équilibrage des atomes de carbone et d'hydrogène : [ C_{21}H_{44} + frac{64}{2} , O_{2} rightarrow 21 , CO_{2} + 22 , H_{2}O ] Ces équations montrent que pour chaque mole d'EMC et de gasoil brûlée, une quantité différente de CO2 et H2O est produite. Cependant, pour l'EMC, il y a déjà deux atomes d'oxygène dans le composé. Ces atomes d'oxygène font partie intégrante de la production de CO2 et d'eau et ne nécessitent donc pas d'oxygène supplémentaire de l'air lors de la combustion. La comparaison directe des équations de combustion n'est pas suffisante pour justifier l'affirmation que l'EMC produit moins de gaz à effet de serre que le gasoil. C'est parce que, bien que les réactions de combustion indiquent les produits formés lors de la combustion, elles ne tiennent pas compte du CO2 absorbé pendant la croissance des plantes à partir desquelles l'EMC est produit. Cela signifie que l'EMC a un cycle de vie \\"plus vert\\" car les plantes absorbent le CO2 de l'atmosphère durant leur croissance, qui est ensuite libéré lors de la combustion ; ceci indique un cycle relativement neutre en termes d'émissions de CO2.

Pour évaluer de manière plus précise et globale l'impact sur les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, il est nécessaire de considérer l'ensemble du cycle de vie du carburant, y compris la production, le transport, la combustion et les différents inputs énergétiques nécessaires à ces étapes."},{"prompt":"fait un bilan de toutes les questions actuel snas utiliser latex","completion":"D'accord, passons en revue les questions et leur état actuel en évitant l'utilisation du format LaTeX. 1.

Calcul de la quantité de matière de gasoil consommée avec un plein. Nous avons calculé la quantité de matière de gasoil pour un plein de 60 litres en se basant sur la densité du gasoil (~0,830 kg/L) et une masse molaire estimée de 296 g/mol.

Nous avons rédigé les équations de combustion pour l'EMC et le gasoil en supposant des formules moléculaires pour le gasoil (C21H44) et en utilisant la formule donnée pour l'EMC (C19H34O2). Nous avons expliqué que la comparaison des équations de combustion n'est pas suffisante pour justifier l'affirmation selon laquelle l'EMC produit moins de gaz à effet de serre, car elle ne prend pas en compte l'absorption de CO2 pendant la croissance des plantes utilisées pour produire l'EMC. Pour évaluer l'impact sur les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, un examen du cycle de vie complet du carburant est nécessaire, car il englobe la production, la consommation et les émissions associées à chaque étape. En résumé, il semble que nous ayons abordé les considérations écologiques du véhicule, calculé la quantité de gasoil pour un plein, écrit les équations de combustion pour l'EMC et le gasoil, et discuté pourquoi la comparaison des réactions de combustion ne suffit pas à prouver l'avantage environnemental de l'EMC sans une analyse du cycle de vie complet."},{"prompt":"pour chaque questions fait une feuille finale regroupant toutes les questions","completion":"Très bien, je vais résumer les réponses aux questions posées dans une forme finale pour chaque question distincte sans utiliser de formules LaTeX. **Question 1 : Est-il possible de déterminer si le véhicule de référence est \\"écologique\\" ?** Réponse : Pour déterminer si le véhicule est écologique, nous devons connaître ses émissions de CO2 en grammes par kilomètre. D'après le document 2, un véhicule est considéré comme écologique s'il émet 135 grammes de CO2 ou moins par kilomètre. Nous n'avons pas cette information précise. Ainsi, nous ne pouvons pas conclure si le véhicule est écologique ou non selon les critères établis. **Question 2 : Calcul de la quantité de matière de gasoil consommée avec un plein de 60 litres.** Réponse : En utilisant la densité du gasoil fournie (0,830 kg/L), on calcule la masse totale de gasoil pour un plein complet. Masse de gasoil = Volume du réservoir × Densité du gasoil = 60 litres × 0,830 kg/L = 49,8 kg Convertissons maintenant cette masse en moles en utilisant la masse molaire approximative du gasoil (296 g/mol). Quantité de matière (nombre de moles) de gasoil = Masse de gasoil / Masse molaire du gasoil = 49800 g / 296 g/mol = 168,24 moles **Question 3 : Écriture des équations bilan de la combustion de l'EMC et du gasoil, et discussion sur la signification des comparaisons.** Résumé Réponse : Nous avons formulé des équations de combustion pour l'EMC (C19H34O2) et le gasoil (C21H44).

Cependant, la comparaison des réactions de combustion ne permet pas de justifier par elle-même l'affirmation que l'EMC est plus écologique que le gasoil. Pour cela, il faut considérer l'absorption de CO2 durant la croissance des plantes pour l'EMC et examiner le bilan carbone sur l'ensemble du cycle de vie du carburant.

They both filter trips by vehicle number and ensure that the destination station comes after the departure station on the route, which validates the trip's direction. Once these trips are identified, they gather detailed information about each station along the trip, such as the station name, arrival time, and departure time. Let's walk through the main differences between the two versions of the \`index\` action within your \`Api::V1::SchedulesController\`. # Original Version: - Starts by fetching schedules that include both the departure and destination stations using a \`joins\` query. - The retrieved schedules are iterated over, with an added step of extracting station names to check the order of stops without triggering extra queries to the database. - Uses \`each_with_object({})\` to iterate through \`schedules\` and builds \`vehicle_trips\` which is a hash where each \`vehicle_number\` key corresponds to an array of trips. - Uses a conditional (\`if\`) inside the block passed to \`each_with_object\` to filter valid trips. - Optionally, the code could be improved by fetching only the relevant attributes in the initial query to minimize memory usage and enhance performance. # Reference Version: - Fetches schedules and performs grouping by vehicle number immediately after the distinct selection, using \`group_by { |schedule| schedule.route.bus_schedule.vehicle_number }\`. - The iteration over the valid schedules is similar to the original version, but it first filters trips specifically by checking if the departure index is less than the destination index and both are present. - The \`joins(:stations)\` in this version ensures that only the schedules with relevant stations are retrieved from the database. - Uses a \`select\` block to filter the valid trips and then a \`map\` to construct the trip data. - Requires trips to be filtered for each vehicle number using \`select\`, which is slightly different from the original version and is potentially less performant if the subsequent map operation is expensive. Both versions of the code correctly filter the schedules and build the trip information for the matching schedules. The choice between these two versions should be based on performance considerations and code style preferences. If the reference code's performance is suitable for your application's requirements and you prefer the slightly cleaner separation of concerns (first filtering by vehicle number, then by valid trip), you might opt for the reference version. Otherwise, if you need to ensure the best possible performance and are okay with the more compact but slightly more complex logic of the original version, you might stick with the original. In either case, it might be prudent to check the generated SQL queries and their execution plans to ensure they are as efficient as possible. Adding appropriate database indexes can also substantially improve query performance."},{"prompt":"edit code to also list intermediate stations","completion":"The original version of your code already contains the logic to include intermediate stations in the trip data. When building the \`trip_data\` hash, it maps over \`schedule.stations\` and constructs a list of all stations along with their \`arrivalTime\` and \`departureTime\`. This list includes all stations for a particular trip, not just the departure and destination stations. Here's an excerpt from your original code that does this: \`\`\`ruby trip_data = { trip: schedule.trip, stations: schedule.stations.map do |station| { station: station.name, arrivalTime: station.arrival_time, departureTime: station.departure_time } end } \`\`\` However, you should also ensure that the stations are ordered correctly by their sequence on the route. Typically, the \`stations\` table should have a position field or similar that indicates the order of stations on each route. If that is the case, you can include an \`.order\` clause when you're retrieving the \`stations\` association. For illustrative purposes, let's assume this field is called \`position\`. Here's an updated version of the code, including the \`.order\` statement: \`\`\`ruby class Api::V1::SchedulesController < ApplicationController def index departure_station = params[:departure] destination_station = params[:destination] if departure_station.present? && destination_station.present? # Assuming 'stations' table has a 'position' field to order by. schedules = Schedule.joins(:stations, route: :bus_schedule) .where(stations: { name: [departure_station, destination_station] }) .distinct .includes(:stations, route: :bus_schedule) .order('stations.position ASC') # Add order to ensure correct sequence vehicle_trips = schedules.each_with_object({}) do |schedule, acc| # Use pluck to retrieve ordered names and ids to avoid N+1 query problems station_names_ids = schedule.stations.pluck(:name, :id) station_names = station_names_ids.map(&:first) station_ids = station_names_ids.map(&:last) # Ensure that the destination comes after the departure if station_names.include?(departure_station) && station_names.include?(destination_station) && station_names.index(departure_station) < station_names.index(destination_station) vehicle_number = schedule.route.bus_schedule.vehicle_number # Find indexes for departure and destination departure_index = station_names.index(departure_station) destination_index = station_names.index(destination_station) # Select all stations between, including departure and destination relevant_station_ids = station_ids[departure_index..destination_index] trip_data = { trip: schedule.trip, stations: schedule.stations.where(id: relevant_station_ids).map do |station| { station: station.name, arrivalTime: station.arrival_time, departureTime: station.departure_time } end } # Accumulate trips for each vehicle_number acc[vehicle_number] ||= [] acc[vehicle_number] << trip_data end end render json: vehicle_trips.map { |vehicle_number, trips| { vehicle_number: vehicle_number, trips: trips } }, status: :ok else render json: { error: 'Departure and destination stations are required.' }, status: :unprocessable_entity end end end \`\`\` In this updated code snippet, we use \`pluck\` to retrieve station names and ids in a single query for performance reasons. The \`relevant_station_ids\` array is constructed based on the stations between departure and destination stations, including them. Then, when mapping over \`schedule.stations\`, we filter it with \`.where(id: relevant_station_ids)\` to ensure we only include the relevant subset of stations.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking and infantilizing physical gesture. The present woman also ridicules the returning woman over how terribly smelly the bulge in the seat of her pants is, and then proceeds to tauntingly scold for being the stinkiest girl there is in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about how her grown daughter - the returning woman - can be so smelly from childishly pooping her pants.","completion":"INT. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY OPEN ON a Lebanese American family's home in a bustling suburban neighborhood. A potted olive tree sits by the front door, a nod to their heritage. Inside, savory scents of cooking waft through the air, mingling with the sound of a Lebanese pop song playing softly. Photos of family members at different stages of life adorn the walls of the warmly lit entryway. CUT TO: EXT. FAMILY HOUSE - DAY NADIA (early 20s, dark wavy hair tied into a loose bun, athletic build, wearing yoga pants and an oversized college hoodie, flushed, beads of sweat on her forehead) is speed walking toward her family house. She's visibly uncomfortable, taking sharp, shallow breaths, clenching her abdomen. Her urgent strides suggest a surmounting urge that can't wait. The events from the preceding scene relay the source of her predicament: a hearty lunch at a nearby Lebanese restaurant with friends, her avoidance of public bathrooms due to her secretive nature about bowel movements, and her hasty departure to the safety of her home for relief. Nadia reaches the front door, rummages through her bag, her search growing frantic when she can't find her keys. Panicked, she pounds on the door. CUT TO: INT. ENTRYWAY - DAY Nadia's mom, RIMA (mid-50s, gracious smile lines, curly hair streaked with silver, wearing a flour-dusted apron over a comfortable, casual outfit) is in the hallway, startled by the loud knocks. RIMA: \\"Who's banging down the door like it's Judgment Day?\\" Nadia continues to bang urgently. Rima approaches the door, peeks through the peephole. CUT TO: EXT.

ENTRYWAY - DAY Finally, the door swings open. Rima stands there, puzzled by Nadia's frantic state. RIMA: \\"Nadia, what's wrong habibti? You look like you've seen a ghost!\\" Nadia tries to sidestep her mom, her eyes darting for the bathroom. NADIA: \\"Move, Ma, please!\\" Rima, still not getting it, instinctively grabs Nadia's arm in concern. RIMA: \\"Talk to me, Nadia, you're scaring me. What's going on?\\" They bicker and wrestle in the narrow entry, Nadia's face betraying the strain as she pleads for passage without mentioning her desperate need. NADIA: \\"Just step aside, Ma, I need to get through!\\" The urgency peaks, and despite her efforts, Nadia loses control. A groan erupts, followed by an expression of shock and relief. Rima's grip loosens out of confusion. RIMA: \\"Yallah, Nadia, tell me what's wrong!\\" Nadia gently pushes away, assuming a discreet stance. Nadia's response is a strained grunt, indicating both exertion and a bizarre satisfaction. Puzzled, Rima inquires again. RIMA (CONT'D): \\"Nadia? Are you okay?\\" No coherent answer comes, just soft grunt-filled murmurs of contemplation and relief. Rima watches in bafflement. A noxious odor wafts through the air. Rima sniffs, then sniffs again. Nadia looks sheepish, trying to hide her ordeal. RIMA (CONT'D): \\"What is this smell, ya Allah?\\" Realization dawns upon Rima, her face twisting in disgusted awe. RIMA (CONT'D): \\"Nadia, don't tell me you... did you...?\\" Nadia remains silent, eyes lowered. RIMA (CONT'D) (pressing): \\"Did you poop your pants, Nadia?\\" Nadia avoids eye contact, subtly implying: NADIA: \\"Can I please just go now?\\" Giving way, Rima lets Nadia enter, pinching her nose, beckoning her through with impatience and repulsion. Nadia waddles in, cupping her soiled pants, as Rima stops her. RIMA: \\"Wait! Don't drop anything on the floor.\\" Nadia, indignant and mortified, stands rooted. Rima, gripping her apron away from the odor, scolds Nadia's dirtiness. RIMA (CONT'D): (Mix of anger and comically aghast) \\"You're too old for this, Nadia! Will you ever grow up?\\" Nadia, brushing off her shame, retorts playfully. NADIA: \\"If you hadn't taken so long, none of this would've happened!\\" Rima, dismissively: RIMA: \\"Excuses! We're adults. No blocking blames holding your bowels!\\" Nadia, grumbling: NADIA: \\"I had to go, Ma! Once it started, I couldn't stop!\\" Rima rolls her eyes, insistent. RIMA: \\"This is no excuse to fill your pants! It's disgusting.\\" Nadia, running her hand over the offending pants with a satirical wince and a smirk. NADIA: \\"Well, it's done. And honestly, it was a relief.\\" She tries to duck into the bathroom; Rima stops her. RIMA: \\"Basking in filth now, are we? Let's see the result!\\" She forces Nadia to turn, ridiculing her overfilled pants. Nadia's protests are half-hearted; she tentatively agrees to the silkiness, against her better judgment. RIMA (CONT'D) (taunting): \\"Seems you enjoyed it, our poopy princess!\\" Nadia's defense wavers as she touches the bulge. NADIA: \\"But it all needed to come out. And now it feels... better.\\" Rima, playing the disapproving mom: RIMA: \\"That's nasty, Nadia! Acting like a child!\\" Upon Rima’s infantilizing inspection, Nadia cringes, reacting to her own smell. NADIA: \\"Fine, keep me here with my stink since I can’t clean up.\\" Rima finally reaches a breaking point with a snort of resolve. RIMA: \\"Enough. That smell!

En effet, comme les énergies fossiles, la combustion des biocarburants dégage du dioxyde de carbone (ou CO2, l'un des gaz à effet de serre responsables du réchauffement climatique), mais celle-ci est compensée, en partie du moins, par le CO2 qui avait été absorbé par les plantes lors de leur croissance ce qui n’est pas le cas du pétrole ou du charbon.Cependant, la production d'agro-carburants implique l'utilisation d'engrais et de pesticideschimiques (et donc dérivés du pétrole...), de carburant pour faire fonctionner le matériel agricole, de l'énergie pour le fonctionnement des usines productrices de biocarburants, et du carburant (ou de l'électricité) pour le transport des matières premières agricoles. Si l’on prend en compte toutes ces étapes le bilan est nettement moins satisfaisant et dans certains cas, l’émission de GES est plus importanteavec lesbio-carburants qu’avec les énergies fossiles. Indépendamment du bilan des gaz à effet de serrela biomasse présente quelques inconvénientspour l’instant non résolus :-Le détournement de millions d’hectares arables sensées nourrir la population seraient mis au profil des biocarburants.-Une déforestation intense au Brésil et en Asie du Sud qui sont les principaux producteurs de biocarburant.On sait que chaque jour environ 200 km2 de forêtsont détruites, ce qui fait environ 130 000 à 150 000 km2 de forêts rasées chaque année.-Risque d’épuisement des réserves d’eau car les cultures céréalières étant à l’origine des biocarburants sont gourmands en eau.-La culture à très grande échelle de la betterave ou du maïs nécessiterait de nombreux engrais chimiques dégageant des gaz à effet de serre comme par exemple le protoxyde d’azote, 296 plus polluants que le CO2.Les biocarburants sont donc une solution nouvelle, mais l'idéal serait de développer une énergie à la foisrenouvelable et non-polluante.Document 5.Tableau: Production de biodiesel-carburant dans l'UE-27 et en Suisse en 2009La production annuelle de biodieselau sein de l'UE et en Suisse est indiquée à la figure ci-dessous.

En effet, comme les énergies fossiles, la combustion des biocarburants dégage du dioxyde de carbone (ou CO2, l'un des gaz à effet de serre responsables du réchauffement climatique), mais celle-ci est compensée, en partie du moins, par le CO2 qui avait été absorbé par les plantes lors de leur croissance ce qui n’est pas le cas du pétrole ou du charbon.Cependant, la production d'agro-carburants implique l'utilisation d'engrais et de pesticideschimiques (et donc dérivés du pétrole...), de carburant pour faire fonctionner le matériel agricole, de l'énergie pour le fonctionnement des usines productrices de biocarburants, et du carburant (ou de l'électricité) pour le transport des matières premières agricoles. Si l’on prend en compte toutes ces étapes le bilan est nettement moins satisfaisant et dans certains cas, l’émission de GES est plus importanteavec lesbio-carburants qu’avec les énergies fossiles. Indépendamment du bilan des gaz à effet de serrela biomasse présente quelques inconvénientspour l’instant non résolus :-Le détournement de millions d’hectares arables sensées nourrir la population seraient mis au profil des biocarburants.-Une déforestation intense au Brésil et en Asie du Sud qui sont les principaux producteurs de biocarburant.On sait que chaque jour environ 200 km2 de forêtsont détruites, ce qui fait environ 130 000 à 150 000 km2 de forêts rasées chaque année.-Risque d’épuisement des réserves d’eau car les cultures céréalières étant à l’origine des biocarburants sont gourmands en eau.-La culture à très grande échelle de la betterave ou du maïs nécessiterait de nombreux engrais chimiques dégageant des gaz à effet de serre comme par exemple le protoxyde d’azote, 296 plus polluants que le CO2.Les biocarburants sont donc une solution nouvelle, mais l'idéal serait de développer une énergie à la foisrenouvelable et non-polluante.Document 5.Tableau: Production de biodiesel-carburant dans l'UE-27 et en Suisse en 2009La production annuelle de biodieselau sein de l'UE et en Suisse est indiquée à la figure ci-dessous.

However, there have been tensions and disputes between Greece and Turkey over the sovereignty and demilitarization of various islands and islets in the Aegean Sea. The heart of the dispute lies in the complex history and the treaties that have shaped the modern boundaries of the two nations. Some of the key treaties include: 1. The Treaty of Lausanne (1923): This treaty established the borders of the modern Turkish state after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and confirmed the sovereignty of Greece over the majority of the Aegean Islands, except for the Dodecanese Islands which were under Italian control at that time. 2. The Paris Peace Treaties (1947): Following World War II, these treaties transferred sovereignty of the Dodecanese Islands from Italy to Greece. Disputes have arisen over maritime boundaries, airspace, the demilitarization status of certain Greek islands, and over small islets and rock formations, most notably the Imia/Kardak islets in 1996. Tensions have occasionally flared up, leading to political and military standoffs. Nonetheless, these disputes have so far been handled without a full-scale conflict, and both countries have engaged in diplomatic efforts and dialogue to manage the tensions. Turkey generally challenges what it sees as Greek efforts to extend its territorial waters or airspace to what Turkey regards as its detriment. Moreover, disagreements over the continental shelf and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) rights to exploit potential undersea resources, particularly since the discovery of natural gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, have exacerbated these tensions. As of my last update in early 2023, both nations remain active members of NATO and continue to seek ways to address these differences through diplomatic channels and international law despite periodic escalations in rhetoric and tensions."},{"prompt":"ますかっと @jibajiba_watch - twitter - image - illustration - ヒカリブシニャン et 桜ブシニャン - Série : Yo Kai watch - Date de image : 01/03/2009 - Traduction français Fiche technique liste traduction francais liste fiche :","completion":"Désolé, mais je ne peux pas fournir d'informations ou traductions sur des images spécifiques provenant de Twitter, car je n'ai pas la capacité de visualiser des images ou des comptes spécifiques sur les réseaux sociaux. De plus, il est peu probable que l'image mentionnée avec la date du 1er mars 2009 soit correcte, car Twitter n’a pas été largement utilisé pour partager des illustrations de la série Yo-kai Watch à cette époque, et la série elle-même a été diffusée pour la première fois en 2013. Cependant, je peux vous donner quelques informations générales à propos de \\"ヒカリブシニャン\\" (Hikari Bushinyan) et \\"桜ブシニャン\\" (Sakura Bushinyan), deux personnages qui pourraient être liés à la franchise Yo-kai Watch, bien que je ne dispose pas de données à jour après 2023. En français, \\"ヒカリ\\" se traduit par \\"lumière\\" et \\"ブシ\\" pourrait être une traduction de \\"samurai\\" ou \\"guerrier\\" en japonais, tandis que \\"ニャン\\" est un jeu de mots sur \\"nyan\\", le son de miaulement d'un chat en japonais, qui est un thème récurrent dans les noms des Yo-kai qui sont des chats dans la franchise. Donc, \\"ヒカリブシニャン\\" pourrait être traduit par \\"Guerrier Lumineux Chat\\" ou \\"Chat Samurai Lumineux\\". De même, \\"桜\\" signifie \\"cerisier\\" ou \\"sakura\\", ce qui est très lié à la culture japonaise et aux cerisiers en fleurs. Ainsi, \\"桜ブシニャン\\" pourrait être traduit par \\"Guerrier Chat Sakura\\" ou \\"Chat Samurai Sakura\\". Si vous avez une question spécifique sur la série Yo-kai Watch ou sur les fiches techniques des Yo-kai en question, je serais heureux de vous aider avec des informations à jour jusqu'à mon point de connaissances en 2023."},{"prompt":"ますかっと @jibajiba_watch - twitter - image - illustration - ヒカリブシニャン et 桜ブシニャン - Série : Yo Kai watch - Traduction français Fiche technique liste traduction francais (2024) Date de image '","completion":"Je suis désolé pour la confusion, mais je dois clarifier que je n'ai pas la capacité d'accéder au contenu actuel d'Internet, y compris Twitter, pour vérifier des images ou des tweets spécifiques.

Pour ce qui est des fiches techniques de ces personnages, elles détailleraient généralement les compétences, les statistiques et les histoires de fond des Yo-kai.

Le tweet hypothétique que vous pourriez évoquer pourrait contenir une image d'illustration de deux personnages de la série Yo-kai Watch, nommés \\"ヒカリブシニャン\\" (Hikari Bushinyan) et \\"桜ブシニャン\\" (Sakura Bushinyan). Voici une façon possible de traduire ces noms en français qui s'alignerait avec les significations japonaises : - ヒカリブシニャン (Hikari Bushinyan) pourrait être traduit par \\"Bushinyan Lumineux\\" ou \\"Chat Samouraï de Lumière\\". - 桜ブシニャン (Sakura Bushinyan) pourrait être traduit par \\"Bushinyan Sakura\\" ou \\"Chat Samouraï des Cerisiers\\". Si le tweet en question fait référence à des fiches techniques pour ces personnages, alors ce seraient des documents détaillant leurs attributs dans la série, tels que les pouvoirs, les compétences spéciales, les statistiques, l'histoire des personnages, et peut-être comment les obtenir ou les utiliser dans le jeu.
