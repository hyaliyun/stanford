As the function is given by y=2sin x, and we know the sine function has a period of 2pi, we need to deduce the possible value of b-a. Since the range of y=2sin x is [-2,1] which includes the minimum value but does not include the maximum value, it follows that the span of the domain, b-a, must be less than a full period. The sine function reaches its maximum amplitude at sin x = 1. However, for 2sin x, the maximum value achievable before scaling is still sin x = 1, which would correspond to y = 2. Within any interval smaller than the full period, for every point in the range to be covered, the domain must at least span from the point where sin x = -1 to just before sin x goes back to 1. The values of x for which sin x = -1 occur at odd multiples of pi, so at x = (2k+1)pi, with k being any integer. The values for sin x = 0.5 (leading to y=1), a sub-maximum on the original sine curve, occur at x = frac{pi}{6} + 2kpi and x = frac{5pi}{6} + 2kpi. Given the constraint that the range does not include the maximum value 2, the domain in [a,b] must end before 2sin x hits its peak at y=2. The closest we can approach this value from the left (taking the negative value of the sine wave first) is at x = frac{5pi}{6} + 2kpi, not exceeding the point where sin x = 1. Thus, the domain covered from the negative peak to just before returning to the positive peak (without reaching the full amplitude of the sine function) is less than the full periodic length, 2pi. Option D, frac{3pi}{2}, is less than the full period of the sine function and could potentially be the length of the domain. However, the period is symmetric about the x-axis, and to include one extreme value and exclude the other, the domain needs to be asymmetric about the midline, implying that the correct answer must exclude the full half-period, which is pi. Options A (frac{5pi}{6}) and C (frac{7pi}{6}) are both possible since they are asymmetric about the x-axis and are smaller than the full period. This is because they allow us to include the lower bound of the range while excluding the upper bound. Option B (pi) cannot be correct because a stretch of pi starting from a negative peak would include the next positive peak due to the symmetry of the sine wave. Consequently, the value of b-a cannot be boxed{frac{3pi}{2}}."},{"prompt":"What is the molecular weight of some moles of BaF2 if the molecular weight of 6 moles is 1050?","completion":"To find the molecular weight of BaF2, we first need to calculate the molecular weight of one mole of BaF2.

Prove that every set of five points such that no three are collinear and no four are concyclic has exactly four separators.","completion":"1. **Setup the Initial Configuration:** Consider a set of five points ( P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5 ) in the plane such that no three points are collinear and no four points are concyclic (i.e., no single circle can pass through four of these points). 2. **Definition of a Separator:** Recall the definition: - A separator is a circle that passes through exactly three of these five points, contains a fourth point inside, and the fifth point outside the circle. 3. **Use of Inversion:** To simplify our problem, let's employ inversion with respect to a circle. Inversion is a geometric transformation that maps points ( P ) in the plane to new points ( P' ) such that the original circle passing through three points becomes a line, and the arrangement of points inside and outside circles remains consistent. 4. **Label the Points:** Let us denote four of the points as ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). The fifth point will act as the pole of the inversion. 5. **Transform the Point and Line Configuration:** Under inversion with the fifth point acting as the pole, a circle passing through three points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) or ( A, B, ) and ( D ) etc., transforms into a line. The goal is to ensure one point lies inside this circle (line in the transformed space) and one point lies outside. 6. **Analyze Based on Convex Hulls:** We will consider two cases based on the convex hull formed by four points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ): **Case 1: The Convex Hull is a Quadrilateral:** Suppose the convex hull formed by ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) is a quadrilateral: - Here, two diagonals of the quadrilateral will act as lines in the transformed space (inversion). - These lines separate two points inside from two points outside. - Further, two circles that pass through three of them and have the fourth point inside will serve as separators. Therefore, we evaluate the possible separators: - The two diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ). - The remaining two separators will be two circles passing through any three of the four points, say ( (ABC) ) and ( (ACD) ) or ( (BAD) ) and ( (BCD) ). This gives us exactly 4 separators. **Case 2: The Convex Hull is a Triangle (with One Point Inside):** Suppose the convex hull is a triangle, say ( ABC ), with the fourth point ( D ) lying inside the triangle: - In this case, the three lines connecting the internal point ( D ) to any vertex of the triangle ( A, B, ) and ( C ) will act as separators. - Additionally, the circle passing through the triangle vertices ( (ABC) ) with ( D ) inside acts as the fourth separator. This setup also provides exactly 4 separators: - Lines ( DA, DB, ) and ( DC ) - Circle ( (ABC) ) 7. **Conclusion:** From both cases, we see that irrespective of the structure formed by the points under the given constraints, every set of five points has exactly four separators.

After some men leave and 8 women enter the bus in city Y, the number of men and women is equal.

After some men leave and 8 women enter, the number of women becomes 24 + 8 = 32. Since the number of men and women is now equal, there must be 32 men as well.

The pairs could be: ((1, 4)) or ((2, 3)). 6. **Eliminate inconsistent pairs**: Consider the pair ((1, 4)). If these were the grades, the sorted list would be ([1, 4, 4, 5, 5]). However, this means There are three \\"4\\"s, and only two \\"5\\"s. Hence, this contradicts the problem statement that the most frequent grade is .

The problem states that the sales increased from 100 helmets in April to 144 helmets in June, with the same monthly growth rate. Since there are two months from April to June, the sales in June can be represented as 100(1+x)^2 = 144.

After a certain number of rounds, Nick has a total of 30 candies, Tim has a total of 25 candies, and it is known that Tim won a total of 2 rounds. The question is: how many candies should the winner take in each round?","completion":"1. Let's denote the number of candies the winner takes in each round by m, and the number of candies the loser takes by n. Thus, the total number of candies taken in each round is m+n. 2. Given that Nick and Tim, together, have a total of 55 candies: [ 30 + 25 = 55 ] 3. We are told that Tim won 2 rounds. There are two possible scenarios for m+n: m+n=5 or m+n=11. 4. Examine the scenario where m+n=5: - If m+n=5, and considering Tim won 2 rounds while Nick won the others, they would have played 11 rounds in total. - Given m > n > 0, we have the following possibilities: - (m, n) = (4, 1) - (m, n) = (3, 2) - For (m, n) = (4, 1): Tim's candies would be: [ 2 times 4 + 9 times 1 = 8 + 9 = 17 ] This contradicts the given information that Tim has 25 candies. - For (m, n) = (3, 2): Tim's candies would be: [ 2 times 3 + 9 times 2 = 6 + 18 = 24 ] This still does not match the 25 candies Tim has. Hence, m+n=5 is not a viable solution. 5. Next, examine the scenario where m+n=11: - If m+n=11, they would have played 5 rounds in total since Tim won 2 rounds. - The possible pairs (m, n) given m > n > 0 are: [ (m, n) = (10, 1), (9, 2), (8, 3), (7, 4), (6, 5) ] - Since Tim must have 25 candies and won 2 rounds, we derive the equation: [ 2m + 3n = 25 ] Checking each pair: - For (m, n) = (10, 1): [ 2 times 10 + 3 times 1 = 20 + 3 = 23 ] which does not satisfy 2m + 3n = 25. - For (m, n) = (9, 2): [ 2 times 9 + 3 times 2 = 18 + 6 = 24 ] which does not satisfy 2m + 3n = 25. - For (m, n) = (8, 3): [ 2 times 8 + 3 times 3 = 16 + 9 = 25 ] which satisfies the equation 2m + 3n = 25. - For (m, n) = (7, 4): [ 2 times 7 + 3 times 4 = 14 + 12 = 26 which does not satisfy 2m + 3n = 25. - For (m, n) = (6, 5): [ 2 times 6 + 3 times 5 = 12 + 15 = 27 which does not satisfy 2m + 3n = 25. 6.

Since the chord on l cut by the circle M has a length of sqrt{3}, the perpendicular distance from the center to l is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. By the Pythagorean theorem, this distance is also sqrt{1^2 - left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2} = frac{1}{2}, and so we have the equation left|frac{8a-3}{sqrt{8^2 + 6^2}}right| = frac{1}{2}, which simplifies to |8a-3| = 5. Since M is below l, we have 8a-3 > 0, thus 8a-3 = 5, resulting in a = 1. Therefore, the equation of the circle is (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1. (2) Since AC and BC are tangent to the circle, the slopes k_1 and k_2 of lines AC and BC must satisfy the condition that the perpendicular distance from center M to these lines equals the radius, which is 1.

For BC: left|frac{k_2 cdot 0 + t + 6}{sqrt{1 + k_2^2}}right| = 1, resulting in k_2 = frac{1 - (t + 6)^2}{2(t + 6)}. The x-coordinate of point C is obtained by solving the system of equations for lines AC and BC, yielding x = frac{6}{k_1 - k_2}. Since |AB| = 6, the area of triangle ABC is S = frac{1}{2} cdot left| frac{6}{k_1 - k_2} right| cdot 6 = frac{18}{|k_1 - k_2|}.

We know that P(x) = 5 + frac{k}{x} and on the 10th day, Q(10) = 90.

We need to prove the existence of four points among these marked vertices that form the vertices of a trapezoid. 2. **Establishing the parallelism of diagonals with sides:** Let's start by noting that every diagonal in a regular polygon is parallel to one of its sides. This is because the angles between consecutive vertices are all equal, which makes corresponding angles equal. 3. **Explain the pattern of parallel diagonals:** Consider a diagonal (A_i A_j). The diagonals (A_i A_{i+1}, A_{i+1} A_{i+2}, ldots) maintain parallelism due to the regularity. Assume (i < j) and that their difference (j-i) is of the same parity. 4. **Count the number of segments among the 64 points:** The total number of segments among the 64 marked vertices is given by: [ binom{64}{2} = frac{64 cdot 63}{2} = 2016. ] 5. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:** By the Pigeonhole Principle, since there are 2016 segments and 1007 sides of the polygon, we are guaranteed that there are at least ( Biglceil frac{2016}{1007} Bigrceil = 2 ) segments among the marked 64 vertices that must be parallel (in the same direction relative to the polygon's sides). 6. **Forming the trapezoid:** Since we have two pairs of parallel segments, consider these segments as (A_i A_j) and (A_k A_l). These pairs will form a trapezoid as long as the segments are not collinear and offset from each other, which holds because of the relative arrangement in a 2015-sided polygon where exact side alignment doesn't reuse vertices as per set parity condition. 7. **Elimination of the parallelogram possibility:** Verify that a parallelogram cannot form part of this configuration by noting that for a set to be labelled as a parallelogram, an even number of sides is implicitly required (which is not possible here). Thus, the only feasible quadrilateral is a trapezoid since aligning segments directly avoids the repeating vertices giving quadrilateral nature. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The existence of four vertices forming a trapezoid among the marked points is proven.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Meredith drives 5 miles to the northeast, then 15 miles to the southeast, then 25 miles to the southwest, then 35 miles to the northwest, and finally 20 miles to the northeast.

When the road inclined upwards, he rode at 12 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance he covered uphill is ( 12 times 2.5 = 30 ) miles. On the downhill, he rode at 24 miles per hour for 1.5 hours, so the distance he covered downhill is ( 24 times 1.5 = 36 ) miles. We know he walked 8 miles after the tire puncture. The total distance covered is the sum of the distances covered on flat ground, uphill, downhill, and walking, which is equal to 164 miles (the distance from the starting point to the next town). So we have: [ 20T + 30 + 36 + 8 = 164 ] Now, let's solve for ( T ): [ 20T + 74 = 164 ] Subtract 74 from both sides: [ 20T = 164 - 74 ] [ 20T = 90 ] Now, divide both sides by 20 to find ( T ): [ T = frac{90}{20} ] [ T = 4.5 ] So, Alex rode on flat ground for boxed{4.5} hours."},{"prompt":"Martha buys 1 latte for 4.00 every morning, 5 days a week. 3 days a week, she buys an iced coffee for 2.00.

So, her weekly spending on iced coffee is: 3 days * 2.00/day = 6.00/week Her total weekly spending on coffee is: 20.00/week (lattes) + 6.00/week (iced coffee) = 26.00/week To find her annual spending, we multiply her weekly spending by the number of weeks in a year (assuming she buys coffee every week of the year): 26.00/week * 52 weeks/year = 1,352.00/year Now, we know she wants to save 338.00 from her annual coffee spending. Let's subtract that from her current annual spending to find her new target spending: 1,352.00/year - 338.00 = 1,014.00/year To find the percentage by which she wants to cut her coffee spending, we divide the amount she wants to save by her current annual spending and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (338.00 / 1,352.00) * 100 = 25% So, Martha wants to cut her coffee spending by boxed{25%} ."},{"prompt":"rectangle EFGH, we have E=(4,10), F=(196,58), G=(x, 62), for some integer x.

How much did Sonika deposit initially?","completion":"Let's denote the initial amount Sonika deposited as P (the principal), the original rate of interest as R%, and the time period as T years. According to the problem, the simple interest (SI) on the principal P for 3 years at R% is such that: P + SI = Rs. 9200 (1) If the interest rate were 2.5% more, the new rate would be (R + 2.5)%. The new simple interest for the same period would be: P + New SI = Rs. 9800 (2) The formula for simple interest is: SI = (P * R * T) / 100 From equation (1), we can write the simple interest as: SI = 9200 - P From equation (2), the new simple interest with the increased rate is: New SI = 9800 - P The difference between the new simple interest and the original simple interest is the additional amount Sonika would have gotten due to the 2.5% increase in the interest rate, which is Rs. 9800 - Rs. 9200 = Rs. 600. So, we can write: New SI - SI = 600 Substituting the SI and New SI from the above equations, we get: (9800 - P) - (9200 - P) = 600 Simplifying this, we get: 9800 - P - 9200 + P = 600 The P's cancel out, and we are left with: 9800 - 9200 = 600 600 = 600 This confirms our understanding of the difference in interest due to the 2.5% increase. Now, let's calculate the additional interest due to the 2.5% increase for 3 years: Additional SI = (P * 2.5 * 3) / 100 We know that Additional SI is Rs. 600, so: 600 = (P * 2.5 * 3) / 100 Multiplying both sides by 100 to get rid of the denominator, we get: 600 * 100 = P * 2.5 * 3 60000 = 7.5P Now, divide both sides by 7.5 to solve for P: P = 60000 / 7.5 P = 8000 So, Sonika initially deposited Rs. boxed{8000} ."},{"prompt":"Given the function ( f(x) = x^{2} mathrm{e}^{a x} ), where ( a leq 0 ) and ( mathrm{e} ) is the base of the natural logarithm, (I) Discuss the monotonicity of the function ( f(x) ); (II) Find the maximum value of the function ( f(x) ) on the interval ([0, 1]).","completion":"Given the function ( f(x) = x^{2} e^{ax} ), where ( a leq 0 ) and ( e ) is the base of the natural logarithm.

For triangle BCD, similarly, we use the fact that sin C = sin A because opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary: [ S_{BCD} = frac{1}{2} times b times c times sin C = frac{1}{2} times b times c times sin A ] 4. The total area S of quadrilateral ABCD is the sum of the areas of triangle ABD and triangle BCD: [ S = S_{ABD} + S_{BCD} = frac{1}{2} ad sin A + frac{1}{2} bc sin A = frac{1}{2} (ad + bc) sin A ] Thus, we have the first part of the required equality: [ S = frac{ad + bc}{2} sin A ] 5.

This means if a contestant is seated at position ( c_i ), then no contestant can be seated at ( c_{i+4} ). 2. **Grouping Seats:** We can group the seats into 5 residue classes modulo 5: [ begin{aligned} &{c_1, c_6, c_{11}, dots, c_{51}}, &{c_2, c_7, c_{12}, dots, c_{52}}, &{c_3, c_8, c_{13}, dots, c_{53}}, &{c_4, c_9, c_{14}, dots, c_{54}}, &{c_5, c_{10}, c_{15}, dots, c_{55}}. end{aligned} ] Each group contains 11 seats. 3. **Applying the Restriction:** Within each residue class, we need to ensure that no two contestants are seated 4 seats apart. This translates to ensuring that no two consecutive seats in the residue class are both occupied. 4. **Maximizing Occupied Seats:** We can achieve this by alternating between occupied and vacant seats. For example, in a residue class of 11 seats, we can seat contestants as follows: [ O, V, O, V, O, V, O, V, O, V, O ] where ( O ) represents an occupied seat and ( V ) represents a vacant seat. This pattern ensures that no two contestants are 4 seats apart. 5. **Counting the Occupied Seats:** In each residue class, we can occupy 6 seats (since there are 11 seats and we alternate starting with an occupied seat). Therefore, for each of the 5 residue classes, we can seat 6 contestants. 6. **Total Number of Contestants:** The total number of contestants that can be seated is: [ 6 times 5 = 30 ] Conclusion: The maximum number of contestants that can be seated in a single row with the restriction that no two of them are 4 seats apart is (boxed{30})."},{"prompt":"The area of the intersection of a triangle and a circle is 45% of the total area of the diagram.

For simplicity, we first analyze the case ( n geq m ). 1. **Case ( n geq m ):** Firstly, let us note that: [ (m+1)^2 - m = m^2 + 2m + 1 - m = m^2 + m + 1 ] Therefore, for ( n > m+1 ), note that ( n^2 - m ) will be much larger than ( n + m^2 ) because the function ( n^2 ) increases faster than the linear and quadratic terms combined as ( n ) grows. Thus, for ( n > m + 1 ): [ n^2 - m > n + m^2 ] It implies that for such ( n ), ( n^2 - m ) won't divide ( m^2 + n ).

For its complementary chain, the sum is (S_{C'}). - Since (S_C + S_{C'} = 1), it implies one of these sums must be positive, as the total sum of all numbers is positive. 4. **Counting Chains and Complementary Chains:** - There are ( binom{101}{2} = frac{101 times 100}{2} = 5050 ) chains. - Each chain’s sum is either positive or negative except for one case (when the sum is exactly zero). - Since the total sum is 1, the exact zero sum chain does not exist. - Thus, each chain (S_C) being positive has a counterpart chain (S_{C'}) which is negative. 5. **Half of the Chains:** - Out of these 5050 chains, exactly half will have a positive sum, and half will have a negative sum. - Therefore, the number of chains with a positive sum is ( frac{5050}{2} = 2525 ).

The regular pay is straightforward: Regular hours worked = 40 hours Regular rate = 16 per hour Regular pay = Regular hours worked × Regular rate Regular pay = 40 hours × 16/hour Regular pay = 640 For the overtime pay, we need to calculate the overtime rate, which is 75% higher than the regular rate: Overtime rate increase = 75% of 16 Overtime rate increase = 0.75 × 16 Overtime rate increase = 12 So, the overtime rate is: Overtime rate = Regular rate + Overtime rate increase Overtime rate = 16 + 12 Overtime rate = 28 per hour Now we can calculate the overtime pay: Overtime hours worked = Total hours worked - Regular hours worked Overtime hours worked = 57 hours - 40 hours Overtime hours worked = 17 hours Overtime pay = Overtime hours worked × Overtime rate Overtime pay = 17 hours × 28/hour Overtime pay = 476 Finally, we add the regular pay and the overtime pay to get the total compensation: Total compensation = Regular pay + Overtime pay Total compensation = 640 + 476 Total compensation = 1116 The bus driver earned a total of boxed{1116} in compensation for the week."},{"prompt":"Given that the function f(x)=frac{x^2+1}{ax+b} is an odd function on its domain, and f(1)=2. (1) Find the analytical expression of the function f(x); (2) Determine and prove the monotonicity of the function f(x) on (1,+infty).","completion":"**Step-by-Step Solution:** **(1) Finding the Analytical Expression of f(x)** Given that f(x) is an odd function, we know that f(-x) = -f(x). Since it's given that f(-1) = -2, let's find the value of f(1) using the property of odd functions: - Since f(-1) = -2, by the definition of an odd function, we have f(1) = -f(-1) = 2. The function is expressed as f(x) = frac{x^2+1}{ax+b}. We can use the information about the function's value at x = 1 and x = -1: - For x = 1, we substitute into the function: frac{1^2+1}{a(1)+b} = 2 Rightarrow frac{2}{a+b} = 2. - For x = -1, using the fact that f(-1) = -2, we get: frac{(-1)^2+1}{a(-1)+b} = -2 Rightarrow frac{2}{-a+b} = -2. Solving these equations, we find that: begin{align*} frac{2}{a+b} &= 2 Rightarrow a+b = 1, frac{2}{-a+b} &= -2 Rightarrow -a+b = -1. end{align*} Solving this system of equations, we get: begin{align*} a + b &= 1, -a + b &= -1, end{align*} which simplifies to: begin{align*} a &= 1, b &= 0. end{align*} Therefore, the analytical expression of the function f(x) is: f(x) = frac{x^2+1}{1x+0} = x + frac{1}{x}. So, the analytical expression of f(x) is boxed{f(x) = x + frac{1}{x}}. **(2) Proving Monotonicity on (1,+infty)** To prove that f(x) = x + frac{1}{x} is monotonically increasing on (1,+infty), let's consider any two points x_1 and x_2 in (1,+infty) such that x_1 < x_2. We need to show that f(x_1) < f(x_2): f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2}) = left(x_{1} + frac{1}{x_{1}}right) - left(x_{2} + frac{1}{x_{2}}right) = (x_{1} - x_{2}) + left(frac{1}{x_{1}} - frac{1}{x_{2}}right). Since x_1 < x_2, we have x_{1} - x_{2} < 0. Also, because both x_1, x_2 > 1, we can say that frac{1}{x_{1}} - frac{1}{x_{2}} < 0 as well, since the function frac{1}{x} is decreasing for x > 0. This implies: (x_{1} - x_{2}) + left(frac{1}{x_{1}} - frac{1}{x_{2}}right) < 0. Therefore, we have f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2}), proving that f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (1,+infty). Thus, the conclusion is that the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on (1,+infty), which we box as the final statement: boxed{text{The function } f(x) text{ is monotonically increasing on } (1,+infty).}"},{"prompt":"Let g(x) = x^3 3x.

The equation becomes: [ x^3 - 3x = 8 ] [ x^3 - 3x - 8 = 0 ] Using the rational root theorem or synthetic division, we find that x = 2 is a root. Factoring out (x-2) from x^3 - 3x - 8: [ x^3 - 3x - 8 = (x-2)(x^2 + 2x + 4) ] The quadratic x^2 + 2x + 4 has no real roots (since the discriminant b^2 - 4ac = 4 - 16 = -12 < 0). Thus, the only real solution to g(x) = 8 is x = 2. Next, we need to find where g(x) = 2. This leads to: [ x^3 - 3x = 2 ] [ x^3 - 3x - 2 = 0 ] Again, x = 2 is a root. Factoring out (x-2): [ x^3 - 3x - 2 = (x-2)(x^2 + 2x + 1) = (x-2)(x+1)^2 ] Here, x = 2 and x = -1 (double root) are solutions. Continuing, we find where g(x) = -1 for the above solutions.

This means the prize is not in the neighboring box. - If the statement on a box saying \\"The prize is in the neighboring box\\" is the true one, then the prize must indeed be in one of its neighboring boxes. This can only happen if the true statement is on a box adjacent to the box containing the prize. 4. **Position Analysis:** - If the statement \\"The prize is in the neighboring box\\" is the true statement and it must be adjacent to the prize box, the prize box itself must have a false statement. - Boxes with \\"The prize is in the neighboring box\\" statement can only be true if it is next to the prize box. 5. **Finding the Configuration:** - Suppose one of the extreme boxes (the first or the last) contains the prize. Then the box next to it would have to be the one with the true statement \\"The prize is in the neighboring box.\\" However, this would not be possible because then the prize would have to be in the extreme box contradicting that only one statement is true. - Therefore, the prize box cannot be at either end. - If we consider the middle box (the 12th box) having either statement: - Case 1: If the 12th box says \\"The prize is in the neighboring box\\", it must be false since a neighboring box would not contain the prize if the prize is not in the neighboring box (left or right). - Case 2: If the 12th box says \\"There is no prize here\\", it must also be false because in that arrangement, it's not ensuring any other box has a true statement and it guarantees one false statement. 6. **Intermediate Conclusion:** - The statement on the 12th box (\\"The prize is in the neighboring box\\") must be false implying the prize is not exactly adjacent. - Among the remaining boxes, still, all statements but one must be false. Thus, the middle box can't be true to have a false implication and neighbor must state it correctly. 7. **Determining the Correct and Only True Statement:** - Given the falsehood assertion about the neighboring boxes increasing spreading their falsehood, error margins end up central assertive only matching the 12 without direct prize, only dialect remains about the corresponding adjacency made feasible.

Let's break down the solution step by step. **Step 1: Analyze condition p** Given p: |4x-1| leqslant 1, we can solve the inequality by considering the absolute value. This leads to two cases: - 4x - 1 leqslant 1 and - 4x - 1 geqslant -1. Solving these inequalities, we get 4x leqslant 2 and 4x geqslant 0, which simplifies to x leqslant frac{1}{2} and x geqslant 0. Combining these, we find the solution for p as 0 leqslant x leqslant frac{1}{2}. **Step 2: Analyze condition q** Given q: x^2 - (2a+1)x + a(a+1) leqslant 0, we can factor this quadratic inequality to get (x-a)(x-(a+1)) leqslant 0. This tells us that the roots of the quadratic equation are x = a and x = a + 1. By the properties of quadratic equations, the solution to this inequality is a leqslant x leqslant a + 1. **Step 3: Relating neg p and neg q** Given that neg p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for neg q, it implies that p is a sufficient but not necessary condition for q. This means that the range of x satisfying p must be entirely contained within the range of x satisfying q. **Step 4: Determining the range of a** To satisfy the condition that p is a sufficient but not necessary condition for q, we must have: - a leqslant 0 (since x can be as low as 0 in p), - frac{1}{2} leqslant a + 1 (since x can be as high as frac{1}{2} in p). Solving these inequalities, we get a leqslant 0 and a geqslant -frac{1}{2}.

We must find those fractions which are in their lowest terms. To do this, we simplify frac{ab}{99} whenever ab and 99 share common factors. The prime factorization of 99 is 3^2 times 11. We consider: - Count all the numbers from 1 to 99. - Exclude the multiples of both 3 and 11 (since these would already be accounted for when considering pairs where GCD is not 1). Exclusions: - Multiples of 3 from 1 to 99: 33 multiples. - Multiples of 11 from 1 to 99: 9 multiples. - Adjust for multiples of 3 times 11 = 33: Include back 3. Thus, we have total valid numerators: 99 - 33 - 9 + 3 = 60. Therefore, there are potentially 60 different numerators, but since ab range from 01 to 99 and not all might be counted if they are divisible by 3 or 11, we have simplified the total numerators to 60 different possible ones.

Notice that the denominators of these fractions are never zero because the X_{i} (i = 1, 2, ldots, n) are positive random variables. 3. Since X_{i} are identically distributed random variables, the Y_{i} variables are also identically distributed. Consequently, they have the same expected value: [ M(Y_{1}) = M(Y_{2}) = ldots = M(Y_{n}) ] 4. Observe that the sum of all Y_i is equal to 1: [ Y_{1} + Y_{2} + ldots + Y_{n} = 1 ] 5.

This implies we need to show that each term in the expansion is correctly represented. 2. **Step 2: Recognize the Binomial Coefficient**: The binomial coefficient (binom{n}{k}) is defined as the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to the order of selection. This is given by: binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}. 3. **Step 3: Expansion of (x + y)^n**: To expand (x + y)^n, let's consider what happens when we multiply (x + y) by itself n times: (x + y)^n = (x+y)(x+y)cdots(x+y). 4. **Step 4: Combining Terms**: When expanding this product, each term comes from choosing either x or y from each of the n factors. The coefficient of each term (x^k y^{n-k}) in the expansion is precisely the number of ways to select k factors to contribute x and the remaining n-k factors to contribute y. 5. **Step 5: Counting the Number of Ways**: The number of ways to choose these k positions for x out of n positions is exactly given by the binomial coefficient binom{n}{k}. Hence the term x^k y^{n-k} appears binom{n}{k} times in the expansion. 6. **Step 6: Summing All Possible Terms**: Summing over all possible values of k from 0 to n includes all possible terms in the expanded form of ((x+y)^n). Therefore: (x+y)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^{k} y^{n-k}. **Conclusion**: We have shown that the expansion of ((x+y)^n) follows the binomial theorem, where each term's coefficient is counted appropriately by the binomial coefficient binom{n}{k}.

So, to find the remainder, we can multiply the decimal part by y: remainder = 0.1 * y Given that y = 70.00000000000398, we can calculate the remainder as follows: remainder = 0.1 * 70.00000000000398 remainder = 7.00000000000398 Since the remainder must be less than y and it is a positive integer, we can round the result to the nearest whole number if necessary.

For a regular 17-gon: [ R = frac{360^circ}{17} approx 21.18^circ. ] However, for the purposes of this problem, we will keep the exact value: [ R = frac{360}{17} text{ degrees.} ] 3. **Compute L + R:** Adding the lines of symmetry and the smallest rotational angle gives: [ L + R = 17 + frac{360}{17} = frac{289 + 360}{17} = frac{649}{17} = 38.176 text{ (approx)}. ] For exact values, let's keep it as frac{649{17}}. Conclusion: The sum of the number of lines of symmetry and the smallest angle for rotational symmetry for a regular 17-gon is frac{649{17}} which simplifies to 38.176 degrees approximately.

Let ( n = p_1 p_2 cdots p_r ), where each ( p_i ) is a Mersenne prime of the form ( 2^{k_i} - 1 ). 2.

Since ( sigma(n) ) is a power of 2 and ( sigma ) is multiplicative, for any prime ( p ) dividing ( n ), ( sigma(p^{k-1}) ) must also be a power of 2. 2. For a prime ( p ) and integer ( k geq 1 ), we have: [ sigma(p^{k-1}) = frac{p^k - 1}{p - 1} ] 3. We need ( frac{p^k - 1}{p - 1} = 2^m ) for some ( m in mathbb{N} ).

However, ( Phi_q(p) equiv 1 pmod{2} ), which is a contradiction. **Case 2: ( k = 2^q ) for some ( q geq 1 ).** - Since ( 2 mid 2^q ) and ( 4 mid 2^q ), we have: [ Phi_2(p) = p + 1 quad text{and} quad Phi_4(p) = p^2 + 1 ] Both must be powers of 2. Since ( p^2 + 1 > p + 1 ), we have ( p + 1 mid p^2 + 1 ).

To prove this, consider the convex hull of the 5 points. 2. If the convex hull contains more than 3 points, then it must be a convex quadrilateral or pentagon, and the claim is clearly true. 3. Suppose the convex hull is a triangle, say A_1A_2A_3. The remaining points, A_4 and A_5, must lie inside this triangle since no 3 points are collinear. 4. Since A_4 and A_5 are inside the triangle, they must be such that the segment A_4A_5 intersects two sides of the triangle, making the points A_4A_5 and two vertices of the triangle form a convex quadrilateral. Conclusively, we always find 4 points forming the vertices of a convex quadrilateral: [ boxed{} ] (2) Given 4n + 1 points in a plane, each 3 of which are not collinear, show that we can select 4n points among them forming 2n pairs such that the number of crossings (intersections) among the connecting lines of these pairs is at least n. We use mathematical induction to prove this. 1. **Base Case:** Consider n = 1, i.e., 4 times 1 + 1 = 5 points. From part (1), we know that any 5 points with no 3 collinear contain 4 points that form a convex quadrilateral. The two pairs of opposite vertices in this quadrilateral clearly intersect at least at one point. Therefore, for (n = 1), our statement holds: [ boxed{} ] 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that for some integer n, the statement holds true for 4n + 1 points. 3. **Induction Step:** We need to show the statement holds for 4(n+1) + 1 = 4n + 5 points. Consider adding 5 additional points to our set of 4n + 1 points. We know from part (1) that any set of 5 points will include 4 points that form a convex quadrilateral. Let these 4 points be designated vertices forming two intersecting pairs. 4. By the induction hypothesis, among the remaining 4n + 1 points, it is possible to select 4n points forming 2n intersecting pairs with at least n intersections. 5. Thus, adding the two intersecting pairs from the new 5 points, we get that there are now 2n + 2 pairs with at least n + 1 intersections. Therefore, by induction, the statement is true for 4n + 1 points for all n.

The key to solving this problem is to use the method of translating tangent lines in combination with the geometric meaning of derivatives. Find the tangent point coordinates by calculating the derivative of the function, and then use the geometric meaning of the derivative to find the conclusion. This is a medium difficulty problem. **Step-by-step solution:** 1. Let the line parallel to y=x+1 intersect with y=ln x at a tangent point. Then, the slope of the tangent line k=1. 2. Given y=ln x, we have y'= dfrac{1}{x}. 3. By equating the slope of the tangent line to the derivative of the function, we get y'= dfrac{1}{x}=1, which yields x=1. 4. When x=1, y=ln 1=0.

The distance formula for a point to a line is given by: d=dfrac{|Ax+By+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. In this case, the line can be rewritten as y - x - 1 = 0, so A = -1, B = 1, C = -1. 6.

What are the lengths of the sides of these hexagons?","completion":"1. **Identifying Symmetry and Plane Movement:** - We start by considering the line HL passing through two opposite vertices H and L of a regular dodecahedron with edge length a. - Since a regular dodecahedron is symmetric around any of its axes through opposite vertices, rotating it by 120^circ around the HL axis moves it onto itself. 2. **Starting Point and Initial Triangle Intersection:** - Place a plane S perpendicular to HL and move it from point H towards point L. - When S passes through the midpoint between H and L, it intersects the dodecahedron along a set of vertices forming a plane figure. - Initially, as the plane S moves from H towards L, the cross-section formed is triangular. However, continuing this movement, the plane S will eventually intersect some edges of the dodecahedron. 3. **Formation of Hexagonal Intersection:** - As plane S continues moving, it aligns itself such that specific vertices (E, F, G) lie on it, turning the intersection into a hexagonal shape. - We need to verify if the hexagon formed is regular. This will occur precisely when the distances between successive intersection points on the edges of the dodecahedron are equal. 4. **Equation and Verification of Equality of Sides:** - Suppose the plane S intersects the edges EA and ED at some internal points. Let these intersection points divide EA and ED in the ratio k. Hence, each side c_1 and c_2 of the hexagon will be: - Given the edge a of the dodecahedron, a diagonal in the pentagonal face spanning two vertices can be expressed as frac{a}{2}(1+sqrt{5}). - Therefore, c_1=k cdot frac{a}{2}(1+sqrt{5}). - Considering the trapezoid formed by vertices BCDE, with BE as one side; we see that c_2 can be written as: [ c_2 = frac{a}{2}(1+sqrt{5}) - k cdot frac{a}{2}(1-sqrt{5}) ] - Setting c_1 = c_2: [ k cdot frac{a}{2}(1+sqrt{5}) = frac{a}{2}(1+sqrt{5}) - k cdot frac{a}{2}(1-sqrt{5}) ] - Solving for k, we get: [ k = frac{5 + sqrt{5}}{10} ] - Substituting k back, we find: [ c_1 = c_2 = frac{a}{10}(5 + 3sqrt{5}) ] 5. **Special Cases and Moving Plane Through the Dodecahedron’s Center:** - If the plane S passes through point A initially, it might not divide the dodecahedron into a regular hexagon. Further movement through the dodecahedron's center O ensures that such a symmetry splits edges evenly: [ b_1 = b_2 = frac{1}{2}left(a + frac{a}{2}(1 + sqrt{5})right) = frac{a}{4}(3 + sqrt{5}) ] 6. **Summarizing and Counting Planes:** - Beyond the plane S passing through H and L, there are two additional symmetrical configurations obtained by more such divisions, leading to three cases of intersections per axis. - Each axis (such as HL) uniquely corresponds to 10 such axes within the dodecahedron. - Therefore, the total number of planes is: [ 3 times 10 = 30 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{30} ] Each of the hexagonal sides in such synchronized configurations measures (frac{a}{4}(3 + sqrt{5}))."},{"prompt":"A company sells a brand of cars in two locations, A and B, with profits (in units of 10,000 yuan) of L_1 = 5.06x 0.15x^2 and L_2 = 2x, respectively, where x is the sales volume (in units).

Substituting the initial conditions (x(0) = 1) and (x'(0) = -1): [ mathcal{L}{x''(t)} = p^2 X(p) - p cdot 1 - (-1) = p^2 X(p) - p + 1. ] Also, we know: [ mathcal{L}{x(t)} = X(p), ] and the Laplace transform of (cos(2t)) is given by: [ mathcal{L}{cos(2t)} = frac{p}{p^2 + 4}. ] Therefore, the transformed differential equation becomes: [ p^2 X(p) - p + 1 + 4X(p) = frac{p}{p^2 + 4}. ] Simplifying, we get: [ (p^2 + 4)X(p) - p + 1 = frac{p}{p^2 + 4}. ] 2. **Solve for (X(p))**: Combine the terms involving (X(p)): [ (p^2 + 4)X(p) = frac{p}{p^2 + 4} + p - 1. ] Simplify the right-hand-side to get a common denominator: [ (p^2 + 4)X(p) = frac{p(p^2 + 4)}{(p^2 + 4)^2} + frac{p^2 + 4(p - 1)}{p^2 + 4}. ] Continue simplifying, noting that: [ X(p) = frac{p}{(p^2 + 4)^2} + frac{p}{p^2 + 4} - frac{1}{p^2 + 4}. ] 3. **Take the inverse Laplace transform**: Determine the inverse Laplace transform for each term. We know: [ mathcal{L}^{-1}left{frac{p}{(p^2 + 4)^2}right} = frac{t sin(2t)}{4}, ] [ mathcal{L}^{-1}left{frac{p}{p^2 + 4}right} = cos(2t), ] [ mathcal{L}^{-1}left{frac{1}{p^2 + 4}right} = frac{sin(2t)}{2}. ] Hence, [ x(t) = frac{1}{4} t sin(2t) + cos(2t) - frac{1}{2} sin(2t). ] 4. **Verify the initial conditions**: Compute ( x(0) ) and ( x'(0) ): [ x(0) = frac{1}{4} cdot 0 cdot sin(0) + cos(2 cdot 0) - frac{1}{2} sin(2 cdot 0) = 1, ] [ x'(0) = frac{d}{dt} left(frac{1}{4} t sin(2t) + cos(2t) - frac{1}{2} sin(2t)right) biggr|_{t=0}. ] Evaluating derivatives at (t = 0): [ x'(t) = frac{1}{4} left( sin(2t) + 2t cos(2t) right) - 2 sin(2t) - cos(2t) = -1. ] Therefore, the solution satisfies the initial conditions as well. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{x(t) = frac{1}{4} t sin(2t) + cos(2t) - frac{1}{2} sin(2t)}. ]"},{"prompt":"f m and n are two different lines, and alpha and beta are two different planes, then the correct statement among the following is ( ) A: If m parallel alpha, m subset beta, alpha cap beta = n, then m parallel n B: If m parallel alpha, n subset alpha, then m parallel n C: If m parallel alpha, n parallel alpha, then m parallel n D: If alpha cap beta = m, m perp n, then n perp alpha","completion":"According to the theorem on the property of line-plane parallelism, \\"If a line is parallel to a plane, then any plane that passes through this line intersects with the plane along a line that is parallel to the original line.\\" Therefore, option A is correct.

This means that for the digit c, we have two possibilities: c = 0 or c = 5. 3. Next, we consider the constraints on the other digits. For the digit a, it can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it cannot be 0 as it is the leading digit of the number). Therefore, a has 9 possible values: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 4. The digit b can be any digit from 0 to 9 because there are no restrictions provided for b. Thus, b has 10 possible values. 5. Calculating the total number of such numbers involves multiplying the number of choices for each digit: - Choices for c: 2 - Choices for a: 9 - Choices for b: 10 6. Therefore, we calculate the total number of desired numbers as follows: [ text{Total numbers} = 2 times 9 times 10 = 180 ] 7.

Show that there exists a positive integer M such that |Mlambda^{300}|<4^{100} . *Proposed by Evan Chen*","completion":"1. Given the equation lambda = lambda^{2/3} + 1, we can rewrite it in terms of lambda^{1/3}. Let x = lambda^{1/3}. Then the equation becomes: [ x^3 = x^2 + 1 ] This simplifies to: [ x^3 - x^2 - 1 = 0 ] Thus, x is a root of the polynomial x^3 - x^2 - 1 = 0. 2. By Descartes' rule of signs, the polynomial x^3 - x^2 - 1 = 0 has exactly one positive real root. Let's denote this root by x_1. We need to show that x_1 > 1.44. 3. To approximate x_1, we can use numerical methods or bounds. For simplicity, we assume that x_1 > 1.44 based on the problem statement. 4. The polynomial x^3 - x^2 - 1 = 0 has three roots: one real root x_1 and two complex conjugate roots z and overline{z}. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is given by: [ x_1 cdot z cdot overline{z} = -(-1) = 1 ] Since z and overline{z} are complex conjugates, their magnitudes are equal, and we have: [ |z| = |overline{z}| = frac{1}{sqrt{x_1}} ] 5. Given that x_1 > 1.44, we have: [ |z| = frac{1}{sqrt{x_1}} < frac{1}{sqrt{1.44}} = frac{1}{1.2} ] 6. We need to consider the magnitudes of z^{900} and overline{z}^{900}. Since |z| < frac{1}{1.2}, we have: [ |z^{900}| = |z|^{900} < left(frac{1}{1.2}right)^{900} ] Since 1.2^9 > 5, we have: [ left(frac{1}{1.2}right)^{900} < left(frac{1}{5}right)^{100} = 5^{-100} ] 7. Therefore, the magnitudes of z^{900} and overline{z}^{900} are both less than 5^{-100}. Their sum, being the sum of two complex conjugates, has a magnitude less than: [ 2 cdot 5^{-100} < 4^{-100} ] 8. The expression lambda^{300} + z^{900} + overline{z}^{900} is an integer because it is a sum of the form x_1^{300} + z^{900} + overline{z}^{900}, where x_1 = lambda^{1/3}. 9. Since z^{900} + overline{z}^{900} has a magnitude less than 4^{-100}, it follows that lambda^{300} is within 4^{-100} of some integer M.

We know that there are four triangular faces and one square base. Each triangular face has an area that is half the area of the square base.

Benjamin counted 17 billboards in the first hour and 20 in the second hour, so let's add those up: Billboards counted in first two hours = 17 + 20 Billboards counted in first two hours = 37 Now we subtract the number of billboards seen in the first two hours from the total number of billboards they should have seen in three hours to find out how many were seen in the third hour: Billboards seen in third hour = Total billboards - Billboards counted in first two hours Billboards seen in third hour = 60 - 37 Billboards seen in third hour = 23 Benjamin counted boxed{23} billboards in the third hour."},{"prompt":"A total of 19 teams participate in a singleelimination basketball tournament.

(1) If a=2, find set B; (2) If A=B, find the value of the real number a.","completion":"(1) When a = 2, the function is y = log(x). The inequality (x-2)(x-7)<0 is satisfied for x values between the roots, that is, within the interval (2, 7). Hence, set B = {x | 2 < x < 7}. (2) By the problem statement, we know B = {x | 2 < x < 3a+1} due to the definition of set A. Now let's consider all the cases: - If 2 < 3a+1, i.e., when a > frac{1}{3}, then A = {x | 2 < x < 3a+1}. Since A=B, this case is not possible because the sets would then not be equal. - If 2 = 3a+1, it is clearly not consistent with the condition that A = B as it implies that A has no elements. - If 2 > 3a+1, i.e., when a < frac{1}{3}, then A = {x | 3a+1 < x < 2}. Given A = B, we want to find a such that the intervals for A and B are identical, which means 3a+1 must equal 2. Solving 3a+1=2, we find a=frac{1}{3}. However, this contradicts the condition a < frac{1}{3}. So we need to correct this. We are looking for a common interval for A and B, which gives us the system of inequalities: [2 < 3a+1 < a^2+1] [2 < a^2+1] [3a+1 < a^2+1] From the second inequality, since the square of any real number is greater than or equal to 0, this inequality is always true. The third inequality simplifies to 3a < a^2, which implies a^2 - 3a > 0, or a(a - 3) > 0. Solving this, we get that a > 3 or a < 0. Since the value of a must satisfy both a > 3 and a < 0, which is not possible, we find that there is no solution if 3a+1 < a^2+1. In conclusion, there are three constraints on a that have to be simultaneously fulfilled: a < frac{1}{3}, a > 3, and a < 0. There are no real numbers that satisfy all three conditions, meaning there are no solutions for this case, and our analysis of the inequality 2 > 3a+1 was flawed. Let's revise it: Revising the analysis, we should instead solve for the interval for A = {x | 3a+1 < x < 2} given that a < frac{1}{3}. Thus, we want to equate the endpoints of A and B, which gives us a linear system: [2 = 2a] [3a+1 = a^2+1] Solving 2 = 2a we immediately get a = 1, but this contradicts our earlier conclusion that a < frac{1}{3}. Hence, the only consistent case is when the endpoints of the intervals are reversed, equating 2 with a^2 + 1 and 2a with 3a + 1. This results in the following system: [2 = a^2 + 1] [2a = 3a + 1] Solving the system: 1. From 2 = a^2 + 1, subtracting 1 from both sides, we get a^2 = 1 which implies that a = 1 or a = -1. 2. From 2a = 3a + 1, subtracting 2a from both sides, we get 0 = a + 1, giving us a = -1. The only value that satisfies both equations is therefore a = -1.

So, 289x^2 = 105x^2, and simplifying gives x^2 = 1.

The cost of one pair of boots is 84 / 2 = 42. Now, we need to find the ratio of the cost of a pair of boots to the amount they had left before adding their own money. The cost of a pair of boots is 42, and they had 14 left. The ratio is 42 (cost of boots) : 14 (amount left), which simplifies to 42/14 = 3.

This step ensures that the number of balls for each color is in ascending order. It's important to have this order to analyze the problem systematically. 2. **Checking if Enough Balls of Any Color Exist**: We need to ensure that there is at least one color with ( m ) or more balls. If ( n_k < m ), where ( n_k ) is the number of balls of the color with the greatest abundance, then it is impossible to fulfill the condition of having ( m ) balls of any single color. In this case, there is no solution. 3. **Finding the Necessary Number of Draws**: We want to determine how many draws are required to ensure we obtain ( m ) balls of the same color. To achieve this, we find the smallest index ( s ) such that ( n_s geq m ). Let's break down the formula for the required number of draws: The formula is: [ 1 + (bar{m}-1)(k-s+1) + sum_{i<s} n_i ] where: - ( bar{m} ) is interpreted as ( m ), - ( s ) is the smallest index such that ( n_s geq m ). 4. **Explanation of Each Term in the Formula**: - **The term ( 1 )**: The first term ensures that we start by drawing at least one ball. - **The term ( (bar{m}-1)(k-s+1) )**: Let's understand this part in detail. If we need ( m ) balls of the same color, after picking the first ball, it can belong to any color. The worst-case scenario is that the ( m-1 ) balls drawn subsequently do not constitute the complete set of ( m ) balls of any one color. Given that we have ( k-s+1 ) colors that have at least ( m ) balls, the worst-case draw sequence would involve these multiple colors in such a way to approach ( m ) without completing ( m ) balls of any one color. - **The term ( sum_{i<s} n_i )**: Next, consider all colors that have fewer than ( m ) balls (i.e., ( n_i < m ) for ( i < s )). We need to include all such balls since they potentially reduce the count breakdown among balls satisfying ( n_i geq m ). By combining these parts of the formula, we provide an upper bound for the number of draws required. # Conclusion: Thus, the smallest number of draws necessary for getting ( m ) balls of the same color from an urn containing balls of ( k ) different colors with ( n_i ) balls of the ( i )-th color is: [ boxed{1 + (m-1)(k-s+1) + sum_{i<s} n_i} ] where ( s ) is the smallest index such that ( n_s geq m )."},{"prompt":"( 0.0077 ) ( 3.6 ) / ( 0.04 ) ( 0.1 ) ( 0.007 ) = some_number.

According to the property of a parabola, the distance from a point on the parabola to the focus is equal to its distance to the directrix. Using this property, we can find the result. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. Since the distance from point M to the focus is 3, the distance from point M to the directrix is also 3. 2. The directrix of a standard parabola is given by the equation x = -a, where a is the distance from the focus to the directrix. In this case, the directrix is x = -1 (assuming the focus is at (1, 0) and a = 1). 3. Therefore, we have 1 + x_M = 3, where x_M is the x-coordinate of point M. Solving for x_M, we find x_M = 2. 4. The distance from point M to the x-axis is the absolute value of its y-coordinate. However, since we don't know the y-coordinate of point M, we need to use the parabola's equation to find it. 5. Assuming the parabola opens to the right (since the focus is to the right of the directrix), its equation is (y - k)^2 = 4a(x - h), where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola. In this case, the vertex is at (0, 0), so the equation becomes y^2 = 4x. 6. Substituting x_M = 2 into the equation, we find y_M = pm sqrt{4 cdot 2} = pm 2.

The key insight lies in understanding the distribution of coins across the 41 parts. 4. **Derivation of the Maximum Coins:** Consider the largest part in each step: - Initially 1987 coins are split into 2 parts. The largest part could be up to ( frac{1987}{2} ) but actually slightly less because it includes remainders. - Subsequent splittings continue similarly. By implementing the principle that in each step the first selected part is picked to be as large as possible, we can focus on obtaining the largest theoretical possible share before anyone else interferes. 5. **Ensuring Robust Share:** Using the binary/logarithmic division concept, each robber guarantees they get at least: [ leftlceil frac{1987}{41} rightrceil = leftlceil 48.46 rightrceil = 49 text{ coins} ] This is derived since with 41 parts, each part on average holds ( frac{1987}{41} approx 48.46 ).

Grapes: 8 kg at 70 per kg Cost of grapes = 8 kg * 70/kg = 560 2. Mangoes: 8 kg at €55 per kg Cost of mangoes in euros = 8 kg * €55/kg = €440 3. Oranges: 5 kg at £40 per kg Cost of oranges in pounds = 5 kg * £40/kg = £200 4.

Grapes: 10% discount on 560 Discount on grapes = 10% of 560 = 0.10 * 560 = 56 Final cost of grapes = 560 - 56 = 504 2. Mangoes: 5% tax on 506 Tax on mangoes = 5% of 506 = 0.05 * 506 = 25.30 Final cost of mangoes = 506 + 25.30 = 531.30 3.

If the quantity sold remains the same, the total sales will decrease by 20%.

The quantity of type B bikes purchased should not exceed twice the quantity of type A bikes. How should the quantities of the two types of bikes be arranged to maximize profit after selling this batch of bikes?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Selling Price per Type A Bike This Year Given that the total sales decrease by 20% when the selling price per bike is 400 yuan less, and assuming the quantity sold remains the same, we can set up an equation to find the selling price per type A bike this year (x yuan). The equation is derived from the information that the total sales of type A bikes last year was 50,000 yuan, and this year, with a 400 yuan decrease in selling price per bike, the total sales will decrease by 20%. Thus, we have: [ frac{50000}{x + 400} = frac{50000 times (1 - 20%)}{x} ] Simplifying the equation: [ frac{50000}{x + 400} = frac{50000 times 0.8}{x} ] [ frac{50000}{x + 400} = frac{40000}{x} ] Cross-multiplying to solve for x: [ 50000x = 40000(x + 400) ] [ 50000x = 40000x + 16000000 ] [ 10000x = 16000000 ] [ x = 1600 ] After checking, x = 1600 is indeed a root of the original equation and satisfies the problem conditions. Therefore, the selling price per type A bike this year is boxed{x = 1600} yuan. Part 2: Maximizing Profit for the New Batch of Bikes Given the constraints for purchasing a new batch of 60 bikes, where the quantity of type B bikes should not exceed twice the quantity of type A bikes, we let m represent the number of type A bikes purchased. The inequality representing the constraint is: [ 60 - m leqslant 2m ] Solving for m: [ 60 leqslant 3m ] [ m geqslant 20 ] The profit, w, from selling this batch of bikes is calculated as: [ w = (1600 - 1100)m + (2000 - 1400)(60 - m) ] [ w = 500m + 600(60 - m) ] [ w = 500m + 36000 - 600m ] [ w = -100m + 36000 ] Since the coefficient of m in the profit equation is negative (-100 < 0), the profit decreases as m increases. Therefore, to maximize profit, we choose the smallest possible value for m that satisfies the inequality, which is m = 20.

We need to determine whether the equality of sides and the equality of angles in a polygon are independent properties. 2. Consider a pentagon (five-sided polygon) to investigate these properties. We'll analyze whether knowing certain properties automatically implies the other properties. 3. Let’s denote the properties as follows: - Property 1: All sides of the pentagon are equal. - Property 2: All angles of the pentagon are equal. 4. Observe that if a pentagon has all sides equal (Property 1) and all angles equal (Property 2), it is a regular pentagon. In this case, the conditions are mutually dependent. 5. However, if we consider only sides (Property 1) or only angles (Property 2), without imposing the regularity condition, these properties seem independent. 6. Now, let’s analyze possible cases: - **Case 1**: If a pentagon has all sides equal but angles are not equal, it’s possible for a non-regular pentagon to exist. - **Case 2**: If a pentagon has all angles equal but sides are not equal, a non-regular pentagon exists which also satisfies this condition. 7. Notice that for arbitrary polygons, just knowing the equality of sides or angles does not necessarily infer the other property's equality. This shows these properties are independent for a general polygon. 8. In a pentagon: - Having all sides equal does not imply all angles are equal unless we specify regularity (Property 1 alone does not imply Property 2). - Having all angles equal does not imply all sides are equal unless we specify regularity (Property 2 alone does not impact Property 1). 9. However, in a pentagon, combining Property 1 and Property 2 will naturally imply regularity, which aligns with the assertion from the reference solution where pairs of properties lead to a third inferred property. # Conclusion: From the analysis of a pentagon, we conclude that the equality of sides and angles in a polygon are indeed independent properties separately, but together they imply regularity. Thus, these properties are not completely independent, as each pair of properties in a pentagon implies the third one naturally follows. boxed{text{No, for all polygons, the properties of side equality and angle equality are not completely independent.}}"},{"prompt":"A train has a certain speed.

This implies that the interval is symmetric with respect to 0, leading to the equation 2a-1+3-a=0. Solving this equation for a gives: [2a-1+3-a=0 implies a=-2.] 2. **Determine the value of b:** Given that f(x) is an odd function, we have the property that f(-x) = -f(x). Applying this to the given function, we get: [(-x)^3 + bx^2 - x + x^3 + bx^2 + x = 0.] Simplifying, we find that the terms involving x^3 and x cancel out, leaving us with 2bx^2 = 0. Since this must hold for all x, we conclude that b=0. 3. **Simplify the function f(x):** With b=0, the function simplifies to f(x) = x^3 + x. The domain of f(x), given the values of a and b, is [2(-2)-1, 3-(-2)] = [-5, 5]. 4. **Analyze the inequality f(2x-1) + f(x-b) > 0:** With b=0, this becomes f(2x-1) + f(x) > 0. Since f(x) is odd, we have f(-x) = -f(x), leading to f(2x-1) > f(-x). 5. **Monotonicity of f(x):** The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 3x^2 + 1, which is always positive for all x in the domain [-5, 5]. This means f(x) is monotonically increasing on this interval. 6. **Solve the inequality -5 leqslant -x < 2x-1 leqslant 5:** This inequality stems from the monotonicity of f(x) and the comparison f(2x-1) > f(-x). Solving it for x gives: [-5 leqslant -x < 2x-1 leqslant 5 implies frac{1}{3} < x leqslant 3.] Therefore, the solution set of the given inequality f(2x-1) + f(x-b) > 0 is boxed{left(frac{1}{3}, 3right]}."},{"prompt":"Let ( ABCD ) be a convex quadrilateral with no parallel sides.

Define points E and F such that E is the intersection point of the lines AB and DC, and F is the intersection point of the lines BC and AD. We need to prove that the quadrilateral ABCD is circumscribed (i.e., there exists an incircle tangent to all four sides) if and only if ED + BF = DF + BE. Necessity: Assume ABCD is a circumscribed quadrilateral. Let the tangents drawn from points A, B, C, D, E, and F to the incircle be denoted as a, b, c, d, e, and f respectively. Given that ABCD is circumscribed, we have: [ AB + CD = AD + BC ] From the lengths of the tangents, we have: [ AB = a + b, quad BC = b + c, quad CD = c + d, quad AD = d + a ] Thus, [ (a + b) + (c + d) = (d + a) + (b + c) ] which simplifies to an identity. Now, compute the expressions for ED, BF, DF, and BE using the tangent lengths: [ ED = e - d, quad BF = b + f, quad DF = f - d, quad BE = b + e ] Adding these expressions: [ ED + BF = (e - d) + (b + f) ] [ DF + BE = (f - d) + (b + e) ] By rearranging, both expressions clearly equal: [ ED + BF = e - d + b + f = f - d + b + e = DF + BE ] Thus, we have: [ ED + BF = DF + BE ] Sufficiency: Assume the equation ED + BF = DF + BE holds. This implies: [ (e - d) + (b + f) = (f - d) + (b + e) ] Simplifying this: [ e - d + b + f = f - d + b + e ] Thus, we can rearrange the terms to get: [ e - d = e - d ] which is trivially true. To prove that the angle bisectors of angle BEC, angle BFA, and angle ABC intersect at a single point, it is implied that ABCD has an incircle centered at this intersection point: 1. Since the pairwise sums of opposite sides being equal (ED + BF = DF + BE) suggests the possible existence of an incircle, by Pitot's Theorem for circumscribed quadrilaterals, ABCD must indeed be circumscribed. Thus, the intersection point of the angle bisectors ensures the occurrence of the incenter equidistant to all the sides, confirming that ABCD is circumscribed.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 57.6 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 57.6 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 57600 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 16 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the distance the train travels in 25 seconds, which is the time it takes to cross the bridge. Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 16 m/s * 25 s Distance = 400 m This distance is the combined length of the train and the bridge. To find the length of the train, we subtract the length of the bridge from the total distance.

Finally, the water level is gradually rising at a rate of 0.5 meters per hour. Calculate the total distance rowed by the man in this scenario, taking into account the effect of the river current, wind, and water level change.","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. The man's rowing speed in still water is 8 kmph. 2. The river current is 3.5 kmph. 3. The wind reduces his effective speed by 1.5 kmph on the way there and increases it by 1.5 kmph on the way back. 4. The water level change does not directly affect his speed, so we can ignore it for the calculation of distance. First, we need to calculate the man's effective speed going to the place and coming back. Going to the place: - His speed in still water is 8 kmph. - The river current is against him, so we subtract 3.5 kmph. - The wind is also against him, so we subtract another 1.5 kmph. Effective speed going to the place = 8 kmph - 3.5 kmph - 1.5 kmph = 3 kmph Coming back: - His speed in still water is 8 kmph. - The river current is with him, so we add 3.5 kmph. - The wind is also with him, so we add another 1.5 kmph. Effective speed coming back = 8 kmph + 3.5 kmph + 1.5 kmph = 13 kmph Now, let's denote the distance to the place as D km. The total time taken for the round trip is 2 hours. Time taken to go to the place = Distance / Speed = D / 3 kmph Time taken to come back = Distance / Speed = D / 13 kmph The sum of these times is 2 hours: D/3 + D/13 = 2 To solve for D, we find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 39: (13D + 3D) / 39 = 2 16D / 39 = 2 16D = 2 * 39 16D = 78 D = 78 / 16 D = 4.875 km So, the distance to the place is 4.875 km.

For our problem, n=9 (5 boys + 4 girls) and k=3 (the number of people to be chosen), so we have: binom{9}{3} = frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = frac{9!}{3!6!} = frac{9 times 8 times 7}{3 times 2 times 1} = 84 2. **Arrangement of the Selected Individuals**: After selecting 3 people, we need to arrange them in a row.

This means the solution set for |x-2| < a is empty, which trivially satisfies the given necessary condition since an empty set is contained in any set, including (-2, 1]. - When a > 0, the inequality |x-2| < a can be rewritten by removing the absolute value, leading to two inequalities: 2-a < x < 2+a. This means the solution set for x is the open interval (2-a, 2+a). 3. **Comparing the solution set with the necessary condition**: - For the interval (2-a, 2+a) to be contained in (-2, 1], we need 2-a geq -2 and 2+a leq 1. Solving these inequalities gives us: - From 2-a geq -2, we get a leq 4. - From 2+a leq 1, we get a leq -1. - However, upon closer inspection, it's clear that there's a mistake in the original solution's analysis for a > 0. The correct approach should recognize that for (2-a, 2+a) to be a subset of (-2, 1], it must be that 2-a is at least -2 (which is always true for positive a), but more critically, 2+a cannot exceed 1, leading to a leq -1. This condition cannot be met for a > 0. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that no positive a can satisfy the condition that (2-a, 2+a) subset (-2, 1]. 4. **Conclusion**: - The only values of a that satisfy the given necessary condition are those where the solution set of |x-2| < a is empty, which corresponds to a leqslant 0.

By the antiparallelism property, (TA) is tangent to Gamma. This can also be established by angle chasing to show that the angles made by lines intersecting at (TA) and touching Gamma are congruent. 4. **Properties of (MD) and (ME)**: Note that (MD) and (ME) are tangents to Gamma since the circle with diameter [BC] has M as its center and passes through D and E.

Consider the grid points as coordinates ((x_i, y_i)), where (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The midpoint of any two points ((x_i, y_i)) and ((x_j, y_j)) (where (i neq j)) will be [ left( frac{x_i + x_j}{2}, frac{y_i + y_j}{2} right). ] For this midpoint to also be a grid point, both (frac{x_i + x_j}{2}) and (frac{y_i + y_j}{2}) must be integers. This implies that (x_i + x_j) and (y_i + y_j) must both be even numbers. Let us focus on the parities (even or odd nature) of the coordinates of the points. Each coordinate (x_i) and (y_i) can be either even (E) or odd (O). There are therefore four possible parity combinations for any point: (E, E), (E, O), (O, E), (O, O). According to the pigeonhole principle, if we categorize five points into four possible parity categories, at least two points must fall into the same category. This means at least two of the points share the same parity type for both their (x) and (y) coordinates. Let these two points be ((x_a, y_a)) and ((x_b, y_b)) both with the same parity. Therefore, 1. If ((x_a, y_a)) and ((x_b, y_b)) are both either (E, E), (E, O), (O, E), or (O, O), then: - (x_a + x_b) is even since the sum of two even or two odd numbers is even. - (y_a + y_b) is even for the same reason. Thus, the midpoint [ left( frac{x_a + x_b}{2}, frac{y_a + y_b}{2} right) ] will have integer coordinates, implying it lies on a grid point. Therefore, we have demonstrated that among any five points marked at the vertices of a rectangular grid, there must be at least two points such that the midpoint of the segment joining them is also a grid point.

So, the total number of ways to select 2 members from 9 is: C(9, 2) = 9! / [2! * (9 - 2)!] = 9! / (2! * 7!) = (9 * 8) / (2 * 1) = 72 / 2 = 36 ways.

Since the total amount removed is 9 liters, we have: 7x + 5x = 9 12x = 9 x = 9/12 x = 3/4 So, 7x = 7 * (3/4) = 21/4 = 5.25 liters of A are removed, and 5x = 5 * (3/4) = 15/4 = 3.75 liters of B are removed.

By examining the sign of g'(x), we can see: - For x in (0,1), g'(x) < 0. - For x in (1, +infty), g'(x) > 0. This means that g(x) has a minimum value at x = 1. We thus have: g(1) = 1 - frac{ln(1)}{1} = 1. Therefore, a + 1 must be less than this minimum value; thus, a < 0.

For f(3), we have to find the product of all consecutive positive integers between 4 and 3^2 (which is 9), inclusive. So, f(3) = 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9. For g(3), we have to find the product of the squares of all consecutive positive integers between a certain number (let's call it m) and 3, inclusive. So, g(3) = m^2 * (m+1)^2 * ... * 3^2.

Since we want the exponent of 2 in f(3)/g(3) to be 4, and we already have an exponent of 6 from f(3), g(3) must contribute an exponent of 2 to cancel out the excess, leaving us with 4.

We need to test which one actually corresponds to an extreme value at x = 1. First, let's consider (a, b) = (-3, 3). The derivative becomes f'(x) = 3(x - 1)^2 geq 0, which means that the function f(x) is either at a minimum or maximum for x geq 1, but since it doesn't change sign around x = 1, there is no extreme value at this point.

Here, f'(x) changes sign from negative to positive as x increases through 1, which means that there's a minimum at x = 1. This is consistent with the problem statement, so we accept this pair.

When B (with 0 coins) makes a move, the coins do not change: [ (0, 0, 1) rightarrow (0, 0, underline{1}) ] 9. When C (with 1 coin) makes a move, they discard 1 coin: [ (0, 0, 1) rightarrow (underline{0}, 0, 0) ] Conclusion: [ boxed{(underline{0}, 0, 0)} ] Part (b) We need to show that any stable position has a total of 4n coins for some integer n. Suppose (underline{a}, b, c) is a stable position where A is the next to move. After three moves, the position must revert to (underline{a}, b, c). Let's analyze these steps: 1. A's move: Since the position must remain unchanged after three moves, a must be even. Let a = 2n. Half of these a coins will be passed to B, and A will keep the other half: [ (underline{2n}, b, c) rightarrow (n, underline{n + b}, c) ] Since (n + b) must be even to allow B to split the coins equally, let b = n. Thus, we get: [ (n, n, underline{n+c}) ] 2. B's move: Splitting n + c coins (since n + c must be even), we need to ensure c = n: [ (n, n, underline{n+c}) rightarrow (n, n, underline{2n}) ] 3. C's move: When they split 2n coins evenly, each keeps n: [ (n, n, 2n) rightarrow (underline{2n}, n, n) ] We conclude that any stable position must be of the form (underline{2n}, n, n) where there are 4n coins in total. Conclusion: [ boxed{4n} ] Part (c) To find the minimum number of coins needed to form a position that is neither stable nor eventually leading to (underline{0}, 0, 0): Consider the position (underline{3}, 4, 2): 1. When A (with 3 coins) makes a move, they discard 1 coin: [ (underline{3}, 4, 2) rightarrow (2, underline{4}, 2) ] 2. When B (with 4 coins) makes a move, they split the coins evenly: [ (2, 4, 2) rightarrow (2, 2, underline{4}) ] 3. When C (with 4 coins) makes a move, they split the coins evenly: [ (2, 2, 4) rightarrow (underline{2}, 2, 2) ] The configuration (2, 2, 2) is stable by the previous analysis, leading to 4n = 8. Considering we are seeking the minimum configuration that is neither stable nor eventually leads to (underline{0}, 0, 0), the smallest number of such coins is 9 since configurations with less than 9 will either be stable or eventually lead to zero.

Observe the behavior of the coefficients of the polynomial ( P_a(x) ) at ( x^k ): - The sign of the coefficient of ( x^k ) in ( P_a(x) ) matches the sign of the ( k )-th derivative of ( P_a ) at ( x = 0 ). 3. For even ( k ), the ( k )-th derivative at ( x = 0 ) is: [ P_a^{(k)}(0) = 2 P^{(k)}(a) ] 4. For odd ( k ), the ( k )-th derivative at ( x = 0 ) is: [ P_a^{(k)}(0) = 0 ] 5.

This implies that one of the values ( 2a ) is repeated infinitely often. 11. Thus, the corresponding polynomial ( P_a(x) ) must have infinitely many roots, meaning ( P_a(x) ) is identically zero. 12.

Prove that there are two equal numbers among the 10000 numbers on the blackboard.","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Assumptions**: - We have a group of 100 kids and a deck of 101 cards numbered from 0 to 100. - Each kid shuffles the deck and writes down 100 averages on the blackboard. - We need to prove that there are at least two equal numbers among the 10000 numbers written on the blackboard. 2. **Understanding the Averages**: - When a kid takes the first card, the average is simply the number on that card. - When the kid takes the second card, the average is the sum of the first two cards divided by 2. - Generally, after taking ( n ) cards, the average is the sum of the first ( n ) cards divided by ( n ). 3. **Possible Values of Averages**: - The first average for each kid is just the number on the first card, which can be any number from 0 to 100. - The second average is of the form ( frac{k}{2} ) where ( k ) is the sum of the first two cards, and ( 0 leq k leq 200 ). - The ( n )-th average is of the form ( frac{S_n}{n} ) where ( S_n ) is the sum of the first ( n ) cards, and ( 0 leq S_n leq 5050 ) (since the sum of all cards is ( 5050 )). 4. **Counting Distinct Averages**: - For the first average, there are 101 possible values (0 to 100). - For the second average, there are 201 possible values (( frac{0}{2}, frac{1}{2}, ldots, frac{200}{2} )). - For the ( n )-th average, the number of possible values increases, but it is always of the form ( frac{k}{n} ) where ( k ) is an integer and ( 0 leq k leq 5050 ). 5. **Pigeonhole Principle Application**: - There are 100 kids, each writing down 100 averages, resulting in 10000 numbers. - The possible distinct averages are of the form ( frac{k}{n} ) where ( k ) is an integer and ( n ) is between 1 and 100. - The total number of distinct possible averages is bounded by the number of distinct fractions ( frac{k}{n} ) where ( 0 leq k leq 5050 ) and ( 1 leq n leq 100 ). 6. **Contradiction and Conclusion**: - The number of distinct possible averages is less than 10000 because the number of distinct fractions ( frac{k}{n} ) is limited by the range of ( k ) and ( n ). - By the pigeonhole principle, since there are 10000 numbers written and fewer than 10000 distinct possible averages, at least two of the numbers must be the same. Therefore, we have shown that there must be at least two equal numbers among the 10000 numbers written on the blackboard.

Specifically, there are (frac{n^2 - 1}{2}) squares of one color and (frac{n^2 + 1}{2}) squares of the other color. - When a student moves to an adjacent chair, they move from a black square to a white square or vice versa. - Since the number of black and white squares are unequal, it is impossible for every student to move to a new chair while maintaining the checkerboard pattern. This is because there would be an imbalance in the number of students moving to black squares versus white squares. Therefore, it is impossible to rearrange the students according to the given rules if ( n ) is odd. 2. **Constructive Argument for Even ( n ):** Suppose ( n ) is even. In this case, the number of black squares and white squares in the checkerboard pattern are equal.

For (n geq 2), each (a_n) is formed by appending (889) to the previous term (a_{n-1}) with eight zeros in between. Therefore, the sum of the digits of (a_n) is: [ S(a_n) = S(a_{n-1} cdot 10^8 + 889) = S(a_{n-1}) + S(889) = 25n ] This is because appending zeros does not change the sum of the digits. 3. **Calculate (S(a_n^2)):** To find (S(a_n^2)), we need to consider the sum of the digits of the square of (a_n). For simplicity, we use the given example (a_1 = 889) and (S(889^2) = S(790321) = 22). For (n geq 2), (a_n) is a large number formed by appending zeros and the number (889). The sum of the digits of (a_n^2) will be the sum of the digits of the square of each part, but since the digits of (a_n) are just repetitions of (889), the sum of the digits of (a_n^2) will be: [ S(a_n^2) = S((a_{n-1} cdot 10^8 + 889)^2) ] However, for large (n), the dominant term in the sum of the digits will be the sum of the digits of (889^2) repeated (n) times.

Similarly, sqrt{17} is slightly more than 4 but less than 5, because 4^2 = 16 and 5^2 = 25. Thus, sqrt{17} > 4.

For ( 1 le j le m ), define ( T_j ) as follows: - If ( j = 1 ), ( T_j = S_{a_1, b_1} ). - If ( j neq 1 ), ( T_j ) is obtained by adding the sum ( sum_{t=1}^{j-1} 2^{a_t} ) to any element in ( S_{a_j, b_j} ). 4. **Union of sets ( T_j ):** The union ( U_n ) of all such sets ( T_j ) gives a subset of ( {0,1, dots, n} ) fitting the condition. By Lucas' theorem, no binary representation of one number in ( U_n ) can completely \\"cover\\" another. 5. **Cardinality of ( U_n ):** Let ( f(n) ) be the cardinality of ( U_n ). We need to prove that ( f(n) ) fits the bound for ( 2^{k-1} le n < 2^k ). We do this inductively. 6. **Base case:** The base case is trivial. If ( n = 2^k - 1 ), proving the inequality is straightforward as it always holds with equality. 7. **Inductive step:** Assume ( n le 2^k - 2 ). All sets ( T_j ) are disjoint, so it suffices to sum ( |T_j| ) over all ( 1 le j le m ). 8. **Case when ( k ) is even:** If ( k ) is even, then ( a_1 = k-1 ) and ( lceil a_1 / 2 rceil - 1 ge lceil a_2 / 2 rceil ). Thus, [ f(n) = binom{k-1}{frac{k}{2} - 1} + f(n - 2^{k-1}) ge binom{k-1}{frac{k}{2} - 1} + frac{binom{k-1}{frac{k}{2} - 1}(n - 2^{k-1} + 1)}{2^{k-1}} = frac{binom{k}{frac{k}{2}}(n+1)}{2^k}. ] 9. **Case when ( k ) is odd:** If ( k ) is odd, then either ( a_2 le k-3 ) or ( a_2 = k-2 ). In the former case, [ f(n) = binom{k-1}{frac{k-1}{2}} + f(n - 2^{k-1}) ge binom{k-1}{frac{k-1}{2}} + frac{binom{k-1}{frac{k-1}{2}}(n - 2^{k-1} + 1)}{2^{k-1}} > frac{binom{k}{frac{k-1}{2}}(n+1)}{2^k}. ] 10. **Lower bound for ( |T_j| ):** For ( j ge 3 ), we show ( g(j) le 2^{a_j} cdot frac{binom{k}{frac{k-1}{2}}}{2^k} ) using an AM-GM argument. Given ( a_2 = k-2 ), the quantity [ binom{k-1}{frac{k-1}{2}} + binom{k-2}{frac{k-1}{2}} + sum_{j=3}^{m} g(j) - frac{binom{k}{frac{k-1}{2}}}{2^k} cdot (n+1) ] is minimized when ( n+1 ) has all possible digits in binary from ( 2^0 ) to ( 2^{k-1} ) (when ( n = 2^k - 2 )).

Therefore, we can set up the following equation: ( z_5 = z_t + 20 ) Substitute the known values: ( 35 = t^2 + 2t + 20 ) Now, let's solve for ( t ): ( t^2 + 2t + 20 = 35 ) ( t^2 + 2t = 35 - 20 ) ( t^2 + 2t = 15 ) This is a quadratic equation. To solve for ( t ), we can either factor the equation or use the quadratic formula. However, since the equation does not factor easily, we will use the quadratic formula: ( t = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) For our equation, ( a = 1 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = -15 ). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get: ( t = frac{-2 pm sqrt{2^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-15)}}{2 cdot 1} ) ( t = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 60}}{2} ) ( t = frac{-2 pm sqrt{64}}{2} ) ( t = frac{-2 pm 8}{2} ) We have two possible solutions for ( t ): ( t = frac{-2 + 8}{2} = frac{6}{2} = 3 ) seconds or ( t = frac{-2 - 8}{2} = frac{-10}{2} = -5 ) seconds Since ( t ) must be within the range ( 0 ≤ t ≤ 7 ), the negative value is not valid.

This holds because if a and b are both positive or both negative, then ab is positive, and |ab| = ab = |a||b|. If one is positive and the other is negative, then ab is negative, but |ab| = -(ab) = |a||b|.

You can easily determine the count of numbers divisible by 5 by dividing the range endpoints by 5 then finding the difference of the resulting quotient plus one. The calculation to find the smallest and largest multiples of 5 within the range are as follows: - The smallest multiple of 5: 5 div 5 = 1 - The largest multiple of 5: 1000 div 5 = 200 By doing so, we have established that the numbers divisible by 5 start with the 1st multiple (which is 5) and end with the 200th multiple (which is 1000).

The difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers is 200. How much does it cost to replace the headlights?","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we know that the car maintenance inspection costs a tenth of Chris's asking price. Since Chris is asking for 5200, the cost of the car maintenance inspection is: ( frac{1}{10} times 5200 = 520 ) So, if Chris accepts the first buyer's offer, he will pay 520 for the inspection and sell the car for 5200, effectively earning: ( 5200 - 520 = 4680 ) Now, let's consider the second buyer's offer. Let the cost to replace the headlights be ( H ) and the cost to replace the tires be ( 3H ) (since it's three times as much). The total cost for Chris to replace both would be: ( H + 3H = 4H ) The second buyer will pay the full price of 5200, but Chris has to subtract the cost of replacing the headlights and tires: ( 5200 - 4H ) We are told that the difference between the amounts Chris will earn from the two offers is 200. So, if we subtract the earnings from the second offer from the earnings of the first offer, we get: ( 4680 - (5200 - 4H) = 200 ) Now, let's solve for ( H ): ( 4680 - 5200 + 4H = 200 ) ( -520 + 4H = 200 ) ( 4H = 200 + 520 ) ( 4H = 720 ) ( H = frac{720}{4} ) ( H = 180 ) Therefore, the cost to replace the headlights is boxed{180} ."},{"prompt":"We know that the quadratic equation x^{2}=1 has no real roots, which means there is no real number whose square is equal to 1.

According to the problem, when the members are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied. This means that the total number of positions in this formation is N + 2, and it is divisible by 8. Therefore, we can write: [N + 2 = 8k,] where k is some integer. Similarly, when the members are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. This means the total number of positions in this formation is N + 3, and it is divisible by 9. Hence, we can write: [N + 3 = 9m,] where m is another integer. From the first equation, we can see that N = 8k - 2. This implies that N leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 because 8k - 2 = 8(k-1) + 6. From the second equation, N = 9m - 3. Adding 9 to both sides to make the remainder positive, we get N + 9 = 9m + 6, which simplifies to N = 9(m-1) + 6. This shows that N also leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 9. Since N leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by both 8 and 9, it means N is 6 more than a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 9. The LCM of 8 and 9 is 72 (since 8 = 2^3 and 9 = 3^2, and they have no common prime factors, their LCM is just their product). Therefore, we can express N as: [N = 72 cdot l + 6,] where l is an integer. Given that N is between 100 and 200, we substitute l = 1 and l = 2 to find the possible values for N: - For l = 1, N = 72 cdot 1 + 6 = 78, which is not between 100 and 200. - For l = 2, N = 72 cdot 2 + 6 = 144 + 6 = 150, which is between 100 and 200.

The third tangent touches the circle at Q and intersects AB at P and AC at R. By tangent properties, BP = PQ and CR = QR. 4. **Segment Calculations**: As BQ = QC, we have BP = PQ = frac{AB}{2} = 9 and similarly, CR = QR = frac{AC}{2} = 9. 5. **Triangle Perimeter**: Calculate AP = AB - BP = 18 - 9 = 9, AR = AC - CR = 18 - 9 = 9. PR as the sum of PQ and QR gives PR = 9 + 9 = 18. 6. **Summing Perimeter**: AP + PR + AR = 9 + 18 + 9 = 36. Thus, the perimeter of triangle APR is 36. Conclusion: The triangle’s perimeter calculation is valid and consistent with the given conditions. The position of Q being fixed ensures the solution is specific and not influenced by variables not given in the problem.

Since each child picks up two flags, the number of children, C, is F/2. Now, we are told that 60% of the children have blue flags and 60% have red flags. This means that 0.6C children have blue flags and 0.6C children have red flags. However, this seems contradictory because if 60% have blue and 60% have red, that would imply that 120% of the children have flags, which is not possible. The only way this makes sense is if some children are counted in both groups because they have one blue flag and one red flag. Let's denote the percentage of children who have both colors as X%. This means that X% of the children are counted twice, once in the blue group and once in the red group. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 60% + 60% - X% = 100% 120% - X% = 100% X% = 120% - 100% X% = 20% So, boxed{20%} of the children have flags of both colors."},{"prompt":"Compare the following real numbers: frac{{sqrt{3}1}}{2}____frac{1}{3}.","completion":"To compare the two real numbers frac{{sqrt{3}-1}}{2} and frac{1}{3}, we start by analyzing the inequality involving square roots and fractions.

Since sqrt{27} = 3sqrt{3} > 5, we have: frac{sqrt{27}}{6} > frac{5}{6} Step 2: Simplify and compare to frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3}.

When they work together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates, which we know is ( frac{1}{10} ) documents per minute (since it takes them 10 minutes to type the document together).

The correct number of conclusions is ( ). A: 1 B: 2 C: 3 D: 4","completion":"To solve this problem systematically, let's break down the solution step by step, following the given information and conclusions: **Step 1: Determine the Period T and omega** Given the intersection points frac{pi}{6} and frac{2pi}{3}, the period T can be found as twice the difference between these points: [T = 2 times left(frac{2pi}{3} - frac{pi}{6}right) = 2 times frac{pi}{2} = pi.] Thus, we can find omega by using the relation omega = frac{2pi}{T}: [omega = frac{2pi}{pi} = 2.] **Step 2: Solve for varphi** Substituting (frac{pi}{6}, 0) into f(x) = 2sin(2x + varphi) yields: [begin{align*} 2sinleft(2 times frac{pi}{6} + varphiright) &= 0 2sinleft(frac{pi}{3} + varphiright) &= 0. end{align*}] Since |varphi| < frac{pi}{2}, solving for varphi gives varphi = -frac{pi}{3}. Therefore, the function simplifies to: [f(x) = 2sin(2x - frac{pi}{3}).] **Step 3: Evaluate Conclusion 1** For y = f(x + frac{pi}{3}), we have: [y = 2sinleft[2(x + frac{pi}{3}) - frac{pi}{3}right] = 2sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}).] This function is not symmetric about the origin since it's not an odd function. Therefore, conclusion 1 is incorrect. **Step 4: Evaluate Conclusion 2** For x in [-frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{3}], we have: [2x - frac{pi}{3} in [-frac{2pi}{3}, frac{pi}{3}].] Thus, the maximum value of f(x) is obtained when x = frac{pi}{3}, resulting in: [f(frac{pi}{3}) = 2sin(frac{pi}{3}) = 2 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = sqrt{3}.] Hence, conclusion 2 is correct. **Step 5: Evaluate Conclusion 3** For an axis of symmetry, we look for solutions to 2x - frac{pi}{3} = frac{pi}{2} + kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}. This does not simplify to x = frac{pi}{6}, making conclusion 3 incorrect. **Step 6: Evaluate Conclusion 4** Shifting f(x) left by frac{pi}{4} units gives g(x) = f(x + frac{pi}{4}) = 2sin[2(x + frac{pi}{4}) - frac{pi}{3}] = 2cos(2x - frac{pi}{3}). Setting 2sin(2x - frac{pi}{3}) = 2cos(2x - frac{pi}{3}), we find the x-values of intersection points as x = frac{kpi}{2} + frac{7pi}{24}, where k in mathbb{Z}.
