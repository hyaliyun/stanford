Given that Mr. Wang has forgotten his set password, how many attempts are required to ensure that the safe is opened? To find the number of attempts required to ensure that the safe is opened, we must identify all possible unique combinations that could potentially satisfy the condition, given that the 3-digit code will be unlocked if any two digits are correct.

How many red straws does she need for each mat?","completion":"Let's denote the number of red straws needed for each mat as R, and the number of green straws needed for each mat as G. According to the information given, we know that G is half the number of orange straws. Since there are 30 orange straws for each mat, then: G = 30 / 2 G = 15 green straws for each mat. Now, we know that Ginger needs 650 straws to make 10 mats. This includes red, orange, and green straws. The total number of orange and green straws for 10 mats can be calculated as follows: Total orange straws for 10 mats = 30 orange straws/mat * 10 mats = 300 orange straws. Total green straws for 10 mats = 15 green straws/mat * 10 mats = 150 green straws. Now, let's add the total number of orange and green straws for 10 mats: Total orange and green straws for 10 mats = 300 orange straws + 150 green straws = 450 straws. Since the total number of straws needed for 10 mats is 650, we can find the total number of red straws needed for 10 mats by subtracting the total number of orange and green straws from 650: Total red straws for 10 mats = 650 total straws - 450 orange and green straws = 200 red straws. Now, to find the number of red straws needed for each mat, we divide the total number of red straws by the number of mats: R = Total red straws for 10 mats / 10 mats R = 200 red straws / 10 mats R = 20 red straws for each mat.

Importantly, one of the rays of the original angle and the double angle should coincide, and the apexes should be identical. Here are the steps: 1. **Define the given angle**: Let us consider the original angle angle AOB, where O is the apex, and A and B are points on the rays of the angle. 2. **Construct a reflection**: Reflect one of the rays of the original angle onto the other ray. Let us assume that we reflect ray overrightarrow{OB} onto ray overrightarrow{OA}. - Draw the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining O to a point B' on overrightarrow{OB} that is convenient to work with. The midpoint of this segment will act as the mirror line. - Perform the reflection of point B across this mirror line to find the new point B''. 3. **Verify the reflection**: Since the reflection across an axis preserves the angle, the angle angle B'OB'' will be double the angle angle AOB. - Check that angle B'OB'' = 2 cdot angle AOB because the reflection maintains the measure of the angles and mirrors one ray onto another while preserving the magnitude of the angles. 4. **Construct the double angle**: - The ray overrightarrow{OB''} now represents the direction to the new point constituting the double angle. - This new angle angle AOB'' is the required double angle where A, O, and ray overrightarrow{OA} remain unchanged, ensuring both angles have the same vertex O. 5. **Conclusion**: - By using geometric reflection properties, we successfully created the angle double the original without altering the vertex or one of the original rays.

This means that if we can prove the statement for a rotated version of the set ( Z ), then it holds for the original set as well. Specifically, for any ( theta in mathbb{R} ), consider the set ( Z_theta = Z cdot e^{itheta} = { z cdot e^{itheta} : z in Z } ). The magnitudes of sums of subsets of ( Z ) are preserved under this rotation. 2. **Sum Notation**: Let ( Sigma(S) ) denote the sum of the elements of the set ( S ). We define ( Sigma(emptyset) = 0 ). For any complex number ( z ), let ( P_z ) be the point in the complex plane corresponding to ( z ). 3. **Lemma**: We need to prove the following lemma: There exists a subset ( V subset Z ) with ( n - 2m ) elements such that, upon a proper rotation, ( P_{Sigma(Z)} ) and ( P_{Sigma(V)} ) can both be placed in the top-right quadrant of the plane. This means that both ( P_{Sigma(Z)} ) and ( P_{Sigma(V)} ) will have non-negative ( x ) and ( y ) coordinates after rotation. 4. **Proof of Lemma**: - If ( n - 2m = 0 ), then ( V = emptyset ) and ( P_{Sigma(V)} = (0,0) ). Regardless of the rotation, ( P_{Sigma(V)} ) remains at the origin, which is in the desired quadrant. We can then rotate ( P_{Sigma(Z)} ) to the desired quadrant. - If ( Sigma(Z) = 0 ), then ( P_{Sigma(Z)} ) is at the origin.

For every ( V subset Z ) with ( n - 2m ) elements, ( angle P_{Sigma(V)}OP_{Sigma(Z)} > 90^circ ). This implies that all ( P_{Sigma(V)} ) lie in the half-plane determined by the line perpendicular to ( OP_{Sigma(Z)} ) at ( O ), not containing ( P_{Sigma(Z)} ). 6. **Double Counting**: Let ( V_1, V_2, ldots, V_k ) be all the ( n - 2m ) element subsets of ( Z ). Since all ( P_{Sigma(V_i)} ) lie in the lower half-plane, so does ( P_{Sigma(V_1) + cdots + Sigma(V_k)} ). However, by double counting: [ sum_{i=1}^k Sigma(V_i) = binom{n-1}{n-2m-1} sum_{z in Z} z = binom{n-1}{n-2m-1} Sigma(Z). ] Thus, ( Sigma(V_1) + cdots + Sigma(V_k) = k Sigma(Z) ) for some ( k in mathbb{N} ).

This assumption ensures that the direction of the lines will remain the same throughout the game. - The path will not intersect itself. Since each move is in a single direction, it is impossible for the path to cross itself because there are no changes in direction that could lead to intersections. 3.

Part (a): Finding ( angle AXC ) 1. **Establishing key angles**: - Since (AB = BX) and ( angle B = 36^circ ), (triangle ABX) is isosceles with (AB = BX).

We need to consider all scenarios where exactly two trains arrive on time. These scenarios include: 1. The first and second trains arrive on time, but the third does not. 2.

Adding these probabilities together gives us the total probability of exactly two trains arriving on time: 0.8 times 0.7 times (1-0.9) + 0.8 times (1-0.7) times 0.9 + (1-0.8) times 0.7 times 0.9 = 0.056 + 0.144 + 0.198 = 0.398 Therefore, the probability of exactly two trains arriving on time is boxed{0.398}. # Part (2): Probability of At Least One Train Arriving on Time To find the probability of at least one of the three trains arriving on time, we can use the complement rule. This rule states that the probability of at least one event happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of none of the events happening. The probability of none of the trains arriving on time is the product of the probabilities of each train not arriving on time: (1-0.8) times (1-0.7) times (1-0.9) = 0.2 times 0.3 times 0.1 = 0.006 Therefore, the probability of at least one train arriving on time is: 1 - (1-0.8) times (1-0.7) times (1-0.9) = 1 - 0.006 = 0.994 Thus, the probability that at least one of the three trains arrives on time is boxed{0.994}."},{"prompt":"A hall measuring 15 feet by 18 feet is to be tiled with tiles measuring 3 inches by 9 inches.

The tomatoes on the plants would then be 1, 2, 3, ..., 12.

[ S = frac{12 times 13}{2} = 78 ] 3. **Compare to Actual Total:** Gabriella counts a total of 186 tomatoes. The difference between the actual tomato count and our initial sum is: [ 186 - 78 = 108 ] 4. **Redistribute Excess Tomatoes:** The 108 additional tomatoes must be evenly spread over the 12 plants.

Since the initial amount of alcohol (2 liters) plus the added alcohol (x liters) equals the amount of alcohol in the final solution, we can set up the following equation: 2 + x = 0.09 * (47.5 + x) Now, let's solve for x: 2 + x = 0.09 * 47.5 + 0.09x 2 + x = 4.275 + 0.09x x - 0.09x = 4.275 - 2 0.91x = 2.275 x = 2.275 / 0.91 x ≈ 2.5 So, boxed{2.5} liters of alcohol are added to the solution."},{"prompt":"There are several statements about the linear correlation coefficient r of two variables x and y: (1) If r>0, then as x increases, y also increases correspondingly; (2) If r<0, then as x increases, y also increases correspondingly; (3) If r=1 or r=1, then the relationship between x and y is completely corresponding (there is a functional relationship), and all the scatter points on the scatter plot are on a straight line.

Notice that (gcd((a-2)n, 2n+1) = 1) implies (gcd(a-2, 2n+1) = 1) because (2n+1) is odd and does not share any common factor with (n). Thus, we have shown that: [ gcd(a-2, 2n+1) = 1 quad text{for all integers } n. ] # Part (b) Find all possible ( a ). 1. From part (a), we know that (gcd(a-2, 2n+1) = 1) for all integers ( n ). 2. Consider ( n = frac{p-1}{2} ) where ( p ) is an odd prime. Then ( 2n+1 = p ), and we have: [ gcd(a-2, p) = 1 ] for all odd primes ( p ). 3. Since (gcd(a-2, p) = 1) for all odd primes ( p ), ( a-2 ) must be a power of 2. This is because any integer that is coprime with all odd primes must be of the form ( 2^m ) for some nonnegative integer ( m ). 4. Therefore, ( a-2 = 2^m ) for some nonnegative integer ( m ), which implies: [ a = 2 + 2^m ] Additionally, ( a = 1 ) is also a solution since ( gcd(1-2, 2n+1) = gcd(-1, 2n+1) = 1 ). Thus, the possible values of ( a ) are: [ a = 1 quad text{or} quad a = 2 + 2^m text{ for any nonnegative integer } m. ] The final answer is ( boxed{ a = 1 } ) or ( a = 2 + 2^m text{ for any nonnegative integer } m )."},{"prompt":"On a cart, there are some books.

According to the Pythagorean theorem, in triangle (OA_{i} A_{i+1}), we have: [ O A_{i+1}^2 = A_{i+1} H_i^2 + O H_i^2 ] Also, in triangle (O A_{i+1} A_{i+2}): [ OA_{i+1}^2 = A_{i+1} H_{i+1}^2 + O H_{i+1}^2 ] Since the sides of the heptagon are of length 1, we can write: [ 1 - 2x_i + x_i^2 + h_i^2 = x_{i+1}^2 + h_{i+1}^2 ] This equation results from comparing the distances when calculating (O A_{i+1}).

Prove that everyone can be divided into exactly 100 sections. (Sections of one person are allowed: they write a review of the movie they have seen.)","completion":"To prove that it's possible to divide 5000 movie enthusiasts into exactly 100 sections based on the given conditions, we will follow the outlined steps: 1. **Initial Assumption:** Each of the 5000 participants has seen at least one film. 2. **Section Types:** We have two types of sections: - Type 1: All members of the section have seen the same film. - Type 2: Each member describes a film that only they have seen in the section. 3. **Upper Bound on Section Formation:** Let's take any arbitrary film. If there is a film that has been seen by more than 100 participants, we will create a section for all of these participants. This ensures that the number of sections required to cover these participants does not exceed the total number of participants divided by 100, suggesting that creating 100 sections is feasible. 4. **Subsequent Films and Section Distribution:** Once we have created a section for a film seen by more than 100 participants, and if another film is seen by more than 99 out of the remaining participants, we create another section for these 99 participants. We continue this process ensuring the number of sections will manage the large number of participants without creating more than 100 sections. We assert that forming 101 sections is impossible under these constraints because the sum of a series from 101 to 1 exceeds 5000. Explicitly, this sum is greater than 5000. 5. **Mathematical Proof Using Series:** Assume while forming sections, we get to forming a section for more than 100 people, more than 99 people, and so on, till 1 person. The sum of participants for these sections would be: [ 101 + 100 + 99 + ldots + 2 + 1 > 5000 ] The sum ( frac{101 cdot (101 + 1)}{2} = 5151 ). This indicates that it is indeed impossible to form more than 100 sections if each film were seen by participants reducing in size down to 1 in a single round of distribution. As we have 5000 participants, not 5151, and since this sum exceeds 5000, it proves that we can indeed ensure no more than 100 sections are needed. 6. **Inductive Step to Generalize:** Suppose we have created (100 - k) sections already and each film among the remaining movies is seen by no more than (k) individuals. We allocate (k) rooms for these (k) new sections, and for each film, distribute the viewers into different new sections. 7. **Final Allocation:** Continuing this logical deduction and ensuring each distribution finalizes within our required sections, we see no point arises where the total number of sections exceeds 100. # Conclusion: Therefore, we have shown rigorously that it is always possible to divide the 5000 movie enthusiasts into exactly 100 sections.

This is because at least two of the triangles will share a side or vertex, leading to a contradiction. - Therefore, ( n = 5 ) is not a valid solution. 5. **Case ( n = 2k ) for ( k geq 2 )**: - For ( n = 2k ), we consider a regular ( 2k )-gon. - In a regular ( 2k )-gon, drawing non-intersecting diagonals will divide it into ( 2k-2 ) triangles. - Each of these triangles will be isosceles and similar to each other due to the symmetry of the regular polygon. - Therefore, ( n = 2k ) for ( k geq 2 ) is a valid solution. 6. **Case ( n = 2k + 3 ) for ( k geq 2 )**: - For ( n = 2k + 3 ), we consider a regular ( 2k )-gon and add 3 points. - However, adding 3 points to a regular ( 2k )-gon does not guarantee that the resulting triangles will be similar. - This construction does not necessarily lead to all triangles being similar, and thus, it is not a valid solution. 7. **Conclusion**: - From the above analysis, the valid solutions are ( n = 4 ) and ( n = 2k ) for ( k geq 2 ).

Given that the maximum value of f(x) is 2, we can equate this to sqrt{1+a^2} to find the value of a.

Consider the player X who made his first step n+1 after the last game. Assume in result of this step he met player Y in the t-th game. - This implies Y was taking steps of length n+1 before this, leading up to: [ q + (n+1) + k(n+2) ] - If X made fewer steps than k+1 up to the t-th game, his first game would be numbered: [ q + (n+2) ge n+3 ] - However, this cannot be true, as all players participated in the first n+2 games already.

Therefore, at 15 minutes, the minute hand is at 15 times 6^circ = 90^circ from the 12 o'clock position. At 8:00, the hour hand is on the 8, which is 8 times 30^circ = 240^circ from the 12 o'clock position. However, the hour hand also moves with the minute hand.

Substituting this into the given functional equation, we get: [ f(x^y) = 1 quad text{and} quad f(x)^{f(y)} = 1^{1} = 1 ] This shows that the constant function f(x)=1 satisfies the given functional equation. 2. **Non-Constant Case Assumption**: Assume f is not a constant function equal to 1. Hence, there exists some a > 0 such that f(a) neq 1. Let's proceed by considering the given functional equation: [ f(x^y) = f(x)^{f(y)} ] 3. **Functional Application and Power Laws**: Notice that: [ f(a)^{f(x y)} = f(a^{x y}) = f((a^x)^y) = f(a^x)^{f(y)} = left(f(a^x)right)^{f(y)} = left(f(a)^{f(x)}right)^{f(y)} = f(a)^{f(x) f(y)} ] Since f(a) neq 1, we can equate the exponents: [ f(x y) = f(x) f(y) ] This equation shows that f is multiplicative over the positive real numbers. 4. **Additive Property Derivation**: Let's use the multiplicative property f(x y) = f(x) f(y) and the given function to derive another property: [ f(a)^{f(x+y)} = f(a^{x+y}) = f(a^x cdot a^y) = f(a^x) cdot f(a^y) = f(a)^{f(x)} cdot f(a)^{f(y)} = f(a)^{f(x) + f(y)} ] Since f(a) neq 1, we equate the exponents: [ f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) ] This equation shows that f is also additive over the positive real numbers. 5. **Characterizing Additive and Multiplicative Functions**: We will now show that the only functions that are both multiplicative and additive over mathbb{R}^+ are linear functions of the form f(x) = cx where c > 0. From additivity, we have: [ f(n x) = n f(x) ] by induction for all natural numbers n and positive real numbers x.

From the equation of a hyperbola, we know that the asymptotes are given by the equation frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 0, where a^2 = m and b^2 = n. Here, a^2 = frac{1}{4} and b^2 = frac{3}{4}, so: frac{x^2}{frac{1}{4}} - frac{y^2}{frac{3}{4}} = 0 implies 4x^2 - frac{4y^2}{3} = 0. This simplifies to: 3x^2 = y^2 implies sqrt{3}x pm y = 0.

Based on the value of B(n), f(n) is defined as follows: * If B(n) = 1, then f(n) = 1. * If B(n) neq 1, then f(n) is the largest prime factor of B(n). 2. **Formulate Derived Lemma**: We need to justify that for any positive integers ( n ) and ( a ), the fraction: [ frac{(2n)!}{n!(n+a)!} ] written in its reduced form does not have a prime factor greater than (2a). 3. **Proof of the Lemma**: Let: [ x = frac{(2n)!(2a)!}{n!(n+a)!} ] For any prime ( p ), the highest power of ( p ) dividing ( x ) is given by: [ sum_{r geq 1} left( leftlfloor frac{2n}{p^r} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2a}{p^r} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n}{p^r} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n+a}{p^r} rightrfloor right) ] This needs to be non-negative for ( x ) to be an integer. 4. **Analyze Inequality**: Since (leftlfloor 2y rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2z rightrfloor geq leftlfloor y rightrfloor + leftlfloor y + z rightrfloor) for all non-negative (y, z), let's prove this: Suppose: [ y = leftlfloor y rightrfloor + alpha quad text{and} quad z = leftlfloor z rightrfloor + beta quad text{for } 0 leq alpha, beta < 1. ] Then the inequality transforms to: [ 2 leftlfloor y rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2alpha rightrfloor + 2 leftlfloor z rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2beta rightrfloor geq leftlfloor y rightrfloor + leftlfloor y rightrfloor + leftlfloor z rightrfloor + leftlfloor alpha + beta rightrfloor ] Which simplifies to: [ leftlfloor z rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2alpha rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2beta rightrfloor geq leftlfloor alpha + beta rightrfloor ] 5. **Evaluate Equality Conditions**: Given ( 0 leq alpha, beta < 1 ), it follows ( 0 leq alpha + beta < 2 ). Thus, ( leftlfloor alpha + beta rightrfloor = 0 ) or ( 1 ): * If ( leftlfloor alpha + beta rightrfloor = 0 ): [ leftlfloor z rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2alpha rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2beta rightrfloor geq 0 ] which is clearly true because all integer parts are non-negative. * If ( leftlfloor alpha + beta rightrfloor = 1 ), then either ( alpha ) or ( beta ) is at least ( frac{1}{2} ). Therefore, one of ( leftlfloor 2alpha rightrfloor ) or ( leftlfloor 2beta rightrfloor ) must be 1, satisfying the equality. 6. **Conclude Lemma**: Hence, the highest power of any prime ( p ) dividing ( x ) must be non-negative, confirming ( x ) is an integer. Consequently, ( frac{x}{(2a)!} )'s denominator cannot contain any prime factors larger than ( 2a ), validating the lemma. 7. **Application to f(n)**: Using the derived lemma: [ frac{(2n)!}{n!(n+1002)!} ] cannot have prime factors in ( B(n) ) greater than 2004. Given the function definition: [ f(n) < 2004. ] Thus, ( f(n) ) values are finite. 8. **Maximum Value of f(n)**: Evaluate when ( f(n) ) takes its maximum value.

The standard form for an ellipse's foci along the x-axis is left(pm c,0right), where c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}, and a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes respectively. For our ellipse, a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 3, so c = sqrt{4 - 3} = 1. Therefore, the coordinates of the right focus of the ellipse are (1,0). Since the focus F of the parabola coincides with the right focus of the ellipse, we have F = (1,0). In the standard equation of a parabola y^2 = 2px, the distance from the vertex to the focus is p. Thus, p = 2, and the equation of the parabola becomes y^2 = 4x. This confirms that **statement A is correct**. 2. **Minimum Value of frac{|AB|}{|MF|}:** - **Case 1: Slope of AB Does Not Exist** When the chord AB is vertical, it intersects the directrix at a fixed point M, and |AB| = 2p = 4. The distance |MF| = 2, leading to frac{|AB|}{|MF|} = 2. - **Case 2: Slope of AB Exists** Let the slope of AB be k neq 0. The equation of line AB can be written as y = k(x - 1). Substituting y^2 = 4x into this equation, we get a quadratic in x with A = 16(k^2 + 1) > 0, implying two distinct points of intersection (since A > 0). The sum and product of roots give us x_1 + x_2 = frac{2(k^2 + 2)}{k^2} and x_1x_2 = 1. The length |AB| can be found using the distance formula, resulting in |AB| = frac{4(k^2 + 1)}{k^2}. For point M, using the equation of line FM and setting x = -1, we find M(-1, frac{2}{k}). The distance |MF| is then 2sqrt{frac{1 + k^2}{k^2}}, leading to frac{|AB|}{|MF|} = 2sqrt{1 + frac{1}{k^2}} > 2. Therefore, the minimum value of frac{|AB|}{|MF|} is indeed 2, making **statement B correct**. 3. **Triangle A'FB' Being a Right Triangle:** By the definition of a parabola, AA' = AF' and BB' = BF'. Since AA' and BB' are parallel, and both perpendicular to the directrix, angles angle AA'F and angle BB'F are equal to angles angle AFA' and angle BFB' respectively. This setup ensures that angle A'FB' = 90^circ, confirming that triangle A'FB' is a right triangle. Thus, **statement C is correct**. 4. **Area of triangle ABM Being Constant:** The area of triangle ABM varies depending on the slope of AB. In the case where the slope does not exist, the area is a fixed value. However, when the slope exists, the area is not constant as it depends on k. Therefore, **statement D is incorrect**.

This means that the value of 3/4 of his shares, after accounting for the capital gains tax, is 30,000 Rs. 2. To find the value of his shares before the capital gains tax, we need to divide the 30,000 Rs by (1 - 0.15), because he keeps 85% (100% - 15%) of the sale after tax: Value before tax = 30,000 Rs / (1 - 0.15) Value before tax = 30,000 Rs / 0.85 Value before tax ≈ 35,294.12 Rs 3. The 35,294.12 Rs represents the value of 3/4 of his shares before the tax. To find the value of all his shares before the tax, we divide by 3/4: Value of all his shares = 35,294.12 Rs / (3/4) Value of all his shares = 35,294.12 Rs / 0.75 Value of all his shares ≈ 47,058.83 Rs 4. The 47,058.83 Rs is the value of the man's 2/3 share in the business before the 10% increase in the business value.

The 51,764.71 Rs represents the value of the man's 2/3 share in the business after the 10% increase.

Considering the last two digits, 92, we see that 92 div 4 = 23, which means 92 is divisible by 4. The value of B does not influence the divisibility by 4 in this particular integer structure because the divisibility by 4 of a number formed only by the last two digits of a larger number depends uniquely on these two digits. Thus, any digit from 0 to 9 could be used for B without affecting divisibility by 4.

These pairs are (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (B, C), (B, D), and (C, D). 3. **Determine the circles from these pairs**: - Pairs (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), and (D, A) are adjacent sides of the square. Each pair defines a circle with the segment as its diameter. However, since S is a square, all sides are equal, resulting in circles with the same radius but different centers. - Pairs (A, C) and (B, D) are diagonals of the square. Both diagonals are equal in length and intersect at the center of the square. Each diagonal defines the same circle, which is the circumcircle of the square. 4. **Analyze the uniqueness of the circles**: - The circles defined by the sides (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), and (D, A) are distinct from each other because they have different centers. - The circle defined by the diagonals (A, C) and (B, D) is the same circle. 5. **Count the distinct circles**: We have four distinct circles from the sides and one from the diagonals, making a total of 5 distinct circles. Thus, the number of circles in the plane of S that have a diameter both of whose endpoints are vertices of S is 5.

Substituting the values of a and b, we get c = sqrt{9^2 - 3^2} = sqrt{81 - 9} = sqrt{72} = 6sqrt{2}. Therefore: - The length of the major axis is 2a = 2 times 9 = 18. - The length of the minor axis is 2b = 2 times 3 = 6. - The eccentricity, which is the ratio of the focal distance to the semi-major axis, is e = frac{c}{a} = frac{6sqrt{2}}{9} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}. - Because the ellipse equation is centered at the origin and is aligned with the y-axis, the coordinates of the foci are on the y-axis.

Let ( D, E, F ) be the midpoints of the sides ( BC, CA, AB ) of ( triangle ABC ), respectively. We need to show that ( T = T' ). 4. Consider the homothety with ratio ( frac{1}{2} ) centered at ( A ). Under this homothety, ( B ) maps to ( F ), ( C ) maps to ( E ), and ( I ) maps to ( T' ). 5. Since ( angle A = 60^circ ), the excentral triangle ( triangle BIC ) has ( angle BIC = 90^circ + frac{1}{2} angle A = 120^circ ). Therefore, ( angle FT'E = angle BIC = 120^circ ). 6. The medial triangle ( triangle DEF ) has ( angle EDF = angle A = 60^circ ). Thus, ( angle EDF + angle FT'E = 60^circ + 120^circ = 180^circ ). 7. Since ( angle EDF + angle FT'E = 180^circ ), the points ( D, F, T', E ) are concyclic. Therefore, ( T' ) lies on the circumcircle of ( triangle DEF ), which is the nine-point circle of ( triangle ABC ). 8. By Feuerbach's theorem, the nine-point circle of ( triangle ABC ) is tangent to the incircle of ( triangle ABC ) at a unique point. Since ( T' ) lies on both the nine-point circle and the incircle, it must be the point of tangency. Hence, ( T = T' ). 9. Since ( AT' = r ) and ( T = T' ), it follows that ( AT = r ). (blacksquare) The final answer is ( boxed{ AT = r } )."},{"prompt":"triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, c respectively.

By the Law of Sines, frac{b}{sin B} = frac{a}{sin A} = 2R, where R is the radius of the circumcircle. Since R = 1, we have frac{b}{sin B} = 2, which implies b = 2sin B. 2. Substituting the given expression for b into the equation from the Law of Sines, we get acos C - frac{sqrt{3}}{6}ac = 2sin B. 3. Applying the sine sum identity, sin B = sin(A + C) = sin Acos C + cos Asin C. 4. Equating the two expressions for sin B, we have sin Acos C - frac{sqrt{3}}{6}asin C = sin Acos C + cos Asin C. 5. Simplifying, we find cos Asin C = -frac{sqrt{3}}{6}asin C. 6. Since sin C neq 0, dividing both sides by sin C gives cos A = -frac{sqrt{3}}{6}a. 7. Knowing R = 1, we use the formula a = 2Rsin A = 2sin A. 8. Substituting a = 2sin A into cos A = -frac{sqrt{3}}{6}a, we get cos A = -frac{sqrt{3}}{3}sin A. 9. This implies tan A = -sqrt{3}. 10.

Simplifying, 3 = 1 + c^2 + c since cosleft(frac{2pi}{3}right) = -frac{1}{2}. 4. Rearranging, we get c^2 + c - 2 = 0. 5. Solving this quadratic equation, we find c = 1 or c = -2. We discard c = -2 since side lengths are positive. 6. The area of triangle ABC, S = frac{1}{2}bcsin A = frac{1}{2} times 1 times 1 times sinleft(frac{2pi}{3}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}.

We are allowed to flip exactly 7 coins at a time, and these 7 coins must be evenly spaced (i.e., they could be consecutive, every other coin, etc.). Our goal is to show that through a series of such flips, we can make all 100 coins heads up. 2. **Identifying the Approach:** To solve this problem, it is enough to demonstrate that we can flip any single coin while leaving the rest in their original positions. If we can do this, we can then repeatedly flip each coin from tails to heads as needed. 3. **Flipping a Pair of Coins:** Suppose we want to flip a pair of coins that are separated by exactly 6 coins. If we include these two coins and the 6 coins between them, we form a group of 8 consecutive coins. We can flip these as follows: - First, flip the leftmost 7 coins in this group. - Then, flip the rightmost 7 coins in this group. In doing so, the coins at the 1st and 8th positions (in this 8-coin segment) will each be flipped once, while the coins in positions 2 through 7 will be flipped twice, returning them to their original states. 4. **Flipping a Single Coin in the Left Half:** Now, consider flipping just one coin. For simplicity, let’s assume this coin lies in the left half of the sequence. We will then look at a set of 7 coins where our target coin is the first coin, and the others follow at intervals of 6 coins (i.e., positions 1, 7, 13, ..., etc.). This creates a sequence where the group contains our target coin and three other pairs of coins spaced by 6 positions. We can flip each of these pairs as described earlier. Finally, flipping the entire set of seven coins will result in only our target coin being changed, while the rest remain in their original positions. 5. **Flipping Any Coin in the Sequence:** The method described works similarly for any coin, whether it lies in the left half or the right half. The symmetry of the problem ensures that the reasoning and steps apply uniformly. 6. **Ensuring the Final Configuration:** By iteratively applying the above operation, we can systematically flip any coin from tails to heads until all coins are heads up. This proves that using the allowed operations, we can achieve the desired final configuration of all coins being heads up. # Conclusion: By showing that any single coin can be flipped while all others remain unchanged, we establish that we can flip any coin from tails to heads as needed and thus ensure all coins are heads up by iterating through the sequence.

Prove that one of the players can act in such a way as to guarantee a win, and find the smallest possible number of primes that will be used by both players in such a game.","completion":"1. **Identify the Key Constraint:** The players take turns naming prime numbers not exceeding 100. Each new number must start with the last digit of the previous number named. Once a number is used, it cannot be reused. The first number chosen should strategically ensure a winning condition for the first player. 2. **Initial Move by the First Player:** The first player should choose a prime number ending in a digit that forces the second player into a limited number of choices down the line. A good candidate is (19): [ 19 text{ (prime, ends in 9)} ] 3. **Analysis of Consequent Moves for the Second Player:** The second player must now choose a prime number starting with the last digit of (19), which is (9).

Therefore, when x in (-2, 0), f(x) = -(ln(-x) - a(-x)) = -ln(-x) + ax. The minimum value of f(x) in this interval is 1, which means -ln(-x) + ax = 1. Let x = -1, we get -ln 1 + a(-1) = 1, which simplifies to -a = 1. Therefore, a = -1, which contradicts the condition a > 0. Hence, there must be a mistake in the reasoning process. The correct approach is to consider the symmetry of the odd function and the given conditions.

When x = 2, f(x) = 1, and from f^2(x) + bf(x) + c = 0, we get 1 + b + c = 0, which gives us x_1 = 1.

So, the total distance to be covered for them to be clear of each other is: Total distance = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2 Total distance = 135 meters + 165 meters Total distance = 300 meters The speed of the first train is 80 km/h, and the speed of the second train is 65 km/h.

Since 12 ounces of butter is used and the original recipe calls for 5 ounces of butter for each 7 cups of flour, we can set up a proportion to find the amount of flour needed: 5 ounces butter : 7 cups flour = 12 ounces butter : x cups flour Solving for x gives us: x = (12 ounces butter * 7 cups flour) / 5 ounces butter x = 84 cups flour / 5 x = 16.8 cups flour Now, let's convert the cups of flour to grams: 16.8 cups flour * 125 grams/cup = 2100 grams of flour Next, let's find out how much salt is needed. The original recipe calls for 3 teaspoons of salt for each 1.5 cups of flour. Since we have 16.8 cups of flour and we need 3.5 times the original amount of salt, we can calculate the amount of salt as follows: (3 teaspoons salt / 1.5 cups flour) * 16.8 cups flour * 3.5 = x teaspoons salt x = (3 * 16.8 * 3.5) / 1.5 x = (3 * 16.8 * 3.5) / 1.5 x = 117.6 teaspoons salt Now, let's convert the teaspoons of salt to grams: 117.6 teaspoons salt * 5 grams/teaspoon = 588 grams of salt Finally, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed. The original recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of sugar for every 2.5 cups of flour. Since we have 16.8 cups of flour and we need 3 times the original amount of sugar, we can calculate the amount of sugar as follows: (2 tablespoons sugar / 2.5 cups flour) * 16.8 cups flour * 3 = x tablespoons sugar x = (2 * 16.8 * 3) / 2.5 x = (33.6 * 3) / 2.5 x = 100.8 / 2.5 x = 40.32 tablespoons sugar Now, let's convert the tablespoons of sugar to grams: 40.32 tablespoons sugar * 15 grams/tablespoon = 604.8 grams of sugar To summarize, for the adjusted recipe proportions, Elena will need: - 2100 grams of flour - 588 grams of salt - boxed{604.8} grams of sugar"},{"prompt":"Let a, b, and c be distinct real numbers such that [ frac{a^3 + 9}{a} = frac{b^3 + 9}{b} = frac{c^3 + 9}{c}. ] Find a^3 + b^3 + c^3.","completion":"Let [ k = frac{a^3 + 9}{a} = frac{b^3 + 9}{b} = frac{c^3 + 9}{c}. ] Then a, b, and c are all roots of the equation [ k = frac{x^3 + 9}{x}, ] which simplifies to [ x^3 - kx + 9 = 0. ] By Vieta's formulas, since a + b + c = 0 (coefficient of x^2 is zero), we have: [ a^3 - ka + 9 = 0, ] [ b^3 - kb + 9 = 0, ] [ c^3 - kc + 9 = 0. ] Adding these equations, we obtain [ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - k(a + b + c) + 27 = 0. ] Since a + b + c = 0, this simplifies to [ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 27 = 0. ] Thus, [ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = -27. ] So, [ boxed{-27}. ]"},{"prompt":"Find the quadratic equation for numbers whose sum is 10 and the absolute value of whose difference is 6.

First, we check the divisibility by 3: - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. - Sum of the known digits of ( a1988b ) is ( a + 1 + 9 + 8 + 8 + b = a + b + 26 ).

We denote the functions as follows: [ f_1(x) = (x-b)(x-c) - (x-a), ] [ f_2(x) = (x-c)(x-a) - (x-b), ] [ f_3(x) = (x-a)(x-b) - (x-c). ] Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that two of these functions, say (f_1) and (f_2), have no roots. This implies the quadratic equations (f_1(x) = 0) and (f_2(x) = 0) have no real solutions. By the properties of quadratic functions, this would mean that these functions are either always positive or always negative. 1. **First Argument Using Sum of Functions:** Since (f_1(x)) and (f_2(x)) are both assumed to be without roots, both should be always above or below zero. Let's assume (f_1(x) > 0) and (f_2(x) > 0) for all (x) (similar arguments will apply if they are always negative). Consider their sum: [ f_1(x) + f_2(x) = (x-b)(x-c) - (x-a) + (x-c)(x-a) - (x-b). ] Simplifying, we get: [ f_1(x) + f_2(x) = (x-c)((x-b) + (x-a)) - ((x-a) + (x-b)), ] [ f_1(x) + f_2(x) = (x-c)(2x - a - b) - (2x - a - b), ] [ f_1(x) + f_2(x) = (2x - a - b)(x - c - 1). ] This expression is a quadratic polynomial in (x). But a quadratic polynomial must have at least one real root, simplifying: [ (2x - a - b)(x - (c + 1)) = 0 implies x = frac{a+b}{2} text{ or } x = c + 1. ] This means that (f_1(x) + f_2(x)) must have a real root, which contradicts the assumption that (f_1(x) > 0) and (f_2(x) > 0) for all (x). Hence, this assumption cannot hold. 2. **Second Argument Using Discriminants:** Since the discriminants of the quadratic equations must be negative if they have no real roots, we analyze the discriminants of (f_1(x)) and (f_2(x)). The discriminant of (f_1(x)) is: [ Delta_1 = (b+c+1)^2 - 4(bc + a). ] Since (f_1(x)) has no solutions, this must be less than zero: [ (b+c+1)^2 < 4(bc + a). ] Similarly, the discriminant of (f_2(x)) is: [ Delta_2 = (c+a+1)^2 - 4(ca + b). ] Since (f_2(x)) also has no solutions, this must be less than zero: [ (c+a+1)^2 < 4(ca + b). ] We can rewrite these inequalities as: [ (b-c-1)^2 < 4(a - b), quad text{and} quad (c-a+1)^2 < 4(b - a). ] Both sides of these inequalities cannot be simultaneously true if the right-hand sides are both positive. This leads to another contradiction because (a, b,) and (c) are distinct and make one or both inequalities impossible. From the contradiction in both arguments, our initial assumption that two of the functions (f_1, f_2, f_3) have no roots must be false.

We need to determine which player has a winning strategy, assuming optimal play from both players. 1. **Objective Analysis**: - The goal for the first player is to ensure that the sum of all digits is divisible by 11. - Conversely, the second player aims to ensure that the sum is not divisible by 11. - Thus, we need a strategy for the first player to achieve this divisibility condition, regardless of the second player’s actions. 2. **Divisibility Condition**: - For the sum to be divisible by 11, the sum modulo 11 (i.e., ( S mod 11 )) should be 0. - Let's analyze this sum at different steps to understand the required conditions. 3. **Optimal Strategy**: - **Final Condition**: For the sum to be divisible by 11 after 101 steps, the sum modulo 11 should be 0. - **Penultimate Step**: To ensure this, before the 101st step, we need control over the sum modulo 11. After 100 steps, if the sum is ( k mod 11 ), on the 101st step, the first player should be able to play such that the final sum ( (k + d) mod 11 = 0 ) where ( d ) is the digit played on the last turn. 4. **General Step Analysis**: - If the sum after 100 steps modulo 11 is any number except 1, the first player can adjust it to 0 by choosing an appropriate digit on the 101st move. - Therefore, the critical situation occurs one step before, at 99 steps. 5. **Backward Induction**: - At the 99th step, the first player should ensure the sum modulo 11 after the 99th step is any number except 2. - This would enable them to manage steps 100 and 101 effectively. 6. **Continuing Induction**: - If we continue this reasoning backward: - After 98 steps, the sum modulo 11 should not be 3. - After 97 steps, the sum modulo 11 should be 4. - Proceeding similarly, we determine that the first player has control over the sum modulo 11 at critical points, ensuring the sum modulo 11 reaches the desired state at their turn. 7. **Guaranteed Winning Strategy**: - Given that the first player can always adjust at their turn to avoid a losing condition in subsequent steps, they can ensure the sum divides by 11 after the last digit is placed. # Conclusion: The first player, by following the described strategy, can always win by ensuring the final sum of the digits in the 101 cells is divisible by 11.

How many workers of type A should be recruited to minimize the monthly wage paid by the company? What is the minimum monthly wage paid by the company in this case?","completion":"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of workers in type A as x. Consequently, the number of workers in type B can be represented as (150-x), given the total number of workers to be recruited is 150. Given the condition that the number of workers in type B should be at least twice the number of workers in type A, we can formulate the inequality: [150 - x geq 2x.] Rearranging the terms to solve for x, we get: [150 geq 3x implies x leq 50.] This means the maximum number of workers that can be recruited for type A to satisfy the given condition is 50. Next, we calculate the total monthly wage paid by the company, which is the sum of the wages for workers in types A and B. The total wage can be expressed as: [2000x + 3000(150-x).] Substituting the expression for total wage, we get: [2000x + 3000(150-x) = 2000x + 450000 - 3000x = 450000 - 1000x.] Since the total wage decreases as x increases (because of the negative coefficient of x in the equation), the minimum total wage occurs when x is at its maximum value under the given constraints, which is x = 50. Substituting x = 50 into the equation for total wage, we find: [450000 - 1000 times 50 = 450000 - 50000 = 400000.] However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the calculation of the total monthly wage in the provided solution.

Given that we started with 2 moles of C2H6, and we know that 1 mole of C2H6 produces 2 moles of HCl, we can conclude that all 2 moles of C2H6 reacted to form 4 moles of HCl (since 2 moles of C2H6 would produce 2 * 2 = 4 moles of HCl). However, the question states that only 2 moles of HCl were formed, not 4 moles. This indicates that there was not enough Cl2 to react with all 2 moles of C2H6. Since 1 mole of C2H6 requires 1 mole of Cl2 to produce 2 moles of HCl, and we only have 2 moles of HCl, it means that only 1 mole of C2H6 fully reacted.

This is feasible to construct and thus demonstrates that the bound is achievable. Therefore, the maximum number of cells in a primitive dinosaur is (boxed{8025})."},{"prompt":"The solution set for the inequality ax^2 + bx + 2 > 0 is (frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{3}). Find the value of ab.

Checking the work done and comparing with the options, it seems there is a miscalculation in the solution. Going back to equations (1) and (2), we correctly set up the equations for the sum and product of the roots, but erred in solving them. Let's correct that: From equation (1): -frac{5}{6} = -frac{b}{a} Multiplying both sides by a: -frac{5a}{6} = -b Thereby giving us the relationship b = frac{5a}{6}. From equation (2): -frac{1}{6} = frac{2}{a} Multiplying both sides by a and then by 6: -1 = 12 div a Which simplifies to a = -12. Substituting a = -12 into the relationship b = frac{5a}{6}, we get: b = frac{5 times (-12)}{6} b = -10 Hence, the values of a and b are -12 and -10, respectively. Now, calculating a - b: a - b = -12 - (-10) a - b = -12 + 10 a - b = -2 Once again, this result does not match the previously calculated answer or any of the given options. Therefore, there must still be an error in the calculation. Let’s go through the system of equations (1) and (2) again step by step: 1. From equation (1), we reconstruct the equation to find b in terms of a: -frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} = -frac{b}{a} -frac{3}{6} + frac{2}{6} = -frac{1}{6} = -frac{b}{a} b = frac{1}{6}a quad text{(6)} 2. From equation (2), we calculate the value of a: -frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{a} -frac{1}{6} = frac{2}{a} a = -12 quad text{(7)} 3. Now substituting a = -12 back into equation (6) to get the value of b: b = frac{1}{6} times (-12) b = -2 quad text{(8)} 4. We now have a = -12 and b = -2, and we find a - b: boxed{a - b = -12 - (-2) = -12 + 2 = -10} Therefore, according to the corrected calculations, a - b = -10, which corresponds to option A."},{"prompt":"Given A={1,3,m} and set B={3,4}.

We first identify the foci (focus points) of the ellipse by converting its equation to the standard form: [ frac{9x^2}{225} + frac{25y^2}{225} = 1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{9} = 1 ] Here, ( a^2 = 25 ) and ( b^2 = 9 ), so ( a = 5 ) and ( b = 3 ). 4. The distance between the foci of the ellipse is calculated using the formula ( 2c ), where ( c ) is given by ( c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} ): [ c = sqrt{25 - 9} = sqrt{16} = 4 ] Therefore, the distance between the foci of the ellipse: [ 2c = 2 times 4 = 8 ] 5. Next, we analyze the hyperbola with the equation: [ frac{x^2}{16-k} - frac{y^2}{k} = 1 ] 6. For the hyperbola, the distance between the two foci is given by ( 2a = 2sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). Here, [ a^2 = 16 - k ] and ( b^2 = k ). 7. Therefore, the distance between the foci is: [ 2a = 2sqrt{(16 - k) + k} = 2sqrt{16} = 2 times 4 = 8 ] 8. Since both the hyperbola and ellipse have the same distance between their foci, we need to ensure this condition holds. 9. From the above calculations, it is evident that: [ k neq 0 ] as ( k = 0 ) would lead to an undefined term in the hyperbola equation. 10. The hyperbola's foci distance calculation is valid for: [ k text{ can be any value from } (-infty, 0) cup (0, 16) ] Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for ( k ) to make the foci equal is: [ k in (-infty, 0) cup (0, 16) ] Consequently, the correct option is: [ boxed{A} ]"},{"prompt":"Maja decided to enter numbers into the cells of a 3 times 3 grid.

The problem is equivalent to having a complete graph with 9 vertices where each edge is colored either red or blue. One of the following will certainly exist: a red triangle or a completely blue quadrilateral. Similarly, one of the following will certainly exist: a completely red quadrilateral or a blue edge.","completion":"Let's analyze the problem step-by-step. We need to show that given any complete graph on 9 vertices, where each edge is colored either red or blue, there exists either a red triangle or a blue complete quadrilateral. 1. **Define the problem:** Let the 9 vertices be denoted by ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_9 ). We consider the complete graph on these 9 vertices where each edge is colored either red or blue. 2. **Initial Assumptions:** For such a graph, consider any vertex, say ( v_i ). This vertex has 8 edges connecting it to the remaining vertices ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_{i-1}, v_{i+1}, ldots, v_9 ). 3. **Observations:** Since each vertex connects to 8 other vertices, it is impossible for any vertex to have exactly 3 edges of one color and 5 edges of the other color because: [ 3 times 9 = 27 quad (text{if each vertex had exactly 3 edges of the same color}) ] This total must be an even number because each edge would be counted twice (once for each end), contradicting our assumption. 4. **Detailed Considerations:** At least one vertex, say ( v_i ), must have more than 3 edges of one color. Assume without loss of generality that ( v_i ) has at least 4 red edges. 5. **Case I: Red Edges Analysis** Assume the adjacent vertices connected by red edges are ( v_{a1}, v_{a2}, v_{a3}, v_{a4} ). We now analyze these vertices: - If any pair of these vertices (( v_{a1}, v_{a2}, v_{a3}, v_{a4} )) are connected by a red edge, say ( v_{a1}v_{a2} ) is red, then ( v_i, v_{a1}, v_{a2} ) forms a red triangle. - If none of these pairs are connected by a red edge, then all edges among ( v_{a1}, v_{a2}, v_{a3}, v_{a4} ) are blue. Thus, ( v_{a1}, v_{a2}, v_{a3}, v_{a4} ) forms a blue complete quadrilateral. 6. **Case II: Blue Edges Analysis** Conversely, suppose ( v_i ) has fewer than 3 red edges, implying it has at least 6 blue edges. Let these adjacent vertices connected by blue edges be ( v_{b1}, v_{b2}, v_{b3}, v_{b4}, v_{b5}, v_{b6} ). - Within these 6 vertices, any set of 4 will suffice to form either a blue triangle (if some edges are blue among them) or force a red complete quadrilateral otherwise. 7. **General Argument and Conclusion:** By the pigeonhole principle and the arguments above, in any complete graph on 9 vertices with two-color edge coloring, it's impossible to avoid forming either a monochromatic triangle or a complete quadrilateral in one color.

Strategy: - Each tourist checks their designated section and then moves to the next section only if all the rooms in their section are occupied or under renovation. Proof: 1. For even k = 2m: Each section contains m+1 rooms. Because there are 100 tourists, the total number of rooms needed is 100(m+1). Therefore: [ n geq 100(m+1) ] 2. For odd k = 2m + 1: Each section contains m+1 rooms, plus an additional spare room. This means a total of 100(m+1) + 1 rooms to ensure that there is always a spare room.

This follows from the fact that the indicator ( I_B(x, y) ) of any Borel set ( B ) in ( mathbb{R}^2 ) can be approximated by functions of the form ( f(x) g(y) ) (cf. Problem I.12.7). Therefore, any such ( Z = h(X, Y) ), where ( mathbb{E} |h(X, Y)|^2 < infty ), can be expanded in a Fourier series: [ Z = sum_{m, n geqslant 0} left(h, h_{mn}right) f_m(X) g_n(Y) ] which converges in ( L^2 = L^2(Omega, mathscr{F}, P) ).

This implies that both numbers in any such rectangle must be either both even or both odd. This is due to the property that the sum of two even or two odd numbers is always even, while the sum of one even and one odd number is odd. 3. **Vertical Columns Analysis:** Since each column consists of 6 cells, for each column to maintain this property (being composed entirely of even or entirely of odd numbers), all 6 numbers in a column must have the same parity (either all even or all odd). 4. **Total Number of Even and Odd Numbers:** The numbers from 1 to 42 include 21 even numbers and 21 odd numbers. Therefore, we must distribute these evenly. 5. **Column Count and Distribution Imbalance:** In the (6 times 7) grid, we have a total of 7 columns. - If we try to arrange such that each column is entirely even or entirely odd, necessarily: - We need an even number of columns for an even split between entirely even and entirely odd columns. - Each column contributing 6 numbers means we should ideally have an even split of columns between even and odd numbered cells. 6. **Contradiction:** However, since there are 7 columns (which is an odd number), it is impossible to split these 7 columns into an equal number of columns of entirely even and entirely odd numbers. This creates a contradiction because to satisfy the condition of each vertical (1 times 2) rectangle having an even sum, we must have an even split, which is not possible with 7 columns. 7. **Conclusion:** Thus, it is impossible to arrange the numbers from 1 to 42 in a (6 times 7) grid such that each (1 times 2) vertical rectangle has an even sum.

These choices depend on n but are designed to force her into suboptimal picks. Step 3: Sequential Moves Given each number must be >1 and <3 units from any previously picked number, the problem is strategically reduced to creating the most restrictive impacts on an opponent per move.

Consequently, the probability of the coin landing tails up is ( q = 1 - p ). 3. We are given that in 5 independent trials, the probability that heads comes up exactly 3 times is ( w = frac{144}{625} ). 4. The probability of getting heads exactly 3 times in 5 trials follows a binomial distribution. The required probability can be calculated using the binomial probability formula: [ P(X = k) = binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} ] 5. Here, ( n = 5 ) trials and ( k = 3 ) successes (heads). Therefore: [ binom{5}{3} p^3 (1-p)^{5-3} = frac{144}{625} ] 6. The binomial coefficient ( binom{5}{3} = frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10 ). Thus: [ 10 p^3 (1-p)^2 = frac{144}{625} ] 7. We now solve for ( p ): 8.

According to the given ratio of male to female employees, which is 3:2, we can write: M/F = 3/2 From this, we can express M in terms of F: M = (3/2) * F Now, we are given that 2/5 of all employees are managers. Let's denote the total number of employees as T. So, the total number of managers is (2/5) * T. We know that there are 200 female managers, so the number of male managers is (2/5) * T - 200. We are also given that 2/5 of all male employees are managers. So, the number of male managers is also (2/5) * M. Since these two expressions represent the same quantity (the number of male managers), we can set them equal to each other: (2/5) * M = (2/5) * T - 200 Now, we can substitute M with (3/2) * F in the above equation: (2/5) * (3/2) * F = (2/5) * T - 200 Simplify the left side: (3/5) * F = (2/5) * T - 200 Now, let's solve for T in terms of F: (3/5) * F + 200 = (2/5) * T Multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fractions: 3F + 1000 = 2T Now, we can express T in terms of F: T = (3/2) * F + 500 We know that T is the sum of male and female employees: T = M + F Substitute M with (3/2) * F: T = (3/2) * F + F Combine like terms: T = (5/2) * F Now, we can substitute T from the previous equation: (5/2) * F = (3/2) * F + 500 Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fractions: 5F = 3F + 1000 Subtract 3F from both sides: 2F = 1000 Divide both sides by 2: F = 500 So, there are 500 female employees.

For larger primes, consider the pairs of integers ( (x, y) ) such that ( 0 leq x, y leq lfloor sqrt{p} rfloor ). By the Pigeonhole Principle, there exist pairs ( (x_1, y_1) ) and ( (x_2, y_2) ) such that: [ x_1 - ry_1 equiv x_2 - ry_2 pmod{p} ] This implies: [ (x_1 - x_2) equiv r(y_1 - y_2) pmod{p} ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ p mid (x_1 - x_2)^2 + 5(y_1 - y_2)^2 = a^2 + 5b^2 ] where ( a = x_1 - x_2 ) and ( b = y_1 - y_2 ). Since ( a, b < sqrt{p} ), we have ( a^2 + 5b^2 < 6p ). The possible cases are: - If ( a^2 + 5b^2 = 5p ), then ( 5 mid a ) so ( p = b^2 + 5left(frac{a}{5}right)^2 ). - If ( a^2 + 5b^2 = 4p ), then ( 2 mid a, b ) so ( p = left(frac{a}{2}right)^2 + 5left(frac{b}{2}right)^2 ). - If ( a^2 + 5b^2 = 3p ), then: [ 2p = left(frac{a + 5b}{3}right)^2 + 5left(frac{a - b}{3}right)^2 = left(frac{a - 5b}{3}right)^2 + 5left(frac{a + b}{3}right)^2 ] One of these must be an integer solution. - If ( a^2 + 5b^2 = p ) or ( 2p ), we are done.

Thus, we can find corresponding ( a_p, b_p ) with ( a_p^2 + 5b_p^2 = p ) or ( 2p ). Doing this for every prime (with multiplicity) and multiplying all of them together, we get: [ 2^k n = x^2 + 5y^2 ] for some integers ( x, y, k ) with ( k geq 0 ). If ( k geq 2 ), then by mod 4 we will have ( 2 mid x, y ), reducing it to: [ 2^{k-2} n = left(frac{x}{2}right)^2 + 5left(frac{y}{2}right)^2 ] We can do this until ( k leq 1 ), which completes the proof of Claim 2. 3. **Claim 3:** If ( n ) is good, then ( n mid x^2 + 5y^2 ) for some integers ( x, y ). *Proof:* Since ( n ) is good, we can find integers ( a, b, c, x, y ) such that ( ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 = n ) and ( b^2 - 4ac = -20 ). Note that ( b ) is even, so let ( b = 2b_1 ). Then: [ ac = b_1^2 + 5 ] Thus: [ an = a^2x^2 + 2ab_1xy + acy^2 = a^2x^2 + 2ab_1xy + b_1^2y^2 + 5y^2 = (ax + b_1y)^2 + 5y^2 ] which proves the claim. 4. **Claim 4:** If ( n_1, n_2 ) are good, then so is ( n_1 n_2 ). *Proof:* From Claim 3, ( n_1 mid x_1^2 + 5y_1^2 ) and ( n_2 mid x_2^2 + 5y_2^2 ), so: [ n_1 n_2 mid (x_1^2 + 5y_1^2)(x_2^2 + 5y_2^2) = (x_1 x_2 - 5y_1 y_2)^2 + 5(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1)^2 ] By Claim 2, we can find ( i, j ) such that ( i^2 + 5j^2 = n_1 n_2 ) or ( 2n_1 n_2 ). In the former case, take ( (a, b, c, x, y) = (1, 0, 5, i, j) ), while in the latter case, take ( (a, b, c, x, y) = (2, 2, 3, frac{i - j}{2}, j) ). This completes the proof.

Notice that the equation can be solved by using the quadratic formula (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}). Here, (a = 1984^2), (b = -1983 cdot 1985), and (c = -1). 4. Calculate the discriminant (Delta = b^2 - 4ac): [ Delta = (-1983 cdot 1985)^2 - 4 cdot 1984^2 cdot (-1) ] Simplifying inside the discriminant: [ (-1983 cdot 1985)^2 + 4 cdot 1984^2 ] 5. It simplifies complex expressions. Importantly, recognize that (1) is a potential root because if we let (1984x = 1), then we get: [ (1)^2 - 1983 cdot 1985 cdot frac{1}{1984} - 1 = 0 ] 6. Hence, we recognize that (1984x = 1) must be a solution. Thus, one of the roots is (x = frac{1}{1984}). 7. Given that one root is positive and the sum of roots is a constant given by (-frac{b}{a}), the other root must be negative. Therefore, let (r = 1) for the positive root. 8. Moving to the second quadratic equation, (1983x^2 - 1984x + 1 = 0), we solve it using the quadratic formula similarly. Here, (a = 1983), (b = -1984), and (c = 1): [ s = frac{-(-1984) pm sqrt{(-1984)^2 - 4 cdot 1983 cdot 1}}{2 cdot 1983} ] 9. Calculate the discriminant (Delta = sqrt{1984^2 - 4 cdot 1983 cdot 1}): [ Delta = sqrt{1984^2 - 4 cdot 1983} ] [ = sqrt{1984^2 - 7932} = sqrt{3948416 - 7932} ] [ = sqrt{3940484} ] 10. Simplify the roots: [ s = frac{1984 pm sqrt{3940484}}{2 cdot 1983} ] Among these, the smaller root: [ s = frac{1984 - sqrt{3940484}}{2 cdot 1983} ] is approximately (frac{1}{1983}), thereby being close enough. 11. Finally, since (r = 1) and (s = frac{1}{1983}), we compute: [ r - s = 1 - frac{1}{1983} ] [ = frac{1983}{1983} - frac{1}{1983} ] [ = frac{1983 - 1}{1983} ] [ = frac{1982}{1983} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{C}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given 12 matches, each 2 cm in length.

Given that each of the three people can choose any team from the four with equal probability, the total number of possible choices is 4^3 since each person has 4 choices and there are 3 people. To find the number of ways exactly two teams can be chosen out of the four, we first choose 2 teams out of 4, and then distribute the 3 people among these 2 teams. The number of ways to choose 2 teams out of 4 is {C}_{4}^{2}. After choosing 2 teams, there are 3 ways to distribute 3 people among these 2 teams such that each team is chosen at least once (i.e., 2 people choose one team and 1 person chooses the other team). Therefore, the total number of ways to achieve event A is {C}_{4}^{2} times 3. Thus, the probability P(A) is given by: P(A) = frac{{C}_{4}^{2} times 3}{4^3} = frac{6 times 3}{64} = frac{18}{64} = frac{9}{32} However, the correct calculation for the number of ways to choose exactly two teams and distribute the people is {C}_{3}^{2}{A}_{4}^{2}, which accounts for the combinations of choosing 2 people out of 3 and arranging 2 teams out of 4.

This can happen in two scenarios: either the female fan chooses the German team, or one of the male fans does. The probability is: P(xi=1) = frac{1}{3} times left(frac{3}{5}right)^2 + frac{2}{3} times 2 times frac{2}{5} times frac{3}{5} = frac{3}{25} + frac{8}{25} = frac{11}{25} - For P(xi=2), exactly two people choose the German team.

When the train crosses a signal pole, it only needs to cover its own length, which is 300 meters. It does this in 18 seconds. Therefore, the speed of the train (v) can be calculated using the formula: v = distance / time v = 300 meters / 18 seconds v = 16.67 meters/second Now, when the train crosses the platform, it has to cover the length of itself plus the length of the platform. Let's call the length of the platform L. The total distance covered when crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform: Total distance = Length of train + Length of platform Total distance = 300 meters + L The time taken to cross the platform is given as 45 seconds. We can use the speed of the train to find the total distance covered in this time: Total distance = speed * time 300 meters + L = 16.67 meters/second * 45 seconds Now we can solve for L: 300 + L = 750 L = 750 - 300 L = 450 meters Therefore, the length of the platform is boxed{450} meters."},{"prompt":"Bob runs 6 miles per hour.

We are asked to find how many positive integers (2 leq a leq 101) have the property that there exists a positive integer (N) for which the last two digits in the decimal representation of (a^{2^n}) are the same for all (n geq N). 2. This means that (a^{2^N}) has a fixed last two digits for large (N). In other words, we want (a^{2^N} mod 100) to be constant for sufficiently large (N). 3. Consider all numbers modulo 100, we notice that we are looking for numbers which stabilize for a sufficiently large power of 2. Specifically, the behavior is studied through (a^k mod 100). First Approach: 4. Start by analyzing the numbers whose squares persist modulo 100: - Numbers whose last two digits stabilize are exactly those numbers (a) such that the sequence (a, a^2, a^{2^2}, a^{2^3}, dots) hits a fixed point. This means (a^{2^k} equiv a^{2^{k+1}} mod 100) starting from some power (k). 5. Check the fixed points by finding (x) such that: [ x equiv x^2 mod 100 ] This simplifies to: [ x(x-1) equiv 0 mod 100 ] So, (x = 0) or (x = 1 mod 100). 6. The fixed points give initial: - (x equiv 0 mod 5 Rightarrow) multiples of 5. - (x equiv 1, 25, 76, 49). 7. For each root modulo 5: [ x^2 equiv 0, 25 mod 100. ] These contribute multiples of 5, resulting in 20 values. 8. For root 1 modulo 5: - Values are: ( 1, 49, 51, 99). - Further evaluate: (49 mod 100) yields (7, 43, 57, 93). - Values cumulatively add up to 16 unique numbers. 9. Summarize totals: - Fixed points (0, 25) lead to multiples of 5 (10 numbers). - (49) and others produce an additional set of 16 numbers. Modular Approach: 10. Consider numbers modulo 4 and 25 separately via the Chinese Remainder Theorem. - Mod 4: All remainder classes 0, 1, 2, 3 work since (a^2 = a mod 4). - Mod 25: Focus on primitives, leads to 5 options contributing to 4 solutions. 11.

A: The maximum value of g(x) is 2 B: [frac{5π}{12}, frac{π}{12}] is an increasing interval of g(x) C: (frac{5π}{6}, 1) is a center of symmetry of the graph of g(x) D: x=frac{π}{6} is an axis of symmetry of the graph of g(x)","completion":"To analyze the transformation of the function f(x) = sin x into g(x), we follow the transformations step by step: 1. **Halving the Abscissa**: The transformation that halves the abscissa of each point on the graph of f(x) = sin x results in the function y = sin(2x). This is because halving the abscissa effectively doubles the frequency of the sine function. 2. **Shifting Left and Up**: Shifting the graph of y = sin(2x) to the left by frac{pi}{6} units and up by 1 unit results in the function g(x) = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) + 1. Now, let's analyze the given options: **Option A**: To find the maximum value of g(x), we set sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) = 1 because the sine function reaches its maximum at 1. Substituting into g(x) gives g(x) = 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the maximum value of g(x) is indeed 2. Hence, boxed{text{A is correct}}. **Option B**: To determine if [-frac{5pi}{12}, frac{pi}{12}] is an increasing interval of g(x), we consider the derivative of sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}).

Hence, boxed{text{B is correct}}. **Option C**: To check if (frac{5pi}{6}, 1) is a center of symmetry, we evaluate g(frac{5pi}{6}). We find that sin(2 times frac{5pi}{6} + frac{pi}{3}) = sin(2pi) = 0, so g(frac{5pi}{6}) = 0 + 1 = 1. This means that (frac{5pi}{6}, 1) is indeed a center of symmetry for the graph of g(x). Hence, boxed{text{C is correct}}. **Option D**: To determine if x = -frac{pi}{6} is an axis of symmetry, we evaluate g(-frac{pi}{6}). We find that g(-frac{pi}{6}) = sin(2 times (-frac{pi}{6}) + frac{pi}{3}) + 1 = sin(0) + 1 = 1. Since an axis of symmetry would require the function to mirror on either side, and this condition does not specifically establish such a symmetry for all points, x = -frac{pi}{6} being an axis of symmetry is not directly supported by this calculation.

So: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (k-1) = frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} ] Since (n) can be rolled in one of three positions, the total number of ways is: [ frac{3(n-1)(n-2)}{2} ] - If (n) gets rolled twice, then the number that isn't (n) has (n-1) options, so the total number of ways is: [ 3(n-1) ] - If (n) gets rolled three times, there's 1 way. Thus, the recursive formula for (f(n)) is: [ f(n) = f(n-1) + frac{3(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 3(n-1) + 1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ f(n) = f(n-1) + frac{3n(n-1)}{2} + 1 ] 4. **Base case**: For (f(1)), there is only one way to roll the die three times to get three 1's, which does not form a valid triangle. So: [ f(1) = 0 ] 5. **Calculating (f(20))**: We need to compute (f(20)) using the recursive formula. This involves summing up the contributions from each (n) from 2 to 20: [ f(20) = sum_{k=2}^{20} left( frac{3k(k-1)}{2} + 1 right) ] Simplifying the sum: [ f(20) = sum_{k=2}^{20} frac{3k(k-1)}{2} + sum_{k=2}^{20} 1 ] [ f(20) = frac{3}{2} sum_{k=2}^{20} k(k-1) + 19 ] [ sum_{k=2}^{20} k(k-1) = sum_{k=2}^{20} (k^2 - k) = left( sum_{k=1}^{20} k^2 - 1^2 right) - left( sum_{k=1}^{20} k - 1 right) ] Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of the first (n) integers: [ sum_{k=1}^{20} k^2 = frac{20 cdot 21 cdot 41}{6}, quad sum_{k=1}^{20} k = frac{20 cdot 21}{2} ] [ sum_{k=2}^{20} k(k-1) = frac{20 cdot 21 cdot 41}{6} - 1 - left( frac{20 cdot 21}{2} - 1 right) ] [ = frac{2870}{6} - 1 - 210 + 1 = 3990 ] [ f(20) = frac{3}{2} cdot 3990 + 19 = 5985 + 19 = 6004 ] 6. **Probability**: The probability that the three recorded outcomes are sides of a triangle is: [ frac{f(20)}{8000} = frac{6004}{8000} = frac{3002}{4000} = frac{1501}{2000} ] 7. **Finding (a + b)**: Since (a = 1501) and (b = 2000), we have: [ a + b = 1501 + 2000 = 3501 ] The final answer is (boxed{3501})."},{"prompt":"Given proposition p: There exists x in mathbb{R}, such that tan(x) = 1, and proposition q: The solution set of x^2 3x + 2 < 0 is {x | 1 < x < 2}.

This triangle is rotated about its center by an angle ( theta ), where ( theta < 120^circ ) and ( theta = frac{1}{n} cdot 360^circ ) for integer ( n ). After the rotation, the triangle assumes a new position ( B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} ). 2. We need to investigate the relationship between the sides of the triangles ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} ) and ( B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} ). 3. Note that ( A_{2} B_{2} ), ( A_{3} B_{1} ), and ( A_{1} B_{3} ) are segments connecting corresponding vertices of the original and rotated triangles. 4. These segments are parallel to each other due to the symmetrical nature of a regular triangle and the equal rotation angle between any two sides. 5. As we rotate ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} ) by ( theta ), the segments ( A_{2} B_{2} ), ( A_{3} B_{1} ), and ( A_{1} B_{3} ) are equal because each pair of corresponding points on the boundary of the triangles is separated by the same rotational distance. 6. Connect these segments: this forms a hexagon by joining ( A_{1} ) to ( B_{1} ), ( A_{2} ) to ( B_{2} ), and ( A_{3} ) to ( B_{3} ). Due to the regularity and the symmetry of the rotation, the newly formed hexagon ( A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} ) is regular and its sides are equal. 7. To prove the equal sides and the symmetry about the center, note that for any rotation with ( theta ), we have pairs of points in the rotated triangle that map back directly to their original points in the previous rotation steps. 8. This newly formed figure has rotational symmetry because rotating each vertex around the center by subsequent angles equal to ( theta ), ( 2theta ), etc., we cover all positions around the center, maintaining the equal spacing due to the regularity and identical rotations. 9. Hence, the sides of the hexagon are all equal, and since it can be inscribed inside a circle, all vertices are equidistant from the center. 10. By extension, if the original figure is an ( n )-sided polygon, the arguments above hold where ( 2n )-sided polygons (constituted of pairs of corresponding vertices) must also have properties of equal side lengths due to symmetrical rotations by smallest possible subdivision of ( 360^circ ).

Then there exists a positive integer ( k = k(b,c) ) such that the coefficients of [ (x^2 - bx + c)(x + 1)^k ] are all non-negative integers. **Proof of the Lemma:** Expanding the expression, [ left(x^2 - bx + cright) (x+1)^k = left(x^2 - bx + cright) sum_{i=0}^{k} binom{k}{i} x^{k-i} ] By distributing (left( x^2 - bx + c right)) across the binomial expansion, [ = sum_{i=0}^{k} left( c binom{k}{i} x^{k-i} - b binom{k}{i} x^{k-i+1} + binom{k}{i} x^{k-i+2}right) ] Grouping the terms by powers of (x), [ = sum_{t=-1}^{k+1} left( c binom{k}{t-1} - b binom{k}{t} + binom{k}{t+1} right) x^{k-t+1} ] where we define ( binom{k}{i} = 0 ) for ( i < 0 ) or ( i > k ).

To find z, we solve for it by isolating z on one side of the equation. 2. **Solving for z**: - z = frac{2}{1+i} - To rationalize the denominator, multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: - z = frac{2}{1+i} cdot frac{1-i}{1-i} = frac{2(1-i)}{1^2 - i^2} = frac{2(1-i)}{2} = 1-i - Thus, we find that z = 1-i.

Hence, option B is correct. 4. **Calculating |z|**: - To find the magnitude of z, denoted as |z|, we use the formula |z| = sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, where z = x + yi. - For z = 1-i, we have x=1 and y=-1. Therefore, |z| = sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{2}. This means option C is correct. 5. **Considering z as a Root of the Equation x^2 - px + 2 = 0**: - We have established that z = 1-i. If z is a root of the equation x^2 - px + 2 = 0, then its conjugate overline{z} = 1+i is also a root. - By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the equation x^2 - px + 2 = 0 is equal to p. Therefore, z + overline{z} = (1-i) + (1+i) = 2, which implies p = 2. Hence, option D is correct. Based on the analysis and calculations, the correct options are B, C, and D.

For f(x) to be decreasing across R, the derivatives of each piece must be negative or zero (indicating non-increasing behavior), and the transition at x = 1 must be smooth in the sense that the function does not start increasing again. **Step 1: Analyzing the first piece, f(x) = a^x + 1 for x < 1.** - The derivative f'(x) = ln(a) cdot a^x. - For f'(x) to be non-positive, since a^x > 0 for all x when a > 0, we need ln(a) leq 0, which implies 0 < a leq 1. **Step 2: Analyzing the second piece, f(x) = -x^2 + (2a+1)x - 4a + 2 for x geq 1.** - This is a quadratic function, which is concave down (since the coefficient of x^2 is negative).

So, we find two cells with numbers differing by more than 23 and distance less than 150 units. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{These two cells are the solution we seek.}} ] **Variant B:** 1. **Construction of Larger Square:** Let’s consider any larger square with side length 66. Again, call this the larger square. 2. **Partition the Larger Square:** Divide this larger square into 36 smaller squares each of side length 11. 3. **Placement of Number Inside Smaller Squares:** The center of a square with a number which is within 5 units from the center of any smaller square ensures the presence of the numbered cell within these smaller squares. 4. **Non-overlapping Property:** Since the smaller squares do not overlap, the larger square contains at least 36 numbered cells. 5. **Difference of Numbers:** The difference between the smallest and largest numbers in these 36 cells is at least 35 - 0 = 35 which is greater than 23. 6. **Distance between Numbered Cells:** The distance between any two cells within the larger square is less than 66 sqrt{2} approx 93.3 < 100. Hence, we find two cells with numbers differing by more than 23 and distance less than 150 units. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{These two cells are the solution we seek.}} ] # Additional Commentary: - The size of the squares (both larger and smaller) can vary. For instance, in the first variant, we could use smaller squares of size 19 times 19 instead. - This means the solution scales appropriately with different division strategies provided the basic constraints are maintained.

Consider a sequence ({x_i}_{i=0}^n ) that is convex, meaning (x_{i} + x_{i+2} geq 2 x_{i+1}) for all valid (i). We need to show: [ frac{sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i binom{n}{i}}{2^n} leq frac{sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i}{n+1} ] 2. **Derive an Equivalent Expression:** This inequality is equivalent to: [ (n+1) sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i binom{n}{i} leq 2^n sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i ] 3. **Proof for Odd (n = 2k + 1):** When (n = 2k + 1) is odd, by symmetry and convexity, we can pair terms: [ x_0 + x_n geq x_1 + x_{n-1} geq cdots geq x_k + x_{k+1} ] Next, consider the binomial coefficients: [ binom{n}{0} leq binom{n}{1} leq cdots leq binom{n}{k} = binom{n}{k+1} geq cdots geq binom{n}{n} ] 4. **Apply Chebyshev's Sum Inequality:** Using Chebyshev's inequality for sums of products of elements from two sequences ordered in the same manner: [ (n+1) sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i binom{n}{i} = frac{1}{2} (n+1) sum_{i=0}^{n}(x_i + x_{n-i})binom{n}{i} ] By applying Chebyshev’s inequality: [ (n+1) sum_{i=0}^{k}(x_i + x_{n-i})binom{n}{i} leq (n+1) cdot frac{1}{k+1} left(sum_{i=0}^{k}(x_i + x_{n-i})right) cdot left(sum_{i=0}^{k}binom{n}{i}right) ] Recognize that: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{n}{i} = 2^n ] Combining the results, we see: [ frac{1}{2} left(sum_{i=0}^{n}(x_i + x_{n-i})right) cdot 2^n leq 2^n sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i ] 5. **Extending to Even (n):** Similar arguments can be extended to the case where (n) is even. 6. **Apply the Lemma to the Original Problem:** For the sequence ({a^i b^{n-i}}_{i=0}^n), observe: [ a^i b^{n-i} + a^{i+2} b^{n-i-2} geq 2 a^{i+1} b^{n-i-1} ] This implies the sequence is convex.

The vertex ( x ) represents the village on the island and is connected to all other vertices in ( K_{m,n} ). The edges are labeled with positive integers. 2. **Assumption and Set Definition:** Assume that the claim holds, i.e., for every vertex ( v ), the set of edge labels incident to ( v ) forms a sequence of consecutive integers. Let ( S(v) ) be the set of edge labels incident to ( v ). Without loss of generality, assume ( S(x) = {1, 2, dots, m+n} ). 3. **Greatest Common Divisor:** Let ( d = gcd(m+1, n+1) ).

Part (2): To determine if an isosceles triangle can be formed with one side of 4 cm, we consider two cases: **Case 1:** One leg is 4 cm. If one leg is 4 cm, then the total length of the other two sides (the base and the other leg) would be 20 - 4 = 16 cm. However, for any two sides of a triangle, the sum of their lengths must be greater than the length of the third side. Here, 4 + 4 = 8 cm, which is less than the remaining length (which would be the base), making it impossible to form a triangle. This case is therefore not possible. **Case 2:** The base is 4 cm. If the base is 4 cm, then the total length for the two legs would be 20 - 4 = 16 cm. Since it's an isosceles triangle, the two legs are equal in length, so each leg would be frac{1}{2} times 16 = 8 cm.

Every two consecutive elements of any subset have different parity. 2. If A_1, A_2, A_3 are all nonempty, then exactly one of them has an even minimal number. We will use a combinatorial approach to count the valid partitions. 1. **Partitioning into Consecutive Strings**: We start by noting that the condition on parity implies that each subset must alternate between odd and even numbers. This means that each subset can be represented as a sequence of consecutive integers. For example, a valid subset could be {1, 2, 3, 4}, but not {1, 3, 5}. 2. **Bijection with Consecutive Strings**: We claim that valid partitions are in bijection with partitions of {1, ldots, n} into consecutive strings of integers.

We need to show that ( lim_{n to infty} nx_n = 1 ). 2. First, observe that ( x_n ) tends to 0 as ( n to infty ). This can be shown by noting that ( x_{n+1} = x_n(1 - x_n) < x_n ) for ( 0 < x_n < 1 ). Hence, ( x_n ) is a decreasing sequence bounded below by 0, implying ( x_n to 0 ). 3.
