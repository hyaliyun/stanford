Suppose (O) is the center of a sphere with radius (R) that intersects the edges (A_{2}A_{3}, A_{3}A_{1},) and (A_{2}A_{1}) at points (P_{1}, P_{2},) and (P_{3}) respectively. 2. Let (r_1, r_2, r_3,) and (r_4) be the radii of the spheres centered at (A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3},) and (A_{4}) respectively. 3. It is known that the distances from the vertices to the points of intersection (A_{3}P_{1}=A_{3}P_{2}=r_{3}, A_{4}P_{3}=A_{4}P_{2}=r_{4},) and (A_{2}P_{1}=A_{2}P_{3}=r_{2}). 4.

Thus, all the radii (r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3},) and (r_{4}) are equal, implying that all edges of the tetrahedron are equal. 10.

At first glance, this seems like the Pigeonhole Principle might not apply because the number of pigeonholes equals the number of pigeons. 4. **Additional Insight**: - Notice that it is impossible for one person to know exactly ( n-1 ) others (this would mean they know everyone else) while another person knows exactly ( 0 ) others (meaning they know no one). This is because if one person knows everyone, every other person must know at least that one person. 5. **Reduction in Pigeonholes**: - The scenario where both a person knows everybody else ( ( n-1 ) acquaintances) and another person knows nobody ( ( 0 ) acquaintances) is contradictory in a mutual acquaintanceship structure. - Therefore, at least one of these pigeonholes (0 or ( n-1 )) cannot be used simultaneously.

This implies Bob must alter his grid such that at least one of the integers in each row does not match precisely how the numbers appear in Alice's grids. 5. **Swapping to Ensure Victory**: If Bob initially has ( A_0 ) and any of ( A_1 ) to ( A_{2010} ) is among Alice's grids, he can always swap the according elements to create ( A_k ), which ensures the necessary condition where integers in the same columns of Bob's grid. 6. **Analysis with Pigeonhole Principle**: By the pigeonhole principle, not all ( 2011 times 2011 ) grids might exist as Alice's grids. - Suppose any grid ( A_k ) is not among Alice’s grids. - Upon checking, Bob can rearrange his grid ( A_0 ) to ( A_k ) by making a single swap.

But since S is the midpoint of the segment VC, it suffices to show that the lines BV and IS are parallel. 6. **Angle Properties of Cyclic Quadrilateral:** Since the quadrilateral BYIV is cyclic: [ angle VBI = angle VYI = angle YIA = 90^circ ] This implies that BV is the external angle bisector of the angle ABC, which yields: [ angle VAC = angle VCA ] Therefore: [ 2alpha - x = 2gamma + x Rightarrow alpha = gamma + x ] Hence, angle SCI = alpha, so angle VSI = 2alpha. 7. **Parallel Lines Verification:** On the other hand: [ angle BVC = 180^circ - angle BAC = 180^circ - 2alpha ] which implies that the lines BV and IS are parallel.

Now, we want to solve for z. To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 1+i: z = frac{|1+ sqrt{3}i|}{1+i} = frac{2}{1+i}.

Let the side lengths of the smaller squares be (a) and (b) and the side length of the large square be (c). 2. The area of the large square can be expressed as (c^2). 3. The total area can also be expressed as the sum of (n) smaller squares each with area (a^2) and (n) larger squares each with area (b^2). 4. Therefore, the equation for the areas is, [ c^2 = n cdot a^2 + n cdot b^2 ] 5. By factoring out (n), we rearrange it as, [ c^2 = n left( a^2 + b^2 right) ] 6. By finding an example where the equation (5^2 = 4^2 + 3^2) holds, we verify that the sums of square numbers fit our original equation. 7. To generalize, we can multiply the equation (5^2 = 4^2 + 3^2) by enough factors (i.e., (k^2)) to yield a feasible solution. 8. Setting (n = 9), (a = 4), (b = 3), and (c = 15) satisfies (c^2 = n left( a^2 + b^2 right)). [ 15^2 = 9 left( 4^2 + 3^2 right) ] 9.

The configuration for these squares is demonstrated in the referenced image. **Second Solution:** 1. We can construct a rectangle using smaller and larger squares as mentioned. 2. Suppose we use squares of size (2 times 2) and (1 times 1). 3. Construct a rectangle of size (5 times 2) using these squares. 4. When arranging 10 such rectangles, we can form a larger square of size (10 times 10). 5. This method allows for numerous other solutions as we scale the constructions or use different combinations of sizes. In both cases, we demonstrate possible solutions for dividing a single large square into an equal number of smaller squares of two different sizes. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"wo pipes a and b can separately fill a cistern in 45 minutes and 60 minutes respectively . there is a third pipe in the bottom of the cistern to empty it . if all the three pipes are simultaneously opened , then the cistern is full in 40 minutes . in how much time , the third pipe alone can empty the cistern ?","completion":"Let's denote the rate at which pipe A fills the cistern as A, the rate at which pipe B fills the cistern as B, and the rate at which the third pipe (let's call it C) empties the cistern as C. Pipe A can fill the cistern in 45 minutes, so its rate is 1/45 cistern per minute. Pipe B can fill the cistern in 60 minutes, so its rate is 1/60 cistern per minute. When all three pipes are open, the cistern fills in 40 minutes. This means that the combined rate of pipes A and B minus the rate of pipe C equals the rate of filling the cistern when all three are open, which is 1/40 cistern per minute. So, we have the equation: A + B - C = 1/40 Substituting the rates of A and B, we get: (1/45) + (1/60) - C = 1/40 To solve for C, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 45, 60, and 40 is 360. So we convert the fractions: (8/360) + (6/360) - C = 9/360 Now, combine the fractions on the left side: (8 + 6)/360 - C = 9/360 14/360 - C = 9/360 Subtract 14/360 from both sides to isolate C: -C = 9/360 - 14/360 -C = -5/360 C = 5/360 Now, we have the rate at which pipe C empties the cistern, which is 5/360 cisterns per minute. To find out how long it takes for pipe C to empty the cistern, we take the reciprocal of the rate: Time for C to empty the cistern = 1 / (5/360) = 360/5 = 72 minutes Therefore, the third pipe alone can empty the cistern in boxed{72} minutes."},{"prompt":"Abigail spent 60% of her money on food, and 25% of the remainder on her phone bill.

Therefore, the total amount she had before spending on entertainment is: [ 20 + 40 = 60 ] 2. **Determine the percentage of money left after paying for the phone bill**: The 60 represents 75% of the money Abigail had after spending on food. This is because she spent 25% of the remainder on her phone bill, leaving her with: [ 100% - 25% = 75% ] 3. **Calculate the total amount after spending on food**: Since 75% is equivalent to 60, we find the value of 1% by dividing 60 by 75: [ 60 / 75 = 0.80 ] Therefore, the total amount she had after spending on food (100%) is: [ 0.80 times 100 = 80 ] 4. **Determine the original amount of money**: The 80 represents 40% of her original money because she spent 60% of it on food.

The prime factorization of 5 is just 5 (since it's a prime number), and the prime factorization of 8 is 2^3 (since 8 = 2 × 2 × 2). The LCM is found by taking the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in the factorization of each number. In this case, we have 5 (from 5) and 2^3 (from 8).

Show that P_{(m)} = frac{1}{m!}left(1+sum_{j=1}^{nm} frac{(1)^{j}}{j!}right)","completion":"1. **Understanding the Random Assignment:** First, let's understand what is meant by the phrase \\"letters are allocated to envelopes in a 'random way'.\\" This indicates that each letter is assigned to an envelope randomly. For example: - Letter number 1 could be placed in any one of the (n) envelopes. - Letter number 2 could be placed in any one of the remaining (n-1) envelopes, and so on. Given this, such a procedure can be considered as a \\"choice without replacement,\\" which aligns with classically assigning probabilities where the order of letter and envelope assignments corresponds to an ordered set ((a_1, ldots, a_n)) of envelope numbers. 2. **Total Number of Assignments:** The total number of different ordered sets ((a_1, ldots, a_n)) will be (n!) (the factorial of (n)). According to the classical principle of \\"equally likely outcomes,\\" the probability of obtaining a specific ordered set ((a_1, ldots, a_n)) is: [ frac{1}{n!} ] 3. **Event Definition and Probability:** Let (A_i) be the event that the (i)-th letter ends up in the (i)-th envelope. We need to find the probability (P_{(m)}) that exactly (m) out of the (n) letters end up in their corresponding envelopes. 4. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Using the inclusion-exclusion principle and the notation from combinatorial problems, we recognize that: [ P_{(m)} = mathrm{P}left(B_mright) ] where (B_m) is the event that exactly (m) letters are in their correct envelopes. The inclusion-exclusion principle provides the formula: [ P_{(m)} = sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^{k-m} binom{k}{m} S_k ] Here, (S_k) represents the probability that exactly (k) letters end up in their correct envelopes (derangement problem). 5. **Derangements:** Analogously, by solving the derangement problem (the number of ways to place (k) items so that no item is in its correct position), we achieve: [ S_k = frac{1}{k!} ] 6. **Substituting (S_k) in the Formula:** Plugging the value of (S_k) into the inclusion-exclusion formula: [ P_{(m)} = sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^{k-m} binom{k}{m} frac{1}{k!} ] 7. **Simplifying the Expression:** To simplify our final expression, we need to recognize that the sum (sum_{j=1}^{n-m}) naturally emerges from this simplification: [ P_{(m)} = frac{1}{m!} left(1 + sum_{j=1}^{n-m} frac{(-1)^j}{j!}right) ] This follows from the set formations and manipulations within the inclusion-exclusion principle with the inclusion of derangements calculable as we derived. 8. **Conclusion:** Thus, the probability (P_{(m)}) that exactly (m) letters go into their correct envelopes is given by: [ P_{(m)} = frac{1}{m!}left(1 + sum_{j=1}^{n-m} frac{(-1)^j}{j!}right) ] Conclusively, the probability is boxed as: [ boxed{frac{1}{m!}left(1 + sum_{j=1}^{n-m} frac{(-1)^j}{j!}right)} ]"},{"prompt":"An equilateral triangle of side x has its vertices on the sides of a square side 1 .

We need to find the possible side lengths (x) of an equilateral triangle whose vertices lie on the sides of this square. 2. **Positioning the vertices of the equilateral triangle:** Let's denote the vertices of the equilateral triangle as (P), (Q), and (R). We need to consider different cases based on the positioning of these vertices on the sides of the square. 3. **Case 1: One vertex on each side:** Suppose one vertex (P) is on side (AB), another vertex (Q) is on side (BC), and the third vertex (R) is on side (CD). We need to find the coordinates of these points and the side length (x). 4. **Using coordinate geometry:** Let (P(a,0)) be on (AB), (Q(1,b)) be on (BC), and (R(c,1)) be on (CD). Since (PQR) is an equilateral triangle, the distances (PQ), (QR), and (RP) must all be equal to (x). 5. **Distance formula application:** Using the distance formula, we have: [ PQ = sqrt{(1-a)^2 + b^2} = x ] [ QR = sqrt{(1-c)^2 + (1-b)^2} = x ] [ RP = sqrt{c^2 + (1-0)^2} = x ] 6. **Simplifying the equations:** We need to solve these equations simultaneously to find the possible values of (x). However, this system of equations is complex and may not yield a simple analytical solution. Instead, we can use geometric properties and symmetry to simplify our approach. 7. **Geometric properties:** Consider the symmetry of the problem. The maximum side length of the equilateral triangle will occur when the vertices are positioned such that the triangle is inscribed in the square. The side length of the inscribed equilateral triangle can be found using the relationship between the side length of the square and the side length of the inscribed equilateral triangle. 8. **Inscribed equilateral triangle:** The side length (x) of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a square of side length 1 can be derived using trigonometry. The height (h) of the equilateral triangle is given by: [ h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x ] Since the height of the equilateral triangle must fit within the side length of the square, we have: [ frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x = 1 implies x = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ] 9. **Conclusion:** The possible value of (x) for an equilateral triangle inscribed in a square of side length 1 is (frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}).

We need to determine the minimum number of weighings required to identify these two lighter coins using scales that show the total weight in grams. 1. **Initial Observations**: A weighing of any group of coins can result in one of three outcomes based on the presence of lighter coins: - No light coins in the group: 10 cdot k grams - One light coin in the group: 10 cdot k - 1 grams - Two light coins in the group: 10 cdot k - 2 grams Here, k is the number of coins being weighed. 2. **Possible Outcomes**: From the above point, any weighing can distinguish between the three outcomes mentioned. 3. **Determining the Minimum Weighings**: - Suppose there are n coins in total. Since each weighing can have three unique outcomes, and we need to identify two specific positions among n coins, we can represent each possible outcome as a unique combination resulting from different weighings. - The total number of binary distinctions we need to make is binom{n}{2} because we aim to find two specific adjacent coins out of the n coins. - However, it's more straightforward in this problem to determine adjacent pairs only. This leads to a pattern and reduces the number of comparisons. 4. **Combining and Weighing**: - By symmetry and adjacency, if we group the coins logically, we can reduce the total number of scrutinies required. 5. Let's now set up the effective strategy using three weighings: - **First Weighing**: Divide the coins into two groups, each with half the total number of coins (assuming n is even, if odd, adjust the groups accordingly). Weigh the first group. This helps us detect if the lighter coins are in one specific group or spread out. - Outcomes here will indicate either one group has lighter ones, or they’re spread across groups. - **Second Weighing**: Focus on one of the groups that potentially have lighter coins. Divide this group into two equal subgroups and weigh one. Again, observe the outcomes. - If the second set indicates singles or doubles of lightweights within a subgroup, it narrows down further. - **Third Weighing**: Use the same logic but more narrowly focus on fewer coins (likely four or fewer) to pinpoint exactly which pair among the minimal close-knit group is lighter. - Final distinguishing between the adjacent pairs based on the total weight differentials. 6. **Conclusion**: By performing targeted, sequential weighings, setting focus based on the outcomes, and logically splitting the groups, three weighings are sufficient to determine the lighter pair with certainty. Therefore, the minimum number of weighings required to identify the two lighter coins is: [ boxed{3} ]"},{"prompt":"Let A be a 2ntimes 2n matrix, with entries chosen independently at random.

Since ( A ) is a ( 2n times 2n ) matrix with entries chosen independently at random to be either 0 or 1 with equal probability, the entries of ( X ) are given by: [ x_{i,j} = a_{i,j} - a_{j,i} ] where ( a_{i,j} ) are the entries of ( A ). Note that ( x_{i,j} = -x_{j,i} ), making ( X ) a skew-symmetric matrix. 2. The determinant of a skew-symmetric matrix of odd order is zero. Since ( X ) is a ( 2n times 2n ) skew-symmetric matrix, we need to find the expected value of ( det(X) ). 3. The determinant of ( X ) can be expressed as: [ det(X) = sum_{P in S_{2n}} (-1)^{text{inv}(P)} prod_{i=0}^{2n-1} x_{i,P(i)} ] where ( S_{2n} ) is the symmetric group of ( 2n ) elements and ( text{inv}(P) ) is the number of inversions in the permutation ( P ). 4.

This implies that ( P ) must consist of disjoint transpositions. 6. For a permutation ( P ) to consist of disjoint transpositions, it must satisfy ( P(P(x)) = x ) and ( P(x) neq x ). Thus, we can rewrite the expectation as: [ mathbb{E}[det(X)] = sum_{substack{P in S_{2n} P(P(x)) = x P(x) neq x}} (-1)^{text{inv}(P)} mathbb{E}left[prod_i x_{i,P(i)} x_{P(i),i}right] ] 7.

So, we get T = frac{2pi}{2} = pi. Hence, the smallest positive period of f(x) is boxed{pi}. (II) Proof: Since x in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right], it follows that -frac{pi}{3} leq 2x - frac{pi}{3} leq frac{2pi}{3}. Consequently, sin(2x - frac{pi}{3}) geq sinleft(-frac{pi}{3}right) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Since the sine function is greater than or equal to its value at -frac{pi}{3} in the specified domain, and f(x) = sqrt{3}sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{3}right) + 1 geq sqrt{3}left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) + 1 = -frac{3}{2}+ 1 = -frac{1}{2}, we have that f(x) geq -frac{1}{2}. Thus, for x in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right], the inequality f(x) geq -frac{1}{2} holds, and the proof is completed with boxed{f(x) geq -frac{1}{2}} for the given domain."},{"prompt":"Let's consider the sequence where the following rules apply: 1. If a term (a_n) is even, it is divided by 2 in the next term. 2. If a term (a_n) is odd, the next term is calculated by the formula (a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 1). Given this sequence, let's find out what happens when (a_n) is expressed in terms of modulo 4.

Continue: [a_{n+6} = 3^{m+1} k' + (3^{m+1} 1)] Following the same pattern, as (k') reduces to less than half of (k) each step, eventually a term in the sequence will be divisible by 4.","completion":"***First Solution (Patient Contemplation):*** To understand the sequence, let's analyze the operations performed on its terms. 1. Whenever an even term appears in the sequence, the first rule is applied, which is to halve the term until it becomes odd. 2. Let's analyze what happens when the sequence forms with an odd term a_{n}: * Suppose a_{n} is odd. If a_{n} upon division by 4 leaves a remainder of 1, i.e., a_{n} = 4k + 1, then a_{n+1} = 3a_{n} + 1 = 3(4k + 1) + 1 = 12k + 4, which is divisible by 4. 3. Let's consider the case where a_{n} upon division by 4 leaves a remainder of 3, i.e., a_{n} = 4k + 3. We compute the next few terms as follows: * a_{n+1} = 3a_{n} + 1 = 3(4k + 3) + 1 = 12k + 10 * a_{n+2} = 2(6k + 5) = 6k + 5 * a_{n+3} = 3(6k + 5) + 1 = 18k + 16, which is divisible by 4. * If k is even, 18k + 16 is divisible by 4, thus further terms will follow this pattern making the analysis valid. Hence, we assume k is odd. 4. Let's generalize the pattern for m iterations. Let m = 2, thus we have: [ a_{n+4} = 3^m k + left(3^m - 1right) ] given k is odd, a_{n+4} will be odd. By substituting k = 2k' + 1, and continue the calculations as follows: [ begin{aligned} & a_{n+4} = 3^m cdot 2k' + left(2 cdot 3^m - 1right) & a_{n+5} = 3^{m+1} cdot 2k' + left(2 cdot 3^{m+1} - 2right) end{aligned} ] Notice that if k' is even, then the resulting number will be divisible by 4, hence considering k' is odd. 5. Continue the process: [ a_{n+6} = 3^{m+1} k' + left(3^{m+1} - 1right) ] The formula is consistent with previous calculation pattern, detailing the same modulo properties. Also, here k' < frac{k}{2}. ***Conclusion:*** Continuing such steps ensures that, eventually, one of the sequence terms will be divisible by 4, as otherwise, natural numbers decrease indefinitely which is impossible. Hence, the sequence will contain a term divisible by 4. The detailed arithmetic of terms substantiates this conclusion effectively. blacksquare ***Solution 2 (Remainders):*** Let’s assume that no term in the sequence is divisible by 4. 1. Since even and odd terms alternate in the sequence, operations \\"divide by 2\\" and \\"multiply by 3 and add 1\\" alternate as well. 2. Let: - a_{2n} be even and - a_{2n+1} be odd for all n. Using induction, we will prove that if after 2n operations we cannot produce a term divisible by 4, the initial term a_1 will leave a remainder of 2^n - 1 when divided by 2^n. 3. According to this claim, it must follow that a_1 geq 2^n - 1. For sufficiently large n, this inequality cannot be satisfied, hence, the sequence must contain numbers divisible by 4. ***Conclusion:*** Clearly, the a_1 geq 2^n - 1 results in divergence for large n which leads to a contradiction as the values cannot sustain the correct alternate resolutions indefinitely. Hence, the sequence indeed must have a term divisible by 4. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"he first flight out of phoenix airport had a late departure . if the next 3 flights departed on time , how many subsequent flights need to depart from phoenix on time , for the airport ' s on time departure rate to be higher than 40 % ?","completion":"Let's calculate the number of flights that need to depart on time for the airport's on-time departure rate to be higher than 40%.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter D is twice the radius (D = 2r), we can also write the area in terms of the diameter as A = (π/4)D^2. If the area is increased by 300%, the new area A' is 4 times the original area (since 100% + 300% = 400%, or 4 times the original). So we have: A' = 4A Now, let's express the new area in terms of the new diameter D'. The new area A' can also be written as: A' = (π/4)D'^2 Since A' = 4A, we can substitute the expression for A into the equation for A': (π/4)D'^2 = 4(π/4)D^2 Simplify the equation: D'^2 = 4D^2 Take the square root of both sides to solve for D': D' = 2D This means the new diameter is twice the original diameter.

If ( A ) is sum-free, then ( {f(a) mid a in A} = A ) is also sum-free. We need to show that this is the only function that satisfies the condition. 3. **Claim 1**: For all ( x in mathbb{N} ), ( f(2x) = 2f(x) ). If ( f(y) = 2f(x) ), then ( y = 2x ). **Proof**: Suppose ( f(x) = c ). Since ( f ) is surjective, there exists ( y ) such that ( f(y) = 2f(x) = 2c ). Thus, ( f(x) + f(x) = f(y) ). If ( {x, y} ) is sum-free, then ( {f(a) mid a in {x, y}} ) must be sum-free, but ( f(x) + f(x) = f(y) ) contradicts this. Therefore, ( y = 2x ) or ( 2x = y ). Assume ( y = frac{x}{2} ). Then ( fleft(frac{x}{2}right) = 2c ). By surjectivity, there exists ( y_1 ) such that ( f(y_1) = 4c = 2fleft(frac{x}{2}right) ). By the same logic, ( y_1 in left{2 cdot frac{x}{2}, frac{frac{x}{2}}{2}right} = left{x, frac{x}{4}right} ). Since ( y_1 neq x ), ( y_1 = frac{x}{4} ). Continuing this process, we get a sequence ( y_k ) such that ( f(y_k) = 2^{k+1}c ) and ( y_k = frac{x}{2^k} ). This is impossible since ( nu_2(x) ) is finite. Thus, ( y = 2x ) and ( f(2x) = 2f(x) ). 4. **Claim 2**: Let ( {c_i}_{i geq 1} ) be a sequence of naturals such that ( f(c_i) = i ) for all ( i geq 1 ). Then ( c_i = ic_1 ) for all ( i geq 1 ). **Proof**: The ( c_i ) are pairwise distinct since if ( c_i = c_j ), then ( i = f(c_i) = f(c_j) = j ). We use induction on ( i ). For ( i = 1 ), the result is trivially true. For ( i = 2 ), by Claim 1, ( f(c_2) = 2 = 2f(c_1) ), so ( c_2 = 2c_1 ). For ( i = 3 ), ( f(c_3) + f(c_1) = f(c_4) ), and from Claim 1, ( f(c_4) = 2f(c_2) ), so ( c_4 = 2c_2 = 4c_1 ). Thus, ( {c_1, c_3, c_4} = {c_1, c_3, 4c_1} ) is not sum-free. Since ( {c_1, 4c_1} ) is sum-free, ( c_3 in {frac{c_1}{2}, 2c_1, frac{4c_1}{2}, 2(4c_1), 4c_1 - c_1, 4c_1 + c_1} = {frac{1}{2}c_1, 2c_1, 3c_1, 5c_1, 8c_1} ). If ( c_3 = frac{1}{2}c_1 ), then ( f(c_1) = f(2c_3) = 2f(c_3) = 6 ), absurd. If ( c_3 = 2c_1 ), then ( f(c_3) = f(2c_1) = 2f(c_1) = 2 ), absurd. If ( c_3 = 8c_1 ), then ( f(c_3) = f(8c_1) = 2f(4c_1) = 4f(2c_1) = 8f(c_1) = 8 ), absurd. Thus, ( c_3 in {3c_1, 5c_1} ). If ( c_3 = 5c_1 ), then ( f(c_5) = f(c_1) + f(c_4) = f(c_1) + f(4c_1) ), so ( {c_1, 4c_1, c_5} ) is not sum-free. Thus, ( c_5 in {frac{c_1}{2}, 2c_1, frac{4c_1}{2}, 2(4c_1), 4c_1 - c_1, 4c_1 + c_1} = {frac{1}{2}c_1, 2c_1, 3c_1, 5c_1, 8c_1} ). If ( c_5 = frac{1}{2}c_1 ), then ( f(c_1) = f(2c_5) = 2f(c_5) = 10 ), absurd. If ( c_5 = 2c_1 ), then ( f(c_5) = f(2c_1) = 2f(c_1) = 2 ), absurd. If ( c_5 = 8c_1 ), then ( f(c_5) = f(8c_1) = 8f(c_1) = 8 ), absurd. Thus, ( c_5 in {3c_1, 5c_1} ). ( c_5 ) cannot be ( 5c_1 ) since we are assuming for the sake of contradiction that ( c_3 = 5c_1 ), and we know ( c_3 neq c_5 ). Thus, ( c_5 = 3c_1 ). Now, since ( c_3 = 5c_1 ), it follows that ( c_6 = 2c_3 = 10c_1 ) by Claim 1, so ( f(c_1) + f(c_5) = f(c_1) + f(3c_1) = f(10c_1) = f(c_6) ), but ( {c_1, 3c_1, 10c_1} ) is sum-free, a contradiction. Thus, ( c_3 = 3c_1 ). Now, assume that for some ( k geq 3 ), we have that for all ( 1 leq i leq k ) that ( c_i = ic_1 ). Then, ( f(c_{k+1}) = f(c_1) + f(c_k) = f(c_1) + f(kc_1) ), so ( {c_1, kc_1, c_{k+1}} ) is not sum-free. Since ( k geq 3 ), ( {c_1, kc_1} ) is sum-free, so ( c_{k+1} in {frac{c_1}{2}, 2c_1, frac{kc_1}{2}, 2kc_1, kc_1 - c_1, kc_1 + c_1} = left{frac{1}{2}c_1, 2c_1, frac{k}{2}c_1, (k-1)c_1, (k+1)c_1, 2kc_1right} ). If ( c_{k+1} = frac{1}{2}c_1 ), then ( f(c_1) = f(2c_{k+1}) = 2f(c_{k+1}) = 2k+2 ), absurd. If ( c_{k+1} = 2c_1 ), then ( f(c_{k+1}) = f(2c_1) = 2f(c_1) = 2 ), absurd. If ( c_{k+1} = frac{k}{2}c_1 ), then ( k = f(c_k) = f(kc_1) = f(2c_{k+1}) = 2f(c_{k+1}) = 2k+2 ), absurd. If ( c_{k+1} = 2kc_1 ), then ( f(c_{k+1}) = f(2kc_1) = 2f(kc_1) = 2f(c_k) = 2k ), absurd. If ( c_{k+1} = (k-1)c_1 ), ( c_{k+1} = (k-1)c_1 = c_{k-1} ), absurd. Thus, ( c_{k+1} = (k+1)c_1 ), as desired, so our inductive step is complete and so we are done. 5. **Conclusion**: Since ( f ) is surjective, there exists such a sequence ( {c_i} ), so fix such a sequence. If there existed a ( d_1 neq c_1 ) for which ( f(d_1) = 1 ), then ( d_1, c_2, c_3, cdots ) is also a valid sequence, so ( c_2 = 2d_1 ). But ( c_2 = 2c_1 ), so ( c_1 = d_1 ), a contradiction. So ( f ) is injective at ( 1 ). Now, ( f ) is injective at any ( j > 1 ) since if there existed a ( d_j neq c_j ) for which ( f(d_j) = j ), then ( c_1, c_2, cdots, c_{j-1}, d_j, c_{j+1}, cdots ) is also a valid sequence, so ( d_j = jc_1 ). But ( c_j = jc_1 ) as well, so ( c_j = d_j ), a contradiction. Thus, ( f ) is bijective, so there exists an ( i ) for which ( c_i = 1 ). Then, ( 1 = ic_1 ), so ( i mid 1 ), implying ( i = 1 ). Thus, ( c_1 = 1 ), so ( c_i = i ), and so ( f(i) = i ) for all ( i geq 1 ), as desired.

Prove this. d) Prove that in part b) you can choose three paths such that no two paths share any vertices, except for the points ( A ) and ( B ).","completion":"The given problem consists of four parts. We will solve each part separately: Part (a): Prove that the sum of the edge lengths of any convex polyhedron is greater than three times the diameter. 1. **Define the Diameter:** Given a convex polyhedron (P), let's denote its diameter by (AB). The diameter is the longest distance between any pair of vertices of the polyhedron. 2. **Project All Edges:** Project all edges of (P) onto the line segment (AB). 3. **Counting Projections:** Consider a point (C) within the segment (AB). If we draw a plane (P) perpendicular to (AB) through point (C), this plane intersects (P) in a convex polygon. At least three edges project onto each internal point of (AB). 4. **Conclusion:** Each internal point of (AB) has at least three projections from the edges of (P). Hence, the total sum of edges projected on (AB) must be at least three times the length of (AB). Thus, the sum of the edge lengths of the polyhedron is greater than three times the diameter: [ sum text{(edge lengths)} > 3 times text{diameter}. ] This completes the proof for part (a). Part (b): Prove that for any two vertices (A) and (B) of a convex polyhedron, there exist three distinct broken lines, each consisting of edges of the polyhedron, from (A) to (B) such that no two broken lines share an edge. 1. **Existence of Paths:** For a convex polyhedron, there is at least one path from (A) to (B) due to the connectivity of the graph formed by its edges. 2. **Paths Through Different Faces:** Since polyhedra are three-dimensional, at least three edges emerge from any vertex. This implies that different adjacent faces connected to vertex (A) provide distinct ways to form broken lines. 3. **Avoiding Common Edges:** By cleverly selecting edges via different faces and avoiding overlaps, three such paths can be constructed from (A) to (B). This completes the proof for part (b). Part (c): Prove that if two edges are cut in a convex polyhedron, there is still a path connecting any two vertices (A) and (B) using the remaining edges. 1. **Suppose Two Edges are Removed:** Let the removed edges be (r_1) and (r_2). 2. **Examine Connections:** Even with (r_1) and (r_2) removed, the remaining graph is still connected. There always exists a path between (r_1) and (r_2) that does not traverse these edges. 3. **Forming New Path:** For any pair of vertices (A) and (B), a path can still be formed around the remaining connected graph. This completes the proof for part (c). Part (d): Prove that in the task from part (b), we can choose three broken lines such that no two of them have common vertices, except for the points (A) and (B). 1. **Utilize Induction:** We use induction on the distance (number of edges in the shortest path) from (A) to (B). 2. **Base Case: (d(A, B) = 1):** If (A) and (B) are connected directly by an edge, the statement is trivially true. 3. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for all paths of length (n - 1). For a path of length (n), let (B') be a vertex adjacent to (B) with (d(A, B') = n - 1). By induction, we have three disjoint paths from (A) to (B'). 4. **Constructing Paths:** Build new paths by combining disjoint paths to (B') and the edge (B'B). Ensure the resulting paths to (B') do not share vertices other than (A) and (B).

Let (mathscr{J}) be the inversion transformation with respect to a circle centered at ( C ) with radius ( r ). The combined transformation is denoted as (mathscr{R}). 2. **Behavior of Points under Transformation:** Under the (mathscr{R}) transformation: [ A mapsto B, quad B mapsto A ] [ Gamma mapsto text{line } AB ] [ Gamma_{1} mapsto Gamma_{1}^{prime} quad (text{the excircle of } triangle ABC text{ opposite to vertex } C) ] [ P mapsto Q^{prime} quad (text{intersection point of line } AB text{ with circle } Gamma_{1}^{prime}) ] 3. **Nature of (Gamma_{1}^{prime}):** Observe that under the transformation (mathscr{J}), the transformed image (Gamma_{1}^{prime}) of (Gamma_{1}) is a circle that is tangent to (AC), (BC), and (AB). Hence, (Gamma_{1}^{prime}) must either be the incircle of (triangle ABC) or its excircle. Given ( r geq min {AC, BC} ), (Gamma_{1}^{prime}) must be an excircle. Thus, (Gamma_{1}^{prime}) is the excircle of (triangle ABC) opposite vertex (C). 4. **Reflection Property and Image of (P):** Since (Gamma_1) is tangent to (Gamma) at (P) and line (AB) is the image of circle (Gamma) under transformation (mathscr{J}), point (P) gets mapped to point (Q^{prime}). The reflection under this setup establishes: [ CP text{ reflects to } CQ^{prime} ] Since (CP) under transformation (mathscr{J}) is its own reflection and also maps to (CQ^{prime}), it implies that (C), (Q), and (Q^{prime}) are collinear. 5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, (angle ACP = angle QCB), as required to be proved.

We need to find (angle E). 2. **Intersection Point**: Let (P) be the intersection point of diagonals (BD) and (CE). 3. **Angle Calculations at Point (P)**: - Consider ( angle PCB ) and ( angle PDE ). Since (angle C = 108^circ) and (angle D = 108^circ), (angle PCB = angle PDE = frac{180^circ - 108^circ}{2} = 36^circ). This is because diagonals of an equal-sided polygon bisect the angle. 4. **Isosceles Triangle Properties**: - Therefore, in triangle (BPC) and (PDE), both base angles are equal. Hence, (angle BCP = angle BPC = 36^circ). - Similarly, in triangle (CPE), (angle DPE = angle PED = 36^circ). 5. **Angles in Triangle (BPC)**: - The angles in triangle (BPC) add up to 180°. So, (angle BPB = 180^circ - 2 times 36^circ = 180^circ - 72^circ = 108^circ). 6. **Isosceles Triangle (ABP)**: - Now, consider that (BP = BC = AB) (as all sides are equal in the pentagon). - We use the previously calculated angle (angle BP = 36^circ), thus (angle ABP = 96^circ - 36^circ = 60^circ). 7. **Equilateral Triangle**: - Since (angle ABP = 60^circ) and all sides of triangle (ABP) are equal, triangle (ABP) must be equilateral. Therefore, (AP = AE). 8. **Angle (APE)**: - Since (AP = AE), triangle (APE) is isosceles and the angle at (A) is (angle APE = 108^circ - 60^circ = 48^circ). 9. **Completing Final Angle Calculations**: - To find (angle E), consider the angles: (angle AEP = frac{180^circ - 48^circ}{2} = frac{132^circ}{2} = 66^circ). - Finally, since (angle ADE = 108^circ), (angle E = angle AEP + angle ADE = 66^circ + 36^circ = 102^circ). # Conclusion Therefore, the measure of (angle E) in the pentagon is ( boxed{102^circ} )."},{"prompt":"45 workers work 8 hours to dig a hole 30 meters deep.

Work is typically calculated as the product of the number of workers, the time they work, and their rate of work. In this case, we can consider the depth of the hole as a measure of the work done. For the first hole: Number of workers = 45 Time worked = 8 hours Depth of hole = 30 meters Total work done = Number of workers × Time worked × Work rate Since we don't know the work rate, we'll assume it to be a constant rate, let's call it R.

Let's call the number of workers needed W. Total work done for the second hole = W workers × 5 hours × R = 70 meters Since the work done is proportional to the depth of the hole, we can set up a proportion based on the work done for the first hole: 360R (work for the first hole) / 30 meters (depth of the first hole) = 5WR (work for the second hole) / 70 meters (depth of the second hole) Solving for W: 360R / 30 = 5WR / 70 12R = 5WR / 70 12R × 70 = 5WR 840R = 5WR W = 840R / 5R W = 168 So, 168 workers are needed to dig the second hole that is 70 meters deep in 5 hours.

The monthly cost for one person is 1000, so for 12 months, it would be ( 12 times 1000 = 12,000 ) per person. The total cost for one person for the first year, including the joining fee and the monthly cost, would be ( F + 12,000 ). Since there are 4 people, the total cost for the first year for all 4 people would be ( 4 times (F + 12,000) ). John pays half of this total cost, which is given as 32,000. So we can set up the equation: ( frac{1}{2} times 4 times (F + 12,000) = 32,000 ) Simplifying the equation: ( 2 times (F + 12,000) = 32,000 ) ( F + 12,000 = frac{32,000}{2} ) ( F + 12,000 = 16,000 ) Now, we can solve for ( F ): ( F = 16,000 - 12,000 ) ( F = 4,000 ) Therefore, the fee to join the country club per person is boxed{4,000} ."},{"prompt":"Given U={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, A={1,3,5}, B={2,4,5}, then Acap (complement _{U}B)=left( right) A: {1,3} B: {1,3,5} C: {2,4,6} D: {0,2,4,6}","completion":"To solve the problem step-by-step, let's first determine complement_U B, which is the complement of set B in the universe set U.

Let ( y = 0.00overline{081} ). We need to express ( y ) as a fraction. Notice that ( y ) is a repeating decimal with the repeating part \\"081\\". 4. To convert ( y ) into a fraction, we use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series. First, we write ( y ) as: [ y = 0.000081 + 0.000000081 + 0.000000000081 + ldots ] 5.

Assume ( T_0 ) as the triangle located at the center (if the setup permits a central triangle). Then assign some arbitrary values to the outermost triangles. Let's have a simpler case with an isosceles triangle grid where the outermost triangles are at the vertices and the center is the reference point. 4. **Step-by-Step Assignment** - **Step 1:** Assign (0) to the central triangle, ( T_0 ). - **Step 2:** Assign values to the first row neighbors (i.e., the ones immediately adjacent to ( T_0 )): - ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ): Let's arbitrarily assign (1) and (2) to these neighbors respectively. - This assignment is consistent as ( |1 - 2| = 1 ), and assigning either value next to a (0) results in that same value, which fits the absolute difference criterion. - **Step 3:** Proceed with the next set of triangles recursively. - Assign integers in such a way that the absolute difference condition holds. - Example for these triangles: [ T_3 quad |-| ] Assign ( 3 ), where this fits ( |3 - 2| ) and fills the condition with previous adjacent levels as (3). 5. **Verifying the Framework** - Continue the integer assignment process ensuring that each triangle with at least two neighbors satisfies the stated condition for the integer value. 6. **Conclusion** - After completing the integer assignment for all triangles in the grid (ensuring every triangle with at least two neighbors meets the absolute difference requirement), we end with a consistent set of integers for all triangles. Given the nature of integer assignments satisfying all required conditions recursively and consistently, the process concludes successfully. Therefore, the construction and approach described resolve the problem entirely. The integers are assigned such that the condition holds for every triangle with at least two neighbors.

Assume that our set contains an irrational number ( a ). If an irrational number exists in the set, then the remaining numbers must either be of the form ( p-a ) or ( frac{p}{a} ), where ( p ) is rational. 2. Show that numbers of the form ( p - a ) cannot have more than two elements. Suppose there exist three such numbers ( b_1 = p_1 - a, b_2 = p_2 - a, b_3 = p_3 - a ). - The sum ( b_1 + b_2 = (p_1 + p_2) - 2a ) is irrational, hence the product ( b_1 b_2 = p_1 p_2 - a(p_1 + p_2) + a^2 ) must be rational. - Similarly, ( b_1 b_3 ) and ( b_2 b_3 ) must be rational: [ b_1 b_3 = p_1 p_3 - a(p_1 + p_3) + a^2 ] [ b_2 b_3 = p_2 p_3 - a(p_2 + p_3) + a^2 ] - From these, we derive the rational terms: [ A_3 = a^2 - a(p_1 + p_2) ] [ A_2 = a^2 - a(p_1 + p_3) ] [ A_1 = a^2 - a(p_2 + p_3) ] - Therefore, the difference ( A_3 - A_2 = a(p_3 - p_2) ) must be rational which is possible only if ( p_3 = p_2 ).

Let’s assume numbers of the form ( p-a ) are ( b_1 ) and ( b_2 ). 4. Now consider more than two numbers must be of the form ( frac{q}{a} ). Let these numbers be ( c_1 = frac{q_1}{a}, c_2 = frac{q_2}{a}, c_3 = frac{q_3}{a} ). 5.

Then the other ( k ) characters are also determined. 5. **Base case:** Since ( r_1 = 27 geq 18 ), it suffices to show by induction that ( r_{n} geq 18 r_{n-1} ) for all ( n geq 1 ), and ( r_n geq 18^n ) follows. 6. **Inductive step:** Suppose that ( r_i geq 18 r_{i-1} ) for all ( i < n ). Then we have: [ r_n geq 27 r_{n-1} - sum_{1 leq k leq n/2} r_{n-2k} b_{2k} ] Using the bound for ( b_{2k} ): [ r_n geq 27 r_{n-1} - sum_{1 leq k leq n/2} 18^{-2k} r_n cdot (4 cdot 27)^k ] Simplifying the sum: [ r_n geq 27 r_{n-1} - r_n cdot sum_{k=1}^{infty} left(frac{4 cdot 27}{18^2}right)^k ] Since: [ frac{4 cdot 27}{18^2} = frac{108}{324} = frac{1}{3} ] The geometric series sum is: [ sum_{k=1}^{infty} left(frac{1}{3}right)^k = frac{frac{1}{3}}{1 - frac{1}{3}} = frac{1}{2} ] Therefore: [ r_n geq 27 r_{n-1} - frac{1}{2} r_n ] Rearranging terms: [ frac{3}{2} r_n geq 27 r_{n-1} ] Thus: [ r_{n} geq 18 r_{n-1} ] This completes the induction step. Since the base case and the inductive step are both satisfied, we conclude that ( r_n geq 18^n ) for all ( n geq 1 ). The final answer is ( boxed{ r_n geq 18^n } )."},{"prompt":"Given a set M consisting of an odd number of elements, each element x in M uniquely corresponds to a subset H_x subset M such that: (1) For every x in M, x in H_x; (2) For any x, y in M, y in H_x if and only if x in H_y.

For (n=2), see Figure 3. Prove that there exists a positive integer (n), such that among the vertices of the smaller triangles, there are (2000n) points, any three of which do not form a regular triangle. 1. **Introduction to the Induction Hypothesis:** We claim that if a regular triangle with side length (m) has (x_m) interior points such that any three points do not form a regular triangle, then a regular triangle with side length (3m) has (4x_m) such points. 2. **Verification of the Hypothesis:** To verify this, we notice that a regular triangle with side length (3m) can be divided into 9 regular triangles each with side length (m) (see Figure 6). Label these smaller triangles as (1, 2, 3, ldots, 9). Among these 9 triangles, select 4 triangles (let’s say triangles (1, 2, 3,) and (4)), each containing (x_m) points which do not form a regular triangle when any three are taken from within one triangle. 3. **Proof of Non-formation of a Regular Triangle:** To prove these (4x_m) points does not form a regular triangle, consider three distinct points (A, B, C): - **Case 1:** (A, B, C) are within the same small triangle (same label). We already know these three points (A, B, C) do not form a regular triangle since (x_m) was defined as such within each side length (m) triangle. - **Case 2:** Two points are within the same small triangle, and the third point is in a different triangle. Assume (A) and (B) are in the same small triangle, say triangle labeled (1), and (C) is in another triangle. The only potential third vertex of a regular triangle with side length (A) and (B) should lie in larger encompassing equilateral triangle whose sides contain all 9 smaller triangles. Since these larger triangles do not intersect the other chosen triangles, (C) cannot form a regular triangle with (A) and (B). - **Case 3:** Each point is within a different small triangle. By noting the relative placement of any potential regular triangle vertices in the coordinates of the larger triangle, one can ascertain that constructing a regular triangle would violate the initial non-formation conditions since they fall outside the necessary circumstantial alignment conditions of the original small (m)-side triangles. 4. **Finding a Suitable (n):** Using the conclusion from the derived induction step, the recursive generation of non-regular forming points scales exponentially. Now, compute suitable (m) such that the number of points is at least (2000n): Given (4^k) points within an (m) triangle correspond to non-forming conditions, we want: [ 4^k geq 2000 times 3^{k+1} ] Considering base logarithmic growth conditions ( frac{4}{3} > 1 ): [ lim_{k to + infty} left(frac{4}{3}right)^k = +infty ] Equivalently, finding appropriate (k): [ left(frac{4}{3}right)^k geq 6000 ] Hence, appropriate (k) which solves: [ frac{4^k}{3^{k+1}} = frac{1}{3} left(frac{4}{3}right)^k geq 2000 ] By setting (n = 3^{k+1}): [ 4^k geq 2000 times 3^{k+1} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{n = 3^{k+1}} ] This relation (n = 3^{k+1}) provides a solution ensuring (2000n) points do not form a regular triangle."},{"prompt":") Show that there is no integer such that its 58th power has 64 digits. b) Can we replace the number 64 in the previous statement with any other natural number?","completion":"1. **Part (a)**: Show that there is no integer whose 58th power has 64 digits. 1.

Take the base-10 logarithm of all parts of the inequality: [ log_{10}(10^{63}) leq log_{10}(n^{58}) < log_{10}(10^{64}) ] 3. Using the properties of logarithms: [ 63 leq 58 log_{10}(n) < 64 ] 4.

Since (log_{10}(n)) must be an integer for (n) to be an integer, we see that there is no integer (n) that satisfies: [ 1.0862 leq log_{10}(n) < 1.1035 ] Therefore, no integer (n) exists such that (n^{58}) would have exactly 64 digits. 2. **Part (b)**: Determine whether there are any natural numbers that can replace 64 in the previous assertion. 1. Using the same form of argument, consider the general statement for any number (k): [ frac{k-1}{58} leq log_{10}(n) < frac{k}{58} ] 2. To check if (log_{10}(n)) can be an integer within this interval, note that the difference between two consecutive natural numbers’ logarithms: [ d(n) = log_{10}(n+1) - log_{10}(n) = log_{10}left(frac{n+1}{n}right) = log_{10}left(1 + frac{1}{n}right) ] This difference (d(n)) decreases as (n) increases. 3. For (d(n) leq frac{1}{58}), we need: [ log_{10}left(1 + frac{1}{n}right) < frac{1}{58} ] 4. Since (log_{10}(1 + frac{1}{n}) approx frac{1}{n ln(10)}) for sufficiently large (n): [ frac{1}{n ln(10)} < frac{1}{58} ] 5. Solving for (n): [ n > frac{58}{ln(10)} approx 25 ] Thus, for (n > 25), the difference (d(n)) becomes smaller than (frac{1}{58}), and no such (d(n)) can be greater than this value. 6. For (k leq 81) (i.e., (frac{k}{58} approx 1.397)): [ frac{k}{58} leq log_{10}(25) approx 1.398 ] Hence: [ k leq 58 log_{10}(25) approx 81 ] Therefore, (k > 81) is impossible under these constraints, and hence the substitution of (64) with any number less than or equal to (81).

Therefore, we have: [k = cos theta] Since cos theta can range from -1 to 1 for all real values of theta, we have: [k in [-1,1]] The inclination angle alpha of a line is related to its slope through the tangent function, tan alpha = k. However, it is given that the inclination angle alpha cannot be frac{pi}{2} because the tangent function is undefined at frac{pi}{2}, which corresponds to a vertical line (infinite slope), not possible in this context since the slope is finite (cos theta).

The probability that Silvia picks 7 can be calculated as follows: - Silvia has 1 way to pick the number 7. - After picking 7, she has binom{6}{2} ways to choose the remaining two numbers from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6}. The total number of ways Silvia can pick any three numbers from {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} is binom{7}{3}.

Solving the system of equations: begin{cases} y=kx+t_1 x^2 + 4y^2 = 4 end{cases} We get the quadratic equation in x: (1+4k^2)x^2 + 8kt_1x + 4t_1^2 - 4 = 0 The discriminant Delta = 16(4k^2 - t_1^2 + 1) > 0. The sum and product of the roots are: x_1 + x_2 = -frac{8kt_1}{1+4k^2} x_1x_2 = frac{4t_1^2 - 4}{1+4k^2} Thus, |AB| = sqrt{(1+k^2)[(x_1+x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2]} = frac{4sqrt{1+k^2}sqrt{4k^2 - t_1^2 + 1}}{1+4k^2} Similarly, we can find: |DE| = frac{4sqrt{1+k^2}sqrt{4k^2 - t_2^2 + 1}}{1+4k^2} Since |AB|=|DE|, we have: frac{4sqrt{1+k^2}sqrt{4k^2 - t_1^2 + 1}}{1+4k^2} = frac{4sqrt{1+k^2}sqrt{4k^2 - t_2^2 + 1}}{1+4k^2} This implies that t_1^2 = t_2^2. Since t_1 neq t_2, we have t_1 = -t_2. Therefore, the convex quadrilateral with vertices A, B, D, and E is a parallelogram. Let r be the distance between the parallel lines AB and DE. Then, r = frac{|t_1 - t_2|}{sqrt{1+k^2}} = frac{2|t_1|}{sqrt{1+k^2}} The area S of the parallelogram is: S = |AB| cdot r = frac{4sqrt{1+k^2}sqrt{4k^2 - t_1^2 + 1}}{1+4k^2} cdot frac{2|t_1|}{sqrt{1+k^2}} = frac{8sqrt{(4k^2 - t_1^2 + 1)t_1^2}}{1+4k^2} Using the AM-GM inequality, we have: S leq 8 cdot frac{(4k^2 - t_1^2 + 1) + t_1^2}{2} cdot frac{1}{1+4k^2} = 4 The equality holds if and only if 4k^2 + 1 = 2t_1^2, which satisfies Delta > 0.

Deck cards: Bella has 20 fewer frisbees than deck cards, so she has 30 - 20 = 10 deck cards. 4. Action figures: Bella has five times fewer action figures than marbles, so she has 60 / 5 = 12 action figures. Now, let's calculate how many of each item she will buy: 1. Marbles: She buys 2/5 times more, so she buys 2/5 * 60 = 24 more marbles. 2. Frisbees: She buys 2/5 times more, so she buys 2/5 * 30 = 12 more frisbees. 3. Deck cards: She buys 2/5 times more, so she buys 2/5 * 10 = 4 more deck cards. 4. Action figures: She buys 1/3 times more, so she buys 1/3 * 12 = 4 more action figures.

Subtract (7) from both sides of each equation: [ 15 - 7 = (k-1)d ] [ 27 - 7 = (m-1)d ] Simplifying these, we get: [ 8 = (k-1)d ] [ 20 = (m-1)d ] 4. Let (k-1 = a).

(b) In your opinion, which type of cashback is more preferable for the customer: cashback in rubles or in bonus points? Explain your position.","completion":"**(a)** 1. **Attraction of New Clients:** Cashback services can be highly attractive to new clients. By offering a cashback program, banks incentivize spending through their cards, which helps in acquiring new customer base. The reason is that customers are more likely to choose a bank offering a cashback service over one that does not offer such benefits. 2. **Mutually Beneficial Collaboration with Commercial Entities:** By offering cashback, banks can establish partnerships with various commercial businesses. These businesses may offer exclusive deals or higher cashback percentages for purchases made using the bank’s services, which in turn promotes increased sales for the commercial entities and more transactions through the bank. This creates a win-win situation for both parties involved. 3. **Competitiveness:** If other banks are offering cashback services and a particular bank does not, this could negatively impact customer interest in that bank's services. Therefore, to remain competitive and retain their customer base, it is advantageous for banks to implement and promote cashback service programs. With these points in mind, the promotion of cashback services by banks serves as an effective marketing strategy, thereby ensuring customer acquisition, enhanced partnerships, and competitive standing in the financial market. blacksquare **(b)** 1. **Liquidity Advantage:** Assuming other conditions are equal (i.e., the value of 1 ruble equals 1 bonus point), cashback in the form of rubles is more advantageous for the customer. The primary reason is the liquidity aspect. Cash in rubles provides more flexibility, as it can be used anywhere without restrictions, unlike bonus points which may have limited usage scope. 2. **No Expiry Concerns:** Bonus points often come with terms and conditions, such as expiry dates. Customers might need to use them within a specific time frame, which may not always be convenient. However, cash in rubles does not have such restrictions and can be saved or spent as per the customer’s discretion. 3. **No Partner Limitations:** Rubles can be used broadly without being tied to specific partners or vendors. In contrast, bonus points might only be redeemable at particular stores or within set categories, limiting the customer's choice and convenience. Thus, given the liquidity, flexibility, and freedom associated with ruble cashback, it emerges as the preferred option for buyers. boxed{text{Cashback in rubles}}"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)= frac{1}{3}{x}^{3} frac{1}{2}m{x}^{2}+4x3 is an increasing function on the interval [1,2], find the range of values for the real number m ( ).

Show that (MX perp CD).","completion":"To show that (MX) perp (CD) given the conditions of the problem, we will follow a series of steps and use angle chasing in the cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD). 1. Identify Key Points and Properties 1.1. Given that the diagonals (AC) and (BD) are perpendicular at (X), we can write: [ widehat{AXC} = 90^circ, quad widehat{BXD} = 90^circ ] 1.2. Point (M) is defined as the midpoint of segment ([AB]). 2. Analyze Triangle (ABX) 2.1. Since (M) is the midpoint of ([AB]) and (widehat{AXC} = 90^circ), triangle (ABX) is isosceles with base (AB) at its hypotenuse. Therefore, we have: [ MA = MB ] [ MX text{ is the median from } M text{ to } X text{, and thus, } MX = frac{sqrt{M A^2 + M B^2}}{2}. ] 3. Angles at (M) 3.1. Considering (triangle ABX) which is isosceles and with ( widehat{AXM}) and ( widehat{BXM}) being related, we get: [ widehat{M A X} = widehat{A X M} = alpha quad text{(base angles in isosceles triangle)} ] 3.2. Given (MX) bisects (widehat{AXB}), we thus have: [ widehat{MXB} = 90^circ - alpha ] 4. Intersection and Angle Relations: 4.1. The intersection point (H) of ((MX)) and ((CD)) indicates: [ widehat{DXH} = widehat{MXB} = 90^circ - alpha ] 5. Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties: 5.1. In cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles sum to (180^circ). Therefore, we have: [ widehat{BAC} = widehat{BDC} quad (text{angles subtended by the same arc}) ] 6. Conclude Perpendicularity: 6.1. Using angle chasing, recognize that the angle ( widehat{XDH} ) within the cyclic quadrilateral must satisfy: [ widehat{XDH} = widehat{M X B} = 90^circ - alpha ] Thus, in the right triangle (XDH), ( widehat{DXH} + widehat{XDH} = 90^circ ).

Hence, ( ACBD ) forms a (possibly degenerate) parallelogram. # Second Solution: 1. **Vector Representation:** - Let's denote the vectors to points ( A, B, C, D ) from an arbitrary point as ( mathbf{a}, mathbf{b}, mathbf{c}, mathbf{d} ). 2. **Vector Magnitudes and Differences:** - We represent the distances in the problem with vectors.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. The train is moving at a speed of 72 kmph (kilometers per hour). To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the speed to meters per second (m/s). 1 kilometer = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, 72 kmph is equivalent to: 72 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 20 m/s Now, we know the speed of the train in meters per second and the time it takes to cross the bridge in seconds.

The revenue from regular tickets is 10 per ticket, and the revenue from student tickets is 5 per ticket. So we can write the equation: 10R + 5S = 28350 Since R = 3S, we can substitute R in the equation: 10(3S) + 5S = 28350 30S + 5S = 28350 35S = 28350 Now, we can solve for S: S = 28350 / 35 S = 810 So, 810 student tickets were sold.

This implies point (P) is on a circle with diameter as line segment (AB), sharing a common point with (CD). 7. Since (P) lies on (CD) and (PA cdot PB) is minimized when (angle APB = 90^circ), it must be that (BC leq frac{1}{2} AB) or: [ AB geq 2 BC ] Thus, we have shown that: [ boxed{AB geq 2 BC} ] Part (2): Find the value of (AQ cdot BQ) 1.

The function sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{6}right) has a period of 2pi. Given that 2x is in the argument, the period of f(x) is frac{2pi}{2} = pi.

First, list all combinations of three different digits from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} that add up to 9: - 1, 2, 6: Not possible as 6 is not in the given set. - 1, 3, 5: This is possible and can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. - 1, 4, 4: Not possible as digits must be distinct. - 2, 2, 5: Not possible as digits must be distinct. - 2, 3, 4: This is possible and can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. - The rest will not work because they will repeat the above combinations or include digits not in the given set. So, there are a total of 6 + 6 = 12 combinations of three different digits from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} that add up to 9. However, we have not yet considered combinations that include the digit 0. The digit 0 cannot be the first digit, but it can be the second or third digit. Let's find the combinations that include 0 and add up to 9: - 0, 1, 8: Not possible as 8 is not in the given set. - 0, 2, 7: Not possible as 7 is not in the given set. - 0, 3, 6: Not possible as 6 is not in the given set. - 0, 4, 5: This is possible, but since 0 cannot be the first digit, there are only 2! = 2 ways to arrange the digits. Now we need to update the total count: Total = 12 (from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) + 2 (including 0) = 14 combinations. However, upon reviewing the combinations that include 0, we see that we've only considered combinations where the sum of non-zero digits is 9. The previous step was incorrect as for the cases including zero, we should be looking for two digits from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} that add up to 9 when summed with 0. Here, we explore the correct combinations: For three-digit numbers starting with 1: - 1, 0, 8: Not possible as 8 is not in the given set. - 1, 2, 6: Not possible as 6 is not in the given set. - 1, 3, 5: This is possible and can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways (since the first digit is fixed). - 1, 4, 4: Not possible as digits must be distinct. For three-digit numbers starting with 2: - 2, 0, 7: Not possible as 7 is not in the given set. - 2, 1, 6: Not possible as 6 is not in the given set. - 2, 3, 4: This is possible and can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways (since the first digit is fixed). For three-digit numbers starting with 3: - 3, 0, 6: Not possible as 6 is not in the given set. - 3, 1, 5: This is possible and can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways (since the first digit is fixed). - 3, 2, 4: This is possible and can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways (since the first digit is fixed). For three-digit numbers starting with 4: - 4, 0, 5: This is possible and can be arranged in 2! = 2 ways (since the first digit is fixed). - The rest will either include digits not in the set or repeat digits. So there are 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 combinations including the digit 0. Updating the total count with the correct numbers: Total = 12 + 8 = 20 combinations. However, upon final revision, it seems there has been a miscalculation. Let's correct this: Let's reconsider the combinations that include 0 — we found before that the combination 0, 4, 5 was possible and could be arranged in 2 ways, and not just 1 way. This is because the 0 can be in either the second or third position with the digits 4 and 5 being interchangeable. Thus, the previous solution understated the number of combinations with zero by incorrectly counting the ways to arrange 0, 4, and 5 as 1 instead of 2. This miscount should be corrected as follows: We have two valid combinations (405 and 450) where the sum of the digits is 9 and one of the digits is 0. The correct total count combining the non-zero and zero-inclusive combinations is: Total = 12 (from non-zero digits) + 4 (zero-inclusive combinations) = 16 combinations.

Now, we can find the reduced price per kg by dividing the total cost by the quantity of oil she can now buy with the reduced price: Reduced price per kg = Total cost / (Original quantity + Additional quantity) Reduced price per kg = 1500 / (40 + 10) Reduced price per kg = 1500 / 50 Reduced price per kg = Rs. 30 Therefore, the reduced price per kg of oil is Rs. boxed{30} ."},{"prompt":"johnny bought 6 peanut butter cans at an average price ( arithmetic mean ) of 36.5 ¢ . if johnny returned two cans to the retailer , and the average price of the remaining cans was 30 ¢ , then what is the average price , in cents , of the two returned peanut butter cans ?","completion":"Let's first calculate the total cost of the 6 peanut butter cans that Johnny bought.

The average price of the remaining 4 cans is 30¢, so the total cost of the 4 cans is: Total cost of 4 cans = 4 cans * 30¢/can = 120¢ To find the total cost of the 2 returned cans, we subtract the total cost of the 4 remaining cans from the total cost of the original 6 cans: Total cost of 2 returned cans = Total cost of 6 cans - Total cost of 4 cans Total cost of 2 returned cans = 219¢ - 120¢ = 99¢ Now, to find the average price of the 2 returned cans, we divide the total cost of the 2 returned cans by the number of cans: Average price of 2 returned cans = Total cost of 2 returned cans / 2 cans Average price of 2 returned cans = 99¢ / 2 = 49.5¢ Therefore, the average price of the two returned peanut butter cans is boxed{49.5¢} ."},{"prompt":"Find the maximum value of [ begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 1 & 1 + tan theta & 1 1 + cos theta & 1 & 1 end{vmatrix}, ] as theta ranges over all angles.","completion":"Expand the determinant: begin{align*} begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 1 & 1 + tan theta & 1 1 + cos theta & 1 & 1 end{vmatrix} &= begin{vmatrix} 1 + tan theta & 1 1 & 1 end{vmatrix} - begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 1 + cos theta & 1 end{vmatrix} + begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 + tan theta 1 + cos theta & 1 end{vmatrix} &= (1 + tan theta - 1) - (1 - (1 + cos theta)) + (1 - (1 + tan theta)(1 + cos theta)) &= tan theta + cos theta - (1 + tan theta)(1 + cos theta) &= tan theta + cos theta - (1 + tan theta + cos theta + tan theta cos theta) &= -tan theta cos theta. end{align*} The maximum value of this function can be determined by maximizing -tan theta cos theta.

This problem prohibits any gaps and overlapping, and we do not consider different coverings as unique if they can be obtained by rotation or reflection. **Solution 1:** We first analyze the arrangement of the dominos covering the four corner squares of the chessboard. Three primary cases arise based on the orientation and placement of these dominoes. 1. All four dominoes' axes are in the same direction. 2. Three dominoes' axes are parallel, and the fourth is perpendicular. 3. Two dominoes' axes are parallel in one direction, and the other two are parallel in the perpendicular direction. Let's explore each scenario: Case 1: All four dominoes' axes in the same direction Here, we can rotate the board to arrange all dominoes in a horizontal direction without loss of generality. This configuration is straightforward and leaves a specific pattern to complete the board (which will be addressed in subsequent cases). Case 2: Three dominoes' axes are parallel, and the fourth is perpendicular Without loss of generality, assume three dominoes are horizontal, and the fourth vertical domino covers the top right corner: - Place three horizontal dominoes at the top three rows, leaving a vertical domino in the fourth corner. - This configuration enforces a predetermined structure for the remaining tiles, definable uniquely due to the combinations of 2 times 2 tiles left in a rectangular grid. Case 3: Two pairs of dominos in perpendicular directions Here, two domino pairs share different axes, arranging horizontally and vertically: - Align two horizontal dominoes parallel to each other, and do the same with two vertical dominoes. - This alignment leaves specific formations, notably adjacent or diagonally placed corners completing tile pairs.

Let's first find out the work rate of b by subtracting a's work rate from the combined work rate of a and b: b = (a + b) - a b = (W / 16) - (W / 32) To combine the work rates, we need to find a common denominator, which is 32 in this case: b = (2W / 32) - (W / 32) b = (2W - W) / 32 b = W / 32 Now, we have the work rates for b and c: b = W / 32 c = W / 24 To find out how long it will take for b and c to finish the work together, we add their work rates: b + c = (W / 32) + (W / 24) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 32 and 24.

For both sets of data given, the variance is the same. This implies that the spread of the numbers around their mean is identical in both sets after adjusting for any constant difference between them. 2. **Adjusting the Sets**: To compare the variances directly, we can adjust the sets by subtracting a constant that aligns one set with the other. Subtracting 2019 from the second set of data (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024) aligns it with the first set, resulting in the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 3. **Comparing the Sets**: The first set of data is 1, 2, 3, 4, x. After the adjustment, the second set becomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Since the variances are equal and variance is independent of any constant addition or subtraction (it depends on the spread of the numbers), the adjusted second set can be directly compared to the first. 4. **Determining x**: For the variances to be equal, x must make the first set have the same spread as the second set. Given the second set is now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, x could be a number that, when included in the first set, does not change its variance from that of the second set. This means x could be such that it makes the first set identical to the second set or maintains the same spread pattern. 5. **Conclusion**: Since the second set after adjustment is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and considering the variance equality, x must either complete the sequence similarly to the second set or be a value that, when included, does not alter the established variance. Therefore, x could be 5 to directly match the second set. However, considering the original statement and the nature of variance, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the solution process as variance comparison should not directly dictate the values of x but rather the spread of the values around their mean. The correct approach would involve calculating the mean of both sets and then equating their variances to solve for x.

Given a red number (r), (0 cdot r = 0) would be red, which contradicts the assumption that (0) is white. Therefore, (0) must be red. - Assume (1) is red. Given a white number (w), (w cdot 1 = w) would be red, which contradicts the assumption that (w) is white. Therefore, (1) must be white. 3. **Considering the Smallest Positive Red Number (r_0):** - Let (r_0) be the smallest positive red number. Since (1) is white, (r_0 geq 2). - Consider (r_0^2). If (r_0^2) were white, then (r_0^2 + r_0) would be white. However, (r_0^2 + r_0 = r_0(r_0 + 1)) is red because (r_0 + 1) is white. Hence, (r_0^2) must be red. 4. **Induction on Powers of (r_0):** - By induction, (r_0^k) is red for all positive integers (k). - Base case: (k = 1), (r_0) is red by definition. - Inductive step: Assume (r_0^k) is red. Then (r_0^{k+1} = r_0 cdot r_0^k) is red because the product of two red numbers is red. 5. **Sum of the Form (sum_i w_i r_0^{k_i}):** - Let (w_1, w_2) be white numbers and (k_1, k_2) be positive integers with (k_1 > k_2). - Consider (w_1 r_0^{k_1} + w_2 r_0^{k_2}). This can be written as (r_0^{k_2} (w_1 r_0^{k_1 - k_2} + w_2)). - Since (w_1 r_0^{k_1 - k_2} + w_2) is white (sum of white and white is white), the product with (r_0^{k_2}) (which is red) is red. 6. **Form of Red Numbers:** - Any number of the form (n r_0), where (n) is a non-negative integer, is red. - Any non-negative integer (n) can be expressed in base (r_0) as (a_k r_0^k + a_{k-1} r_0^{k-1} + cdots + a_1 r_0 + a_0), where the coefficients (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_k) are either (0) or positive and less than (r_0) (hence white). - Thus, (n r_0) is either (0) or a sum of the form (sum_i w_i r_0^{k_i}), which is red. 7. **Conclusion:** - If (r) is any red number, then (r = n r_0 + j) for some integers (n geq 0) and (j) with (0 leq j < r_0). - Since (n r_0 + j) is white if (j > 0), (j = 0), and so (r) is a multiple of (r_0). - Hence, the red numbers are precisely the non-negative integer multiples of (r_0). 8. **Sum and Product of Red Numbers:** - The sum of two red numbers (r_1) and (r_2) is (r_1 + r_2), which is a multiple of (r_0) and hence red. - The product of two red numbers (r_1) and (r_2) is (r_1 cdot r_2), which is also a multiple of (r_0) and hence red.

The GCD of these n integers is 1. An operation consists of replacing two integers x and y (if x leq y) with 2x and yx. For which initial configurations is it possible, after a certain number of operations, to end with n1 zeros written on the board?","completion":"To determine the initial configurations that allow us to end with n-1 zeros after several operations, let's analyze the operations and their implications step-by-step. Initially, we have n non-negative integers whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. 1. **Operations and Their Effects**: - Consider two integers x and y such that (x leqslant y). We replace (x) and (y) by (2x) and (y - x), respectively. - Let's analyze the parity and the impact on common divisors using this operation. 2. **Implications on Divisibility by Odd Numbers**: - Suppose d is an odd common divisor of all (n) integers. - This operation results in (2x) which is clearly even. However, if (d) divides (2x), then (d) must divide (x) since (d) is odd. - Also, (d) must divide (y - x). - This operation does not change the common odd divisors. Hence, any odd divisor before the operation remains a divisor after the operation. 3. **Sum of the Numbers**: - Notice that the sum of the numbers in each step remains constant. - Initially, let's denote the sum of the (n) numbers as (S). - For (n-1) numbers to be zero, the remaining number must be equal to (S). 4. **Conditions on the Sum (S)**: - If the final remaining number equals the initial sum (S), and we want this number to be the sole number left (with n-1 zeroes), then: - (S) must be divisible by the greatest power of 2 that any number in the initial set could be divided by after enough operations. - Given that (GCD = 1), there is no common divisor among the numbers initially except 1. - For (S) to equal the only remaining number, it must be a power of 2 because any other number or combination wouldn't satisfy ending conditions (as the operations could modify any composite or non-power-of-2 sum). 5. **Recursive Application & Power of 2**: - Let the initial sum (S = 2^m). - If (GCD = 1), then the power of 2's (k)th-valuation among the numbers will step-by-step increase through the operations by a controlled mechanism: - for example, if some numbers’ (k)-valuation is initially smaller than (m), repeated operations will eventually increase all the numbers' (k)-valuation to become a single (2^m). - Iteratively, with each operation, the divisibility by powers of 2 increases systematically. 6. **Conclusion**: - Thus, starting from the (GCD = 1) condition and through systematic power-of-2 upward adjustments via each step, (n-1) numbers becoming zero, finally leaving (2^m) (the initial sum remaining). This is achieved if initial sum (S = 2^m).

Since g(x) is monotonically increasing on R, if x_1 < x_2, then g(x_1) < g(x_2). Therefore, g({sinfrac{π}{5}}) < g({2^{0.1}}). **Option B:** f({log_3frac{1}{5}})＜f({log_3 4}) Since log_3frac{1}{5} = -log_3 5 < 0 and log_3 4 > 0, and considering that f(x) is even, we have f({log_3frac{1}{5}}) = f({-log_3 5}) = f({log_3 5}).

This is because a negative omega would invert the period of the sine function, contradicting the condition of having more extreme points than zeros in the given interval. Thus, omega > 0. 2. **Variable Transformation**: Let's set omega x+dfrac {pi }{3}=t. This transformation helps us analyze the function in terms of t rather than x. Consequently, t ranges from dfrac {pi }{3} to pi omega +dfrac {pi }{3} because x ranges from 0 to pi. 3. **Finding Zeros**: The sine function has zeros at multiples of pi. Given there are two zeros in the interval, we can set up the inequality 2pi < pi omega +dfrac {pi }{3}leqslant 3pi. Solving for omega gives us: [ 2 < omega +dfrac {1}{3}leqslant 3 ] Simplifying, we find: [ dfrac {5}{3}< omega leqslant dfrac {8}{3} ] 4. **Finding Extreme Points**: For three extreme points, we consider the derivative of sin t, which is cos t.

This can be shown by noting that both triangles share angle angle DKI and angle KID = angle KEC because I and E are centers of circles tangent to the same lines. 5. **Use the similarity to find angles**: - Since KA/KD = KE'/KE, the triangles KIA and KCE' are similar.

Determine the minimum number of unit squares that must be removed from a (202 times 202) grid so that it can be tiled with Ttetrominoes.","completion":"1. We begin by analyzing the structure of the 202 times 202 grid and examining how we can tile it with T-tetrominoes. A T-tetromino consists of four unit squares arranged in such a way that three form a 1 times 3 rectangle and the fourth square adjoins the middle square on one of its longer sides. 2. First, we demonstrate a constructive approach to tiling the grid. We know that four T-tetrominoes can tile a 4 times 4 grid as follows: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} hline T & T & T & _ hline _ & T & _ & T hline T & T & T & _ hline _ & T & _ & T hline end{array} ] We use this 4 times 4 tiling to cover as much of the 202 times 202 grid as possible. The 202 times 202 grid can be divided into a 200 times 200 grid plus a 2 times 202 and a 202 times 2 strip. 3. The 200 times 200 section of the grid can be divided into 25,000 blocks of 4 times 4 units, which can each be tiled with four T-tetrominoes. Therefore, the entire 200 times 200 grid can be completely tiled with T-tetrominoes. 4. Next, the challenge is to tile the remaining 2 times 202 and 202 times 2 strips without any gaps left. Due to the shape and constraints imposed by T-tetromino tiling, it turns out that we cannot cover these strips completely with T-tetrominoes without removing at least one square from each of the corners. 5. Therefore, to find the minimum number of unit squares that need to be removed to allow tiling, let's consider using a different method to prove the impossibility of tiling the whole grid without any squares removal due to the parity of the board. 6. Assign each cell in the grid a coordinate (i, j) where i and j are row and column indices, respectively. Assign each cell a value 4i + 4j + 1. Each T-tetromino always covers cells in such a way that the sum of their values is divisible by 8. However, summing the values of all cells in the 202 times 202 grid, the entire sum modulo 8 must be considered. 7. Consequently, after analyzing the entire grid, we find that the sum of all cell values is not divisible by 8. This indicates an impossibility in covering the grid using T-tetrominoes alone without removing some cells. 8. An alternative proof can use a checkerboard coloring strategy. Coloring the 202 times 202 grid in a checkerboard pattern, we observe that each T-tetromino will cover exactly three squares of one color and one of the other, which again leads to a contradiction in the total number of cells covered by each color. 9. As a result of both approaches, the minimal configuration needing adjustment involves removal of squares to meet the requirements of covering those two uncovered 2 times 202 and 202 times 2 strips. This results in removing four unit squares: [ boxed{4} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the square (ABCD) with side length of 2, triangle (AEF) is constructed so that (AE) bisects side (BC), and (AF) bisects side (CD).

Let us consider a convex quadrilateral (ABCD), in which (AB = AC = BC = d) and (BD < d). The diameter of this quadrilateral is (d). Since at least two out of three vertices (A), (B), or (C) would fall into one of the two parts when the quadrilateral is divided by a line, the diameter of that part would still be (d). **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. **Define the Quadrilateral:** - Let (ABCD) be a convex quadrilateral with the special property that (AB = AC = BC = d) (illustrating an isosceles right-angle triangle with (A), (B), (C) and (D) somewhere inside or outside the formed triangle). - Let (BD < d), which means the distance between (B) and (D) is less than (d). 2. **Find the Diameter of the Quadrilateral:** - The diameter of a quadrilateral is defined as the greatest distance between any two vertices. Here, the diameter will be (d), as it is the greatest length among all distances between vertices ((AB), (AC), (BC)). 3. **Divide the Quadrilateral:** - Suppose a line divides the quadrilateral into two parts. Consider the vertices (A, B,) and (C) which are all distances (d) apart. - At least two vertices from ( {A, B, C } ) must be in one part after the division. 4. **Analyze the Partitions:** - Since at least two of the points (A, B,) and (C) are in the same part, the distance between these two points is still (d). - Therefore, one part will have a diameter equal to (d), which is not less than the original diameter of the quadrilateral. **Conclusion:** Since for some convex quadrilateral it is impossible to divide the quadrilateral into two parts where each part's diameter is less than the original diameter, we conclude that not every convex quadrilateral can be divided this way.

The sum of the first 6 weights (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) is: [ 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 63 ] This calculation shows that using the first 6 weights gives a total of 63 grams. 7. As the sum modulo 64 is aligned with a factor of 64 to check the balance: [ x equiv 11111 mod 64 Rightarrow x equiv 39 mod 64 ] As specified: [ 63 equiv -1 mod 64, ] Thus: [ 11111 - 63 equiv 38 mod 64. ] 8. Consequently, the mass distributed must sum up to complete the required amount of 38 grams on each pan: [ 1 + 2 + 16 = 19. ] 9.

The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point O. Calculate the lengths AO and OC. A) sqrt{61} B) frac{sqrt{61}}{2} C) 5 D) 6","completion":"1. **Identify Shape and Properties**: Since ABCD is a cyclic parallelogram, AB parallel CD and AD parallel BC. By parallelogram properties, AB = CD = 6 units and AD = BC = 5 units. 2. **Use Geometry**: In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, point O is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD. 3. **Calculate Diagonal Lengths**: - We apply Ptolemy's theorem for cyclic quadrilateral ABCD to find the product of the diagonals: [ AC times BD = AB times CD + AD times BC = 6 times 6 + 5 times 5 = 36 + 25 = 61. ] However, this doesn't directly give AC or BD but their product. 4. **Calculate AO and OC**: Since frac{AC}{2} = AO = OC, we need AC. For simplicity, we note the squared form is simpler and split the diagonals in half directly from their lengths: [ (AC)^2 = frac{(AB times CD + AD times BC)^2}{(BD)^2}. ] Since calculating (AC) directly from the above formula involves more information about BD, we reaffirm the parallelogram's bisect property directly states AO = OC = frac{AC}{2}. Therefore, AO = frac{sqrt{61}{2}}. Conclusion: - Since parallelograms have diagonals that bi-sect itself, each segment of the diagonal is half the total diagonal length, given by the conclusion of frac{AC}{2}, which matches our symmetry expectations for the midpoints AO and OC.

Step-by-step solution: 1. **Define the Hexagon and its Properties**: Consider a hexagon (ABCDEF) with the properties: - (AB parallel DE) - (BC parallel EF) - (CD parallel FA) - Diagonals (AD), (BE), and (CF) are all equal. 2. **Analyze the Subdivided Trapezoids**: Notice that the hexagon can be divided into three equal isosceles trapezoids since: - Quadrilateral (ABDE) is an isosceles trapezoid with (AB parallel DE) and (AD = BE). - Quadrilateral (BCEF) is an isosceles trapezoid with (BC parallel EF) and (BE = CF). - Quadrilateral (CDFA) is an isosceles trapezoid with (CD parallel FA) and (CF = AD). 3. **Symmetry Axes in Trapezoids**: Each isosceles trapezoid has an axis of symmetry: - For (ABDE), the axis is the perpendicular bisector of (AB) and (DE), which also bisects the angle between diagonals (AD) and (BE). - For (BCEF), the axis is the perpendicular bisector of (BC) and (EF), which also bisects the angle between diagonals (BE) and (CF). - For (CDFA), the axis is the perpendicular bisector of (CD) and (FA), which also bisects the angle between diagonals (CF) and (AD). 4. **Intersection of Symmetry Axes**: Since each of these symmetry axes represents an angle bisector, the three axes will intersect at a single point, denoted as (O): - Point (O) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors (angle bisectors) of the diagonals. 5. **Point (O) as the Center of the Circumscribing Circle**: By construction, point (O) lies on the perpendicular bisectors of all sides of the hexagon. Hence, (O) is equidistant from all the vertices of the hexagon, making (O) the center of the circumscribing circle. 6. **Verification through Diagonals**: Given that (AD = BE = CF) are equal and (A, B, C, D, E, F) form a cyclic sequence around (O), it implies that vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F) are equidistant from (O). Therefore, a circle centered at (O) with radius (OA) (or (OB), (OC), etc.) will pass through all vertices. # Conclusion: Therefore, the hexagon (ABCDEF) can be circumscribed by a circle with center (O). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given a regular triangular prism SABC with a base that is an equilateral triangle with a side length of 1, and a lateral edge length of 2, the plane passing through AB divides the volume of the prism into two equal parts.

Let (I_j) be the indicator variable for the event that cavalier (j) is shorter than his randomly chosen dance partner. 2. **Probability of Cavalier (j) Being Shorter**: The probability that a specific cavalier (j) will be shorter than his partner can be determined by considering all possible partners. Since there are (n) cavaliers and (n) ladies, and heights are uniformly and independently distributed, each cavalier is equally likely to dance with any lady. For cavalier (j), he is shorter than ((n-j)) ladies (as heights are assumed indexed consistently).

Therefore, the values of the heaps are in the interval ([m, 2m)). 6. **Reverse Calculation Method:** - Let’s see if this process from reverse helps. - By reversing, if the minimum value is (m), the next minimum value that joins to form another heap will be ( geq 2m), and the returned minimum values after combinations will always grow past (2m). 7. **Heaps Work Through:** - If (k) valid distinct heaps exist: - The minimum of each progressive (k) combination increases by at least 1. - In (k) operations, we tackle that the minimum number grows by (k). 8. **Number of Heaps Argument:** - If (m>15), then calculating ( geq 15 times 16 + 16 times 14 + cdots + k times 2 ) values will sum over 660. - If ( m<15 ), then the intervals can't cover the necessary count to stay within 600. # Conclusion: Therefore, the maximum number of heaps we can have such that no two sizes differ by more than twice the size of the smaller heap is: [ boxed{30} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the area, in square units, of a regular octagon inscribed in a circle whose area is 256pi square units?

(2) Find the coordinates of the point where the tangent line passing through the origin intersects the curve y = f(x).","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Discussing the Monotonicity of f(x) 1. First, we find the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + a 2. To discuss the monotonicity, we need to examine the discriminant Delta of f'(x): Delta = 4 - 12a 3. We consider two cases based on Delta: - **Case 1**: Delta leq 0, i.e., a geq frac{1}{3} - Since Delta leq 0, the graph of f'(x), which is a parabola opening upwards, does not cross the x-axis. Thus, f'(x) geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. - This implies that f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}. - **Case 2**: Delta > 0, i.e., a < frac{1}{3} - Solving f'(x) = 0 gives us the critical points x_1 = frac{1 - sqrt{1 - 3a}}{3} and x_2 = frac{1 + sqrt{1 - 3a}}{3}. - For f'(x) > 0, we have x < x_1 or x > x_2, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-infty, x_1) and (x_2, +infty). - For f'(x) < 0, we have x_1 < x < x_2, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (x_1, x_2). 4. In conclusion, the monotonicity of f(x) can be summarized as: - When a geq frac{1}{3}, f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}. - When a < frac{1}{3}, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-infty, frac{1 - sqrt{1 - 3a}}{3}) and (frac{1 + sqrt{1 - 3a}}{3}, +infty), and decreasing on (frac{1 - sqrt{1 - 3a}}{3}, frac{1 + sqrt{1 - 3a}}{3}). Part 2: Finding the Coordinates of the Intersection Point 1. Let the tangent line passing through the origin be l, with the point of tangency ({x}_{0}, {x}_{0}^3 - {x}_{0}^2 + a{x}_{0} + 1) and slope {f}'({x}_{0}) = 3{x}_{0}^2 - 2{x}_{0} + a. 2. The equation of the tangent line is: y - ({x}_{0}^3 - {x}_{0}^2 + a{x}_{0} + 1) = (3{x}_{0}^2 - 2{x}_{0} + a)(x - {x}_{0}) 3. Substituting the origin into the equation of the tangent line gives: 2{x}_{0}^3 - {x}_{0}^2 - 1 = 0 Solving this equation, we find x_{0} = 1. 4. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is: y = (a + 1)x 5. Setting x^3 - x^2 + ax + 1 = (a + 1)x and solving for x gives: x^3 - x^2 - x + 1 = 0 The solutions are x = 1 or x = -1. 6. Therefore, the coordinates of the points where the tangent line passing through the origin intersects the curve y = f(x) are (1, a + 1) and (-1, -a - 1).

The probability that (K_i subseteq S) is (x^{|K_i|}). 4. **Express (f(x)) using the principle of inclusion-exclusion (PIE):** Using PIE, we can write: [ f(x) = Pleft(bigcup_{i=1}^m E_iright) = sum_{t=1}^m sum_{1 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_t leq m} Pleft(bigcap_{j=1}^t E_{i_j}right)(-1)^{t+1} ] Since (Pleft(bigcap_{j=1}^t E_{i_j}right) = x^{|K_{i_1} cap K_{i_2} cap cdots cap K_{i_t}|}), we have: [ f(x) = sum_{t=1}^m sum_{1 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_t leq m} x^{|K_{i_1} cap K_{i_2} cap cdots cap K_{i_t}|} (-1)^{t+1} ] 5. **Differentiate (f(x)):** To show that (f(x)) is strictly increasing, we need to show that (f'(x) > 0) for (x in (0,1)). Differentiating (f(x)) with respect to (x), we get: [ f'(x) = sum_{t=1}^m sum_{1 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_t leq m} |K_{i_1} cap K_{i_2} cap cdots cap K_{i_t}| cdot x^{|K_{i_1} cap K_{i_2} cap cdots cap K_{i_t}| - 1} (-1)^{t+1} ] 6. **Reinterpret the intersection sizes:** For each (k = 1, ldots, n), let (mathcal{A}_k) be the set of indices (i) for which (k in K_i). The term (|K_{i_1} cap K_{i_2} cap cdots cap K_{i_t}|) counts the number of elements (k) such that (k in K_{i_1} cap K_{i_2} cap cdots cap K_{i_t}). 7. **Sum over all elements:** We can rewrite (f'(x)) as: [ f'(x) = sum_{k=1}^n sum_{t=1}^{|mathcal{A}_k|} sum_{substack{1 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_t leq m i_j in mathcal{A}_k}} x^{|K_{i_1} cap K_{i_2} cap cdots cap K_{i_t}| - 1} (-1)^{t+1} ] This can be interpreted as: [ f'(x) = sum_{k=1}^n Pleft(bigcup_{j in mathcal{A}_k} E_jright) ] 8. **Non-negativity of the derivative:** Since (Pleft(bigcup_{j in mathcal{A}_k} E_jright) geq 0) for all (k), we have: [ f'(x) geq 0 ] Therefore, (f(x)) is non-decreasing. To show that (f(x)) is strictly increasing, we need to argue that (f'(x) > 0) for (x in (0,1)). Given the structure of (mathcal{A}) and the fact that (x in (0,1)), there will always be some (k) such that (Pleft(bigcup_{j in mathcal{A}_k} E_jright) > 0), ensuring that (f'(x) > 0).

Let ( E ) be the point where the line segment ( AM ) intersects the given circle (mathcal{C}). According to the lemma of tangency, the point ( E ) serves as the point of tangency for the required circle and the given circle. 3. **Construct Perpendicular:** From the point ( M ), draw a perpendicular to the given line ( l ), extending this line to intersect with the extended segment ( BE ) at point ( N ). 4. **Determine the Diameter:** The segment ( MN ) will be the diameter of the required circle (mathcal{C}'). This method yields the first solution, constructing the circle (mathcal{C}') that is tangent to both the given circle and the given line at point ( M ). 5. **Second Solution - Internal Tangency:** Observe that there's another solution: constructing a circle that is tangent internally to the given circle (mathcal{C}). For this, determine the point of tangency ( E ) as the point of intersection of the line ( BM ) with the given circle (mathcal{C}). The steps from here are analogous to the first solution. In both cases, the critical step involves identifying the point ( E ) where the tangency occurs and using perpendicular constructions from given geometric constraints to determine the required diameter of the new circle. # Conclusion: Since the second method follows similar subsequent steps to construct the internally tangent circle, both cases provide comprehensive solutions to the problem.

This is because the congruence of a sum sequence modulo 9 depends only on its digits' sum, not their order. 5. **Contradiction of congruences:** However, we previously found that throughout each step, the number generated from 2^{1970} remains 4 modulo 9: [ k equiv 4 pmod{9} ] where k is the resulting number at any step.

The eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} 2. The point (2, sqrt{2}) satisfies the ellipse equation, leading to frac{4}{a^2} + frac{2}{b^2} = 1 From the eccentricity equation, we know c = frac{asqrt{2}}{2}. Since c^2 = a^2 - b^2, we can substitute c into this equation to find a relationship between a and b. Solving the system of equations, we find: - a = 2sqrt{2} - b = 2 Therefore, the equation of the ellipse C is: frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1 The radius of the \\"satellite circle\\" is sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = sqrt{8 + 4} = sqrt{12}, so the equation of the \\"satellite circle\\" is: x^2 + y^2 = 12 boxed{text{The equation of the ellipse is } frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1 text{ and the equation of the satellite circle is } x^2 + y^2 = 12} Part (II) # Method 1: 1. **Case 1:** When l_1 or l_2 has no slope, assume l_1 is vertical (x = text{constant}). Since it intersects the ellipse at only one point, its equation is either x = 2sqrt{2} or x = -2sqrt{2}. For x = 2sqrt{2}, l_1 intersects the \\"satellite circle\\" at (2sqrt{2}, 2) and (2sqrt{2}, -2). The perpendicular line l_2 must then be horizontal (y = text{constant}), either y = 2 or y = -2. Thus, l_1 bot l_2, and MN is the diameter of the \\"satellite circle\\", so |MN| = 4sqrt{3}. 2. **Case 2:** When both l_1 and l_2 have slopes, let P(x_0, y_0) be a point on the \\"satellite circle\\" such that x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 12. The equation of a line through P intersecting the ellipse at one point can be written as y = t(x - x_0) + y_0. Substituting this into the ellipse equation and solving, we find that the product of the slopes of l_1 and l_2 is -1, indicating they are perpendicular. Thus, MN is the diameter of the \\"satellite circle\\", and |MN| = 4sqrt{3}. Combining both cases, we conclude that regardless of the position of P on the \\"satellite circle\\", the chord length |MN| is always equal to the diameter of the \\"satellite circle\\", which is a constant value. boxed{|MN| = 4sqrt{3} text{ is a constant value}} # Method 2: Since l_1 and l_2 pass through point P(x_0, y_0) on the \\"satellite circle\\" and are perpendicular to each other, they form a diameter of the \\"satellite circle\\".

The product in question is [(n - 1)(n - 3)(n - 5) dotsm (n - 97).] 1. **Counting the Factors**: First, we count the number of factors in the given product. Since the factors decrease by 2 each time, starting from n - 1 and ending at n - 97, there are frac{97 - 1}{2} + 1 = 49 factors. 2. **Analyzing Sign Changes**: - For n < 1, all factors are negative because n is less than all the numbers from 1 to 97. Since there are 49 factors (an odd number), the product of an odd number of negative numbers is negative. - When n increases from 1 to 3 (1 < n < 3), the factor n - 1 becomes positive while the others remain negative. This changes the overall sign of the product to positive because there is now an even number of negative factors. - For each interval between the odd numbers (e.g., 3 < n < 5, 5 < n < 7, etc.), one more factor changes from negative to positive. This alternates the sign of the product with each interval. Since we started with a negative product for n < 1, every second interval (starting with 3 < n < 5) will result in a negative product, satisfying the given inequality. 3. **Identifying Satisfying Integers**: - The inequality holds for n = 4, 8, 12, ..., 96. These are the integers in the intervals where the product is negative. - To find the total number of such integers, we observe that they form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4, starting from 4 and ending at 96. The number of terms in this sequence is frac{96 - 4}{4} + 1 = 24.

When aleq 0, we have f'(x) < 0, hence f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty). For a > 0, setting f'(x)=0 gives x = pm sqrt{frac{a}{2}} (we discard the negative value since the domain is positive). When x in left(0, sqrt{frac{a}{2}}right), f'(x) > 0, and when x in left(sqrt{frac{a}{2}}, +inftyright), f'(x) < 0. Thus f(x) is monotonically increasing on left(0, sqrt{frac{a}{2}}right) and monotonically decreasing on left(sqrt{frac{a}{2}}, +inftyright). (II) When a=2, from f(x) leq g(x) we have: 2ln x - x^2 leq (lambda - 1)x^2 + 2(lambda - 1)x - 2, which simplifies to (x^2+2x)lambda geq 2ln x + 2x + 2.

Define h(x) = -2ln x - x, and its derivative is h'(x) = -frac{2}{x} - 1 < 0, implying that h(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty). As x approaches 0, h(x) goes to +infty, and as x approaches +infty, h(x) goes to -infty. Therefore, there exists a unique zero of h(x) in (0, +infty). Let x_0 be such that h(x_0) = 0, i.e., 2ln x_0 = -x_0. For x in (0, x_0), h(x) > 0 and g'(x) > 0, so g(x) is increasing. For x in (x_0, +infty), h(x) < 0 and g'(x) < 0, so g(x) is decreasing.

D: When x gt 1, y lt 0.","completion":"To analyze the given linear function y = x + 1 and determine which of the statements is correct, we proceed as follows: 1. **Quadrants through which the graph passes:** Given the linear function y = x + 1, we note that the slope (k) is positive (k > 0) and the y-intercept (b) is also positive (b > 0). This implies that as x increases, y also increases, indicating the graph will pass through the first and third quadrants due to the nature of linear functions. Additionally, since the y-intercept is positive, the graph will also pass through the second quadrant. Therefore, the graph passes through the first, second, and third quadrants, making statement A incorrect. 2. **Intersection with the y-axis:** To find the point where the graph intersects the y-axis, we set x = 0 and find y. Substituting x = 0 into the equation y = x + 1, we get y = 0 + 1 = 1. Therefore, the graph intersects the y-axis at the point (0, 1), making statement B correct. 3. **Behavior of the function value y as x increases:** Since the slope of the linear function y = x + 1 is positive (k > 0), it means that as the independent variable x increases, the function value y also increases. This contradicts statement C, which claims that y decreases as x increases. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. 4. **Value of y when x > -1:** To understand the behavior of y when x > -1, we examine the point where x = -1. Substituting x = -1 into the equation y = x + 1, we get y = -1 + 1 = 0. Since the slope is positive, as x increases from -1, y will increase from 0.

To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, 60 km/h = 60 * (1000 / 3600) m/s 60 km/h = 60 * (10 / 36) m/s 60 km/h = 60 * (5 / 18) m/s 60 km/h = 10 * 5 m/s 60 km/h = 50 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge.

Each pyramid has its base as one of the faces of the polyhedron, and they all share a common apex, which is the center of the inscribed sphere. 2. **Volume Calculation for Each Pyramid**: For any face ( S_i ) of the polyhedron, we can consider the pyramid having: - Base area ( S_i ) (the area of the polyhedron face). - Height ( R ) (the radius of the inscribed sphere, which is the perpendicular distance from the center of the sphere to the face). The volume ( V_i ) of this pyramid can be calculated as: [ V_i = frac{1}{3} S_i R ] 3. **Summing Volumes of All Pyramids**: The volume of the entire polyhedron is the sum of the volumes of these ( n ) pyramids. Therefore, the total volume ( V ) of the polyhedron is: [ V = V_1 + V_2 + cdots + V_n = frac{1}{3} S_1 R + frac{1}{3} S_2 R + cdots + frac{1}{3} S_n R ] 4. **Factorization**: We can factor out the common factors ( frac{1}{3}R ) from each term in the sum to obtain: [ V = frac{1}{3} R (S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_n) ] 5. **Surface Area Summation**: Notice that ( S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_n ) is simply the total surface area ( S ) of the polyhedron.

A prism can be inscribed in a sphere if and only if all its vertices lie on the surface of the sphere. This implies that the vertices of each base of the prism lie on congruent circles, the intersection of the sphere with planes of the bases of the prism. 2. Consider a planar cross-section of the sphere that includes one of the bases of the prism. Since the base vertices lie in this plane and on the sphere, they must lie on a circle, which is the intersection of the spherical surface and the plane of the base. The same logic applies to the other base. 3. The circles mentioned in step 2 are congruent, meaning that both bases of the prism are inscribed in circles of equal radii. 4. Now, take the line connecting the centers of these two congruent circles. Due to the symmetry and congruency, this line passes through the center of the sphere and is perpendicular to the planes of the bases. 5. Hence, this leads us to conclude that the prism must be a right prism. The bases must be congruent polygons (because their circumscribing circles are congruent), and the lateral edges must be perpendicular to the bases. 6. Conversely, if a prism is a right prism with bases that are polygons inscribed in circles, and these circles are congruent, a sphere can be constructed such that all vertices of the prism lie on the surface of the sphere. This sphere has its center at the midpoint of the line segment connecting the centers of the circles inscribing the bases of the prism. 7. This midpoint is equidistant from all vertices of the prism, as it lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment through the centers of the base circles. 8. Lastly, since all vertices of the prism are equidistant from a single point, it confirms that the sphere described with this radius will indeed inscribe the entire prism. Therefore, the condition that must be satisfied for a prism to be inscribed in a sphere is that it must be a right prism with both of its bases being congruent polygons inscribed in congruent circles.

The key to solving this problem is to reduce the higher-order power function by substitution. Let the coordinates of point A be ({x_0}, {x_0}^2). By differentiating y=x^2, we obtain the slope of the tangent line m at point A as y'|_{x=x_0} = 2x_0. Thus, the equation of the line n passing through point A and perpendicular to line m can be calculated. Upon solving the system of equations formed by the curve and line n, we find the coordinates of point B. Finally, we express the distance between points A and B as a function of x_0, reduce its power using substitution, and determine its minimum value using derivatives. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. Let the coordinates of point A be A({x_0}, {x_0}^2). The derivative of y=x^2 is y'=2x, so the slope of the tangent line at point A is 2x_0. 2.

Because LN parallel AC, the angles angle KLN and angle LKA are equal by the Alternating Interior Angles Theorem: [ angle KLN = angle LKA ] 5. Since KL is an angle bisector of angle AKB, L is equidistant from the lines KA and KB. Thus, angle ALK = angle BLK by definition of the angle bisector. 6.

Therefore, L must lie on the angle bisector of angle KBC_1, where C_1 is a point such that it lies on the extension of segment CB beyond B. 8. Since L lies on the angle bisector of angle KBC_1, it makes BL or BA another angle bisector. Thus, the following angles are established: [ angle ABK = angle CBK = angle BKL ] 9.

The shifts are: 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ldots, which translates to 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on. 2. **First Player's Strategy:** The first player’s moves need to be examined: - For the first move: 2^0 = 1 cell - For the second move: 2^1 = 2 cells - Next move: 2^2 = 4 cells - This continues exponentially up to a significant move, like 2^{10} = 1024 cells. 3. **Determine the critical move:** If the first player makes a move of length 1024 cells, the second player would be forced to make a move of length 2048 cells in their subsequent turn. 4. **Feasibility of the Move:** Since the game presumably has constraints, such as a limited board size, compute the sum of initial smaller moves: [ 1 + 2 + 4 + ldots + 128 < 256 ] The sum of these geometric terms can be computed by the formula for the sum of a geometric series (S_n = afrac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}), where (a) is the first term, (r) is the common ratio, and (n) is the number of terms. Here, (a = 1), (r = 2), and the series length up to (2^8 = 256): [ S = 1 + 2 + 4 + ldots + 128 = frac{2^8 - 1}{2 - 1} = 255 ] Thus, up to the 5th move, the distances sum less than 256 cells (highlighting the reachability within the game’s board). 5. **First Player’s Advantage:** For the fifth critical move by the first player: [ 256 , text{cells towards central cell} ] If during this move, the token is adjacent to the central cell, any subsequent move by the second player would have to be 512 cells. The distance ensured will be at least 256 cells. 6. **Observing Opponent’s Constraints:** After the second player's move of 512 cells, the remaining cells to a 1024-step move can be computed, ensuring: - The required 1024 move is achievable. - The board size limitation ensures the opponent cannot make the next required exponential move. # Conclusion: Hence, the first player has an inevitable win as it forces the second player into a position where they can no longer make a valid next move.

This leaves us with 21 - 14 = 7 visits to be distributed among the remaining 4 people (since 11 - 7 = 4).

The expected value of X can be calculated using the formula for expected value, E(X)=sum x_iP(x_i), where x_i are the values that X can take, and P(x_i) are the probabilities of X taking those values.

First, let's find out how many joggers Martha and Alexander bought since Christopher's purchase is based on the difference between Martha's and Alexander's purchases. Let's denote the number of joggers Martha bought as M and the number of joggers Alexander bought as A. Given that Christopher bought eighteen times the difference between the joggers bought by Martha and Alexander, we can write the following equation: C = 18 * (A - M) where C is the number of joggers Christopher bought. Since we know C = 126, we can plug that into the equation: 126 = 18 * (A - M) Now, let's solve for (A - M): A - M = 126 / 18 A - M = 7 Now, we know that Alexander bought 1.5 times as many joggers as Tyson (T), so we can write: A = 1.5T And Martha bought 2/3T joggers fewer than Tyson, so we can write: M = T - (2/3)T M = (1/3)T Now we can substitute A and M in the equation A - M = 7: 1.5T - (1/3)T = 7 To solve for T, we first find a common denominator for the fractions: (4.5/3)T - (1/3)T = 7 Combine the terms: (3.5/3)T = 7 Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the denominator: 3.5T = 21 Now divide both sides by 3.5 to solve for T: T = 21 / 3.5 T = 6 Now that we have T, we can find out how many joggers Natasha bought.

Therefore, tap B's rate is 12 liters in 20 minutes, which is: B = 12 liters / 20 minutes = 0.6 liters per minute. Now, when both taps are working together, they fill the bucket in 10 minutes. The total volume of the bucket is 36 liters, so the combined rate of taps A and B is: A + B = 36 liters / 10 minutes = 3.6 liters per minute.

Then, we apply the \\"Threefold Loss and Gain Method\\" step by step to find the lengths of the other tubes. 1. **Length of the \\"zhǐ\\" tube**: According to the \\"Threefold Loss One\\" method, we divide the length of the \\"gōng\\" tube by 3 and subtract one part from the total, giving us frac{2}{3}a for the \\"zhǐ\\" tube. 2. **Length of the \\"shāng\\" tube**: Applying the \\"Threefold Gain One\\" method to the \\"zhǐ\\" tube, we divide its length by 3 and add one part to the total, resulting in frac{2}{3}a times frac{4}{3} = frac{8}{9}a for the \\"shāng\\" tube. 3. **Length of the \\"yǔ\\" tube**: Using the \\"Threefold Loss One\\" method again on the \\"shāng\\" tube, we get frac{8}{9}a times frac{2}{3} = frac{16}{27}a for the \\"yǔ\\" tube. 4. **Length of the \\"jué\\" tube**: Finally, applying the \\"Threefold Gain One\\" method to the \\"yǔ\\" tube, we find frac{16}{27}a times frac{4}{3} = frac{64}{81}a for the \\"jué\\" tube.

Therefore, we can write the equation for the distance covered when crossing the signal pole as: [ text{Distance} = text{Speed} times text{Time} ] [ 250 text{ meters} = V times 20 text{ seconds} ] From this, we can solve for the speed of the train ( V ): [ V = frac{250 text{ meters}}{20 text{ seconds}} ] [ V = 12.5 text{ meters/second} ] Now, when the train crosses the platform, it has to cover the length of the train plus the length of the platform.

While it's technically possible to conduct a comprehensive survey, the practical approach for such a study, considering its scope and the variability of the population, leans more towards a sample survey.

Rightarrow This implies the following system of equations: begin{cases} frac{c}{a} = sqrt{3} frac{a^2}{c} = 1 end{cases} Solving the system of equations, we obtain a = sqrt{3}, c = 3, and b = sqrt{9 - 3} = sqrt{6}. Rightarrow Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is frac{x^2}{3} - frac{y^2}{6} = 1. boxed{text{Hence, the correct answer is (A) } frac{x^2}{3} - frac{y^2}{6} = 1.}"},{"prompt":"Regular hexagon ABCDE and regular octagon AEFGHIJK are drawn on opposite sides of line segment AE such that they are coplanar. What is the degree measure of exterior angle DEF?","completion":"To find angle DEF, we need to first determine angle DEA and angle FEA, which are interior angles of regular hexagon and regular octagon respectively. 1. For the regular hexagon ABCDE: - The number of sides n = 6. - Each interior angle = frac{180(6-2)}{6} = frac{180 times 4}{6} = 120 ^circ. - Thus, angle DEA = 120^circ. 2. For the regular octagon AEFGHIJK: - The number of sides n = 8. - Each interior angle = frac{180(8-2)}{8} = frac{180 times 6}{8} = 135^circ. - Thus, angle FEA = 135^circ. 3. Since angle DEA, angle FEA, and angle DEF form a full circle around point E, their sum must be 360^circ. - Hence, angle DEF = 360^circ - (angle DEA + angle FEA) = 360^circ - (120^circ + 135^circ) = 360^circ - 255^circ = 105^circ.

John's work rate is 1/16 of the task per day, and Jane's work rate is 1/12 of the task per day. When they work together, their combined work rate is: 1/16 + 1/12 = 3/48 + 4/48 = 7/48 of the task per day. Let's assume they worked together for x days before Jane had to leave. In x days, they would have completed: 7/48 * x of the task. Jane left 5 days before the work was completed, so John had to work alone for the last 5 days. In those 5 days, John would have completed: 1/16 * 5 = 5/16 of the task. The total work done when the task was completed is the sum of the work done by John and Jane together and the work done by John alone: 7/48 * x + 5/16 = 1 (since the task is completed). To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation: 7/48 * x + 5/16 = 1 First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 48: 7/48 * x + (5/16 * 3/3) = 1 7/48 * x + 15/48 = 1 Now, let's isolate x: 7/48 * x = 1 - 15/48 7/48 * x = 33/48 - 15/48 7/48 * x = 18/48 Now, divide both sides by 7/48 to solve for x: x = (18/48) / (7/48) x = 18/48 * 48/7 x = 18/7 x = 2.5714 (approximately) Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 days.

Hence, there is no line in the plane alpha that would intersect l. Therefore, option A is not possible. - If line l intersects plane alpha, then it must intersect at exactly one point. At this point of intersection, there can be infinitely many lines within the plane that intersect l. However, since the problem assumes the existence of only one specific relation between the line within the plane and line l, and since intersecting is not a unique relationship (as there are infinitely many lines that would intersect), option A is incorrect, while option B (parallel) is impossible because l has already intersected the plane. - If line l is contained within plane alpha, then every line in plane alpha will either intersect with l at some point (if they are not parallel) or be parallel to l.

This is an upper bound for the trace of any such matrix ( M ) because the diagonal entry ( M_{i,i} ) cannot exceed ( min(p_i, q_i) ) for each ( i ). 3. **Existence of the maximum:** The set of matrices with the given row and column sums is closed and bounded in the space of ( n times n ) matrices with nonnegative entries. Since the trace function is continuous, it achieves its maximum on this set. 4. **Constructing a matrix with maximum trace:** Suppose we have a matrix ( M ) with trace strictly less than ( S ). We will show that this matrix is not of maximal trace by constructing another matrix with a larger trace. 5. **Improving the trace:** If ( operatorname{tr}(M) < S ), there exists some ( i ) such that ( M_{i,i} < min(p_i, q_i) ). By the conditions on the row and column sums, there must be indices ( j ) and ( k ) (neither equal to ( i )) such that ( M_{i,j} > 0 ) and ( M_{k,i} > 0 ). 6. **Adjusting the matrix:** We can construct a new matrix ( M' ) by increasing ( M_{i,i} ) and ( M_{k,j} ) by a small positive amount ( epsilon ), and decreasing ( M_{i,j} ) and ( M_{k,i} ) by the same amount ( epsilon ). This adjustment keeps all entries nonnegative and preserves the row and column sums. 7. **Increasing the trace:** The new matrix ( M' ) has a trace given by [ operatorname{tr}(M') = operatorname{tr}(M) + epsilon, ] which is strictly larger than the trace of ( M ). This contradicts the assumption that ( M ) had the maximum trace. 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the matrix with the maximum trace must have ( operatorname{tr}(M) = S ).

Because ( log_{frac{1}{2}} x ) is a decreasing function, the term ( 2 left( log_{frac{1}{2}} x - frac{1}{2} right)^2 ) indicates that as ( log_{frac{1}{2}} x ) decreases (i.e., as ( x ) increases), the value inside the square increases. Hence, the whole function ( y ) increases. 5. Therefore, the function ( y ) is increasing when: [ log_{frac{1}{2}} x leq frac{1}{2} ] 6.

The problem states that we need to show that the normal to the curve ( y = f(x) ) at the point ( left( x_0, y_0 right) ) is given by the equation: [ -f^{prime}left(x_0right)left(y - y_0right) = x - x_0. ] 2. We begin by recalling that if a line passing through a point ( left( x_0, y_0 right) ) has a slope ( k ), its equation can be written as: [ frac{y - y_0}{x - x_0} = k. ] 3. The normal line to this line, which is perpendicular, will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of ( k ). This is because the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is (-1). Hence, if the slope of the tangent line is ( k ), the slope of the normal line is: [ -frac{1}{k}. ] 4.

Therefore, the slope of the normal to the curve at the point ( left( x_0, y_0 right) ) is: [ -frac{1}{f^{prime}(x_0)}. ] 6.

For which values of n is this possible?","completion":"We start by observing that the grid in question is a (5 times n) sheet filled with (1 times 2) dominoes. Each domino covers exactly two adjacent cells in the grid. 1. Since the product of the numbers in each column and row must be positive, it implies that the number of negative ones in each column and each row is even. To see why, consider: - If the product of numbers in a column is positive, then the column contains an even number of negative ones (because the product of an odd number of negative ones is negative). - Similarly, if the product of numbers in a row is positive, then the row contains an even number of negative ones. 2. Each cell of the grid must either contain a 1 or a -1, and each (1 times 2) domino will cover two adjacent cells in either a horizontal or vertical placement. Each domino, therefore, must contain one 1 and one -1 because the product of the two numbers on the dominoes must also be considered (since multiplying 1 and -1 results in -1, which is negative; aligning multiple dominoes to keep the overall grid product positive requires strategic placement). 3. Let us now calculate the total number of cells in the grid: [ text{Total number of cells} = 5n ] 4. This product, (5n), must be divisible by 2, because each domino covers exactly 2 cells; hence the total number of cells must be even. This means (n) itself must be even. 5. Additionally, because each column must contain an even number of negative ones, and the columns are each partitioned from the (5 times n) grid, if (5n) cells are covered, the total number of cells must be arranged in a multiple where every groupings (both horizontally and vertically) have an even count of negative ones that lead to the overall product being positive. 6. The grid structure (5 times n), dictates that (n) must be a multiple of 4. This is concluded from balancing the column, row, and even grid properties as per the table must get divided efficiently into such that each smaller partition (or tiles filled with the ( 1 times 2 ) domino) maintains positive products by structure evenness.

Thus, f(0) cdot f(sqrt{3}) < 0 indicates there is a zero in the interval (0, sqrt{3}), and since f(-1) = 0, the function f(x) has more than one zero.

Let the circle passing through points (A), (B), and the orthocenter (H) of triangle (ABC) intersect sides (AC) and (BC) at points (I_1) and (I_2) respectively. 2. Since (H) is the orthocenter, the angle (angle BHC) is given by: [ angle BHC = 180^circ - angle A ] This follows from the property of the orthocenter in a triangle, where the angle between the altitudes is supplementary to the angle at the opposite vertex. 3. In the cyclic quadrilateral (AI_2HC), the opposite angles sum to (180^circ). Therefore: [ angle AI_2C + angle AHC = 180^circ ] Since (angle AHC = 180^circ - angle A), we have: [ angle AI_2C = angle A ] 4. In triangle (AI_2C), we know that the sum of the angles is (180^circ).

We can do this by dividing 9 by 11 and finding the remainder, then subtracting that remainder from 11 to find the next multiple. 9 divided by 11 gives us a quotient of 0 with a remainder of 9.

Prove this.","completion":"1. **Assumption and Problem Restatement**: Given an ( n times n ) square matrix filled with numbers from 1 to ( n ) such that each number appears exactly once in each row and each column, we need to prove that if ( n ) is odd and the matrix is symmetric with respect to the diagonal running from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, then each number from 1 to ( n ) appears exactly once on this diagonal. 2. **Matrix Symmetry Consideration**: Because the matrix is symmetric with respect to the specified diagonal, for any element ( a_{ij} ) located at ( (i, j) ), there exists an equal element ( a_{ji} ) at the symmetric position across the diagonal. This implies ( a_{ij} = a_{ji} ). 3. **Counting Elements on and off the Diagonal**: Since ( n ) is odd, the total number of cells in the matrix is ( n^2 ). There are ( n ) cells on the main diagonal. We examine the distribution of numbers both on and off this diagonal: - Off the diagonal, the matrix contains ( n(n-1) ) cells, all of which contain ( n-1 ) occurrences of each number from 1 to ( n ). - Each number from 1 to ( n ) must appear ( n ) times in total within the entire matrix. 4. **Implication of Symmetry**: Since the matrix is symmetric and each row and column contains all numbers from 1 to ( n ) exactly once, and given the numbers off-diagonal must sum up correctly, we analyze the diagonal elements: - Due to symmetry, for each element ( a_{ij} = a_{ji} ), the numbers off the diagonal come in pairs: - This pairing implies that each number must balance to appear ( n-1 ) times away from the diagonal among an even number of symmetric positions. - Therefore, the remaining single instance of each number must necessarily be on the diagonal. 5. **Conclusion**: By considering the fill constraint (each number from 1 to ( n ) appearing exactly once per row and column), symmetry constraint (( a_{ij} = a_{ji} )), and count balancing (odd vs even distribution), we infer that each number from 1 to ( n ) appears exactly once on the main diagonal of the matrix. Thus, we have proved that in an ( n times n ) matrix (with ( n ) odd), symmetric about the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right, all numbers from 1 to ( n ) appear on the diagonal exactly once.

Similarly, let ( S ) be the area of the circle circumscribed around the original square, and ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_n ) be the areas of the circles circumscribed around each of the rectangles. 3. Consider one of the rectangles, ( k )-th rectangle, with sides ( a ) and ( b ). The area of the circle circumscribed around this rectangle is given by the formula: [ S_k = frac{1}{4} pi (a^2 + b^2) ] 4. The area of this rectangle itself is: [ s_k = ab ] 5. Now, to relate the areas of the circles and the rectangles, begin by noting the comparison: [ pi s_k = pi ab ] To establish an upper bound for ( pi ab ), we can employ the arithmetic mean – geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality: [ frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} geq ab implies a^2 + b^2 geq 2ab ] Given that ( ab = s_k ), we get: [ pi s_k = pi ab leq pi frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} ] 6. Returning to the area of the circle circumscribed around the rectangle, we multiply our inequality by ( 2 ): [ pi ab leq frac{pi}{2} (a^2 + b^2) = 2 left( frac{1}{4} pi (a^2 + b^2) right) = 2 S_k ] Hence: [ pi s_k leq 2 S_k ] 7.

Observing properties of the entire structure, the total area of the original square ( s ) is the sum of the areas of its constituent rectangles: [ s = s_1 + s_2 + cdots + s_n ] Taking the circles into account, we know from the formula for the area of the circle circumscribed around a square of side length ( s ): [ S = frac{1}{4} pi (2s) = pi s ] 9.

Then the second frame is fixed, and similarly step by step, each following frame is rotated to form a 45^circ angle at each hinge.

Then, let the lower right and left vertices of the i-th frame be A_i and B_i, respectively. The other vertices can be labeled following counterclockwise as C_i and D_i. Thus, A_{i+1} coincides with B_i, and it is clear that the joints lie on the line e (Figure 1). 2. **First Rotation and Reflection**: After the first prescribed rotation, denote this by F_1, the right side A_1D_1 of K_1 stands perpendicular to the diagonal B_0D_0 of K_0, and its extension falls on the reflection of this diagonal with respect to line e. Therefore, it passes through the point O, which is the reflection of D_1 on line e yet the same as D_0's reflection on e (Figure 2). 3. **Frame Alignment and Scaling**: Point O is also the reflection of the new positions of D_1 about line e_1 where the joints now line up since according to the data, A_1D_1 = B_0D_0 = B_0O = OA_0 cdot sqrt{2} = OA_1. Consequently, OB_1 = sqrt{2} cdot OB_0 = (sqrt{2})^2 cdot OA_0. Hence, the positions of frames K_1, K_2, K_3, ldots after F_1 are obtained through a rotation and scaling about O with an angle of +45^circ and a scaling factor of sqrt{2}. Note that frames K_{49}, beyond K_{49}, do not need consideration. 4. **Relation After F_1**: After F_1, within the 45^circ opening of angle D_0OB_0 only K_0 remains among our frames. Also, A_1C_1 diagonal of K_1 lies on e and stays there since K_1 is stabilized in this position. 5. **Drawing Semi-lines**: Draw from O the semi-lines f_j (j=1,2,ldots,7), which makes angle j cdot 45^circ with OA_0 = f_0, so f_1 coincides with OA_1.

Only K_1 remains in T_1. Angle B_2A_2 is perpendicular to f_2. With B_2A_2 = B_1D_1 = B_1O implies B_2 reaches f_2. Therefore, OB_2 = sqrt{2} cdot OB_1 = (sqrt{2})^3 cdot OA_0, and K_2 is fixed there. 7. **Continuing Similar Rotations**: By repeating rotations F_3, F_4, ldots, and fixation of K_3, K_4, ldots similarly, we find each K_i that is fixed lies within corresponding angular sections T_j for which the smallest non-negative remainder of i: 8 determines j. Points B_i and A_i fixed positions lie on f_{j-i} and f_j respectively so that OB_i = (sqrt{2})^i cdot OA_0 and OA_i = (sqrt{2})^{i-1} cdot OA_0. 8. **Determining Intersection with e**: Line e falls into sections T_1 and T_6. As e partitions T_0 and T_7, its portions are brief enough, thus, it intersects significantly only with frames where the remainder from dividing i by 8 is 1, or 6.

Next, we find the complement of set B in the universal set U. Since set B contains all real numbers greater than or equal to 1, its complement, C_U B, contains all real numbers less than 1: C_U B = (-infty, 1). To find the intersection A cap C_U B, we look at the common elements present in both sets A and C_U B. Since set A includes real numbers between 0 and 2, and C_U B includes all real numbers less than 1, the intersection will be the real numbers between 0 and 1: A cap C_U B = (0, 1).

Now, let’s solve for the dimensions a, b, and c: From the second equation bc = 2, we can express c as frac{2}{b}. Substituting c = frac{2}{b} into the third equation ac = 3, we get a(frac{2}{b}) = 3, so a = frac{3b}{2}. Now substituting a = frac{3b}{2} into the first equation ab = 6, we get: frac{3b}{2} cdot b = 6 Rightarrow frac{3b^2}{2} = 6 Rightarrow b^2 = 4 Rightarrow b = 2. Since b = 2, we can now find a and c as follows: a = frac{3b}{2} = frac{3 cdot 2}{2} = 3, c = frac{2}{b} = frac{2}{2} = 1.

The line that satisfies this condition is either the perpendicular bisector of the segment AB or a line parallel to AB passing through point P. Let's first find the slope of the line AB. The slope m_{AB} is found using the formula: m_{AB} = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{-5 - 3}{0 - 2} = frac{-8}{-2} = 4. Since AB has a slope of 4, a line perpendicular to AB will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal, m = -1/4. Now we have two options: 1. The perpendicular bisector of AB. 2. A line parallel to AB through P. For 1, to find the perpendicular bisector, we first find the midpoint of AB, which is given by Mleft(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}right): M = left(frac{2 + 0}{2}, frac{3 + (-5)}{2}right) = left(1, -1right). The equation of the line with slope -1/4 passing through M (1, -1) is: y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) y - (-1) = -frac{1}{4}(x - 1) y + 1 = -frac{1}{4}x + frac{1}{4} Multiplying through by 4 to eliminate fractions: 4y + 4 = -x + 1 4y = -x - 3 y = -frac{1}{4}x - frac{3}{4}. However, we made an error since this line does not pass through P (1, 2). So we should instead adjust for the slope, but since the line must pass through P, the equation of our line will match the form: y - 2 = -frac{1}{4}(x - 1). Let's see if this fits both points. Substituting point A (2, 3) into the equation yields: 3 - 2 = -frac{1}{4}(2 - 1) 1 = -frac{1}{4}, which is incorrect. Hence, point A is not equidistant to the line y - 2 = -frac{1}{4}(x - 1) passing through P (1, 2). Substituting point B (0, -5) into the equation yields: -5 - 2 = -frac{1}{4}(0 - 1) -7 = frac{1}{4}, which is incorrect. Hence, point B is also not equidistant to the line y - 2 = -frac{1}{4}(x - 1) passing through P (1, 2). Therefore, the correct approach is (2), a line parallel to AB through P. Since AB has a slope of 4, the equation of the line with the same slope passing through P (1, 2) is: y - 2 = 4(x - 1) y = 4x - 4 + 2 y = 4x - 2. Thus, the equation of the line is y = 4x - 2. Additionally, the line could be vertical if it is parallel to the segment AB since AB does not have a defined slope (vertical line). Therefore, the other possible line is x=1 as given in the initial solution. Let's check if A and B are equidistant from the line x=1. For point A (2, 3): Distance = |2 - 1| = 1. For point B (0, -5): Distance = |0 - 1| = 1. Indeed, A and B are equidistant from the line x=1. Therefore, the two possible equations for the lines that are equidistant from both points A and B and pass through P are: y = 4x - 2 quad text{and} quad x = 1.
