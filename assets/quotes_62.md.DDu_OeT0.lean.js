To find the fraction that represents the length of the rectangle in terms of the radius of the circle, we divide the length of the rectangle by the radius of the circle: Fraction = Length of rectangle / Radius of circle = 10 / 25 = 2 / 5 Therefore, the length of the rectangle is boxed{2/5} of the radius of the circle."},{"prompt":"Using a compass and straightedge, construct a triangle given two sides and an angle bisector from one of the vertices.","completion":"# Problem: Construct a triangle using a compass and straightedge given two sides and the angle bisector originating from a single vertex. 1. **Identify Given Elements**: - We are given a triangle ABC with sides AB, AC, and angle bisector AD. 2. **Constructing the Circles**: - Draw circles S_1 and S_2: - S_1 with center at A and radius equal to AB. - S_2 with center at A and radius equal to AC. 3. **Using the Angle Bisector Theorem**: - According to the Angle Bisector Theorem, the angle bisector AD of angle BAC divides the opposite side BC into segments proportional to the adjacent sides, i.e., [ frac{BD}{DC} = frac{AB}{AC} ] 4. **Applying Homothety**: - Homothety, or similarity transformation, helps in finding point B given that D and the ratio k = frac{AB}{AC}. - Using homothety centered at D with a coefficient -frac{AB}{AC}, the image of point C will coincide with point B. 5. **Constructing the Required Triangle**: - First, we need to locate points B and C: - Construct S_1 centered at A with radius AB. - Construct S_2 centered at A with radius AC. - Using homothety from D and the proportional distance ratio, transform circle S_2 centered at A to pass through B. - The intersection of the transformed circle with S_1 will provide point B. 6. **Verify and Conclude**: - Confirm B lies on S_1. - Construct segment BC such that D divides it per the given ratio. - The constructed triangle ABC meets all the conditions with given sides and the angle bisector.

Since g(x) is both a quadratic function and a power function, we infer that g(x) could be a function of the form ax^2 for some constant a, as it is the simplest form that satisfies both conditions (being quadratic and a power function). **Step 2:** Analyze the symmetry of m(x). Given that g(x) is a quadratic function, m(x) will be an odd function because the numerator x^3 is an odd function (its sign changes with x), and the denominator g(x)+1 remains even (its value does not change sign with x). This makes m(x) an odd function overall, as the division of an odd function by an even function remains odd. **Step 3:** Consider the function f(x)=m(x)+1. Since m(x) is odd, for any x, m(-x) = -m(x). This implies that f(x)+f(-x) = (m(x)+1) + (m(-x)+1) = m(x) + m(-x) + 2 = 2, because m(x) + m(-x) = 0 due to the odd nature of m(x). **Step 4:** Compute the sum. The sum can be simplified as follows: f(-2023)+f(-2022)+ldots +f(-1)+f(0)+f(1)+ldots+f(2022)+f(2023) This can be paired as (f(-2023)+f(2023)) + (f(-2022)+f(2022)) + ldots + (f(-1)+f(1)) + f(0).

Since ( F ) has characteristic not equal to 2, ( F ) is not a field of characteristic 2. 3. **Finite subgroup of a field**: If ( T ) is finite, then ( T ) is a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group ( F^* ). By a well-known result in group theory, any finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic. Therefore, ( T ) must be cyclic. 4. **Order of ( T )**: Let ( |T| = n ). Since ( T ) is cyclic, there exists an element ( g in T ) such that ( T = langle g rangle ), and the order of ( g ) is ( n ). 5. **Even order**: To show that ( n ) is even, consider the fact that ( F ) has characteristic not equal to 2. This implies that the equation ( x^2 = 1 ) has exactly two solutions in ( F ), namely ( x = 1 ) and ( x = -1 ). Since ( T ) is a subgroup of ( F^* ), it must contain both 1 and -1. 6. **Inclusion of -1**: The element -1 has order 2 in ( F^* ). Since ( T ) is finite and cyclic, the order of ( T ) must be a multiple of the order of any of its elements. Therefore, the order of ( T ) must be a multiple of 2, implying that ( n ) is even.

Additionally, we seek an answer for an ( n times n ) chessboard. Part (a) 1. First, consider an 8x8 chessboard. 2. A key observation is that on each vertical column, at most one queen can be placed without threatening another on the same column. 3. Similarly, on each horizontal row, at most one queen can be placed without threatening another on the same row. 4.

The cat catches up to the rat in 4 hours, so the cat covers the distance the rat has traveled plus the distance the rat covers in those 4 hours. The total distance the cat covers is the distance covered by the rat in 6 hours plus the distance covered by the rat in the next 4 hours (which is ( 4v ) km).

First, we need to convert the speeds from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per second (m/s) because the lengths of the trains are given in meters. Speed of the first train in m/s = 42 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 42 * 1000 / 3600 = 11.67 m/s Speed of the second train in m/s = 30 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 30 * 1000 / 3600 = 8.33 m/s Since the trains are moving towards each other, we need to find the relative speed at which they are approaching each other. Because the tracks intersect at a 45-degree angle, we cannot simply add their speeds. We need to use vector addition to find the resultant speed at which the distance between the trains is closing. The relative speed (Vr) can be found using the formula for the resultant velocity of two vectors at a 45-degree angle: Vr = √(V1^2 + V2^2 + 2 * V1 * V2 * cos(45°)) Where V1 is the speed of the first train, V2 is the speed of the second train, and cos(45°) is √2/2. Vr = √(11.67^2 + 8.33^2 + 2 * 11.67 * 8.33 * (√2/2)) Vr = √(136.3889 + 69.3889 + 194.0111) Vr = √(399.7889) Vr ≈ 19.99 m/s Now, we need to find the total length that needs to be cleared for the trains to be clear of each other. Since they are moving towards each other, we add the lengths of both trains: Total length to be cleared = Length of the first train + Length of the second train Total length to be cleared = 120 m + 280 m = 400 m Finally, we can find the time it takes for the trains to clear each other by dividing the total length by the relative speed: Time = Total length to be cleared / Relative speed Time = 400 m / 19.99 m/s ≈ 20.01 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{20.01} seconds for the two trains to be clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=(x2){e}^{x}frac{a}{2}({x}^{2}2x).<br/>(1) When a=e, find the maximum value of the function f(x) on the interval left[1,2right];<br/>(2) If f(x) has a local maximum point x_{0} and f(x_{0}) lt 0, find the range of values for a.","completion":"**(1)** Given f(x) = (x-2)e^x - frac{a}{2}(x^2 - 2x), when a = e, we have: f(x) = (x-2)e^x - frac{e}{2}(x^2 - 2x).

Since e^x is an increasing function, for 1 leq x leq 2, we have e^x geq e, implying f'(x) geq 0. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on [1,2]. The maximum value of f(x) on this interval is attained at x=2: f(2) = (2-2)e^2 - frac{e}{2}(2^2 - 2cdot2) = 0.

Our goal is to see under what conditions all digits can be the same ('0' or '1') after a number of steps. 3. **Consider (N neq 2^k)**: Suppose that (N) is not a power of 2. We shall prove that under any unfavorable conditions, Ali-Baba will never be able to open the cave because an adversarial move can always be made to prevent all digits from becoming uniform. 4. **Odd Case ((N) is odd)**: Let’s first handle the case where (N) is odd. Place zeros and ones randomly around the circle so that there is a mix of zeros and ones. - Assume that Ali-Baba switches certain (k) digits at every turn. - Ali-Baba wins only if all the selected (k) digits match either the set of all zeros or all ones. - Since the sum of these digits is odd, the number of zeros is not equal to the number of ones.

The cave, therefore, opens in this scenario if ( A_m ) succeeds. 3. If sums in the pairs have the same parity, use ( A_m ) for these units. If unsuccessful, all sums remain odd, and switching all digits to the other within the unit doesn't change parity. 4. Apply an operation ( D ) (changing (m) digits around) to toggle between operation types ensuring all sums are now even. Reapply ( A_m ) to open the cave if properly adjusted. - **Algorithm (B)** is defined for setting uniform same parity in pairs.

Part (a) - Internal Tangency 1. Let the spheres intersect the plane Pi in two circles C_1 and C_2. 2. Consider the planes that are tangent to these spheres. The internal tangency implies that these planes are tangent to both spheres but intersect the line segment connecting their centers on different sides. 3.

Suppose there exist another set ( A', B', C' ) fulfilling the conditions: [ f(x, y, z) = A'(x, y, z)(x-y) + B'(x, y, z)(y-z) + C'(x, y, z)(z-x) ] By setting these equal to the original expressions: [ A(x, y, z)(x-y) + B(x, y, z)(y-z) + C(x, y, z)(z-x) = A'(x, y, z)(x-y) + B'(x, y, z)(y-z) + C'(x, y, z)(z-x) ] And examining the distinction among terms, we see that: [ (A(x, y, z) - A'(x, y, z))(x-y) + (B(x, y, z) - B'(x, y, z))(y-z) + (C(x, y, z) - C'(x, y, z))(z-x) = 0 ] Since this holds true irrespective of the specific values for ( x, y, ) and ( z ), it implies that: [ A(x, y, z) = A'(x, y, z), quad B(x, y, z) = B'(x, y, z), quad C(x, y, z) = C'(x, y, z) ] Thus the polynomials are uniquely determined: [ boxed{text{yes, the decomposition of } f text{ into polynomials } A, B, C text{ is unique.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Find all functions ( f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) such that [ f(x y)=max {f(x+y), f(x) f(y)} ] for all ( x, y in mathbb{R} ).","completion":"1. **Identification of properties on negative real numbers:** Consider the function ( f ) on negative real numbers. For any ( x, y < 0 ), we can write the quadratic equation: [ X^2 - yX + x = 0. ] The discriminant of this equation is positive, indicating that it has two distinct real roots ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( ab = x ) and ( a + b = y ). Therefore, we have: [ f(x) = f(ab), ] and [ f(y) = f(a + b). ] Since ( f(x y) = max { f(x + y), f(x) f(y) } ), by substituting ( x=ab ) and ( y = a+b ), we get: [ f(x) geq f(y). ] 2. **Symmetric argument on negative real numbers:** By a similar reasoning, we can argue that: [ f(y) geq f(x). ] 3. **Constancy on negative real numbers:** Combining the two inequalities, it results that: [ f(x) = f(y). ] Therefore, ( f ) is constant for all negative real numbers. 4. **Consideration of ( f(0) ):** Consider now the functional values involving the number ( 0 ). If ( f(0) ) is strictly negative, it leads to a contradiction because ( f(0) max (f(z), f(0) f(z)) ) involves non-negative products and ( 0 ) is not negative for ( f(z) geq 0 ). Thus, ( f(0) ) cannot be negative. 5. **Case ( f(0) = 0 ):** If ( f(0) = 0 ), then: [ 0 = max (f(z), 0). ] This implies ( f(z) leq 0 ), and since ( f(z) geq 0 ) (from earlier argument), ( f ) is the zero function. Thus, ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x ). 6. **Case ( f(0) > 0 ):** Assuming ( f(0) > 0 ): [ f(0) = max (f(z), f(0) f(z)) = max (f(-z), f(0) f(-z)). ] Therefore, ( f(z) = f(-z) ), suggesting ( f ) must be symmetric around the origin and thus constant not only on ( mathbb{R}^{-} ), but on all of ( mathbb{R} ). 7. **Verification of the constant function:** Based on previous conclusions, we assert that for ( f(x) = c ) where ( c equiv f(0) ), ( f ) solves the functional equation. Hence, [ f(xy) = max {f(x+y), f(x)f(y)}. ] Since ( f ) is constant, ( f(xy) = c ), ( f(x+y) = c ), and ( f(x)f(y) = c^2 ), verifying ( c = 1 ). 8. **Conclusion:** ( f ) being constant with values satisfying ( 0 leq f(0) leq 1 ), we deduce ( f(x) = c ). Therefore, the only functions satisfying the equation are ( f(x) = 0 ) or any constant value ( c neq 0) in interval ( (0, 1] ).

Calculating, - 19! and frac{20!}{2 cdot {10!}^2} cdot {9!}^2 are subsets of 20!. - Thus, the successful configurations contribute some fraction p out of 20! total configurations. The fraction p simplifies to an expression related to the counts of acceptable cycles, and subsequently, convert this fraction to frac{m}{n} where m and n are relatively prime. Let's illustrate with the estimation: frac{1}{20}+frac{1}{180} = frac{9+1}{180} = frac{10}{180} = frac{1}{18}, Thus, m + n = 1 + 18 = boxed{19}."},{"prompt":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} satisfy |overrightarrow{a}|=1, |overrightarrow{b}|=sqrt{3}, and |overrightarrow{a}2overrightarrow{b}|=3, find overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}=left( right) A: 2 B: 1 C: 1 D: 2","completion":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} satisfy |overrightarrow{a}|=1, |overrightarrow{b}|=sqrt{3}, and |overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b}|=3, we are asked to find overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}.

Our goal is to compute ( R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ldots + R_{1,000,000} ). 1. **Define the sequences ( S_n ) and ( V_n )**: - ( S_n ) is the number of valid sequences that return a scalar. - ( V_n ) is the number of valid sequences that return a vector. - By convention, we define ( S_0 = 0 ), ( S_1 = 0 ), ( V_0 = 0 ), and ( V_1 = 1 ). 2. **Recurrence relations**: - The recurrence relations for ( S_n ) and ( V_n ) are given by: [ S_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^n V_k V_{n+1-k} + S_k S_{n+1-k} ] [ V_{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^n V_k V_{n+1-k} + 2S_k V_{n+1-k} ] 3. **Generating functions**: - Let ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) be the generating functions for ( S_n ) and ( V_n ) respectively: [ P(x) = sum_{k ge 0} S_k x^k ] [ Q(x) = sum_{k ge 0} V_k x^k ] - The generating functions satisfy the following equations: [ P(x) = Q(x)^2 + P(x)^2 ] [ Q(x) = x + Q(x)^2 + 2P(x)Q(x) ] 4. **Solving the generating functions**: - Solve for ( P(x) ) in terms of ( Q(x) ): [ P(x) = frac{1}{2} - frac{x}{2Q(x)} - frac{Q(x)}{2} ] - Substitute this into the first equation to obtain a quadratic equation in ( Q(x)^2 ): [ Q(x)^2 equiv -x + xC(x) pmod{4} ] where ( C(x) ) is the Catalan function: [ C(x) = frac{1 - sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2x} ] 5. **Simplifying the generating function**: - Add the two equations and solve the quadratic to find the generating function ( T(x) = P(x) + Q(x) ): [ T(x) = x C(x C(x)) pmod{4} ] 6. **Catalan numbers modulo 4**: - The recurrence for Catalan numbers is: [ C_k = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} C_i C_{k-1-i} ] - We can prove inductively that: [ C_{k-1} equiv 1 pmod{4}, text{ if } k = 2^n ] [ C_{k-1} equiv 2 pmod{4}, text{ if } k = 2^n + 2^m, m neq n ] [ C_{k-1} equiv 0 pmod{4}, text{ otherwise} ] 7. **Summing the remainders**: - After more computations, we find: [ R(x) equiv 2 - (n-1)^2 pmod{4}, text{ if } k = 2^n ] [ R(x) equiv 2(m+1)(n+1) - 2 pmod{4}, text{ if } k = 2^n + 2^m, m neq n ] [ R(x) equiv 0 pmod{4}, text{ otherwise} ] - By casework on whether ( k = 2^m ) or ( k = 2^m + 2^n ) in the sum of ( R_k ) with ( k = 1, 2, dots, 1,000,000 ), we find the answer is: [ 290 + 30 = 320 ] The final answer is (boxed{320})"},{"prompt":"a sequence of numbers from 1 to 2019, which digit appears more frequently: 1s or 2s, and by how many?","completion":"To determine which digit appears more frequently between 1 and 2019, we break the problem into parts: 1. **Count occurrences of 1 and 2 from 1 to 999:** - For any digit, from 0 to 9, the number of appearances in each decimal position (units, tens, hundreds) is equal for numbers of the same length. - Considering only numbers from 000 to 999 (1000 numbers), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 100 times in each decimal place. - Therefore, the digit 1 appears: [ 100 text{ (units place)} + 100 text{ (tens place)} + 100 text{ (hundreds place)} = 300 text{ times} ] - The digit 2 also appears: [ 100 text{ (units place)} + 100 text{ (tens place)} + 100 text{ (hundreds place)} = 300 text{ times} ] 2. **Count occurrences of 1 and 2 from 1000 to 1999:** - Every number from 1000 to 1999 begins with 1, giving 1000 occurrences of the digit 1 in the thousand's place. - For the last three digits (001 to 999), the distribution of digits is the same as the 000 to 999 case: - The digit 1 appears: [ 100 text{ (units place)} + 100 text{ (tens place)} + 100 text{ (hundreds place)} = 300 text{ times} ] - Therefore, from 1000 to 1999, the digit 1 appears: [ 1000 + 300 = 1300 text{ times} ] - The digit 2 appears in the last three digits similarly to the previous case: [ 100 + 100 + 100 = 300 text{ times} ] 3. **Count occurrences of 1 and 2 from 2000 to 2009:** - The digit 2 appears 10 times in the thousand's place. - The digit 2 does not appear in the hundreds and tens places. - The digit 2 appears 1 time in the units place in 2002. - Therefore, the digit 2 appears: [ 10 text{ (thousand's place)} + 1 text{ (units place)} = 11 text{ times} ] - The digit 1 appears only once in the number 2001. 4. **Count occurrences of 1 and 2 from 2010 to 2019:** - The digit 1 appears: [ 10 text{ (units place, appearing in 2011, 2012, ..., 2019)} ] - The digit 2 appears once in each number as the thousand's place: [ 10 text{ (units place)} ] Summarizing the counts: - **Count for the digit 1:** [ 300 text{ (from 1 to 999)} + 1300 text{ (from 1000 to 1999)} + 1 text{ (in 2001)} + 10 text{ (from 2010 to 2019)} = 1611 text{ times} ] - **Count for the digit 2:** [ 300 text{ (from 1 to 999)} + 300 text{ (from 1000 to 1999)} + 11 text{ (from 2000 to 2009)} + 1 text{ (from 2010 to 2019)} = 612 text{ times} ] Therefore, there are: [ 1611 - 612 = 999 ] more occurrences of the digit 1 than the digit 2. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{There are 999 more occurrences of the digit 1 than the digit 2.}} ]"},{"prompt":"A quadrilateral has ____ straight sides and ____ angles.

To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s Speed of the first train in m/s = 71 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 71 * 1000 / 3600 = 19.7222 m/s (approximately) Speed of the second train in m/s = 89 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 89 * 1000 / 3600 = 24.7222 m/s (approximately) Since the trains are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Relative speed = 19.7222 m/s + 24.7222 m/s = 44.4444 m/s (approximately) The total distance to be covered for the trains to meet is the sum of the lengths of the trains plus the distance between them. Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train + Distance apart Total distance = 90 m + 100 m + 200 m = 390 m Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the trains to meet using the formula: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 390 m / 44.4444 m/s ≈ 8.7755 seconds So, the trains will meet approximately boxed{8.7755} seconds after they start moving towards each other."},{"prompt":"a certain city, there were 10,000 fuelpowered buses in 2003.

(2) By the end of which year will the number of electric buses exceed onethird of the total number of buses in the city?","completion":"(1) The number of electric buses introduced each year forms a geometric sequence {a_n}, where a_1 = 128 and the common ratio q = 1.5. To find the number of electric buses introduced in 2010, we calculate the term a_7, since 2010 is the 7th year after 2003: a_7 = a_1 cdot q^6 = 128 times 1.5^6. By calculation, we get: a_7 = 128 times (frac{3}{2})^6 = 128 times frac{729}{64} = 1458. Therefore, the city should introduce boxed{1458} electric buses in 2010. (2) Let S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n be the sum of the first n terms of the sequence, which represents the total number of electric buses introduced by the end of the nth year. According to the problem, we require: frac{S_n}{10000 + S_n} > frac{1}{3}. Multiplying both sides by (10000 + S_n) and simplifying gives: S_n > frac{10000}{2} = 5000. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we have: S_n = a_1 cdot frac{1-q^n}{1-q}. Substituting the given values and solving for S_n > 5000 gives us: 128 cdot frac{1 - 1.5^n}{1 - 1.5} > 5000. Multiplying both sides by (1 - 1.5) which is negative, we invert the inequality: -128(1 - 1.5^n) < -5000, 128 cdot 1.5^n > 5128. Dividing both sides by 128 gives us: 1.5^n > frac{5128}{128} = frac{657}{32}. Taking logarithms on both sides, we can estimate the value of n: begin{align*} log(1.5^n) &> logleft(frac{657}{32}right), n cdot log(1.5) &> logleft(frac{657}{32}right), n &> frac{logleft(frac{657}{32}right)}{log(1.5)}. end{align*} This yields approximately n approx 7.5, so n must be at least 8, because n must be a whole number.

This gives us two inequalities: - k-4 > 0 which simplifies to k > 4. - 10-k > 0 which simplifies to k < 10. 2. For the foci to be on the x-axis, the distance along the x-axis (major axis) must be greater than the distance along the y-axis (minor axis). This means the denominator associated with x^2 must be larger than the denominator associated with y^2. Therefore, we have: - k-4 > 10-k.

Rita bought: - 5 dresses at ( D ) dollars each, so the total cost for dresses is ( 5D ). - 3 pairs of pants at 12 each, so the total cost for pants is ( 3 times 12 = 36 ). - 4 jackets at 30 each, so the total cost for jackets is ( 4 times 30 = 120 ).

We will use a scaled-down version of the problem to simplify our calculations and then scale up the results. 1. **Scaling Down the Problem:** The line segment from ((0,0)) to ((1001,429)) can be scaled down by dividing both coordinates by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 1001 and 429 is 1, so the scaled-down line segment is from ((0,0)) to ((1001,429)). 2. **Simplifying the Problem:** We can simplify the problem by considering the line segment from ((0,0)) to ((7,3)). This is because the line segment from ((0,0)) to ((1001,429)) is essentially 143 times the line segment from ((0,0)) to ((7,3)) (since (1001 = 7 times 143) and (429 = 3 times 143)). 3. **Equation of the Line:** The equation of the line segment from ((0,0)) to ((7,3)) is: [ y = frac{3}{7}x ] 4. **Determining Close Points:** A point ((x,y)) is considered close to the line if the circle or square centered at ((x,y)) intersects the line.

The distance to Atlanta is 440 miles, which is already a multiple of 40 (440 ÷ 40 = 11). Therefore, the distance to Boston must also be a multiple of 40.

Let's denote the number of days to reach Boston as \\"d\\" and the distance to Boston as \\"D\\". Since they can bike up to 40 miles a day, the distance to Boston can be expressed as D = 40d. Since the distance to Atlanta is 440 miles, and they can bike up to 40 miles a day, it will take them 440 ÷ 40 = 11 days to reach Atlanta.

Let's denote the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle as ( c ) and one of the acute angles as ( alpha ). 2. For a right-angled triangle, the perimeter is ( a + b + c = 8 ). Given the relationships from trigonometry, we have ( a = c sin(alpha) ) and ( b = c cos(alpha) ). 3. Therefore, the perimeter can be written as: [ c + c sin(alpha) + c cos(alpha) = 8 ] 4. Simplifying the above equation, we get: [ c (1 + sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)) = 8 ] [ c = frac{8}{1 + sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)} ] 5. Using the trigonometric identity: [ sin(alpha) + sin(90^circ - alpha) = sin(alpha) + cos(alpha) ] 6. Therefore: [ c = frac{8}{1 + sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)} ] 7. Applying the sum-to-product identities, we use: [ sin(A) + sin(B) = 2 sinleft(frac{A + B}{2}right) cosleft(frac{A - B}{2}right) ] 8. Plugging in ( A = alpha ) and ( B = 90^circ - alpha ), we get: [ sin(alpha) + cos(alpha) = 2 sinleft(frac{alpha + (90^circ - alpha)}{2}right) cosleft(frac{alpha - (90^circ - alpha)}{2}right) = 2 sin(45^circ) cosleft(alpha - 45^circright) ] 9. Thus we can rewrite: [ c = frac{8}{1 + 2 cdot frac{1}{sqrt{2}} cdot cos(alpha - 45^circ)} = frac{8}{1 + sqrt{2} cdot cos(alpha - 45^circ)} ] 10. The value is minimized when ( cos(alpha - 45^circ) = 1 ), which occurs when ( alpha = 45^circ ). **Conclusion**: Therefore, the triangle with the smallest hypotenuse is an isosceles right-angled triangle with ( alpha = 45^circ ). (boxed{c = 4 sqrt{2}}) 2. *Second Approach*: 1. Let the hypotenuse be ( c ) and one leg be ( a ), so the other leg is ( 8 - a - c ). By the Pythagorean theorem: [ c^2 = a^2 + (8 - a - c)^2 ] 2. Expanding and simplifying: [ c^2 = a^2 + (64 - 16a + a^2 - 16c + 2ac + c^2) ] [ c^2 = a^2 + 64 - 16a + a^2 - 16c + 2ac + c^2 ] [ 0 = 64 - 16a - 16c + 2ac ] Dividing everything by 2: [ 0 = 32 - 8a - 8c + ac ] Rearranging: [ 8c - ac = 32 - 8a ] [ c = frac{32 - 8a}{8 - a} ] 3. Adding fraction terms: [ c = frac{(8 - a)^2 + 32 - 8a}{8 - a} ] [ c = 8 - a + frac{32}{8 - a} ] 4.

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of rational products in the multiplication table formed by the numbers written in each row and column. 3. Let us denote: - ( x ) as the number of irrational numbers written on the left side of the table. - ( 50 - x ) as the number of rational numbers written on the left side of the table. 4. Based on this, the remaining numbers written on the top of the table will be: - ( 50 - x ) irrational numbers. - ( x ) rational numbers. 5. When we form the multiplication products in the cells of the table, the product of a rational and an irrational number is always irrational. Therefore, to maximize rational products in the table, we need combinations of rational numbers from both the row and the column indices. 6. Let's analyze the formation of the table. Each cell ((i, j)) will contain the product of the number written in the (i)-th row and the (j)-th column. The products will be rational only if both of these numbers are rational. 7. The number of rational products can be calculated by the formula: [ text{Number of rational products} = text{(# of rational numbers on LHS)} times text{(# of rational numbers on top)} ] Given our notation and constraints: [ text{Number of rational products} = x times (50 - x) ] 8.

To find the maximum value, we can complete the square or use the vertex formula of a parabola, (x = -frac{b}{2a}), where the quadratic function is ( ax^2 + bx + c ). Here, (a = -1) and (b = 50). Thus, [ x = frac{50}{2 times 1} = 25. ] 10. Substituting ( x = 25 ) into our function, [ f(25) = 25 times (50 - 25) = 25 times 25 = 625. ] 11.

Therefore, the functional relationship between the total cost y yuan of the pool and the width x meters of the pool bottom is given by: [y = 320(x + frac{4}{x}) + 480] # Part 2: Minimizing the Total Cost From the derived equation y = 320(x + frac{4}{x}) + 480, we want to find the minimum value. By the AM-GM inequality, for positive x, [x + frac{4}{x} geq 2sqrt{x cdot frac{4}{x}} = 2sqrt{4} = 4] Thus, [320(x + frac{4}{x}) geq 320 times 4 = 1280] Adding the constant cost of the pool bottom, we have: [y geq 1280 + 480 = 1760] The equality holds (meaning the cost is minimized) when x = frac{4}{x}, which implies x^2 = 4 and hence x = 2 meters. Therefore, when the width of the pool bottom is boxed{2 text{ meters}}, the total cost of the pool can be minimized.

According to the problem, Petya's incorrect sum is ( 44444 ) instead of the correct sum ( 12345 ). 4. We can write the following system of equations based on the information given: [ begin{cases} x + y = 12345 (10x + c) + y = 44444 end{cases} ] 5.

Given that ( c ) is a digit (i.e., ( c ) is an integer from 0 to 9), ( 32099 - c ) must be divisible by 9. We need to check for which value of ( c ), ( 32099 - c ) is divisible by 9. 8.

Now, when the tiger runs above the fallen tree trunk, we need to consider the length of the tree trunk (20 meters) plus the length of the tiger (5 meters).

With angle A M C being supplementary to the sum of angle C M D and angle M D C, we can express angle C M D as: [ angle C M D = 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2} ] This follows from the angle bisector's properties in a triangle, which evenly divides the opposite angle. 4. In the parallelogram ABCD, we also note that angle M D A = 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2} because of the symmetry and properties of parallelograms in dividing angles. 5. Now, consider angle M D C as the difference between angle C D A and angle M D A: [ angle M D C = angle C D A - angle M D A ] Here, angle C D A = 180^circ - 2alpha because it consists of the entire supplementary angle split evenly in the parallelogram. 6.

Solve the second system (Case 2): [ begin{cases} a + b = -1 a - b = -1 end{cases} ] - Add the two equations: [ (a + b) + (a - b) = -1 + (-1) ] This simplifies to: [ 2a = -2 implies a = -1 ] - Substitute (a = -1) into (a + b = -1): [ -1 + b = -1 implies b = 0 ] Therefore, we have another trivial solution (a = -1) and (b = 0). 8. To conclude, both cases lead to the trivial solutions where one of the values is zero, which means we do not have two distinct integers whose squares differ by exactly one. Thus, there do not exist two consecutive perfect squares for integer values. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A grocery shop has sales for 5 consecutive months and needs a sale of Rs. 4991 in the sixth month to get an average sale of Rs. 6500.

Total sales required for six months = Average sale per month × Number of months Total sales required for six months = Rs. 6500 × 6 Total sales required for six months = Rs. 39000 Now, we know the sales for four of the months and the required sale for the sixth month.

The distance from any vertex to the centroid is one-third the sum of the distances along the medians from the vertex to the midpoint of opposite side and back to vertex through G. 2. **Expressing s_1 in terms of side lengths:** - The lengths of the medians can be expressed in terms of side lengths, and for the centroid, these medians are divided in a 2:1 ratio. Therefore, for each median, GA = frac{1}{3}(text{median to } A). - The sum of medians is proportional to the sum of side lengths, where each median contributes two-thirds of its respective side length to the perimeter sum: [ s_1 = frac{1}{3}(m_a + m_b + m_c), ] where m_a, m_b, m_c are lengths of medians. 3. **Comparing s1 and s2:** - Using known relations for median lengths in terms of side lengths, [ m_a = frac{1}{2}sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2} ] (and similarly for m_b and m_c). - Hence, the sum m_a + m_b + m_c translates to a complicated function of a, b, c, but generally, each median is less than the sum of its corresponding sides due to its proportional component in the formula, thereby s_1 = frac{1}{3}(m_a + m_b + m_c) is considerably less than s_2. s_2 > 3s_1 Conclusion: In case of centroid placement, s_1 relates to s_2 as s_2>3s_1.

By the **pigeonhole principle** and the property of polynomials over infinite fields, we know that a non-constant polynomial (P) has infinitely many values. This follows from the **fact that a non-constant polynomial maps an infinite field to an infinite set** under substitution. Now, assuming ( Q_{1}(P) = Q_{2}(P) ), we have: [ Q_{1}(P(x)) = Q_{2}(P(x)) quad forall x in mathbb{K} ] Suppose ( Q_{1} neq Q_{2} ).

Therefore, ( Q_{1} = Q_{2} ) must hold. 2. **Case of (mathbb{K}) Arbitrary (Finite or Infinite):** Consider that ( P ) is a non-constant polynomial. The key is to use the **degree and leading coefficients** of ( Q_{1} ) and ( Q_{2} ). Write the polynomials ( Q_{1} ) and ( Q_{2} ) as follows: [ Q_{1}(X) = a_{n}X^{n} + a_{n-1}X^{n-1} + cdots + a_{0} ] [ Q_{2}(X) = b_{m}X^{m} + b_{m-1}X^{m-1} + cdots + b_{0} ] Since ( P ) is non-constant, the composition ( Q_{1}(P) ) and ( Q_{2}(P) ) will also have their degrees depend on ( P ). Assume ( Q_{1}(P) = Q_{2}(P) ). Then the degrees of both sides must match: [ n cdot deg(P) = m cdot deg(P) ] Since ( P ) is non-constant, ( deg(P) neq 0 ), hence: [ n = m ] Now, consider the leading coefficients of both sides: [ a_{n}( text{leading coefficient of } P)^{n} = b_{n}( text{leading coefficient of } P)^{n} ] Again, ( (text{leading coefficient of } P) neq 0 ), so: [ a_{n} = b_{n} ] 3. **Proceed by Induction on Degree:** By repeating the argument for the next leading terms (coefficients) by induction, we have: [ a_{i} = b_{i} quad text{for all } i ] Thus, we conclude: [ Q_{1} = Q_{2} ] # Conclusion: The equality ( Q_{1}(P) = Q_{2}(P) ) implies ( Q_{1} = Q_{2} ).

Therefore, both (x) and (y) must be multiples of 7. 5. **Counting Multiples of 7**: Within the range from 1 to 1000, we count the multiples of 7.

The base angles of an isosceles triangle at the points of tangency are equal. - The central angle between the tangents (through the external point and the circle's center) forms a straight line of (180^{circ}) with the given angle ((70^{circ})), at the external point. 3. **Calculate the Central Angle**: - The central angle (between the points of tangency) is obtained by subtracting the given angle from (180^{circ}): [ theta = 180^{circ} - 70^{circ} = 110^{circ}. ] - This (110^{circ}) angle is the smaller angle between the arcs formed by the tangency points on the circle. 4. **Calculate the Other Arch’s Angle**: - The circle's total circumference is (360^{circ}). - Hence, the other arc that spans the rest of the circumference would be: [ 360^{circ} - 110^{circ} = 250^{circ}. ] # Conclusion: The measure of the smaller arc is (110^{circ}) and the measure of the larger arc is (250^{circ}).

Consider the given problem: two circles ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) without any common point, and point ( P ) outside these circles. We need to construct lines passing through ( P ) such that they intersect both circles and the chords have equal lengths, while forming a given angle ( alpha ). 2. Take two lines ( e ) and ( f ) passing through point ( P ) that intersect circles ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) respectively. Assume that the chords ( A_1B_1 ) from ( k_1 ) and ( A_2B_2 ) from ( k_2 ) have equal lengths. 3. Rotate circle ( k_2 ) along with line ( f ) around point ( P ) by angle ( alpha ), so that line ( f ) aligns with line ( e ). Let the resulting circle be ( k_2' ) and the points ( A_2 ) and ( B_2 ) after rotation be ( A_2' ) and ( B_2' ), respectively. 4. The problem is now reduced to a simpler one: For two given circles and a point outside them, construct a line passing through the point such that it intersects both circles and the chords have equal lengths. 5. The number of solutions to this simpler problem determines the number of solutions to the original problem. 6. If the visibility regions from point ( P ) towards circles ( k_1 ) and ( k_2' ) have a common part but do not entirely overlap, then rotating the secant continuously, the chord in one circle will lengthen while the chord in the other shortens, resulting in at least one point where the chords are equal. 7. In some cases, more complexities like ( k_2' ) intersecting ( k_1 ) arise, leading to solutions only if the common chord intersects through ( P ). 8. For cases where radii ( r_1 = r_2 ), if ( k_2 ) (or its rotated image) overlaps with ( k_1 ), analogous conditions and corrections determine unique solutions. 9. To resolve the problem geometrically: - Translate ( k_2' ) by vector ( overrightarrow{A_2' A_1} ) to produce ( k_2'' ). - This translation ensures chord lengths ( A_1B_1 ) and ( A_2'B_2' ) secure equality by their endpoints aligning. 10. Denote the centers of ( k_1 ), ( k_2' ), and ( k_2'' ) as ( O_1 ), ( O_2' ), and ( O_2'' ). 11. Follow the theorem: ( e ) is common to circles if perpendiculars from the centers intersect at the shared chords. 12. Extend this logic to find the required distances and apply the Thales' circle theorem confirming geometric correctness. 13. Compute tangent segments ( d ) from ( P ) to each translated circle. Using: [ PO_2''^2 = d^2 + r_2^2 quad text{and} quad PO_1^2 = d^2 + r_1^2 ] [ text{implies} quad PO_2'' = sqrt{PO_1^2 - r_1^2 + r_2^2} ] 14. Construct the extended radius circle centered at ( P ) with radius ( sqrt{PO_1^2 - r_1^2 + r_2^2} ). 15. Using the intersection properties of Thales' circles and this distance, deduce the possible intersection points to derive ( O_2'' ). 16. Finally, obtain solutions for lines intersecting at these computed centers, thus satisfying the conditions for equal chord lengths. 17. Realize the definitive solutions ( e ) and ( f ) by rotating back under original constraints. Each angle and geometric position maintains the problem's requirements. Conclusively, the number of valid solutions (0, 1, or 2) on geometric intersections and circle properties combined with angle precisions deliver the desired outcome.

By squaring and noting the properties of cube roots of unity, we confirm: varrho_1^2 = varrho_2, quad varrho_2^2 = varrho_1, quad varrho_1 + varrho_2 + varrho_3 = 0.

To maximize the difference between x and y, we want to choose the smallest possible value for x and the largest possible value for y within the given constraints. Since x must be greater than 7 but less than 9, the smallest integer value x can take is 8 (since x must be greater than 7 and we're looking for the greatest integer difference). Now, to find the largest possible value for y, we consider the difference between y and x. We want this difference to be 7, which is the greatest possible positive integer difference. So, if x is 8, then y would be 8 + 7 = 15. Since y must be less than z, the smallest integer value z can take is 16 (the next integer greater than 15).

We need to show that for any admissible set of N points on the coordinate plane, where N geq 3, there exists a polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree at most ( k = N - 2 ) that separates the points such that either above the graph of ( P(x) ) there are no red points and below it, there are no blue points or vice versa. 2. Let's consider any N-1 points from the given N points. There exists a polynomial of degree at most N-2, denoted as ( Q(x) ), whose graph passes through the N-1 points. This is possible due to the **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**. Specifically, we can find such a polynomial because an N-1 point polynomial interpolation problem has a unique solution given the N-1 distinct abscissas. 3. The polynomial ( Q(x) ) would obviously separate the set into two regions fulfilling the separation conditions mentioned, i.e., either no red points above and no blue points below its graph or vice versa. This shows that ( k = N - 2 ) is sufficient. 4. Now, we need to prove that it's not possible to separate any admissible set of N points with a polynomial of degree less than ( N-2 ). For this, let's assume on the contrary that there exists a separating polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree at most ( k = N - 3 ) that separates an admissible set of N points. 5. Consider a polynomial ( f(x) ) of degree ( N-2 ). To generate a counterexample, place N points on the graph of ( f(x) ), alternating their colors between red and blue. Let's assume ( P(r) leq f(r) ) for a red point and ( P(b) geq f(b) ) for a blue point. 6. Let's define ( Q(x) = f(x) - P(x) ). The degree of ( Q(x) ) is ( N-2 ). 7. Given the assumptions: - For any red point abscissa ( r ), ( Q(r) geq 0 ). - For any blue point abscissa ( b ), ( Q(b) leq 0 ). 8. Notice that since ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( N-2 ), ( Q(x) ) changes its sign at each point ( r ) and ( b ), indicating that ( Q(x) ) must have at least ( N-1 ) sign changes. 9. Further, by the **Intermediate Value Theorem**, there must be a point between each pair of adjacent red and blue points where ( Q(x) ) only crosses the x-axis if ( Q'(x) neq 0 ). But ( Q'(x) ) will have degree ( N-3 ). 10. Given the ( N-1 ) sign changes in ( Q(x) ), there should also be ( N-2 ) roots for ( Q'(x) ) due to the sign-changing behavior between adjacent ( r ) and ( b ). This implies ( Q'(x) ) has at least ( N-2 ) roots, which is a contradiction since ( Q'(x) ) being of degree ( N-3 ) can have at most ( N-3 ) roots. 11.

Since f(x) is even, it is symmetric about the y-axis, meaning f(x) also attains its minimum value of -1 for x < 0.

Let one quarter of the square also be filled which contributes approximately frac{s^2}{4} tiles, adjusted for overlap. - Hence, 2s - 1 + frac{s^2}{4} - text{overlap tiles} = 225. - Assuming minimal overlap (ideally around s/2 due to one quarter and diagonal overlap), roughly estimate and simplify equation to solve for s. - Assume frac{s^2}{4} - frac{s}{2} approx 225 - 2s + 1, - frac{s^2}{4} - frac{2s-1}{2} approx 225, - s^2 - 4s + 4 approx 900, - s^2 - 4s - 896 = 0. - Solve using quadratic formula: [ s = frac{-(-4) pm sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-896)}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 + 3584}}{2} = frac{4 pm 60}{2}. ] - s = 32 text{ or } -28 but s must be positive so s = 32. 4. **Calculate total number of tiles**: - Total number of tiles equals s^2 = 32^2 = 1024. 5. **Conclusion**: - Total number of tiles on the floor is 1024.

So we can write: R' = R * 0.9999999999999858 Substituting the expressions for R and R' we get: T' * C' = T * C * 0.9999999999999858 Now, we substitute C' with C * 1.1: T' * (C * 1.1) = T * C * 0.9999999999999858 Divide both sides by C to eliminate it: T' * 1.1 = T * 0.9999999999999858 Now, divide both sides by 1.1 to solve for T': T' = (T * 0.9999999999999858) / 1.1 To find the percentage by which the tax was diminished, we need to find the ratio of the decrease in tax to the original tax and then multiply by 100: Percentage decrease = ((T - T') / T) * 100 Substitute T' with the expression we found: Percentage decrease = ((T - (T * 0.9999999999999858) / 1.1) / T) * 100 Simplify the expression: Percentage decrease = ((T - T * 0.9999999999999858 / 1.1) / T) * 100 Percentage decrease = ((1 - 0.9999999999999858 / 1.1) * 100 Percentage decrease = ((1 - 0.9090909090908978) * 100 Percentage decrease = (0.0909090909091022 * 100 Percentage decrease = 9.09090909091022 So, the tax was diminished by approximately boxed{9.09%} ."},{"prompt":"John buys four items priced at textdollar 2.47, textdollar 6.25, textdollar 8.76, and textdollar 1.49.

We need to determine the day of the week for the 18th of that month. 2. Since three Fridays fall on even dates in the same month, it implies that these dates are distributed in such a way that they include three Fridays within one month under the constraint of even dates. 3. In a typical month, there are a sequence of dates from 1 to 28 or from 1 to 30 or 31. We need to understand the distribution of Fridays on the even dates within this month. 4. If there are three Fridays on even dates, those dates must be distinct, and hence they must occur over a span such that at least three even-numbered dates are Fridays. 5. Analyzing the given even-numbered dates in the month: - Consider the sequence of Fridays that could potentially be on even dates: 2, 16, and 30. - These dates have to be evenly spaced by weeks (7 days apart) considering that a Friday recurs every 7 days. 6. For the first Friday to be on an even date, let's assume the first even Friday: - If the first Friday was on the 2nd of the month, the next Fridays hence would be on 2 + 7 days = 9 -> (which is not even), next 2 + 14 = 16 (even), next 2 + 21 = 23 -> (which is not even) and next 2 + 28 = 30 (even). 7. Given the assumption that the three Fridays are on the 2nd, 16th, and 30th of the month: - This satisfies the condition of having three Fridays on even dates: 2, 16, 30. 8. Now to find the day of the week for the 18th: - Since 2 is Friday -> next one's (9th) Saturday -> then (16th) Friday -> then (23rd) Friday -> then (30th) Friday. 9. Calculating Day of the week for the 18th: - 2nd (Friday) + 7 days = 9 (Saturday) + 7 days = 16 (Friday) - From (16th) Friday to the 18th is the 3rd day; so the 17th would be Saturday, then 18th would be a Sunday. **Conclusion:** 18th is a Sunday.

Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope. The slope of a line given in the form ( Ax+By=C ) is ( -frac{A}{B} ). For the line ( x+y=1 ), the slope can be determined by rewriting it in the form ( x + y - 1 = 0 ), which is comparable to ( Ax + By = C ) with ( A=1 ) and ( B=1 ). Therefore, its slope is ( -frac{1}{1} = -1 ). For the line ( ax+2y=0 ), the slope is ( -frac{a}{2} ). So for the two lines to be parallel, we need ( -frac{a}{2} = -1 ).

The change in the y-coordinate is calculated as follows: -3 - 2 = -5 This means point A is translated 5 units downwards. Now, applying the same translation to point B whose original coordinates are (7,5), we get the new coordinates by subtracting 7 from the x-coordinate and 5 from the y-coordinate: x_{B_{new}} = 7 - 7 = 0 y_{B_{new}} = 5 - 5 = 0 Therefore, the new coordinates of point B after the translation are (0,0).

Similarly, for ( L_2 ): [ T(mathbf{r}_2(t)) = T(mathbf{a}_2 + tmathbf{d}) = A(mathbf{a}_2 + tmathbf{d}) + mathbf{b} = Amathbf{a}_2 + tAmathbf{d} + mathbf{b} ] Hence, the image of ( L_2 ) under ( T ) is a line parameterized by ( mathbf{r}_2'(t) = (Amathbf{a}_2 + mathbf{b}) + t(Amathbf{d}) ). 5. **Parallelism in Images**: Observe that the direction vector of the image lines is ( Amathbf{d} ), which is the same for both ( T(L_1) ) and ( T(L_2) ).

Then the slope of this tangent line is k_2 = e^{x_1}. Assuming that it's also of the form y = k_2 x, we have k_2 = frac{e^{x_1}}{x_1}. To find x_1, set x_1 = 1, which gives k_2 = e.

Also, P - Q = gleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) - frac{g(a) - g(b)}{a - b} = e^{frac{a+b}{2}} - frac{e^a - e^b}{a-b} = frac{(a - b)e^{frac{a+b}{2}} - e^a + e^b}{a - b}. Define varphi(x) = 2x - e^x + e^{-x}, with its derivative varphi'(x) = 2 - e^x - e^{-x} < 0. Thus, varphi(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty). Therefore, varphi(x) < varphi(0) = 0. With x = frac{a-b}{2}, we obtain a - b - e^{frac{a-b}{2}} + e^{frac{b-a}{2}} < 0, which implies P < Q. Finally, frac{e^a + e^b}{2} > frac{e^a - e^b}{a - b} can be reformulated as frac{a-b}{2} > frac{e^{a-b} - 1}{e^{a-b} + 1} = 1 - frac{2}{e^{a-b} + 1}. Define another function t(x) = frac{x}{2} - 1 + frac{2}{e^{x} + 1}. Its derivative is t'(x) = frac{1}{2} - frac{2e^x}{(e^x + 1)^2} = frac{(e^x - 1)^2}{2(e^x + 1)^2} ge 0, which means t(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). Thus, t(x) > t(0) = 0. With x = a - b, we find frac{a-b}{2} - 1 + frac{2}{e^{a-b} + 1} > 0, which implies R > Q.

Each 7 can be part of a number formed by concatenating 7's. For example, ( 777 ) is formed by concatenating three 7's. We need to find combinations of such numbers that sum to 7000. 3. **Formulating the Equation:** Let ( a ) be the number of single 7's, ( b ) be the number of 77's, and ( c ) be the number of 777's. Then we have: [ 7a + 77b + 777c = 7000 ] We also need to count the total number of 7's used: [ a + 2b + 3c = n ] 4. **Simplifying the Equation:** Divide the first equation by 7: [ a + 11b + 111c = 1000 ] 5. **Finding the Range of ( n ):** - The minimum value of ( n ) occurs when we use the maximum number of 777's. [ 777 times 9 + 1 = 7000 implies c = 9, b = 0, a = 1 implies n = 1 + 3 times 9 = 28 ] - The maximum value of ( n ) occurs when we use only single 7's.

First, denote the k line segments as left[a_i, b_iright] for i = 1, 2, ldots, k, with the property that if i < j, then b_i < a_j. This means that the segments are ordered such that they do not overlap. 2. Define d_i = b_i - a_i, where d_i is the length of the segment left[a_i, b_iright]. 3. The goal is to show that the sum of the lengths of these k line segments is at least frac{1}{k}, i.e., sum_{i=1}^{k} d_i geq frac{1}{k}. 4. Now, construct the sets M_{ij} for 1 leq i < j leq k and M_{ii} for each i = 1, 2, ldots, k as follows: M_{ij} = left[a_j - b_i, b_j - a_iright], quad M_{ii} = left[0, d_iright]. 5. Clearly, each M_{ii} represents the interval from 0 to d_i, hence the length of M_{ii} is d_i. Similarly, M_{ij} represents the interval from a_j - b_i to b_j - a_i, and the length of M_{ij} is d_i + d_j. 6. Since any segment of length l leq 1 can be placed on the line such that its endpoints are within M, if the segment endpoints both lie within the same interval left[a_i, b_iright], then l in M_{ii}. If the endpoints lie in two different intervals left[a_i, b_iright] and left[a_j, b_jright] with i < j, then l in M_{ij}. 7.

To do this, we will find a square that is less than or equal to 2018, with the next odd square being greater than 2018. We can approximate the square root of 2018 to determine our k value: sqrt{2018} approx 44.9 So, we approximate k to be 23 since (2 times 23 - 1)^2 = 45^2 is the nearest odd square larger than 2018 and (2 times 22 - 1)^2 = 43^2 is the largest odd square less than 2018.

Consider a triangle (ABC) with sides (a = BC), (b = AC), and (c = AB). Let (A_1) and (B_1) be the midpoints of sides (BC) and (AC), respectively. 2. The medians (AA_1) and (BB_1) intersect at point (M), which is the centroid of the triangle (ABC). 3. Recall that the centroid (M) of a triangle divides each median in the ratio of 2:1. Therefore, (AM = frac{2}{3}AA_1) and (BM = frac{2}{3}BB_1). 4. For these medians to be perpendicular, the angle (angle AMB) must be a right angle: (angle AMB = 90^circ). 5. According to the theorem on medians, (angle AMB = 90^circ) if and only if (AM^2 + BM^2 = AB^2).

This implies that the segments divide the sides of ( triangle ABC ) into pairs of equal lengths. 2. **Analyze Isosceles Triangles:** - Since ( BC_1 = C_1A_1 ), triangle ( BC_1A_1 ) is isosceles, and by the property of isosceles triangles, we have ( angle BC_1A_1 = angle C_1A_1B ). - Similarly, since ( A_1B_1 = B_1C ), triangle ( A_1B_1C ) is isosceles and ( angle B_1A_1C = angle A_1C_1B ). 3. **Summing Angles:** - In ( triangle C_1A_1B_1 ), [ angle C_1A_1B_1 = 180^circ - (angle B + angle C) ] - Since the sum of internal angles in any triangle is ( 180^circ ), we get: [ angle C_1A_1B_1 = angle A ] 4. **Intersection of Altitudes:** - Let ( H_1 ) be the orthocenter of triangle ( C_1A_1B_1 ). The orthocenter of an isosceles triangle lies on the line of symmetry, which implies ( H_1B_1 = H_1C_1 ). 5. **Cycling Quadrilateral Properties:** - Consider the quadrilateral ( AB_1H_1C_1 ). Since [ angle B_1H_1C_1 = 180^circ - angle C_1A_1B_1 = 180^circ - angle A, ] quadrilateral ( AB_1H_1C_1 ) is a cyclic quadrilateral. 6. **Equal Chords:** - In cyclic quadrilateral ( AB_1H_1C_1 ), the angles subtended by equal chords are equal. Therefore, the angles ( angle B_1AH_1 ) and ( angle C_1AH_1 ) are equal. 7. **Conclusion:** - From the equality of angles ( angle B_1AH_1 ) and ( angle C_1AH_1 ), we conclude that point ( H_1 ) lies on the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ).

The average yield per year per tree is 100. If x is 8, how many nuts per year do the x trees yield?","completion":"Let's denote the number of nuts the x trees yield per year as N. According to the problem, we have three groups of trees: 1. (x + 4) trees yielding 60 nuts per year each. 2. x trees yielding N nuts per year each. 3. (x - 4) trees yielding 180 nuts per year each. The total number of trees is (x + 4) + x + (x - 4) = 3x. The total number of nuts produced by all the trees is: - (x + 4) trees * 60 nuts/tree + x trees * N nuts/tree + (x - 4) trees * 180 nuts/tree. The average yield per year per tree is 100 nuts, so the total number of nuts produced by all the trees is also 3x * 100 nuts. Setting the two expressions for the total number of nuts equal to each other, we get: (x + 4) * 60 + x * N + (x - 4) * 180 = 3x * 100. Now, we substitute x = 8 into the equation: (8 + 4) * 60 + 8 * N + (8 - 4) * 180 = 3 * 8 * 100. Solving for N: 12 * 60 + 8 * N + 4 * 180 = 2400. 720 + 8N + 720 = 2400. 8N + 1440 = 2400. 8N = 2400 - 1440. 8N = 960. N = 960 / 8. N = 120.

What is this gender?","completion":"The gender mentioned in the question is a girl. The probability of having a boy is the same as the probability of having a girl, which is 1/2 for each. Let's analyze the situation: - If a family has a boy on the first try, they stop having children. - If they have a girl, they try again. - This process continues until they have a boy, at which point they stop. Despite the fact that families stop having children after having a boy, the probability of having a boy or a girl for each pregnancy remains 1/2. This means that, over a large number of families, the number of boys and girls will tend to even out. Here's why: Each birth is an independent event with a 50% chance of being a boy and a 50% chance of being a girl. So, for each girl born, there's an equal chance that a boy is born. Even though families may have multiple girls on their way to having a boy, other families will have a boy on the first try, and overall, the ratio will tend toward 1:1.

Show that ( S_2 = S_3 ).","completion":"1. **Definition of ( S_n )**: We start by understanding the construction sequence defined: - ( S = S_0 ) is the initial set of points in space. - ( S_n ) is formed by taking all points ( P ) that lie on the closed segment ( AB ), for some ( A, B in S_{n-1} ). 2. **Geometric Interpretation**: We aim to prove ( S_2 = S_3 ). This requires showing that once we reach ( S_2 ), adding another step to form ( S_3 ) does not introduce any new points. Essentially, ( S_2 ) must be the **convex hull** of ( S_0 ). 3. **Definition of the Convex Hull**: The convex hull of a set of points ( x_i ), ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ) is defined as the set of all convex combinations of these points: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} lambda_i x_i ] where ( lambda_i geq 0 ) and ( sum_{i=1}^{n} lambda_i = 1 ). 4. **Combining Points in Segments**: Given two points ( P = sum lambda_i x_i ) and ( Q = sum mu_i x_i ), any point on the segment ( PQ ) can be written as: [ alpha P + beta Q ] for ( alpha, beta geq 0 ) and ( alpha + beta = 1 ). Substitute ( P ) and ( Q ): [ alpha sum lambda_i x_i + beta sum mu_i x_i = sum (alpha lambda_i + beta mu_i) x_i ] where ( sum (alpha lambda_i + beta mu_i) = alpha sum lambda_i + beta sum mu_i = alpha + beta = 1 ), thereby showing that the set of all such points is contained in the convex hull. 5. **Subset Inclusion**: From the definition of ( S_n ), it follows that each ( S_n ) is a subset of the convex hull of ( S_0 ). 6. **Convex Hull Dimension Argument**: We claim that any point in the convex hull can be expressed as a convex combination of at most 4 points from ( S_0 ). Assume otherwise, that some point ( P ) requires at least ( m geq 5 ) points: [ P = sum_{i=1}^{m} lambda_i x_i ] with ( lambda_i geq 0 ) and ( sum_{i=1}^{m} lambda_i = 1 ). 7. **Linear Dependence**: We can find ( mu_i ) not all zero such that: [ sum_{i=1}^{m} mu_i x_i = 0 ] and [ sum_{i=1}^{m} mu_i = 0 ] This means that for any ( k ), [ P = sum_{i=1}^{m} (lambda_i + k mu_i) x_i ] 8. **Adjustment with ( k )**: Choose ( k ) such that ( lambda_i + k mu_i = 0 ) for the smallest ratio ( lambda_i / mu_i ), leading at least one ( lambda_i ) to zero and maintaining others as non-negative. This expresses ( P ) with fewer points, providing a contradiction. Hence, any point in the convex hull can indeed be expressed as a combination of at most 4 points. 9. **Subset Equality**: Given: [ P = lambda_1 x_1 + lambda_2 x_2 + lambda_3 x_3 + lambda_4 x_4 ] Consider scenarios where some ( lambda_i ) are zero or positive. For positive terms, express ( P ) as: [ P = (lambda_1 + lambda_2) left(frac{lambda_1 x_1}{lambda_1 + lambda_2} + frac{lambda_2 x_2}{lambda_1 + lambda_2} right) + (lambda_3 + lambda_4) left(frac{lambda_3 x_3}{lambda_3 + lambda_4} + frac{lambda_4 x_4}{lambda_3 + lambda_4} right) ] Thus, ( P in S_2 ). 10. **Conclusion**: Since ( S_2 ) is the convex hull, ( S_3 ) will not introduce any new points and: [ S_2 = S_3 ] [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the range of real numbers k for which the curve y = 1 + (|x| leq 2) and the line y = k(x 2) + 4 intersect at two points.","completion":"**Step 1:** Understand the equation of the curve. The equation of the curve y = 1 + (|x| leq 2) can be understood as follows: for |x| leq 2, y = 2; otherwise, y = 1. This means the curve is a horizontal line at y = 2 for |x| leq 2 and drops to y = 1 for |x| > 2. **Step 2:** Analyze the conditions for intersection. For the line y = k(x - 2) + 4 to intersect with the curve at two points, it must intersect the horizontal line segment at y = 2 within the interval -2 leq x leq 2. Outside this interval, since the curve drops to y = 1, the line can only intersect with the curve within the given interval for two distinct points of intersection. **Step 3:** Find the intersection points. The line intersects the horizontal segment of the curve when y = 2. Setting k(x - 2) + 4 = 2, we get k(x - 2) = -2. This equation gives us the x-values of the intersection points depending on k. **Step 4:** Determine the range of k.

Thus, (3b^{2}+2 times dfrac{b^{2}}{4} > 21), solving this gives (b > sqrt{6}).

Denoting the points of intersection as A (x_1, y_1) and B (x_2, y_2), we have the system begin{cases} x_1+x_2=-frac{8k}{1+k^2} x_1x_2=frac{12}{1+k^2} end{cases} From this, we can derive y_1y_2=(kx_1+4)(kx_2+4)=k^2x_1x_2+4k(x_1+x_2)+16=frac{16-4k^2}{1+k^2}, and y_1+y_2=k(x_1+x_2)+8=frac{8}{1+k^2}. If there exists a circle P with diameter AB that passes through point M (2, 0), then MA is perpendicular to MB, which implies vec{MA} cdot vec{MB}=0. Hence (x_1-2)(x_2-2)+y_1y_2=0, which simplifies to x_1x_2-2(x_1+x_2)+4+y_1y_2=0. Substituting the previous results, we have frac{12}{1+k^2}+frac{16k}{1+k^2}+4+frac{16-4k^2}{1+k^2}=0. Solving this equation for k, we find k=-2 which is consistent with the condition we derived. Thus, the equation of the circle P with diameter AB passing through the points is given by x^2+y^2-(x_1+x_2)x-(y_1+y_2)y+x_1x_2+y_1y_2=0. Substituting x_1+x_2 and y_1+y_2 from the above, we get boxed{5x^2+5y^2-16x-8y+12=0}. In conclusion, among all the circles with AB as their diameter, there exists a circle P given by the equation boxed{5x^2+5y^2-16x-8y+12=0} or boxed{x^2+y^2=4} that passes through the point M (2, 0)."},{"prompt":"Define an odd function f(x) on mathbb{R} which is an increasing function on the interval [1,4].

The sum of the values over this tile is: [ omega_n^{i_0} omega_m^{j_0} + omega_n^{i_0+1} omega_m^{j_0} + ldots + omega_n^{i_0+n-1} omega_m^{j_0} = omega_m^{j_0} omega_n^{i_0} sum_{k=0}^{n-1} omega_n^k. ] Similarly, [ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} omega_n^k = frac{1 - omega_n^n}{1 - omega_n} = 0, ] because (omega_n^n = e^{2pi i} = 1). 6. **Sum over the whole rectangle:** Since both types of tiles sum to zero, the total sum of the values assigned to the entire (a times b) rectangle is zero. Explicitly calculating this sum gives: [ left(sum_{i=0}^{a-1} omega_n^iright) left(sum_{j=0}^{b-1} omega_m^jright). ] 7. **Evaluate these geometric sums:** We already noted the sums are: [ sum_{i=0}^{a-1} omega_n^i = frac{1 - omega_n^a}{1 - omega_n}, quad text{and} quad sum_{j=0}^{b-1} omega_m^j = frac{1 - omega_m^b}{1 - omega_m}. ] Therefore, the product is: [ frac{(1 - omega_n^a)(1 - omega_m^b)}{(1 - omega_n)(1 - omega_m)} = 0, ] meaning either (1 - omega_n^a = 0) or (1 - omega_m^b = 0). 8. **Conclude divisibility:** The equations (1 - omega_n^a = 0) and (1 - omega_m^b = 0) imply (omega_n^a = 1) and (omega_m^b = 1), respectively. For roots of unity, this condition means (a) is divisible by (n) or (b) is divisible by (m). Thus, we have shown that (n) divides (a) or (m) divides (b), and hence the rectangle can be tiled using only one type of tile.

Index the squares by mathbb{Z}. **Claim**: For any starting configuration, there exists an interval [A,B] such that no coin may ever exit B. *Proof*: Let n be the largest index of a square with any coins. Note that for any square m > n, the following property is true: if m ever gains a coin, then forever after, either m or m+1 has a coin. This follows since any move affecting either m or m+1 will add a coin to at least one of them. Thus, we may take B = n + 2c where c is the number of coins. The choice of A is similar. blacksquare 2. Now note that the sum of squares of indices of coins increases each step. This shows that configurations may never repeat; but there are finitely many configurations, ensuring termination. 3. **Second part**: Suppose S = (x_1, dots, x_n) is a valid sequence of moves that leads to an end state. We perform the following procedure for i = 1, dots, n. - Before the i'th move s_i, look at the leftmost square which has more than one coin. It must be operated on eventually, since that is the only way it can lose coins. Let x_j be the first such move on this square. - Rearrange the sequence so that this move x_j comes next instead. That is, apply the change [ (x_i, x_{i+1}, dots, x_{j-1}, x_j) longmapsto left( x_j, x_i, x_{i+1}, dots, x_{j-1} right). ] Note that validity of the whole operation is preserved. 4.

Now, we regard (F) as a polynomial in (x). Notice that if (x = y), then (x - y = 0), which implies (F = 0). Therefore, (x - y) must be a factor of (F). Similarly, if (x = z), then (z - x = 0) implies (F = 0), so (z - x) must also be a factor of (F). 3. Next, consider (y) as a polynomial variable. Applying a similar argument, setting (y = z) would make (y - z = 0), and hence (F = 0). This means (y - z) is a factor of (F). Thus, we have identified that (x - y), (y - z), and (z - x) are all factors of (F). 4. The polynomial (F) is of degree 3 with respect to its variables. Therefore, (F) can be expressed in the form: [ F equiv k(x-y)(y-z)(z-x), ] for some constant (k). 5. To find the value of the constant (k), we substitute specific values for (x, y), and (z). Let’s verify the constant (k) by choosing (x=1), (y=-1), and (z=0). Substitute these values into the equation for (F) to get: [ F = (1 - (-1))(2 + (-1)(0))(2 + 0(-1)) + ((-1) - 0)(2 + (1)(-1))(2 + 0(1)) + (0 - 1)(2 + (-1)(0))(2+1(-1)). ] Simplifying, [ F = (2)(2)(2) + (-1)(1)(2) + (-1)(2)(1) = 8 - 2 - 2 = 4. ] Therefore, [ k(1 - (-1))((-1)-0)(0-1) = k(2)(-1)(-1) = 2k. ] Solving for (k) we get: [ 2k = 4 implies k = 2. ] Thus, [ F equiv 2(x-y)(y-z)(z-x). ] 6. Finally, since the given condition (F = 0) is equivalent to [ 2(x-y)(y-z)(z-x) = 0, ] it means that at least one of the factors ((x-y)), ((y-z)), or ((z-x)) must be zero. # Conclusion: Therefore, at least two of the numbers (x), (y), and (z) must be equal.

Substituting the expression for a_{n+1} from step 1 into this, we get: [b_{n+1}=a_{n+1}-1=-frac{1}{2}(a_{n}-1)=-frac{1}{2}b_{n}] Since a_{1}-1=9, it follows that b_{1}=9, and thus, {b_{n}} is a geometric sequence with the first term 9 and common ratio -frac{1}{2}. 3. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by S_{n}=frac{a(1-r^{n})}{1-r}, where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. Applying this formula to {b_{n}}, we get: [S_{n}=frac{9(1-(-frac{1}{2})^{n})}{1-(-frac{1}{2})}=6-6times (-frac{1}{2})^{n}] 4. The problem asks us to find the smallest integer n for which |S_{n}-6|<frac{1}{170}. Substituting the expression for S_{n} from step 3, we have: [|6-6times (-frac{1}{2})^{n}-6|<frac{1}{170} implies 6times (-frac{1}{2})^{n}<frac{1}{170}] 5. Simplifying the inequality, we get: [(-frac{1}{2})^{n}<frac{1}{1020} implies (-frac{1}{2})^{n-1}<frac{1}{510}] 6. Solving this inequality for n, we find that n>9.

Therefore: - ( 2 ) must be a proper divisor of ( m ) 7. **Contradiction**: - ( 2 ) as a proper divisor of ( m ) implies it should be part of the set of proper divisors used to form all possible sums. - However, since the sum of any two proper divisors is greater than the smallest proper divisor and all sums formed (by problem conditions) must be greater than 2, ( 2 ) cannot be one of these sums generated by ( m )’s proper divisors. 8. **Conclusion**: This contradiction establishes that our initial assumption (that the obtained set of numbers could be the set of all proper divisors of some natural number ( m )) is false.

Thus, by just counting the change in total coins for odd-numbered wallets, we can pinpoint the specific wallet from which coins were transferred: - If ( text{sum} = 1600 ): - No coins were moved. - If ( text{sum} = 1600 + n ): - Coins were moved from an even-numbered wallet and we can identify the wallet by assessing position relative to ( n/2). - If ( text{sum} = 1600 - n ): - Coins were moved from an odd-numbered wallet and we track the number from the difference. # Conclusion: - The solution ensures that we only need one query to determine which wallet had its coins redistributed.

Given the information, we can set up the following system of equations: 1. For the first purchase: 15x + 20y = 430 2. For the second purchase: 10x + 8y = 212 Solving this system, we start with the second equation to express x in terms of y: - Multiply the second equation by 1.5 to align it with the coefficients of x in the first equation: 15x + 12y = 318 - Subtract this from the first equation to eliminate x: (15x + 20y) - (15x + 12y) = 430 - 318 - Simplify to find y: 8y = 112 Rightarrow y = 14 Substituting y = 14 into the second original equation: - 10x + 8(14) = 212 - Simplify: 10x + 112 = 212 - Solve for x: 10x = 100 Rightarrow x = 10 Therefore, the unit prices are x = 10 yuan for type A and y = 14 yuan for type B. boxed{text{Unit price of type A: } 10 text{ yuan, Unit price of type B: } 14 text{ yuan}} Part 2: Finding the Number of Purchasing Schemes Let m be the kilograms of type A vegetables purchased.

According to the given information, if the price is increased by 1, the sales volume decreases by 2,000 units. The original sales volume is 80,000 units, and the original price is 25 per unit. - The relationship between the price increase and sales volume decrease can be represented as: decrease in sales volume = (t - 25) times 2000. - The new sales volume can then be expressed as: 80000 - 2000(t - 25). - The total revenue with the new price is: new sales volume times new price, which gives us (80000 - 2000(t - 25)) times t. - The original revenue was 80000 times 25 = 2000000 (2 million dollars). To ensure that the total revenue from sales is not less than the original revenue, we set up the inequality: (80000 - 2000(t - 25)) times t geq 2000000 Simplifying: (80000 - 2000t + 50000) times t geq 2000000 130000 - 2000t geq frac{2000000}{t} 130t - 2t^2 geq 20000 2t^2 - 130t + 20000 leq 0 t^2 - 65t + 10000 leq 0 Solving this quadratic inequality, we find the roots to be t = 25 and t = 40.

First, note that the digit ( a ) (the first digit) can be any value from 1 to 9 since the divisibility by 16 depends only on the last four digits. So, ( a ) has 9 possible values. 5. Let us consider the possible values for ( c ): - ( c = 0 ): We need (overline{b160}) to be divisible by 16. - ( c = 8 ): We need (overline{b168}) to be divisible by 16. 6.

Firstly, let's explore the absolute value condition: 1. The condition \\"|x| < 1\\" means that x must lie strictly between -1 and 1. This can be rewritten as: [ -1 < x < 1. ] Now, let's analyze the quadratic inequality: 2. For the inequality x^{2}+x-2 < 0, we can factor the quadratic expression to find its roots and understand its intervals of negativity. The factored form is: [ (x+2)(x-1) < 0. ] This tells us that the roots of the equation x^{2}+x-2 = 0 are x = -2 and x = 1. 3. By analyzing the intervals determined by these roots, we determine that the inequality x^{2}+x-2 < 0 holds true for x values strictly between -2 and 1. Thus, this can be rewritten as: [ -2 < x < 1. ] To compare the two conditions: 4. The interval for |x| < 1 is (-1, 1), while the interval for x^{2}+x-2 < 0 is (-2, 1). 5. We observe that every x in (-1, 1) is also in (-2, 1), but not every x in (-2, 1) is in (-1, 1). This implies that if |x| < 1, then it must be true that x^{2}+x-2 < 0. However, there are values of x that satisfy x^{2}+x-2 < 0 but do not satisfy |x| < 1 (specifically, those between -2 and -1). Conclusion: 6. Therefore, we can conclude that \\"|x| < 1\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"x^{2}+x-2 < 0\\", because if \\"|x| < 1\\" is true, then \\"x^{2}+x-2 < 0\\" will definitely be true. However, it is not a necessary condition because \\"x^{2}+x-2 < 0\\" can still be true even if \\"|x| < 1\\" is not. So, the correct answer is: [ boxed{text{A: sufficient but not necessary condition}} ]"},{"prompt":"Prove that a square can be circumscribed around any convex figure.","completion":"To prove that around every convex figure Phi , a square can be circumscribed, we proceed as follows: 1. **Definitions and Setup**: Let's start by recalling that a figure Phi is convex if, for any two points within the figure, the line segment connecting them lies entirely within Phi . 2. **Defining Supporting Lines**: We examine all possible supporting lines of the convex figure Phi . A supporting line of a figure is a line that touches the figure at least at one point but does not divide the figure into two non-empty subsets (i.e., the figure lies entirely on one side of the line). 3. **Convex Hull**: According to the definition of the convex hull, the intersection of all these supporting lines defines a convex polygon, also known as the convex hull of Phi . We denote this convex hull by Psi . Notably, every supporting line of the convex hull Psi is also a supporting line for the figure Phi , and hence Psi contains Phi . 4. **Rectangular Enclosure**: Now, consider any rectangle R that circumscribes the convex hull Psi . Importantly, this rectangle will also circumscribe Phi because the convex hull Psi is the minimal convex set that contains Phi . 5. **Rotating the Rectangle**: It is essential to establish that among all such enclosing rectangles, one can be found where the sides' lengths are oriented in such a way that they can form a square. To see why this is true, we rotate the rectangle around Phi and note the changes in the dimensions: Let the rectangle have lengths a(alpha) and b(alpha), where ( alpha ) is the angle which one side makes with a fixed reference direction (say the x-axis). If (a(alpha) neq b(alpha)), i.e., ( a(alpha) > b(alpha)), then rotating the rectangle through 90 degrees, the lengths will switch; that is, (a(alpha+90^circ) = b(alpha)) and (b(alpha+90^circ) = a(alpha)). 6. **Continuous Function**: The function defined by the difference a(alpha) - b(alpha) is continuous with respect to alpha. By the intermediate value theorem, if a(alpha) - b(alpha) > 0 and a(alpha+90^circ) - b(alpha+90^circ) < 0, there must be some angle alpha_0 between these two angles such that: [ a(alpha_0) - b(alpha_0) = 0 ] This implies: [ a(alpha_0) = b(alpha_0) ] 7. **Square Formation**: Hence, at the angle alpha_0, the lengths of the enclosing rectangle are equal, thus it forms a square. Such a square is a special case of the enclosing rectangle and will circumscribe the convex figure Phi . In conclusion, we have shown that for any convex figure Phi, there exists a square that can circumscribe it. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"The decimal expansion of 7/9 is a repeating decimal.

Part (2) Finding Coordinates of Point B **Method 1: Using Properties of Parabola** Given A(4,4), the parabola equation is y^{2}=4x. Since D lies on the directrix, line AB passes through the focus F(1,0). Therefore: [x_{1}x_{2}=frac{p^{2}}{4}=1, quad y_{1}y_{2}=-1.] Solving these gives: [x_{2}=frac{1}{4}, quad y_{2}=-1.] Thus, the coordinates of point B are boxed{Bleft(frac{1}{4},-1right)}. **Method 2: Using Equations** Given A(4,4), the parabola equation is y^{2}=4x. The equation of line AD is: [4y=2(x+4) implies y=frac{1}{2}(x+4).] This gives D(-1,frac{3}{2}). For line BD: [yy_{2}=p(x+x_{2}) implies left{begin{array}{l}frac{3}{2}y_{2}=2(-1+x_{2})y_{2}^{2}=4x_{2}end{array}right..] Solving these gives x_{2}=frac{1}{4}, y_{2}=-1, hence boxed{Bleft(frac{1}{4},-1right)}.

The equation of line AD is: [x=frac{y_{1}}{p}y-frac{y_{1}^{2}}{2p}.] Similarly, for line BD: [x=frac{y_{2}}{p}y-frac{y_{2}^{2}}{2p}.] Substituting D(-p,y_{0}) into these equations, we find y_{1} and y_{2} satisfy: [frac{y^{2}}{2p}-frac{y_{0}}{p}y-p=0.] This leads to y_{1}+y_{2}=2y_{0} and y_{1}y_{2}=-2p^{2}. The slope of line AB is: [k=frac{2p}{y_{1}+y_{2}}.] Thus, the equation of line AB is: [x=frac{y_{0}}{p}y+p,] showing that line AB always passes through the fixed point boxed{(p,0)}. **Method 2: Using Polar Line Properties** Let D(-p,y_{0}).

Part (2): Maximizing Profit with Additional Purchases Let x be the number of A phones purchased additionally. Then, the number of B phones purchased additionally is (30 - x). The profit obtained from these purchases is denoted as w yuan, and can be calculated as: [ w = (3400 - 3000)x + (4000 - 3500)(30 - x) ] Simplifying gives: [ w = 400x + 500(30 - x) = -100x + 15000 ] Given the constraint that the number of B phones does not exceed twice the number of A phones, we have: [ 30 - x leq 2x ] Solving this inequality for x gives: [ x geq 10 ] Since the profit function w = -100x + 15000 shows that the profit decreases as x increases (because the coefficient of x is negative), the maximum profit is achieved when x is at its minimum valid value, which is 10. Substituting x = 10 into the profit equation gives: [ w = -100(10) + 15000 = 14000 ] Therefore, the maximum profit is achieved when purchasing 10 units of A phones and 20 units of B phones (since 30 - 10 = 20), resulting in a maximum profit of: [ boxed{14000 , text{yuan}} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the sum of all the positive divisors of 117 and how many of these divisors are prime numbers?","completion":"1. **Prime Factorization**: First, find the prime factorization of 117. We note that 117 = 3 times 39 and further factorize 39 as 3 times 13. Therefore, the prime factorization of 117 is 3^2 times 13. 2. **Sum of Divisors**: Using the formula for the sum of divisors from the prime factorization, sigma(n) = (p_1^{k_1+1}-1)/(p_1-1) times (p_2^{k_2+1}-1)/(p_2-1) times ldots, where n = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} ldots p_r^{k_r}, we apply this to 117 = 3^2 times 13: - For 3^2, the sum is (3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. - For 13, the sum is (13^0 + 13^1) = 1 + 13 = 14.

In this case, the number must have 30 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 divisors. First, let’s find the odd part of n, denoted as n', which must have 12 divisors. The factorization could be one of the following: - A single prime raised to the eleventh power: minimal choice would be 2^{11}, but this is even. - Three primes where one is squared, another is cubed (product of three distinct primes like p^1q^2r^3): smallest such n' using smallest primes would be 3^1 cdot 5^2 cdot 7^3. Next, we need to consider the even part of n. We need n to have 18 even divisors, which means 2^n times an odd number n' should have 18 divisors where all are due to multiplication with some power of 2. This corresponds to having 18 / 12 = 1.5 when divided by the odd divisors, not an integer, invalidating the prompt. To resolve, reconsider counting factors directly based on new divisors of n / n' being 18 / 12 = 1.5, which should be an integer, we failed at the assumption making. Here, we correct: The correct relation should be ensuring even divisors with an added power of 2: 18 = (e_1'+1)(e_2'+1)cdots(e_k'+1) where one of e_i' is multiplied by 2 due to 2^q where q part of e_i' = q + 1 - 1.

For simplicity, let's analyze from May to November and examine if it's possible for the seventh day of each month to avoid being a Sunday. 1. **Define Initial Condition and Recursive Relation:** Let's assume the 7th of May falls on the x-th day of the week. Since there are 7 days a week, x can only take values from 1 to 7, where each value represents a day like Monday, Tuesday, etc. 2. **Establish Relationship Monthly:** The number of days in the subsequent months determines which day of the week will be the 7th day of that month: - May has 31 days. Since 31 days corresponds to 31 equiv 3 mod 7, the 7th of June falls (x + 3)-th day of the week. - June has 30 days. Since 30 days corresponds to 30 equiv 2 mod 7, the 7th of July falls (x + 3 + 30) mod 7 = (x + 33) mod 7 = (x + 5) mod 7. - July has 31 days. Since 31 days corresponds to 31 equiv 3 mod 7, the 7th of August falls (x + 5 + 31) mod 7 = (x + 36) mod 7 = (x + 1) mod 7. - August has 31 days. Since 31 days corresponds to 31 equiv 3 mod 7, the 7th of September falls (x + 1 + 31) mod 7 = (x + 34) mod 7 = (x + 4) mod 7. - September has 30 days. Since 30 days corresponds to 30 equiv 2 mod 7, the 7th of October falls (x + 4 + 30) mod 7 = (x + 34) mod 7 = (x + 6) mod 7. - October has 31 days. Since 31 days corresponds to 31 equiv 3 mod 7, the 7th of November falls (x + 6 + 31) mod 7 = (x + 37) mod 7 = (x + 2) mod 7. 3. **Identify Possible Days:** We mapped the 7th day of each month from May to November as follows: - May 7: x - June 7: x + 3 mod 7 - July 7: x + 5 mod 7 - August 7: x + 1 mod 7 - September 7: x + 4 mod 7 - October 7: x + 6 mod 7 - November 7: x + 2 mod 7 4. **Conclusion:** We have obtained 7 different possible days for the seventh of the months from May to November - these are distinct modulo 7. Since there are 7 different values, this means all days of the week (from 1 to 7) are represented as (x+0) mod 7, (x+1) mod 7, ..., (x+6) mod 7. Therefore, one of these values must correspond to a Sunday. In conclusion, since all days of the week are covered exactly once, it is guaranteed that at least one of them falls on a Sunday. boxed{No}"},{"prompt":"a ( 10 times 20 ) grid, 200 distinct numbers are placed.

The road parallel to the length is 10 m wide and 60 m long (since it is parallel to the breadth of the lawn). So, its area is: Area of road 1 = width * length = 10 m * 60 m = 600 sq m The road parallel to the breadth is 10 m wide and 70 m long (since it is parallel to the length of the lawn). However, we must subtract the area where the two roads intersect to avoid double counting. The intersection area is a square with a side of 10 m (the width of the roads). Area of intersection = side * side = 10 m * 10 m = 100 sq m So, the area of the second road, excluding the intersection, is: Area of road 2 (excluding intersection) = width * length - intersection area = 10 m * 70 m - 100 sq m = 700 sq m - 100 sq m = 600 sq m Now, we add the areas of both roads to get the total area: Total area of roads = Area of road 1 + Area of road 2 (excluding intersection) = 600 sq m + 600 sq m = 1200 sq m Finally, we calculate the cost of traveling the two roads at Rs. 3 per sq m: Cost = Total area of roads * cost per sq m = 1200 sq m * Rs. 3 per sq m = Rs. 3600 Therefore, the cost of traveling the two roads is Rs. boxed{3600} ."},{"prompt":"There are 100 sticks, with which you can form a 100sided polygon.

Consider the set of sticks with lengths given by the sequence: (1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, ldots, 2^{98}, 2^{99} - 2). 2. To determine if these sticks can form a 100-sided polygon, we apply the polygon inequality theorem, which states that a set of lengths can form a polygon if and only if the length of the longest stick is less than the sum of the lengths of the remaining sticks. Let's calculate the total length of all the sticks: [ sum_{i=0}^{98} 2^i + (2^{99} - 2) ] 3. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we find the sum of the first 99 terms: [ sum_{i=0}^{98} 2^i = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ldots + 2^{98} = 2^{99} - 1 ] 4. Adding the length of the last stick: [ 2^{99} - 1 + (2^{99} - 2) = 2^{99} - 1 + 2^{99} - 2 = 2 cdot 2^{99} - 3 = 2^{100} - 3 ] 5. The length of the longest stick in the set is (2^{99} - 2). 6. To verify the polygon inequality condition for 100 sticks: [ 2^{99} - 2 < 2^{100} - 3 - (2^{99} - 2) = 2^{100} - 2^{99} - 1 ] Simplify the expression on the right-hand side: [ 2^{100} - 2^{99} - 1 = 2 cdot 2^{99} - 2^{99} - 1 = 2^{99} - 1 ] 7. Therefore, we need to check if: [ 2^{99} - 2 < 2^{99} - 1 ] This inequality holds true, as (-2) is indeed less than (-1). 8. Since the polygon inequality condition is satisfied, these 100 sticks can be used to form a 100-sided polygon. 9. Now, considering any subset of these sticks, we need to check if any smaller polygon can be formed. 10. For any proper subset, if we remove any one of these sticks, the sum of the remaining sticks is always less than the length of the longest stick in the subset. This fails the polygon inequality theorem, which asserts that in any proper subset, the longest stick cannot exceed the sum of the remaining sticks to form a valid polygon.

To find the intervals of monotonicity, we calculate the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{(x)(frac{1}{x}) - ln(x)(1)}{x^2} = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2}. Setting f'(x) = 0 provides the critical point: 1 - ln x = 0 Rightarrow ln x = 1 Rightarrow x = e. So the function is increasing on the interval (0, e) and decreasing on the interval (e, infty). This can be verified by checking the sign of f'(x) in both intervals. Next, we need to arrange the six numbers 3, 3e, epi, pi e, 3pi, pi^3. Since f(x) is decreasing for x > e, we know that for x > e, larger x will result in smaller f(x) values. This gives us: frac{ln e}{e} = frac{1}{e} > frac{ln pi}{pi} > frac{ln x}{x} text{ for any } x > pi, so we have e > pi e > x for any x > pi.

So, we have the equation: B + I = 6 Since we know B = 4, we can substitute that into the equation: 4 + I = 6 Now, we can solve for I: I = 6 - 4 I = 2 So, Ivory drinks 2 cups of coffee per hour. Now, to find the ratio of the amount of coffee Brayan drinks to the amount Ivory drinks, we divide the amount Brayan drinks by the amount Ivory drinks: Ratio (Brayan:Ivory) = B / I Ratio (Brayan:Ivory) = 4 / 2 Ratio (Brayan:Ivory) = 2 / 1 Therefore, the ratio of the amount of coffee Brayan drinks to the amount Ivory drinks is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"Maxwell leaves his home and walks toward Brad's house at a certain speed.

Now, let's calculate the total tape needed for all the boxes: - 5 boxes of 15x30 inches need 5 x 60 inches = 300 inches of tape. - 2 boxes of 40x40 inches need 2 x 120 inches = 240 inches of tape. The total tape needed for all boxes is 300 + 240 = 540 inches, which matches the given total. Now, to find out how many pieces of tape each box needs, we can look at the individual calculations: - Each 15x30 box needs 3 pieces of tape (1 for the long side, 2 for the short sides). - Each 40x40 box also needs 3 pieces of tape (1 for one side, 2 for the adjacent side). Therefore, each box, regardless of size, needs boxed{3} pieces of tape."},{"prompt":"Show that if the difference of two positive cube numbers is a positive prime, then this prime number has remainder 1 after division by 6 .","completion":"To show that if the difference of two positive cube numbers is a positive prime, then this prime number has remainder 1 after division by 6, we start with the given conditions and proceed step-by-step. 1. **Given:** Suppose ( a, b in mathbb{N} ) and a prime ( p ) such that ( a^3 - b^3 = p ). 2. **Factorization:** We can factorize the difference of cubes as follows: [ a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) ] Since ( p ) is a prime number, it must be the product of two factors, one of which must be ( 1 ) (since ( p ) is prime and cannot be factored further into non-trivial factors). 3. **Case Analysis:** We consider two cases based on the factorization: **Case 1:** ( a - b = p ) and ( a^2 + ab + b^2 = 1 ) - This case is impossible because ( a^2 + ab + b^2 = 1 ) implies: [ (a - b)^2 + 3ab = 1 ] Substituting ( a - b = p ): [ p^2 + 3ab = 1 ] Since ( p ) is a positive prime, ( p^2 geq 1 ), and ( 3ab ) is a positive integer, this inequality cannot hold. Therefore, this case is not possible. **Case 2:** ( a - b = 1 ) and ( a^2 + ab + b^2 = p ) - In this case, let ( a = b + 1 ). Substitute ( a = b + 1 ) into the equation: [ (b + 1)^2 + (b + 1)b + b^2 = p ] Simplify the left-hand side: [ (b^2 + 2b + 1) + (b^2 + b) + b^2 = p ] Combine like terms: [ 3b^2 + 3b + 1 = p ] Therefore: [ p = 3b^2 + 3b + 1 ] 4. **Modulo Analysis:** Note that ( b(b + 1) ) is always even because it is the product of two consecutive integers (one of which is always even). Therefore, ( 3b(b + 1) ) is divisible by ( 6 ): [ 3b(b + 1) equiv 0 pmod{6} ] Adding ( 1 ) to both sides: [ 3b^2 + 3b + 1 equiv 1 pmod{6} ] Hence: [ p equiv 1 pmod{6} ] Thus, we have shown that if the difference of two positive cube numbers is a positive prime, then this prime number has remainder ( 1 ) after division by ( 6 ).

Given that a digit ranges from 0 to 9, initially note that digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cannot be used. This can be demonstrated by attempting to use one of these digits: - For example, if 5 is used, we need two digits to sum equal 24 - 5 = 19, but it’s impossible since the maximum sum of any two digits (9 + 9 = 18) is less than 19. - The same consideration applies for digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since ( y ) and ( z ) are odd integers, and ( x ) is an even integer, the difference between an odd and an even integer is always odd. Therefore, ( y - x ) and ( z - x ) must be odd numbers.
