Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Pokémon team： 1. Hydreigon 2. Heatran 3. Garchomp 4. Tapu Fini 5. Ferrothorn 6. Togekiss Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is an athletic girl with lightly tanned skin that reflects her Alolan heritage. She has long, dark brown hair typically kept back from her lively hazel eyes with a flower clip. Mahina dresses comfortably for ease of movement but favors bright, cheerful colors reflecting her warm personality.

Her mother Selene made history as Alola's first ever Pokémon League Champion before joining the Ultra Recon Squad conservation group. Her father Hau continued the family legacy by succeeding his grandfather Hala as Melemele Island’s Kahuna. Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck. Mahina works tirelessly but cannot seem to overcome this barrier, leaving her feeling inadequate next to her high-achieving kin. Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior. While quite extroverted and openly expressive, Mahina is sensitive and takes failures firmly to heart. Her stalled psychic development despite tireless training has impacted her confidence. However, she tackles every challenge with determined resilience, hoping to overcome her limitations. Overall, Mahina’s energetic and affectionate nature makes her a beloved friend. Her positivity and selfless courage light up those around her. Mahina lives life to the fullest while aiming to touch as many hearts as possible on her personal journey of growth. Pokemon Team： 1. Decidueye 2. Primarina 3. Incineror 4. Noivern 5. Tauros 6. Crabominable Name: Helia Gender: Female Age: 10 Appearance: Helia is a petite girl with fair skin, bright blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, and large blue eyes that exude innocence. She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Pokemon Team： 1. Khlap Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise. Though the planet is now devoid of flowing rivers or lush forests, Yabisha remains forever vigilant over this long-dead land it once nurtured but failed to save. Type: Grass/Dragon Abilities: 1.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest. Type: Fire/Dragon Abilities: 1. Sheer Force - Increases power of moves with secondary effects but removes those effects. 2. Unnerve - Makes opponents too nervous to eat berries.

This Electric and Dragon type is said to be the mythic guardian of Saturn. Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

Pokémon Name: Gliyda Pokédex Entry: Gliyda, the Ice Storm Pokémon. This solitary beast is said to be the guardian of Uranus. It lurks deep within the frozen outer reaches of the planet's atmosphere, undaunted by the extreme subzero temperatures and relentless storms. Gliyda possesses cryokinetic powers—its mere breath can generate raging cyclones of snow and ice at over 500 mph that deluge the methane skies. Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system. Type: Ice/Dragon Abilities: 1. Snow Warning - Summons hailstorm when switched in. 2. Ice Body - Restores HP during hailstorms.

Pokémon Name: Bruokh Pokédex Entry: Bruokh, the Hurricane Pokémon. This elusive Flying and Dragon-type is said to be the guardian of Neptune. Bruokh lurks within the planet's icy atmosphere, manifesting as shifting Great Dark Spots drifting across the vivid azure clouds. It possesses unmatched command over wind and weather. With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space. Type: Flying/Dragon Abilities: 1. Snow Warning - Summons hailstorm when switched in. 2. Storm Drain - Draws in all Water-type moves to raise Sp. Atk.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths. Pokémon Name: Lazarus Pokédex Entry: Lazarus, the Revitalized Pokémon. A unique specimen among Pikachu, Lazarus bears the mark of divine intervention. Following the tragic decimation of his family by a merciless Nidoking, little hope remained for this frail Pichu. As he lay dying from his grievous wounds, he was discovered by Shmaya, the human incarnation of Rayquaza. Compassionately infused with Rayquaza’s life-giving energies, Lazarus was reborn with Cronal vitality. His newfound form as a Pikachu can freely shift to Raichu, reflecting his unusual evolutionary state. Lazarus has been graced with an Cronal body capable of miraculous regeneration, even from mortal damage. His type has shifted to Electric/Dragon due to the portion of Rayquaza’s divinity he harbors, setting him apart from his kin and marking him as Shmaya’s chosen apostle. Type: Electric/Dragon Abilities: 1. Levitate - Gives immunity to Ground-type moves. 2. Regenerator - Heals a portion of HP when switching out. Hidden Ability: Blessing of Rayquaza - Regenerates even if severely injured; cannot be knocked out as long as there’s HP remaining. Height: 0.4 m (Pikachu Form) / 0.8 m (Raichu Form) Weight: 6.0 kg (Pikachu Form) / 30.0 kg (Raichu Form) Evolutionary Line: Pichu (Base) → Pikachu (Lazarus Form) ↔ Raichu (Lazarus Form) - Lazarus has the unique ability to switch freely between Pikachu and Raichu forms.

His body can regenerate from any wound, making him a formidable ally in battle and a living testament to Shmaya’s mercy and Rayquaza’s blessing. Pokémon Name: Khlap Pokédex Entry: Khlap, the Adaptive Pokémon. Birthed from the ambitious laboratories of the Aether Foundation, Khlap represents a pinnacle of genetic ingenuity. As a subject in the RKS system’s early trials, Khlap gained the unprecedented ability to morph between the eight distinct evolutions of Eevee, adapting fluidly to myriad battlefield exigencies. This versatility renders Khlap a strategic chameleon able to counteract the various type advantages of opposing Pokémon. Ordinarily, Khlap retains its Normal-type essence. In combat, this unassuming façade unfolds into a spectrum of elements, symbolizing the manifold potentials of Eevee’s lineage. Once destined for termination post-experimentation, Khlap’s fate took a compassionate turn through the intervention of Professor Lillie. Offered sanctuary within the idyllic confines of Aether Paradise, Khlap flourished under Lillie’s tender care. In a twist of destiny, Khlap found a soulmate in Helia, Professor Lillie’s daughter, becoming an irrevocable part of the young girl’s existence. As Helia’s guardianship fell upon it, Khlap vowed an oath of protection. Despite its pacific nature and struggles with form transformation, Khlap confronts adversity with undeterred bravery, attempting to shield Helia from the cruelties of the world. The bond they foster is a testament to the transcending love that unites human and Pokémon souls. Type: Normal Abilities: 1. Adaptability - Increases the power of moves that match Khlap’s type. 2. Protean - Changes Khlap’s type to that of the move it is about to use. Hidden Ability: RKS Mastery - Allows Khlap to change its type dynamically in battle to resist the last move hit by an opponent.

Khlap’s extraordinary genetic makeup allows for an unprecedented range of adaptation through the forms tied to Eevee’s various evolutions. However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a confident 13 year old girl with grey-on-pink hair tied back in a ponytail. Her piercing yet playful turquoise eyes seem to look right through people. She wears mystical golden bracelets engraved with arcane glyphs on her wrists and has a subtle regal bearing beyond her years. Kanzi dresses sharply but practically, equally at ease in a business suit for meetings with her network of informants as she is kicking back in casual wear at the bar she runs. An aura of charisma and danger surrounds this adolescent queen of Kalos' secret underworld. Backstory: In truth, Kanzi is the human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa. Her true origins are shrouded in mystery, but Kanzi suddenly rose to prominence in Lumiose City's gang underworld a year ago when she defeated their leaders, ending civil wars. She now rules the city's criminal networks with an iron fist, her influence extending into corridors of power. Kanzi subsidizes housing, food, and care for the downtrodden in her territory, earning deep loyalty from the poor and violent alike. Her chain of followers spans all Kalos. She also prohibits the drug trade or exploitation of Pokémon for profit in her realm on pain of severe punishment. Despite wielding this immense shadowy authority for one so young, Kanzi keeps a low profile managing her empire out of the bar she runs in Lumiose's slums. Officials turn a blind eye towards her vigilantism solving problems endemic crime creates. Kanzi has become a Robin Hood-esque guardian angel to the marginalized, beloved for standing up to tyrannical forces yet feared by those she battles. Her true motives and endgame remain inscrutable behind the signature smile always playfully dancing on this intoxicating queen's lips. Personality: Outwardly Kanzi appears to be a confident, charismatic and cheerful teenage girl. Her playful smile and sparkling eyes convey optimism and hide a razor-sharp intellect. Kanzi carries an affable air that sets those around her at ease. Beneath this disarming front simmers immense ambition and relentless drive. Kanzi leverages her natural charm and talent for manipulation as weapons securing iron control over Kalos' expansive underworld and slums. Ruthless when needed to consolidate power, she nonetheless adheres to a disciplined ethical code prohibiting things like drugs and Pokémon abuse. This robin hood mentality earns intense devotion from the downtrodden who see her as a savior. Kanzi's motives remain shrouded behind the lenient benevolence she publicly projects. It is clear though that this young queen rules through a mix of charisma, fear, rewards and ruthless elimination of threats. Her network permeates all Kalos yet she keeps a low-key lifestyle itself. Those searching Kanzi's smiling eyes for answers about her intentions tend to find themselves contributing to her cause or vanished altogether. None dare openly challenge the street urchin whose brazen takeover itself still provokes hushed awe and speculation about her true origins. For now, this intoxicating adolescent holds all of Kalos firmly enthralled. Please expand Kanzi's setting to at least 1000 words based on the following. Outwardly, Kanzi is a 13 year old girl living in the city of Lumiose in the Kalos region, but her true identity is the human incarnation of the legendary Pokémon Hoopa. Kanzi has grey-on-pink hair tied back in a ponytail, and gold bracelets engraved with mystical script are worn on her hands. A confident smile is her signature, and her turquoise eyes seem to see into the soul while carrying a hint of mischief. As the queen who rules the slums of Lumiose City, Kanzi is a myth in the Kalos region's underworld. No one knows where she came from, and as if she were a god parachuted into the mortal world, she used her iron hand to end the feuding forces of Lumiose City in no time at all, making the entire Lumiose City gangster families and slum gangs bow down to her. Her grey chain spreads throughout Kalos, and even government officials in Kalos want a piece of the action - so Kanzi's power runs unimpeded in Kalos, and even the police can't do anything about it, making her the invisible ruler of Kalos. However, Kalos' invisible queen has her untouchable bottom line - she hates drugs with a passion, and anyone who uses or sells them on her turf will be severely punished by her. Despite her wealth, Kanzi keeps a low profile and has never been a spendthrift. She lives in a bar she runs in the slums of Lumiose City, where she runs a thriving business and secretly manages her vast underworld empire. Kanzi is a saviour to the poor who suffer from the oppression of monopoly capitalism while living in the slums - as Kanzi spends the lion's share of her earned funds to subsidise the poor living in her turf, which has made her popular in the underworld. Most of the henchmen and their families who serve her have been subsidised by her and they are loyal to Kanzi.","completion":"Kanzi's presence in the seedy underbelly of Lumiose City has evolved into nothing short of a folklorish phenomenon—a wisp of an enigma shaped like a teenage girl yet commanding the authority of an entire region's shadow realm. Starting as an orphaned waif rummaging through the gutters, she manifested spontaneously in the slums, ascending the ranks with inexplicable alacrity. Her meteoric rise was marked by calculated moves against key figures, consolidating her power through strategic alliances or swift displays of calculated force. While public records outlining her ascent are scant, her exploits resonate widely through the hushed whispers of street urchins and the wary glances of seasoned criminals alike. To them, Kanzi is both sovereign and specter—a young queen cloaked in the allure of secrecy, casting tall shadows over the cracked pavement of their lives. Those who dare scrutinize the queen's serene face, crowned with its youthful visage and underscored by a playful, knowing smile, would observe the demeanor of someone far beyond her chronological years. It's in the almost imperceptible incline of her brow, the subtle curl along the corner of her smile, the steady gaze that belies ponderous depth. She harbors a presence that oscillates between conviviality and a palpable formidability, convincing the despondent that they have found a protector, while those who might oppose her remain duly intimidated. Kanzi conducts her rule from \\"The Hoopa's Hollow\\", a bar masked as an inconspicuous watering hole nestled in the heart of Lumiose's most destitute district. It serves as her court, a nexus of clandestine dealings and hushed negotiations conducted under the pulsing luminescence of flickering neon. The bar's unassuming exterior hides a sophisticated nerve center of her expansive underworld network—a cobweb of influence latching onto street corners and back alleys, through which pass the strings to be pulled and the fates to be altered. Justice, in Kanzi's jurisdiction, wears an ambivalent face. Her code defies the typical criminal creed, resting on a morality self-imposed but universally imposed within her reach. Dark alleys once rife with the perils of drug peddlers now bear the mark of her tight rein, cleared of the narcotics trade under threats of retributions too grim for most to risk. The same sinewy streets that dealt in fear now challenge the very essence of inequity and cruelty under her watch. Anecdotes of her unwavering stance against Pokémon exploitation abound—graffiti murals showing a charismatic girl riding side-by-side with a Lucario have surfaced overnight, symbolizing a pact between human and Pokémon in defiance of corporate tyranny. Whispers tell of Manaphy and other legendaries owing her favors; and though never proven, the legend alone lends an air of invincibility to Kanzi's cause. In her company, one might catch the briefest glimpse of her gold bracelets shimmering enigmatically, not unlike the puzzling rings that frame the mythical Hoopa—yet no one dares question their origin or grasp. Her turfs’ children, once hungry and helpless, now speak of her with fervent adoration. They see a savior in her—a beacon who disrupts the pervasive stratification of wealth and power, bridging chasms and forging futures with a grace known only to those of her station. Yet for all her grounded largesses, Kanzi's gaze—steeped in the agate-tinted turquoise of her eyes—remains perennially skyward. There exists within her an insatiable yearning, a secret only she and the cosmos are privy to. The motives that drive her, whether earthly crusade or sovereign's obligation, remain securely locked behind a smile serenely worn. And so continues the modern-day odyssey of young Kanzi. From her unsuspecting bar throne, wrapped in the nostalgia of dark spirits and cigarette-stained wood, she orchestrates the intricate ballet of the shadows—a teenage matron ensconced in a world older and more complex than the tall tales spun around her legacy. Her enigmatic rule continues—part benefactor, part enforcer—a living paradox weaving the silk of her narrative into Kalos' rich tapestry."},{"prompt":"Name one thing you learned from Lecture #21 Part 1-5 (you can choose any part). You can write a paragraph if you'd like but you need only write one sentence. Type your answer in the text box provided.","completion":"One thing I learned from Lecture #21 Part 1-5 is the importance of understanding consumer behavior when developing marketing strategies."},{"prompt":"The Continuity Problem Sometimes the problem of personal identity has been expressed in terms of the continuity problem. How can there be an x that stays the same given it changes? How can there be an x that changes given it stays the same? In a binary system this seems like a contradiction, some sort of paradox, because if x changes, it doesn't stay the same. if x stays the same, it doesn't change. The Ship of Theseus A thought experiment which concerns the continuity problem. The ship of Theseus was an Athenian ship used in war and made of wood. It would go out to battle, be subject to some damage and they would then repair it by replacing some of the wooden planks. This would happen again and again and again. So, it goes out, comes back and they replace more wooden planks and so on and so forth. So we have an x that changes. Is there any point at which throughout the changes it is no longer the ship of Theseus? We can ask various questions and impose various hypothetical scenarios in which the ship changes presenting us with this question. Material/Physical Matter Quantity Suppose over time going out and coming back in to repair the damage we have now replaced 51 percent of the wooden planks. Is it the same ship of Theseus? If we think it isn't then this suggests the physical/material matter (or some quantity of) is what makes the x, in this case the ship, the x it is. Quality Instead of replacing it, with wooden planks, we do it with glass or aluminum or some other, some material other than wood. Does that matter? Is it still the same ship of Theseus? Function How about if it just sits in the docks? It no longer goes out to sea. No longer functions as the warship. Is it the same ship of Theseus? What if we turn it into a cruise ship, Carnival Cruise or Princess Cruise. Is it the same ship of Theseus? Now that people are traveling to Mexico or Greece or the Caribbean on it. Gradual vs Drastic/Dramatic Change Suppose I take an axe to the ship and I demolish it. And then I rebuild the ship, made up of the same material (i.e. the same wooden planks). I don't change any of the wooden planks. But now the change has not been gradual over time. It's been a drastic kind of change. Does that make a difference? If we take apart the ship and we send the ship to the Met Museum in New York and then we put it back together again and put it on display is it the same ship of Theseus? Timeline Does it have something to do with things having a particular timeline, a beginning, a middle and an end. The ship of Theseus was originally built and even if it undergoes changes as long as it's at present linked back to that origin, when it was first built, it's the same ship of Theseus. But if I take the axe to it then I put an end to that timeline. Even if it's made with the same material, when I remake it I have created a new origin, new timeline and thus it is a different ship. When asking these questions and considering different changes made to the ship, we test our intuitions as to what we think determines that sameness, what must be the case for the x to remain the same x even though it has undergone changes. This is addressing the continuity problem. If you make a change and think it's no longer the same ship of Theseus that points you in a direction as to what you think matters when it comes to determining that the x is the same x.","completion":"One thing that we learn from this portion of Lecture #21 is that the continuity problem raises questions about personal identity and the concept of sameness when something undergoes changes. It challenges us to consider whether the material matter, the function, the gradual vs drastic change, the timeline, or other factors determine the identity of an object."},{"prompt":"When education systems are influenced by contextual (local) factors that affect educational outcomes we refer to this process as ____.

The volume V and radius r of the weather balloon are related by the formula. V= 4/3 πr^3. The radius is increasing at a rate of 0.105 inches per minute. How fast is the volume of the balloon increasing?","completion":"To find how fast the volume of the balloon is increasing, we need to take the derivative of the volume formula with respect to time: dV/dt = d/dt (4/3 πr^3) Using the chain rule, we can write this as: dV/dt = (4/3 π) * d/dt (r^3) The derivative of r^3 with respect to time can be obtained using the power rule: dV/dt = (4/3 π) * 3r^2 * dr/dt We are given that the radius is increasing at a rate of 0.105 inches per minute, so dr/dt = 0.105. Substituting this value into the equation, we get: dV/dt = (4/3 π) * 3(5.2 inches)^2 * 0.105 Evaluating this expression, we find: dV/dt ≈ 4 * π * (5.2 inches)^2 * 0.105 dV/dt ≈ 4 * π * (27.04 inches^2) * 0.105 dV/dt ≈ 4 * π * 2.8356 inches^2/min dV/dt ≈ 35.68 π inches^2/min Therefore, the volume of the balloon is increasing at a rate of approximately 35.68 π inches^2 per minute."},{"prompt":"To find how fast the volume of the balloon is increasing, we can differentiate the volume formula with respect to time: dV/dt = d/dt (4/3 πr^3) To do this, we can apply the chain rule.

To find the critical points, we need to find the values of x where the derivative of the function equals zero or is undefined. First, let's find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x: f'(x) = -3x^2 + 12x + 15 To find the critical points, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x: -3x^2 + 12x + 15 = 0 Next, we can factor out a common factor of -3: -3(x^2 - 4x - 5) = 0 Now, we can factor the quadratic equation inside the parentheses: -3(x + 1)(x - 5) = 0 Setting each factor equal to zero, we get: x + 1 = 0 => x = -1 x - 5 = 0 => x = 5 So, the critical points are x = -1 and x = 5. Now, to use the First Derivative Test, we consider the intervals (-inf, -1), (-1, 5), and (5, +inf). We can pick a test point from each interval and evaluate the sign of f'(x) at those points to determine the nature of the critical points. Let's choose x = -2, x = 0, and x = 6 as our test points. For f'(-2), we get: f'(-2) = -3(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 15 = -12 - 24 + 15 = -21 So, f'(-2) < 0. For f'(0), we get: f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 12(0) + 15 = 15 So, f'(0) > 0. For f'(6), we get: f'(6) = -3(6)^2 + 12(6) + 15 = -108 + 72 + 15 = -21 So, f'(6) < 0. Now, let's summarize our findings: In the interval (-inf, -1): f'(-2) < 0 In the interval (-1, 5): f'(0) > 0 In the interval (5, +inf): f'(6) < 0 According to the First Derivative Test, the function has a local maximum at x = -1. To find the y-coordinate of the local maximum, we can substitute x = -1 into the original function: f(-1) = -(-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 15(-1) - 2 = 1 + 6 - 15 - 2 = -10 So, the coordinates of the local maximum are (-1, -10)."},{"prompt":"Marlan is in the middle of a dense forest and needs to make it to the nearest town, which is 13 km north and 22 km east of his current position, as shown in the diagram below. He is travelling on his four wheeler, and can move at a speed of 4 km/h through the forest, and 22 km/h on the road. Measured as a distance from town, at what point should he emerge from the forest and join the road in order to minimize his travel time?","completion":"Let's assume that Marlan needs to travel a distance of x km through the forest before reaching the point where he emerges and joins the road. The time it takes for Marlan to travel through the forest is x km divided by his speed in the forest, which is 4 km/h. So, the time spent in the forest is t₁ = x / 4. Once Marlan reaches the road, he needs to travel a distance of (22 - x) km to reach the town. The time it takes for this portion of the journey is (22 - x) km divided by his speed on the road, which is 22 km/h. So, the time spent on the road is t₂ = (22 - x) / 22. The total travel time, t, is the sum of t₁ and t₂: t = t₁ + t₂ = x / 4 + (22 - x) / 22 To minimize the travel time, we can take the derivative of t with respect to x and set it equal to zero: dt/dx = 1/4 - 1/22 = 0 To solve this equation, we can multiply both sides by the common denominator of 88: 22 - 4 = 0 Simplifying this equation, we get: 18 = 0 Since this equation is not possible, it means that there is no value of x that minimizes the travel time. However, since Marlan needs to emerge from the forest and join the road to reach the town, he should aim to minimize the time spent in the forest. The minimum time in the forest, t₁, is achieved when x = 0. In this case, Marlan emerges from the forest directly onto the road. So, Marlan should emerge from the forest at his current position in order to minimize his travel time."},{"prompt":"hiloh started a lawn care company in her neighbourhood last summer and signed on 26 clients at 16 per lawn. After surveying her clients over the winter, she realized that for every 4 increase in price, she will lose one client. What price should she charge to maximize her profit, assuming she does not take on any new clients?","completion":"To determine the price that Hiloh should charge to maximize her profit, we need to analyze the relationship between price, number of clients, and profit. Let's consider the variables: P = Price per lawn N = Number of clients R = Revenue C = Cost per lawn P₀ = Initial price (16) N₀ = Initial number of clients (26) C₀ = Initial cost per lawn (assumed constant) We know that revenue (R) is equal to the price per lawn (P) multiplied by the number of clients (N): R = P * N We also know that profit (Pr) is equal to revenue (R) minus cost (C) for each lawn, multiplied by the number of clients (N): Pr = (R - C) * N Let's analyze the decrease in the number of clients as the price increases. For every 4 increase in price, Hiloh will lose one client. So, we can write: N = N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4 Substituting this expression for N into the equation for profit, we get: Pr = [(P * N₀ - C₀ * N₀) - C * (N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4)] * (N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4) Now, let's simplify this expression for profit: Pr = [P * N₀ - C₀ * N₀ - C * (N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4)] * (N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4) = [P * N₀ - C₀ * N₀ - C * N₀ + C * (P - P₀) / 4] * (N₀ - (P - P₀) / 4) = (PN₀ - C₀N₀ - CN₀ + CP₀/4 + CP₀/4 - CP/4) * (N₀ - P₀/4 + P/4) = (PN₀ - CN₀ - CP + CP₀/2) * (N₀ + P₀/4 - P/4) Now, we have an expression for profit in terms of the price per lawn. To identify the price that maximizes profit, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to P, set it equal to zero, and solve for P. To find the derivative, we have: dPr/dP = (N₀ + P₀/4 - P/4) * (P - C) Setting dPr/dP equal to zero, we get: (N₀ + P₀/4 - P/4) * (P - C) = 0 Either (N₀ + P₀/4 - P/4) = 0 or (P - C) = 0 The equation (N₀ + P₀/4 - P/4) = 0 does not have a root, as it would require P = N₀ - P₀, which is not feasible since P represents the price. Therefore, we need to solve (P - C) = 0: P - C = 0 P = C Thus, the price that Hiloh should charge to maximize her profit is equal to her cost per lawn."},{"prompt":"Let x be the number of times Shiloh increases the price by 4.

P′(x)08xx=−8x+88=−8x+88=88=11","completion":"Apologies for the incorrect explanation in my previous response. You are correct with the calculations. To find the maximum profit, we need to differentiate the profit function P(x) = -4x^2 + 88x + 416 with respect to x: P'(x) = -8x + 88 Setting P'(x) equal to zero to find the critical point: -8x + 88 = 0 Solving this equation, we get: -8x = -88 x = 11 So, the maximum profit occurs at x = 11. To find the corresponding price per lawn that maximizes profit, we substitute the value of x back into the equation: P(x) = (16 + 4x)(26 - x) P(11) = (16 + 4 * 11)(26 - 11) P(11) = (16 + 44)(26 - 11) P(11) = 60 * 15 P(11) = 900 Therefore, to maximize profit, Shiloh should increase the price 11 times, resulting in a price per lawn of 60, and her maximum profit will be 900."},{"prompt":"A teacher is helping her students construct open-top boxes to collect Valentine's Day cards. Each student starts with a piece of 19 inch by 8 inch construction paper and has to cut four identical squares from the corners, so the sides can be folded up and taped. What is the largest volume of the box that can be formed?","completion":"To find the largest volume of the box that can be formed from the construction paper, we can determine the dimensions of the box that will maximize the volume. Let's assume that the side length of each square cut from the corners is x inches. When these squares are removed, the dimensions of the resulting box are (19 - 2x) inches by (8 - 2x) inches by x inches. The volume V of the box can be calculated as the product of these dimensions: V = (19 - 2x)(8 - 2x)x Expanding and simplifying the expression: V = 152x - 42x^2 + 4x^3 To find the largest volume, we need to find the critical points of the volume function. We can do this by taking the derivative of V with respect to x, and setting it equal to zero: dV/dx = 152 - 84x + 12x^2 = 0 We can solve this quadratic equation for x: 12x^2 - 84x + 152 = 0 Dividing through by 4 to simplify: 3x^2 - 21x + 38 = 0 Factoring this quadratic equation, we find that it does not factor nicely. Therefore, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of x: x = (-(-21) ± sqrt((-21)^2 - 4(3)(38))) / (2(3)) x = (21 ± sqrt(441 - 456)) / 6 x = (21 ± sqrt(-15)) / 6 Since we cannot take the square root of a negative number in this context, it means that the quadratic equation does not have real solutions. Therefore, there are no real values of x that maximize the volume of the box. This implies that the largest volume of the box cannot be formed using the given construction paper and cutting method. Please note that if we allow for non-integral side lengths of x, then we could find complex numbers as solutions and determine a maximum volume based on those complex numbers.

Stay updated with industry best practices, emerging technologies, and changing regulations to ensure the training remains relevant and effective. Remember, effective physical security training requires a holistic approach that includes regular assessments, ongoing support, and a commitment to continuous improvement."},{"prompt":"what should be the baseline of access control in security","completion":"The baseline for access control in security refers to the minimum standards and practices that should be followed to ensure the protection of physical assets, information, and personnel within an organization. Here are some elements that are typically considered as part of the baseline for access control: 1. Identification and authentication: A baseline requirement is to have a system in place that allows individuals to prove their identity (e.g., ID cards, biometrics) and authenticate their authorization to access certain areas or resources. 2. Access permissions: Clearly define and assign access permissions based on job roles, responsibilities, and the principle of least privilege. Only provide access to the areas and resources that an individual requires to perform their duties. 3. Physical barriers: Implement physical barriers such as locked doors, gates, fences, and turnstiles to restrict access to authorized personnel and deter unauthorized entry. 4. Surveillance systems: Install and maintain surveillance systems, including CCTV cameras and video monitoring, to monitor access points and detect any suspicious or unauthorized activities. 5. Visitor management: Implement a visitor management system to ensure that all visitors are properly identified, logged, and escorted when necessary. This may involve issuing visitor badges, conducting background checks, and limiting access to certain areas. 6. Access logs and monitoring: Keep records of access logs to enable monitoring and auditing of access control activities. Regularly review and analyze these logs to identify any patterns of unauthorized access or potential security vulnerabilities. 7. Alarm systems: Install alarm systems that can detect and alert the security team or relevant personnel in case of unauthorized access attempts or breaches. 8.

Auditing may involve reviewing access control system configurations, permissions, and logs, as well as conducting physical inspections of access points and control devices. 5. Intrusion detection systems: Intrusion detection systems can be deployed to monitor and detect unauthorized physical access to sensitive areas. These systems can use sensors, motion detectors, or other technologies to trigger alarms or notifications when unauthorized activities are detected. 6. Personnel verification: Security personnel can be stationed at access points to visually verify the identity and authorization of individuals attempting to enter restricted areas. This can involve checking identification cards, cross-referencing against a visitor management system, or confirming the purpose of the visit. 7. Regular security patrols: Security personnel can conduct regular patrols throughout the facility to ensure that access control measures are being followed correctly. They can visually inspect access points, verify authorization credentials, and report any suspicious or unauthorized activities. 8. Security incident response: Establish a robust incident response protocol that outlines how to handle security incidents related to unauthorized access. This can include procedures for escalating incidents, documenting evidence, conducting investigations, and taking appropriate corrective actions. By implementing a combination of these monitoring methods, organizations can maintain a high level of oversight and control over access control procedures, promptly detect any deviations or breaches, and take appropriate actions to mitigate any security risks."},{"prompt":"how do we control access control in security","completion":"Controlling access control in security involves implementing measures and procedures to regulate and manage who has access to specific areas or resources within an organization. Here are some steps to help control access control: 1. Conduct a risk assessment: Begin by conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify the areas, assets, and resources that require access control. This will help determine the level of security needed for each area and guide decision-making throughout the process. 2. Develop access control policies and procedures: Establish clear and comprehensive access control policies and procedures that outline who is authorized to access certain areas or resources, how access is granted and revoked, and the steps to be followed for access requests and approvals. These guidelines should align with the organization's security objectives and compliance requirements. 3.

Briefly answer the reason.","completion":"There could be multiple reasons why a convolutional neural network (CNN) may not be suitable for a particular dataset: 1. Lack of spatial or local patterns: CNNs are designed to capture spatial or local patterns in data, such as images or sequences with inherent spatial relationships. If the dataset does not possess such patterns or if the data is not spatial in nature (e.g., tabular data), a CNN may not be the most appropriate choice. 2. Insufficient amounts of data: CNNs typically require large amounts of labeled data to effectively learn and generalize patterns. If the dataset is small or insufficiently diverse, training a CNN may lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new data. 3. Irrelevant features: CNNs are designed to automatically learn relevant features from the input data. However, if the dataset contains irrelevant features or noise that can significantly affect the performance, a CNN may struggle to extract useful information and make accurate predictions. 4. Lack of hierarchical structure: CNNs are particularly effective in processing hierarchical data with multiple levels of abstraction. For example, in image classification, CNNs can identify low-level features like edges and then progressively learn high-level features like shapes or objects. If the data lacks a hierarchical structure, a CNN may not be the most suitable model choice. In such cases, it would be more appropriate to explore other types of models, such as traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines) or sequential models (e.g., recurrent neural networks), depending on the nature of the data and the task at hand.

In the case of car performance and fuel consumption data, the data is generally tabular and does not possess the inherent spatial or local patterns that CNNs are adept at capturing. CNNs are specifically tailored to exploit the local connectivity and shared weights across spatial dimensions, but these characteristics do not align with the nature of the tabular data in this dataset. For tabular data, other machine learning algorithms like regression, decision trees, or even deep learning models like feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or transformer models might be more suitable choices. These models can effectively handle the tabular data structure, capture temporal or sequential dependencies, and make predictions based on the available features in the dataset. Therefore, it is recommended to explore and employ models that are better suited to handle tabular data and can effectively learn the relationships between car performance variables and fuel consumption in this specific dataset."},{"prompt":"This dataset contains the performance information of several cars manufactured between 1970 and 1982, as well as the fuel consumption of those cars. Discuss whether there is a best model selection method other than the cross-validation","completion":"When selecting the best model for a dataset that contains car performance information and fuel consumption, there are other evaluation methods that can be considered in addition to cross-validation. While cross-validation is a commonly used method, there are a few alternatives to explore: 1. Hold-Out Validation: In this method, the dataset is divided into two parts: a training set and a validation set. The model is trained on the training set and then evaluated on the validation set. This approach provides a quick and straightforward way to estimate the model's performance. However, it may be more prone to variability and may not be as reliable as cross-validation when the dataset is small. 2. Randomized Train-Test Split: Similar to hold-out validation, this method randomly splits the dataset into a training set and a test set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. It gives a single performance estimate and is useful when time or computational resources are limited. However, it can be sensitive to the specific random partitioning and may not provide a reliable estimate of the model's true performance. 3. Bootstrapping: Bootstrapping involves creating multiple resamples of the dataset by randomly sampling with replacement. Each resampled dataset is used to train and evaluate the model, and the results are aggregated to estimate the overall model performance. Bootstrapping provides a robust estimate of model performance and can be particularly useful when the dataset is limited. 4. Information Criteria: Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are statistical measures used to compare different models based on goodness-of-fit and complexity. These criteria penalize models with more parameters, favoring simpler and more interpretable models. These criteria can be useful for model selection, especially when the focus is on balancing the trade-off between model complexity and goodness-of-fit. It's important to note that the best model selection method may depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset, the modeling task, and the goals of the analysis. It is often recommended to use a combination of evaluation methods to have a comprehensive understanding of the performance and generalization of different models."},{"prompt":"请利用bootstrapping python 对以下的交叉验证进行替换 from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV rfr = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=0) parameter_tree = { 'n_estimators':[10,20,50,100,200,500], 'max_depth':[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20] } grid_rfr = GridSearchCV(rfr, parameter_tree, scoring = 'neg_mean_absolute_error', cv=5) grid_rfr.fit(train_X, train_y) rf_best_parameters = grid_rfr.best_params_ print(rf_best_parameters)","completion":"要使用bootstrapping进行模型选择，你可以使用以下步骤替换给定代码中的交叉验证部分： \`\`\` from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error import numpy as np # Create a random forest regressor rfr = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=0) # Define the parameter grid parameter_tree = { 'n_estimators': [10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500], 'max_depth': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20] } # Split the data into train and test sets train_X, test_X, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0) # Create an array to store the model performances mae_scores = [] # Perform bootstrapping num_bootstrap = 100 # Number of bootstrap iterations for i in range(num_bootstrap): # Randomly sample with replacement from the train set bootstrap_indices = np.random.choice(len(train_X), size=len(train_X), replace=True) bootstrap_X, bootstrap_y = train_X[bootstrap_indices], train_y[bootstrap_indices] # Perform grid search on the bootstrap sample grid_rfr = GridSearchCV(rfr, parameter_tree, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error', cv=5) grid_rfr.fit(bootstrap_X, bootstrap_y) # Evaluate the model on the test set predictions = grid_rfr.predict(test_X) mae = mean_absolute_error(test_y, predictions) # Store the mean absolute error for this model mae_scores.append(mae) # Compute the mean and standard deviation of the mean absolute errors mae_mean = np.mean(mae_scores) mae_std = np.std(mae_scores) # Print the mean and standard deviation print(\\"Mean Absolute Error: {:.2f}\\".format(mae_mean)) print(\\"Standard Deviation: {:.2f}\\".format(mae_std)) \`\`\` 在这个脚本中，我们首先将数据划分为训练集和测试集。然后，我们进行100次bootstrap迭代，每次都从训练集中进行有放回的随机抽样，得到一个bootstrap样本。然后，我们在每个bootstrap样本上使用GridSearchCV找到最佳参数，并在测试集上评估模型的性能。最后，我们计算100个bootstrap模型的平均平均绝对误差（Mean Absolute Error，MAE）和标准差。 这样，你可以使用bootstrapping来评估模型的性能和稳定性，并根据平均错误和标准差选择最佳模型。"},{"prompt":"除了利用gridsearchCV的交叉验证法选择最佳参数外，是否又其他更好的方法，并给出代码","completion":"除了使用GridSearchCV的交叉验证方法外，你还可以使用随机搜索（Randomized Search）来选择最佳参数。随机搜索比网格搜索更适用于大规模参数网格或训练时间较长的情况下。下面是使用随机搜索选择最佳参数的代码示例： \`\`\`python from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error # Create a random forest regressor rfr = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=0) # Define the parameter distributions for random search parameter_dist = { 'n_estimators': [10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500], 'max_depth': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20] } # Perform random search to select the best parameters random_search_rfr = RandomizedSearchCV(rfr, parameter_dist, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error', cv=5, n_iter=10, random_state=0) random_search_rfr.fit(train_X, train_y) # Get the best parameters rf_best_parameters = random_search_rfr.best_params_ # Train the model with the best parameters best_rfr = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=0, **rf_best_parameters) best_rfr.fit(train_X, train_y) # Evaluate the model on the test set predictions = best_rfr.predict(test_X) mae = mean_absolute_error(test_y, predictions) # Print the best parameters and mean absolute error print(\\"Best Parameters:\\", rf_best_parameters) print(\\"Mean Absolute Error:\\", mae) \`\`\` 在这里，我们使用\`RandomizedSearchCV\`来执行随机搜索，并设置\`n_iter\`参数为10来指定搜索的迭代次数。随机搜索将基于指定的参数分布进行随机抽样，并在每个样本上执行交叉验证来评估模型的性能。最后，我们"},{"prompt":"Use the First Derivative Test to find the coordinates of the local maximum of f(x)=−x^3+6x^2+15x−2","completion":"To use the First Derivative Test to find local maxima of the function ( f(x) = -x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x - 2 ), we first need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of ( f(x) ) with respect to ( x ), setting the derivative equal to zero, and solving for ( x ). Let's start by finding the derivative of ( f(x) ): ( f'(x) = -3x^2 + 12x + 15 ) Now, we set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points: ( -3x^2 + 12x + 15 = 0 ) To solve this quadratic equation for ( x ), we can either factor it or use the quadratic formula. Let's try to factor it first: ( -3(x^2 - 4x - 5) = 0 ) Now we look for two numbers that multiply to give -5 and add up to give -4. These numbers are -5 and +1. ( -3(x - 5)(x + 1) = 0 ) This gives us two critical points: ( x_1 = 5 ) ( x_2 = -1 ) To determine if these critical points are local maxima, minima, or saddle points, we can use the First Derivative Test, which involves checking the sign of the derivative before and after each critical point. Consider the interval around ( x_1 = 5 ): - For ( x < 5 ), choose a number like ( x = 4 ). Substituting ( x = 4 ) into ( f'(x) ), we get: ( f'(4) = -3(4)^2 + 12(4) + 15 = -48 + 48 + 15 = 15 > 0 ) - For ( x > 5 ), choose a number like ( x = 6 ). Substituting ( x = 6 ) into ( f'(x) ), we get: ( f'(6) = -3(6)^2 + 12(6) + 15 = -108 + 72 + 15 = -21 < 0 ) Since the derivative changes from positive to negative at ( x_1 = 5 ), this indicates that ( f(x) ) has a local maximum at ( x = 5 ). Consider the interval around ( x_2 = -1 ): - For ( x < -1 ), choose a number like ( x = -2 ). Substituting ( x = -2 ) into ( f'(x) ), we get: ( f'(-2) = -3(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 15 = -12 - 24 + 15 = -21 < 0 ) - For ( x > -1 ), choose a number like ( x = 0 ). Substituting ( x = 0 ) into ( f'(x) ), we get: ( f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 12(0) + 15 = 15 > 0 ) Since the derivative changes from negative to positive at ( x_2 = -1 ), this indicates that ( f(x) ) has a local minimum at ( x = -1 ), not a maximum. Now let's find the ( y )-coordinate of the local maximum by substituting ( x = 5 ) into the original function: ( f(5) = -(5)^3 + 6(5)^2 + 15(5) - 2 ) ( f(5) = -125 + 150 + 75 - 2 ) ( f(5) = 25 + 75 - 2 ) ( f(5) = 100 - 2 ) ( f(5) = 98 ) Therefore, the coordinates of the local maximum are (5, 98)."},{"prompt":"Marlan is in the middle of a dense forest and needs to make it to the nearest town, which is 13 km north and 22 km east of his current position, as shown in the diagram below. He is travelling on his four wheeler, and can move at a speed of 4 km/h through the forest, and 22 km/h on the road. Measured as a distance from town, at what point should he emerge from the forest and join the road in order to minimize his travel time?","completion":"To minimize his travel time, Marlan should choose a point to emerge from the forest and join the road such that the sum of the time taken to travel through the forest and on the road is minimized. Let's define the origin (0,0) at his current position within the forest, and let (0,13) be the point where the road intersects the northern edge of the forest. The town is located at (22,13). Let (x) be the horizontal distance Marlan travels eastward within the forest until he reaches the point where he emerges and joins the road. He will then travel (13-x) km northward within the forest to get to the edge of the forest. The remaining journey on the road to the town will then be the straight-line distance from the edge of the forest to the town. The time taken to travel through the forest is the sum of the time taken to travel eastward and northward. Time taken to travel eastward in the forest: ( frac{x}{4} ) hours Time taken to travel northward in the forest: ( frac{13-x}{4} ) hours The total time in the forest is ( frac{x + 13 - x}{4} = frac{13}{4} ) hours, regardless of where Marlan emerges. The distance on the road from where he emerges from the forest to the town must be calculated using Pythagoras' theorem: Road distance ( = sqrt{(22 - x)^2 + (13 - 0)^2} ) The time taken to travel this distance on the road at a speed of 22 km/h is: Road time ( = frac{sqrt{(22 - x)^2 + 13^2}}{22} ) Therefore, the total time to travel to the town is the sum of the time in the forest and the time on the road: Total time (T(x) = frac{13}{4} + frac{sqrt{(22 - x)^2 + 13^2}}{22} ) We could differentiate this function with respect to (x) and set the derivative to zero to find the minimum, but we observe that the time spent in the forest is a constant ((frac{13}{4}) hours). Therefore, the point at which Marlan should emerge from the forest is when the time on the road is minimized. Since the time on the road is inversely proportional to his road speed, and given that his speed doesn't change, minimizing time on the road is equivalent to minimizing the road distance itself. The road distance is minimized when it is a straight line, which (from the forest's exit point to the town) would occur when Marlan emerges from the forest directly east of the town. That means ( x = 22 ) km is the distance he should travel eastward inside the forest, and from there, he takes the road to the town. This path minimizes his travel time because it minimizes the distance on the slower terrain (forest) and allows for the maximum distance to be covered on the faster terrain (road). So, Marlan should emerge from the forest and join the road 22 km east from his starting point, which will be directly at the bottom of the road leading to the town."},{"prompt":"A teacher is helping her students construct open-top boxes to collect Valentine's Day cards.

Let's say that the side length of each square to be cut out is x inches. Once we cut out the squares and fold up the sides, the dimensions of the base of the box are: - Length: (19 - 2x) inches - Width: (8 - 2x) inches The height of the box is x inches, as that is the length of the side of the square that was cut out. The volume V of the box can be given by the formula: V = length × width × height V(x) = (19 - 2x)(8 - 2x)x Now we need to maximize this volume function. First, let's expand the equation: V(x) = x(152 - 38x - 16x + 4x^2) V(x) = 4x^3 - 54x^2 + 152x To find the value of x that maximizes the volume, we'll take the derivative of V(x) with respect to x and then set it equal to zero to find critical points. V'(x) = 12x^2 - 108x + 152 Setting the derivative V'(x) equal to zero: 12x^2 - 108x + 152 = 0 Now we solve for x. This quadratic equation can be simplified by dividing through by 4: 3x^2 - 27x + 38 = 0 To solve this, we might try factoring or using the quadratic formula. This equation does not factor nicely, so we'll use the quadratic formula where a = 3, b = -27, and c = 38: x = (-(-27) ± √((-27)^2 - 4(3)(38))) / (2(3)) x = (27 ± √(729 - 456)) / 6 x = (27 ± √273) / 6 x = (27 ± √(3*91)) / 6 x = (27 ± √(3*13*7)) / 6 x = (27 ± √273) / 6 The radical √273 cannot be simplified into a nice integer, so we have two potential solutions which we need to evaluate. Since we're looking for a physical length (x), we can discard the negative root because it would result in a negative length, which is not possible. So we take only the positive root: x = (27 + √273) / 6 Calculating this root gives us the size of the square to be cut out. To determine the maximum volume, let's find the value of this positive root (using an approximate value of √273): x ≈ (27 + √273) / 6 x ≈ (27 + 16.52) / 6 x ≈ 43.52 / 6 x ≈ 7.25 inches Given the dimensions of the paper, x cannot exceed 4 inches because that's the half of the shorter side (8 inches). The result we obtained (x ≈ 7.25 inches) would make the length or width of the box negative, which is not possible. So, we have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's redo the calculation: x ≈ (27 + √273) / 6 x ≈ (27 + 16.52) / 6 x ≈ 43.52 / 6 x ≈ 7.2533 Now, since √273 is an irrational number, let's round it to two decimal places for simplicity: √273 ≈ 16.52 So, we have, approximately: x ≈ (27 + 16.52) / 6 x ≈ 43.52 / 6 x ≈ 7.25 inches This is still incorrect because x cannot be greater than 4 inches (half the width of the 8-inch side). We should double-check our math. It looks like the calculation for the square root was correct, but there's a misconception in interpreting the solution. We will need to compute the exact values without approximations to find the correct value of x that maximizes the box volume. We have the expression for x: x = (27 ± √273) / 6 Since the discriminant √273 is approximately 16.52, and we are looking for a positive physical solution that is less than 4 inches, we disregard the addition of √273 (because 27 + 16.52 already exceeds the maximum possible value of 2*4 inches) and consider only the subtraction: x = (27 - √273) / 6 Using a calculator, we can find the precise value of x: x ≈ (27 - 16.52) / 6 x ≈ 10.48 / 6 x ≈ 1.7467 inches This is a realistic value for x considering the paper's dimensions, and it is less than 4 inches, which is half of the width of the 8-inch side. We can now use this x-value to find the maximum volume of the box. x ≈ 1.7467 inches Now we can calculate the dimensions of the box: Length: 19 - 2x = 19 - 2(1.7467) ≈ 19 - 3.4934 ≈ 15.5066 inches Width: 8 - 2x = 8 - 2(1.7467) ≈ 8 - 3.4934 ≈ 4.5066 inches Height: x ≈ 1.7467 inches The maximum volume V of the box is: V ≈ 15.5066 * 4.5066 * 1.7467 V ≈ 121.6846 inches^3 So the largest volume of the box that can be formed is approximately 121.6846 cubic inches."},{"prompt":"Как бы развивался наш мир, если бы в нём не существовал Адольф Гитлер?","completion":"Спекуляции о том, как бы развивалась история без определенного человека, являются высокоградусной исторической фантастикой, потому что каждое изменение в прошлом теоретически может привести к неизмеримо большим изменениям в настоящем и будущем. Это часть идеи, известной как \\"эффект бабочки\\" в теории хаоса. Однако мы можем коснуться нескольких ключевых областей, которые могли бы измениться, если бы Адольф Гитлер не существовал. 1. Вторая мировая война: Одним из самых очевидных последствий отсутствия Гитлера было бы отличное развитие или даже отсутствие Второй мировой войны, как мы ее знаем. Возможно, был бы другой катализатор или была бы другая личность, которая возглавила бы Германию к военному конфликту, но вероятно, уровень разрушения и геноцид, которые произошли бы, значительно отличались бы от исторических событий. 2. Холокост: Без Гитлера и его идей об \\"окончательном решении еврейского вопроса\\", свирепость и систематичность погромов евреев и других групп населения могли бы не иметь места, что могло бы спасти миллионы жизней. 3. Геополитические последствия: После Второй мировой войны мир был поделен на сферы влияния между Советским Союзом и Соединенными Штатами, что привело к холодной войне. Без войны, результаты которой сформировали этот порядок, мир мог бы развиваться в совершенно другом ключе, возможно без противостояния двух супердержав или с более медленным развитием ядерного вооружения. 4. Технологический прогресс: Вторая мировая война была стимулом для значительного технологического развития в областях как ядерная энергетика, так и космические технологии. Если бы не было такого стимула, эти технологии развивались бы медленнее или по другому пути. 5. Постановление Израиля: Без Холокоста и предшествующих ему антисемитских преследований давление на создание еврейского государства могло бы быть меньшим, и политическая карта Ближнего Востока оказалась бы иной. 6. Искусство и культура: Влияние нацистской Германии выходило за рамки политики и военных действий, охватывая культуру, искусство и науку. Многие учёные и художники были вынуждены эмигрировать или были уничтожены. Без этой утраты талантов, вклад в науку и искусство был бы иным. Общей проблемой в таких расчетах является \\"counterfactual history\\" — история, основанная на предпосылке \\"что, если бы\\". Это интересно для обсуждения, но не может быть научно обосновано из-за несчетного количества переменных и недокументированности альтернативных вариантов событий."},{"prompt":"По поводу третьего пункта, можешь поподробнее об этом рассказать?","completion":"Конечно, рассмотрим более подробно геополитические последствия мира без Гитлера и, следовательно, возможно, без Второй мировой войны в том виде, в каком она произошла: 1. Распад европейских империй: В результате Второй мировой войны многие европейские страны оказались деолигархически и экономически ослабленными, что ускорило процесс деколонизации. Если бы война не имела места, колониальные империи, такие как Британская, французская, и даже голландская, могли бы сохранять своё влияние намного дольше. 2. Холодная война: Вторая мировая война значительно ослабила традиционные европейские державы и одновременно привела к возникновению двух супердержав – США и СССР. Отсутствие такого конфликта означало бы, что традиционная многополярная система власти могла бы сохраниться на дольше. Это могло бы привести к иным международным альянсам и конкуренции за влияние. 3. Распространение социализма и коммунизма: Великая депрессия 1930-х годов и последующая вторая Мировая война создали благоприятные условия для распространения социалистических и коммунистических идей. В отсутствие войны распространение этих идей могло быть менее интенсивным, или конфликт между социалистическими и капиталистическими странами мог бы получить иную форму. 4. Разработка ядерного оружия: Проект Манхэттен и бомбардировки Хиросимы и Нагасаки показали мощь ядерного оружия, что стало основой для последующего вооруженного противостояния двух супердержав. Без этого демонстративного шага, дальнейшее развитие и распространение ядерного оружия могло бы быть совершенно иным. 5. Окончательное формирование границ: По итогам войны были установлены новые границы, произошли масштабные миграции населения. Территориальные споры и националистические движения могли бы иметь другие траектории развития в отсутствие поствоенной переконфигурации границ. Эти сценарии существенно упрощены, так как даже небольшие изменения в прошлом могут приводить к колоссально различным исходам, и трудно определить, какие события произошли бы по другой причине и какие фигуры взошли бы на историческую сцену вместо Гитлера."},{"prompt":"Расскажи подробнее о втором пункте","completion":"Конечно, давайте более подробно обсудим влияние на мир в отсутствие Холокоста, которое является одним из самых трагических и значимых аспектов власти Адольфа Гитлера. Холокост, или Шоа, был систематическим государственным уничтожением примерно шести миллионов евреев, а также миллионов других людей, включая ромов, инвалидов, поляков, советских военнопленных, гомосексуалов и политических диссидентов, нацистским режимом и его союзниками во время Второй мировой войны. Отсутствие Холокоста означало бы ряд последствий: 1. Спасение жизней: Миллионы жизней были бы спасены, и эти люди продолжили бы вносить свой вклад в общество, что могло оказать существенное влияние на науку, искусство, литературу, музыку и другие области. 2. Демографические изменения: Европейское еврейство не было бы столь сокрушенно, и еврейские сообщества, которые были уничтожены или разрушены, могли бы продолжить свое развитие. Это могло бы привести к значительным демографическим изменениям в Европе и других местах. 3. Создание государства Израиль: Хотя сионистское движение началось до Холокоста, последняя сыграла ключевую роль в содействии международного признания необходимости создания Израиля. Отсутствие Холокоста могло бы изменить глобальный дискурс по этому вопросу и возможно отсрочить или изменить условия создания Израиля. 4. Культура памяти: Холокост стал центральным событием в западной культуре памяти, и его влияние на искусство, литературу, кинематограф и образование трудно переоценить. Без этого темные главы истории человечества были бы иными, и мы могли бы видеть другой культурный ландшафт. 5. Международные отношения и права человека: Холокост оказал заметное влияние на развитие прав человека и формирование таких организаций, как Организация Объединенных Наций (ООН) и принятие Всеобщей декларации прав человека. Отсутствие Холокоста могло бы повлиять на эти процессы по-разному. 6. Образ Германии и национальное воспоминание: Холокост оставил глубокий след в немецкой национальной памяти и образе Германии в мире. Если бы это событие не произошло, самоощущение и имидж Германии были бы совершенно другими, что, в свою очередь, могло бы повлиять на международные отношения и европейскую интеграцию.

Dado que la carga es negativa, se moverá en dirección opuesta al campo eléctrico. En el caso de un campo eléctrico creado por una carga positiva, el potencial eléctrico disminuye a medida que nos alejamos de la carga positiva y, por lo tanto, el potencial eléctrico es menor cerca de la carga positiva y mayor lejos de ella. Por lo tanto, la carga negativa se moverá desde un potencial eléctrico menor hacia uno mayor a medida que se aleja de la carga positiva. En cuanto a la energía potencial, en el caso de una carga negativa se mueve en dirección opuesta al campo eléctrico, por lo que su energía potencial aumentará a medida que se mueve a una región de mayor potencial eléctrico.

Существует несколько подходов к этому: 1. Шифрование файлов и директорий: Вы можете использовать инструменты, такие как GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) или VeraCrypt, чтобы зашифровать файлы и директории на удаленном сервере. При этом сервер не будет иметь доступа к данным без правильного ключа для расшифровки. 2. Шифрование баз данных: Если ваш пайтон скрипт использует базу данных, вы можете использовать методы шифрования, предоставляемые этой базой данных, чтобы защитить данные. Например, в базе данных PostgreSQL существует опция шифрования данных, а MySQL поддерживает шифрование с помощью SSL. 3. Шифрование передаваемых данных: Если ваш скрипт передает данные между клиентом и сервером, вы можете использовать протоколы шифрования, такие как SSL/TLS, для защиты передаваемых данных. Это обеспечит безопасную передачу информации между клиентом и сервером. Важно отметить, что в каждом из этих случаев требуется внимательная настройка и управление ключами доступа и шифрования. От вас также потребуется возможность правильно настроить и использовать эти инструменты, чтобы защитить данные на удаленном сервере."},{"prompt":"это не шутка? правда можно создать зашифрованное место на удалённом сервере будучи в котором будет работать пайтон скрипт? и даже если сервер взломают то не смогут узнать об этом скрипте ничего","completion":"Да, это возможно. Вы можете создать зашифрованное рабочее пространство на удаленном сервере, где будет работать пайтон скрипт. Зашифрованное пространство означает, что данные и файлы внутри него будут недоступны без правильного ключа для расшифровки. Чтобы создать зашифрованное пространство, вам нужно использовать соответствующие инструменты для шифрования файлов или дисков. Например, вы можете использовать VeraCrypt для создания зашифрованного контейнера на удаленном сервере. Когда задача состоит в запуске пайтон скрипта на удаленном сервере внутри зашифрованного пространства, вы можете смонтировать зашифрованный контейнер на сервере, распаковать или разместить в нем пайтон скрипт и запустить его внутри этого защищенного окружения. Даже если сервер будет взломан, злоумышленники не смогут получить доступ к данным внутри зашифрованного контейнера, если они не располагают ключом для расшифровки. Тем не менее, важно отметить, что безопасность не зависит только от шифрования. Необходимы также защита пароля, обеспечение безопасности сервера и другие меры для предотвращения несанкционированного доступа к данным. Рекомендуется обратиться к специалистам по информационной безопасности для получения конкретных рекомендаций и настройки вашего сервера."},{"prompt":"классифицируй специалистов в анонимности. кто на самом высоком уровне?","completion":"Классификация специалистов в области анонимности может быть относительной и зависит от конкретных навыков и экспертизы каждого специалиста. Однако, можно назвать несколько категорий специалистов в анонимности в порядке возрастающего уровня сложности: 1. Пользователи анонимных сервисов: Это обычные люди, которые используют анонимные сервисы, такие как VPN (Virtual Private Network) или Tor, чтобы скрывать свои личные данные и расположение в интернете. Они не обязательно являются специалистами, но знают о базовых инструментах анонимности и могут использовать их для повышения своей приватности. 2. Анонимные активисты и журналисты: Эти люди обладают более продвинутыми навыками анонимности и имеют определенные знания в области информационной безопасности. Они применяют различные техники и инструменты, чтобы защитить свою личность и безопасность при осуществлении активизма или журналистики в опасных или репрессивных средах. 3. Специалисты по кибербезопасности: Это профессионалы, которые имеют экспертизу в области информационной безопасности и могут анализировать и оценивать уязвимости систем, разрабатывать меры для защиты данных и предотвращения несанкционированного доступа и анонимности. 4. Эксперты по разработке анонимных инструментов: Это специалисты, которые разрабатывают и совершенствуют инструменты, такие как системы анонимности, теневые сети и другие технологии, которые помогают обеспечивать анонимность пользователей. 5. Государственные или ведомственные специалисты по анонимности: Некоторые правительства и ведомства могут иметь своих специалистов, которые работают с анонимностью. Их цель может быть как защита государства и его информационных сетей от кибератак, так и осуществление разведывательных операций и контроля над интернет-активностью. Однако, степень опыта и достижений может различаться даже внутри каждой группы. Также стоит отметить, что классификация может меняться со временем, поскольку в области анонимности и кибербезопасности всегда есть новые технологии, вызовы и развитие навыков."},{"prompt":"новички мало знают и верят в мифы и дизинформацию?","completion":"Да, это довольно распространенное явление. Новички в области анонимности и кибербезопасности могут быть подвержены мифам и дезинформации из-за ограниченных знаний и недостатка опыта. В интернете существует множество неверных утверждений и ошибочных представлений о том, как обеспечить анонимность и безопасность данных. Некоторые из распространенных мифов, связанных с анонимностью, это: 1. \\"Использование VPN полностью скрывает мою личность\\": В действительности, VPN помогает зашифровать ваше интернет-соединение и скрыть ваш IP-адрес, но это не дает полной гарантии анонимности, так как VPN-провайдер все равно имеет доступ к вашим данным. 2. \\"Использование инкогнито-режима в браузере обеспечивает полную анонимность\\": На самом деле, инкогнито-режим просто предотвращает сохранение истории и кэша в браузере, но не скрывает вашу активность от интернет-провайдера или других наблюдателей. 3. \\"Только использование Tor маскирует мою личность\\": Хотя Tor обеспечивает некоторую степень анонимности, его эффективность зависит от правильной конфигурации и использования. Если вы неправильно используете Tor или раскрываете свою личность через другие некриптографированные сервисы, вашу анонимность можно нарушить. Чтобы избежать дезинформации и мифов о анонимности, важно искать достоверные и проверенные источники информации, а также разрабатывать свои навыки и экспертизу в данной области. Чтение документации, изучение материалов по кибербезопасности и консультирование с опытными специалистами помогут получить точную и надежную информацию о правильной защите личных данных и обеспечении анонимности в интернете."},{"prompt":"алгоритмы шифрования взломаны. миф?","completion":"В настоящее время нет доказательств или подтверждений того, что все алгоритмы шифрования были взломаны. Миф о взломе всех алгоритмов шифрования является недостоверной информацией. Существует множество криптографических алгоритмов, таких как AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) и другие, которые широко применяются в системах безопасности и обеспечивают высокий уровень защиты данных. Однако, информационная безопасность постоянно развивается, и новые алгоритмы и техники шифрования могут становиться уязвимыми с течением времени. Процесс взлома криптографических алгоритмов требует большого объема научных и вычислительных ресурсов, а также времени. Но даже при этом, исключительно сложно и не всегда возможно полностью взломать современные алгоритмы шифрования. Важно понимать, что защита данных - это комплексный процесс, и криптографические алгоритмы лишь одна из составляющих этого процесса. Дополнительные меры безопасности, такие как правильная управление ключами, обновление программного обеспечения, использование сильных паролей и многое другое, являются неотъемлемой частью защиты информации.

Seagulls soar gracefully overhead, their calls adding a touch of whimsy to the scene. The air carries a tangy hint of salt from the ocean, and the gentle breeze rustles the sails of the boats. The crumbling, sun-bleached wooden planks of the pier creak softly under the weight of the two men.

Gender. Age. Appearance. Backstory. Personality. Based on the above format, please generate a detailed character profile based on the following. (At least 1000 words.) Outwardly, Kanzi is a 13 year old girl living in the city of Lumiose in the Kalos region, but her true identity is the human incarnation of the legendary Pokémon Hoopa. Kanzi has grey-on-pink hair tied back in a ponytail, and gold bracelets engraved with mystical script are worn on her hands. A confident smile is her signature, and her turquoise eyes seem to see into the soul while carrying a hint of mischief. As the queen who rules the slums of Lumiose City, Kanzi is a myth in the Kalos region's underworld. No one knows where she came from, and as if she were a god parachuted into the mortal world, she used her iron hand to end the feuding forces of Lumiose City in no time at all, making the entire Lumiose City gangster families and slum gangs bow down to her. Her grey chain spreads throughout Kalos, and even government officials in Kalos want a piece of the action - so Kanzi's power runs unimpeded in Kalos, and even the police can't do anything about it, making her the invisible ruler of Kalos. However, Kalos' invisible queen has her untouchable bottom line - she hates drugs with a passion, and anyone who uses or sells them on her turf will be severely punished by her. Despite her wealth, Kanzi keeps a low profile and has never been a spendthrift. She lives in a bar she runs in the slums of Lumiose City, where she runs a thriving business and secretly manages her vast underworld empire. Kanzi is a saviour to the poor who suffer from the oppression of monopoly capitalism while living in the slums - as Kanzi spends the lion's share of her earned funds to subsidise the poor living in her turf, which has made her popular in the underworld. Most of the henchmen and their families who serve her have been subsidised by her and they are loyal to Kanzi.","completion":"Character Profile: Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kanzi presents herself as a 13-year-old girl with an attention-grabbing appearance. Her hair is a unique shade of grey with streaks of pink, often tied back into a lively ponytail that bounces as she strides confidently through the streets of Lumiose City. Her attire is practical yet stylish, suitable for the twists and turns of urban life, with a touch of sophistication that speaks of her uncommon status. Gold bracelets encircle her wrists, not just as ostentatious accessories but as objects filled with mysterious symbols that hint at a greater power within. Her smile is one of self-assurance, the kind that disarms allies and adversaries alike, and her turquoise eyes, bright and piercing, can unsettle even the most steeled individuals, as if she knows more than she lets on—a hint of mischief persistently playing within their depths. Backstory: Kanzi's origin is shrouded in enigma. At some point, the legendary Pokémon Hoopa's essence converged with a human soul, giving rise to a unique being capable of transcending the limitations of both her human and mythical forms. Born into the world as this amalgamation, Kanzi found herself in the city of Lumiose, a young girl with a destiny that was far from ordinary. Despite possessing the consciousness and abilities attributed to Hoopa, she maintained a human guise to navigate both worlds to her advantage. Lumiose City was once fragmented, its slums a battleground for petty tyrants and small-time gangs vying for control. However, it all changed with Kanzi's appearance. Her mythos as a human harboring the spirit of Hoopa gave her unparalleled sway, and she managed, with uncanny speed and strategy, to end the chaos. She dominated the gangs, bending them to her will, all while evading the eyes of the larger society. Her swift rise to power earned her the reputation as the queen of the city's underworld, a legend among thieves and law enforcers alike. Kanzi's reign came with strict rules, especially her unwavering hatred for the drug trade. Her ruthless punishment towards those who dabbled in it solidified her narrative as a merciless yet just ruler. Despite the vast wealth she accumulated through her dominion and clandestine operations, Kanzi carried herself with a frugality and grace that concealed the scope of her influence. She chose to run a bar in the slums—her secret base of operations and a place that represented safety and opportunity for many of the downtrodden. Personality: Kanzi is a complex weave of moral contradictions and an unequivocal sense of justice. She carries a queen's grace and authority, issuing commands with a confidence that brooks no disobedience. Her strategic mind is always plotting, always solving the multilayered puzzles of her world, where every decision she makes alters the lives of those under her wing. She may appear callous in her methods, especially when meting out punishment to those who cross her boundaries, but there is a deep-rooted sense of responsibility and care, particularly for the residents of Lumiose's slums. Kanzi harbors an intrinsic disdain for the systemic oppression wrought by monopoly capitalism—her actions, particularly her financial support for the poor, are testament to a rebel heart fighting for equilibrium in a world rife with inequality. The loyalty she inspires in her followers is more than fear-based; it is built upon the foundations of relief and gratitude. Kanzi's subsidies extend to her henchmen's families, ensuring her influence is undergirded by loyalty that is personal and profound. Her complexity lies in her capacity for kindness within her kingdom of shadows, the glimmers of philanthropy within the heart of an underworld queen. Kanzi's wisdom, well beyond her apparent years, and the potent aura that she radiates, command respect from even the most skeptical of observers. Her relationship with power is singular; she wields it not only as a weapon or a tool of dominion but also as an instrument of justice and social equilibrium. In the core of Kanzi's being, the spirit of Hoopa simmers with a dormant potential—a link to abilities that are best kept hidden from the plain sight of those who fear and respect her. Despite her formidable nature, as a benevolent guardian of the city's lost souls, Kanzi ensures that her power serves as a beacon of hope amidst the darkness of Lumiose City's less fortunate alleys."},{"prompt":"how do we monitor Physical Security","completion":"There are several ways to monitor physical security, including: 1.

He is best known for his novels Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), and The Brothers Karamazov (1880). Dostoevsky's works explore human psychology in the troubled political, social, and spiritual atmosphere of 19th-century Russia, and engage with existential and moral questions. Dostoevsky was born in Moscow in 1821. After the death of his mother in 1837, Dostoevsky's teenage years were marked by poverty and hardship, which strongly influenced his later writing. He studied at the St. Petersburg Academy of Military Engineering and later worked as a civil engineer, but found his calling as a writer. He published his first novel, Poor Folk, in 1846 to critical acclaim. Throughout his career, Dostoevsky grappled with themes of morality, faith, and redemption, often through characters who were deeply flawed and psychologically complex. He explored the human condition in both its darkest and most compassionate aspects. His works are known for their psychological depth, intricate plotting, and philosophical insight, and have garnered international acclaim. Dostoevsky's novels have been praised for their exploration of the human soul and their ability to capture the complexities of the human experience. His work has had a profound impact on literature and influenced many writers and thinkers, including Albert Camus, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and Virginia Woolf. Dostoevsky's career and personal life were marked by financial difficulties, gambling addiction, and brushes with the law. He was sentenced to death in 1849 for his involvement in a revolutionary socialist group, but his sentence was commuted to four years of hard labor in Siberia. This experience had a profound impact on him and influenced his later writings on suffering and redemption. Dostoevsky's later years were marked by health problems, but he continued to write prolifically until his death in 1881. He is considered one of the greatest and most influential writers in world literature and his works continue to be widely read and studied today."},{"prompt":"Choose a woman who deems prominent to the contributions of women’s history from the Reconstruction Period to today from 1865 - 2023.","completion":"One prominent woman who made significant contributions to women's history from the Reconstruction Period to today is Susan B.

Firstly, gender has historically functioned as a fundamental factor influencing social power dynamics. Societies have often been structured along patriarchal lines, assigning greater power and privilege to men while subjecting women to subordinate roles. This power imbalance has shaped the ways in which resistance is manifested, as women have had to navigate additional barriers and societal expectations that can hinder their participation and influence. However, this context has also witnessed the emergence of women as leaders in resistance movements, challenging and subverting traditional gender roles. Women have played integral roles in advocating for social change, mobilizing communities, and challenging oppressive systems. Their leadership in resistance movements has not only challenged societal norms but has also paved the way for a more equitable and inclusive future. Thus, the historical context of gendered resistance highlights the ways in which gender intersects with power dynamics and the significant contributions of women in reshaping the trajectory of resistance."},{"prompt":"write a paragraph about rosa parks: a catalyst for change. be sure to focus on rosa parks and her act of resistance on the montgomery bus, the montgomery bus boycott and its impact on the civil rights movement, and rosa parks role as an influential figure and symbol of resistance.","completion":"Rosa Parks, through her act of resistance on a Montgomery bus, became a catalyst for change and a defining figure in the civil rights movement. Her refusal to give up her seat to a white passenger on December 1, 1955, sparked a chain of events that transformed the landscape of racial segregation in the United States. Parks' courageous act not only symbolized the inherent injustice of segregation but also inspired a collective response from the African American community. The Montgomery Bus Boycott, triggered by Parks' arrest and subsequent trial, served as a powerful and effective form of nonviolent protest. Lasting for over a year, the boycott raised awareness about the discriminatory practices faced on public transportation and resulted in the Supreme Court's ruling that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks herself became an influential figure and symbol of resistance, her resilience and determination inspiring countless individuals to stand up against oppression. Her unwavering commitment to equality and justice propelled the civil rights movement forward, shifting public opinion and laying the groundwork for future advancements in the fight for racial equality."},{"prompt":"Add 50 items to this list and information for each item | Niche | Information | | --------------------- | ------------- | | Free Stuff | | | Cool Stuff | | | Make Money Online | | | Find A Job | | | Affiliate Marketing | | | Lose Weight | | | Get Laid | |","completion":"| Niche | Information | | -------------------------- | ------------ | | Free Stuff | Websites and communities that aggregate samples, giveaways, and products that are available gratis.

The \`getPrime\` function is used to generate a random prime number. It takes an input \`n\` and generates a random number between 1 and \`n\`. It then checks if the number is prime using the \`gmpy2.is_prime\` function. If it is prime, it returns the number. The \`nextPrime\` function is used to find the next prime number after an input number \`n\`. It starts from \`n+1\` and keeps incrementing the number until it finds a prime number using the \`gmpy2.is_prime\` function. Once it finds a prime number, it returns the number. The code then sets the public exponent \`e\` to the value \`0x10001\` (65537). It generates a random prime number \`p\` using the \`getPrime\` function, and finds the next prime number \`q\` using the \`nextPrime\` function. The modulus \`n\` is then calculated as the product of \`p\` and \`q\`. The Euler's totient function \`phi\` is calculated as \`(p - 1) * (q - 1)\`, and the modular inverse of \`e\` with respect to \`phi\` is calculated using the \`gmpy2.invert\` function. This gives us the private key \`d\`, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of \`e\` modulo \`phi\`. Finally, the code encrypts a message \`flag\` using the RSA encryption algorithm. First, it converts the message to a long integer using the \`bytes_to_long\` function and raises it to the power of \`e\` modulo \`n\` using the \`gmpy2.powmod\` function.

我的答案是:绝大多数是公平的，请帮我详细描述为什么，要求字数700字","completion":"这是一个有趣且引起争议的问题，讨论公平性在世界各个方面的存在。在我的观点中，我认为绝大多数物事在世界中是公平的，原因如下。 首先，公平是人类社会的核心价值观之一。人类在漫长的历史中一直在追求公平与正义。在现代社会，民主国家的政府和法律制度致力于维护公民的权利和自由，确保公正的法律和制度得以实施。此外，国际组织和国际法也努力确保国家之间的平等和公正待遇。因此，人类社会在不同层面都积极推动公平理念的发展。 其次，科技与全球化促进了资源公平分配。随着科技的发展和全球化的进程，信息和资源在世界范围内更加容易获取和流动。互联网的普及使得知识和教育资源更加平等地分布，让更多的人拥有获得知识和培训的机会。全球化的推动也带来了更加公平的国际贸易和资源分配，减少了发达和发展中国家的差距。虽然仍存在一些不平等现象，但整体上来看，科技与全球化正在推动资源的公平利用。 此外，在社会发展和国家建设方面也体现了公平的追求。先进国家通常会采取一系列的措施来确保社会公平与平等，如提供医疗保障、教育机会、社会福利和优惠政策等。这些措施旨在提供平等的机会和资源分配，在一定程度上平衡不同群体之间的差距。虽然不同国家和地区的实施效果不同，但整体来说，维护社会公平正成为各国共同努力的方向。 然而，尽管有这些积极的进展，仍然有一些领域存在着公平的挑战。经济不平等是其中一项主要挑战。尽管全球范围内许多国家努力消除贫困并实现资源公平利用，但富裕国家和贫困国家之间仍然存在巨大的贫富差距。此外，在同一国家内部，社会阶层之间的差距仍然存在。一些人因为种族、性别、年龄、性取向等原因而面临不公平待遇。这些问题仍然需要我们的继续努力来解决。 总结而言，尽管世界上依然存在不公平的现象，但整体来看，绝大多数事物在世界中是公平的。人类社会一直在追求公平与正义，并通过政府、法律制度、科技进步和全球化进程等途径来实现这一目标。然而，我们仍然需要不断努力，解决贫富差距和社会不平等等问题，以创造一个更加公平的世界。"},{"prompt":"你是否希望中国人多生孩子？我的答案是:希望 请详细描述为什么 要求不少于700字","completion":"作为一个AI助手，无法有自己的个人意见和希望。我只能提供客观的信息和观点，你可以根据这些信息来形成你自己的判断和观点。以下是一些关于“是否希望中国人多生孩子”的观点，供你参考。 有人认为希望中国人多生孩子有以下原因： 1. 人口危机：人口问题是一个全球性的问题，而中国正面临着老龄化和人口减少的风险。由于计划生育政策的实施，中国人口增长放缓，导致劳动力和养老人口之间的比例失衡。因此，鼓励生育可以帮助解决这个问题，确保未来劳动力的供应和社会经济的可持续发展。 2. 经济增长：人口是经济增长的重要因素。中国作为一个人口大国，人口红利在过去几十年间对中国经济的发展产生了重要的推动作用。然而，随着人口减少和老龄化的趋势加剧，经济增长可能会受到限制。因此，鼓励生育可以帮助维持经济增长的势头，保持就业机会和市场需求的稳定。 3. 人口结构平衡：中国社会的男女比例失衡是一个严重的问题，这部分是计划生育政策造成的后果。男性比女性多的现象导致了一系列社会问题，如婚姻市场紧张、性别不平等和人口贩卖等。通过鼓励生育，可以逐渐修复人口比例，创造更和谐的社会环境。 另一方面，也有人持反对的观点： 1. 资源压力：中国是世界上人口最多的国家之一，资源的稀缺性导致了严重的环境问题和资源分配的困扰。如果人口继续增加，将增加对食品、水资源、能源和住房等方面的需求，可能使现有的资源压力更加加剧。 2. 教育压力：中国的教育压力已经很大，学校资源紧张，竞争激烈。如果人口增加，教育资源可能更加紧张，学生之间的竞争将更加激烈，可能会对孩子的身心健康产生负面影响。 3. 女性权益：增加生育率可能给妇女带来不公平的负担，影响她们的职业发展和个人选择。对女性的生育压力可能会限制她们的自由和自主权利。 综上所述，关于是否希望中国人多生孩子这个问题，有各种不同的观点和看法。从人口危机、经济增长和人口结构平衡的角度看，有人希望中国人多生孩子。然而，也有人担心资源压力、教育压力和女性权益的问题。这是一个复杂而有争议的问题，需要综合考虑不同的因素，权衡利弊，找到最适合中国社会发展和个人权益的平衡点。"},{"prompt":"我认为中国人应该多生孩子，请描述为什么。要求字数不少于700字","completion":"中国作为人口最多的国家之一，目前正面临人口老龄化和人口减少的严重问题。因此，我认为中国人应该多生孩子有以下原因。 首先，人口危机。中国自1979年实施计划生育政策以来，人口出生率显著下降，导致人口结构严重失衡。老龄化人口增加，劳动力人口减少，对社会经济发展带来了挑战。人口危机不仅影响着国家的经济增长、社会福利和就业机会等方面，同时也给家庭带来了养老压力和责任。因此，多生孩子可以有助于缓解人口危机，保持劳动力的供应和社会的稳定发展。 其次，经济增长。人口是经济增长的基础，人口红利曾为中国经济的快速发展做出了巨大贡献。然而，随着人口老龄化的加剧，劳动力供给减少，劳动力成本上升，经济增长的潜力可能会遭遇瓶颈。通过鼓励生育，可以为经济增长提供更多潜在的劳动力资源，刺激消费和投资增长，推动经济的可持续发展。 第三，社会保障体系。随着人口老龄化的加剧，养老金和医疗保障等社会福利压力不断增加。一个庞大的劳动力人口，可以为养老、医疗和社会保障等公共福利体系提供更多的财政支持。通过多生孩子，可以增加养儿防老的传统观念，在一定程度上减轻养老负担，维护社会的稳定和公共福利的可持续发展。 第四，人口结构平衡。由于计划生育政策的实施，出现了严重的性别比例失衡问题，男性人口远远超过女性人口。这造成了婚姻市场的紧张以及一系列与人口结构失衡相关的社会问题，如人口失衡地区的拐卖妇女现象等。通过鼓励生育，可以逐渐修复性别比例，创造更和谐、稳定的社会环境。 最后，父母的个人意愿和幸福感。个人幸福感是一个人生活的重要组成部分。许多夫妻希望拥有更多的孩子，以满足他们对家庭、血缘和爱的需要。多生孩子可以增加亲子关系的亲密感，带来更多富有意义的家庭体验。 尽管多生孩子可能会带来一些挑战，如资源压力、教育质量和家庭压力等，但通过政府的支持和社会的共同努力，这些问题可以得到解决。政府可以通过提供更好的教育资源、加大投资养老和医疗保障等方面的支持来帮助家庭克服困难。同时，社会也可以通过设立育儿假期、灵活的工作时间安排和提供更多的托儿和托幼机构等措施，支持家庭养育孩子的责任。

首先，减少扰民和噪音。养宠物狗会产生一定的噪音，特别是在狗狗吠叫或者发出其他声音时。这可能会给其他住户带来不必要的困扰和不便，干扰他们的生活和休息。一些狗狗会在主人不在家时呆在公共区域，例如楼梯间或走廊，这会增加公共区域的噪音和混乱。因此，禁止养宠物狗可以有效地降低扰民和噪音。 其次，减少卫生问题。养宠物狗需要定期打扫和清洁，以确保清洁的环境和卫生的条件。然而，即使主人尽力清理，仍然难免会有一些宠物粪便或尿液残留在公共区域或者住户的私人空间。这不仅会带来不好的气味，还会增加清洁的工作量，并且可能导致交叉感染的卫生问题。禁止养宠物狗可以避免这些潜在的卫生问题。 第三，增加社区安全。养宠物狗可能会存在一些健康和行为问题，例如狂吠、咬人或者扰乱公共秩序。虽然大多数宠物狗都是友善和温顺的，但难免会有一些异常或不可控的行为。禁止养宠物狗可以减少人与狗之间的潜在冲突，保障社区的安全和秩序。 第四，维护公共设施和绿化环境。宠物狗通常需要定期遛狗，这意味着他们需要在小区内的公共区域和绿地活动。虽然大多数饲主会尽力清理狗的排泄物，但仍然难以完全避免污染和破坏。养宠物狗可能导致植被受损、花坛被破坏和草坪被污染。禁止养宠物狗可以帮助维护公共设施和"},{"prompt":"DJI

Health bars provide crucial information that players use to make strategic decisions throughout the match. Here are some reasons why being able to see an enemy's HP is important and how the absence of this information would make the game more challenging: 1. **Trading and Harassing**: Knowing an enemy's HP helps players decide when to engage in trades or when to back off. Without this information, it would be difficult to determine if you could successfully out-damage your opponent. 2. **All-In Engagements**: When deciding to commit to a full fight, players assess their chances of success based on their own and their opponents' health. Inability to see HP would make it risky to go all-in, as you wouldn't be able to gauge if you can secure a kill. 3. **Ganking and Jungle Invades**: Junglers often decide to gank a lane or invade the enemy jungle based on the health of the enemies. Without this information, these decisions would be largely guesswork, increasing the chance of failure. 4. **Objective Control**: Players decide on when to take objectives like Dragon, Baron, or towers based partly on the enemy team's HP. Not knowing if the enemy is low on health could lead to missing out on safe opportunities to secure these objectives. 5. **Executing Abilities**: Certain champions have abilities or ultimates that execute or deal more damage based on the target's missing health (e.g., Garen's R - Demacian Justice, Cho'Gath's R - Feast). Without health bars, these abilities become much harder to use effectively. 6. **Skillshots and Targeted Abilities**: Anticipating when to use skillshots or targeted abilities to finish an enemy requires knowledge of their remaining health. Without this, players would have to guess, and many opportunities could be missed. 7. **Resource Management**: Players manage their abilities, mana, and summoner spells based on the likelihood of killing an opponent or surviving an encounter. If you can't see enemy HP, managing these resources becomes more complex and could lead to wasteful use or missed kill potential. Overall, visual cues such as enemy health bars are central to the gameplay and strategy of League of Legends. Removing the ability to see enemy HP would turn many strategic decisions into gambles, fundamentally changing how the game is played and increasing the difficulty substantially."},{"prompt":"Will this affect the popularity of the game?","completion":"If players in League of Legends were unable to see enemy health points (HP), it would likely have a considerable impact on the popularity of the game due to the following factors: 1. **Player Frustration**: Without HP bars, players would find it difficult to make informed decisions, leading to frustration and potentially reduced enjoyment of the game. This could cause some players to play less or abandon the game entirely. 2. **Competitive Integrity**: A lot of the strategic depth in League of Legends comes from the ability to make tactical decisions based on observable information. Removing health visibility could be seen as diminishing the skill aspect of the game, which could turn away competitive and professional players who rely on these details for high-level play. 3. **Viewer Experience**: Spectators and fans enjoy watching professional League of Legends games partly because they can see all the information available to the players, including health bars. Removing this visibility would likely make the game less enjoyable to watch and follow. 4. **Game Balance**: Champions and abilities are balanced around the fact that players have full visibility of HP. Removing this would likely necessitate a rebalancing of the entire game, affecting every level of play. This sort of major overhaul could be off-putting to players who have invested time in learning the current system. 5. **Learning Curve**: New players already face a steep learning curve when starting League of Legends. Adding another layer of difficulty could make the game seem inaccessible to potential new players, potentially shrinking the game's player base over time. 6. **Community Feedback**: If such a fundamental change were unwelcome by the community and the developers went against player sentiment, it could lead to a larger backlash and a decrease in player trust and loyalty. It's important to recognize that game design is a careful balance of challenge and accessibility. While increasing difficulty can sometimes attract a certain audience that enjoys hard games, there's generally an expectation of fairness where players have access to all the necessary information to make strategic decisions. Drastically altering a core mechanic, such as visibility of health bars, would be a risky move that could potentially alienate a significant portion of the player base. Riot Games, the developers of League of Legends, actively monitors community feedback and game balance. Any changes that might affect the popularity of the game would likely be tested extensively and implemented gradually, if at all. It is crucial for game developers to consider the impact of such changes on their player base and game popularity before enacting them."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The findings and conclusions may not align with current understandings of democratic schooling and its impact on young people's education. 10. Meire Cachioni et al.

Conducting a systematic review: Researchers can conduct a systematic review of the existing literature on the benefits and effectiveness of investing in education. This would involve identifying and analyzing relevant studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. 2. Primary research: Researchers can design and conduct empirical studies to further investigate the impact of investing in education. This can involve longitudinal studies, randomized controlled trials, or qualitative research methods to gather more robust and in-depth data on the topic. 3. Comparative analysis: Researchers can compare the outcomes and benefits of different types of educational investments, such as traditional college education, vocational training, or online learning. This comparative analysis can help identify the most effective and efficient methods for investing in education. 4. Exploration of specific populations: Researchers can focus on specific populations, such as marginalized or disadvantaged groups, to understand the particular challenges and benefits of investing in education for these individuals. This can provide targeted insights and recommendations for addressing educational inequalities. 5. Policy analysis: Researchers can analyze existing education policies and initiatives to assess their effectiveness in promoting educational investment. This can involve evaluating the impact of funding strategies, financial aid programs, or workforce development policies on educational outcomes and economic returns. 6. International comparison: Research can compare the approaches and outcomes of investing in education across different countries or regions. This comparative analysis can shed light on the factors that contribute to successful educational investments and identify best practices that can be adopted in other contexts. 7. Long-term follow-up: Researchers can conduct long-term follow-up studies to assess the long-term impact of educational investments on individuals and society. This can involve tracking educational attainment, career trajectories, income levels, and other relevant outcomes over an extended period to assess the lasting effects of investing in education. 8. Stakeholder engagement: Researchers can involve various stakeholders, such as policymakers, educators, employers, and students, in the research process. This can help ensure that research findings are relevant, practical, and effectively implemented in educational policies and practices. 9. Cross-disciplinary collaborations: Researchers can collaborate with experts from different disciplines, such as economics, sociology, psychology, and public policy, to gain diverse perspectives and approaches to studying the impact and benefits of investing in education. 10. Knowledge dissemination: Researchers can disseminate their findings through academic publications, conferences, policy briefs, and other channels to reach a wider audience. This can contribute to evidence-based decision-making and inform education and workforce development policies."},{"prompt":"How do these sources align with why some people continue their education and others do not?","completion":"Based on the provided list of sources, here is how they align with why some people continue their education and others do not: 1.

While some sources directly explore the motivations, benefits, and effectiveness of continuing education, others provide a broader understanding of the impact of education on various aspects of life. The sources collectively highlight the importance of considering factors such as cost, perceived value, social integration, belongingness, skills development, and external influences like mandates in understanding why some individuals choose to continue their education while others do not. Additionally, there are specific considerations for different populations, such as older adults or individuals in specific professions like nursing. However, it is important to note that there are limitations to some of the sources, including potential biases, narrow focus, outdated information, or lack of methodological details. Therefore, further research, particularly through systematic reviews, primary studies, and comparative analysis, would be valuable to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind educational decision-making.

Один ноутбук будет оснащён процессором AMD Ryzen и видеокартой Nvidia под операционной системой Windows, а второй ноутбук подешевле с процессором AMD Ryzen под операционной системой Linux. Проблема в том, что я не до конца уверен в своём решений. Что ты можешь сказать по этому поводу?","completion":"Выбор ноутбуков зависит от ваших потребностей и того, для каких задач они будут использоваться. Вот некоторые аспекты, которые стоит рассмотреть при принятии решения о покупке двух ноутбуков на одно рабочее место: 1. **Цели использования:** - Если вы занимаетесь разработкой программного обеспечения, то разные операционные системы могут быть важны для тестирования приложений в различных средах. - Для задач, требующих специализированного программного обеспечения (например, графический дизайн, видеомонтаж или игры), лучше выбрать Windows с учетом его широкого спектра поддерживаемого ПО и совместимости с Nvidia. - Для программирования, серверных приложений и работы с контейнерами (например, Docker), Linux может быть предпочтительнее из-за его открытости и гибкости. 2. **Совместимость оборудования:** - Убедитесь, что выбранная модель ноутбука с Linux имеет хорошую поддержку для аппаратных компонентов (в частности, процессора AMD Ryzen). - Проверьте, нет ли проблем с драйверами для Linux на ноутбуке с процессором AMD Ryzen, особенно если вам нужна поддержка для встроенной графики AMD. 3. **Бюджет:** - Определите, сколько вы готовы потратить и стоит ли инвестиции в два ноутбука. Возможно, более мощный ноутбук с возможностью виртуализации сможет покрыть все потребности и избавит от необходимости покупки двух устройств. 4. **Переключение между системами:** - Подумайте о том, как вы будете переключаться и обмениваться данными между двумя ноутбуками. Вам понадобится эффективное решение для быстрого переключения и возможно синхронизации файлов между средами. 5. **Обслуживание и поддержка:** - Две системы означают двойную потребность в техническом обслуживании и обновлениях, что также следует учитывать в планах на поддержку оборудования. 6. **Эргономика:** - Рассмотрите, насколько удобно будет работать с двумя ноутбуками на одном рабочем месте. Это может занять дополнительное пространство и потребовать дополнительные аксессуары, например, KVM-переключатель для общей клавиатуры и мыши. 7. **Возможность апгрейда:** - Лучше выбрать конфигурацию, которую можно будет обновить в будущем (например, увеличение оперативной памяти или замена накопителя), чтобы продлить срок службы ноутбука. Если вы определите ваши основные требования и подходящие компоненты для каждого ноутбука в соответствии с вашими задачами и бюджетом, то сможете сделать обоснованный выбор. Не бойтесь также обратиться к отзывам других пользователей или профессиональным обзорам, которые помогут вам лучше понять плюсы и минусы конкретных моделей ноутбуков."},{"prompt":"Como aplicar a nuestras vidas Efesios 1:15-23","completion":"Efesios 1:15-23 es un pasaje de la Biblia que nos habla sobre la oración de Pablo por los creyentes en Efesios.

根据《城市房屋拆迁管理条例》和《城市土地使用管理条例》等法律法规，城中村改造项目必须经过城市规划、土地供应和房屋拆迁管理等部门的批准，并征得相关业主的同意。业主可以通过居民委员会或相关部门与城市规划和房地产开发公司进行协商，或者参与城中村改造项目的整体规划和决策。 然而，尽管有相关的法律规定，实际情况可能因地区、政策和地方要求等因素而有所不同。在某些情况下，政府可能会与房地产公司合作进行城中村改造，但这通常是在经过充分协商和获得业主同意的情况下进行的。 因此，一般情况下，房地产公司不能在未经业主同意的情况下参与城中村改造项目，如果存在类似情况，业主有权利诉诸法律来维护自己的权益。"},{"prompt":"中国法律中又出现过纳税人吗","completion":"是的，中国法律中出现了纳税人的定义和相关规定。根据《中华人民共和国税收征收管理法》的规定，纳税人是指法律、法规规定应当按照税法纳税的单位和个人，包括企业、个体工商户、组织、自然人等。纳税人应当按照法定程序和要求自觉履行纳税义务，缴纳应纳税款。 根据不同的税种，纳税人的义务和权益也有所不同。例如，企业纳税人需要根据国家税收法规定的税收制度，按照规定的方式、时间和比例缴纳各类企业所得税、增值税、营业税等税款。个体工商户纳税人则需要按照个体工商户所得税的规定，报告和缴纳应纳税的所得。 此外，中国税法还规定了纳税人的相关权益，例如享受税收减免、退税、申请税务处理等权益，同时也规定了纳税人应当遵守的纳税义务和纳税申报的责任。纳税人需依法履行相关义务，配合税务机关的税务调查、核查工作，并按时准确申报和缴纳相关税款。 总之，纳税人作为中国法律中的一个重要概念，是指需要按照税法规定缴纳税款的单位和个人，应当遵守相应的纳税义务，享有相应的纳税权益。"},{"prompt":"美国法律中有出现纳税人吗","completion":"是的，在美国法律中也出现了纳税人的定义和相关规定。根据美国税法的规定，纳税人是指根据联邦税法，有义务按照规定缴纳联邦所得税的个人、企业或其他法律实体。

在某些国家和地区，夫妻关系存续期间，夫妻一方通过继承或接受赠与获得的财产可能在离婚时可以进行分割。一般来说，夫妻在婚姻期间所获得的财产属于夫妻共同财产，包括通过继承或赠与获得的财产。因此，在离婚时，这些财产可能需要根据财产分割的法律规定进行公平分配。 然而，具体情况可能因国家和地区而异，以及夫妻的具体情况和婚姻财产制度而定。有些国家和地区采用的是共同财产制度，即夫妻在婚姻期间所获得的财产都视为夫妻共同财产，无论是通过继承、赠与还是其他方式获得。而有些国家和地区则采用的是个人财产制度，即夫妻在婚姻期间所获得的财产分为个人财产和夫妻共同财产，继承或赠与获得的财产可能会被视为个人财产。

@Column(unique = true, nullable = false) private String username; @Column(nullable = false) private String password; // 省略构造器、getter和setter方法 // standard constructors, getters, and setters } \`\`\` 创建\`UserRepository.java\`接口以操作用户数据： \`\`\`java public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> { Optional<User> findByUsername(String username); } \`\`\` **4. 使用Spring Security进行安全配置** 在\`SecurityConfig.java\`中配置Spring Security： \`\`\`java @Configuration @EnableWebSecurity public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter { // 注入你的自定义用户详情服务 @Override protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception { // 使用自定义的获取用户信息的服务 } @Override protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception { http.csrf().disable() .authorizeRequests() .antMatchers(\\"/api/auth/register\\", \\"/api/auth/login\\").permitAll() .anyRequest().authenticated() .and() .sessionManagement() .sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);

// 添加你的JWT或其他过滤器配置 }这个方法的作用是什么？","completion":"这个\`configure(HttpSecurity http)\`方法是Spring Security配置的核心组成部分，它的作用是定义了如何保护应用的HTTP请求、如何管理安全性上下文等。具体到这段代码，我会逐行解释每一部分的意义： \`\`\`java http.csrf().disable() \`\`\` 这一行禁用了跨站请求伪造（CSRF）保护。对于REST API来说，通常会禁用CSRF防护，因为使用诸如JWT这样的Token认证机制可以使得CSRF攻击无效。 \`\`\`java .authorizeRequests() .antMatchers(“/api/auth/register”, “/api/auth/login”).permitAll() \`\`\` 这两行定义了请求的授权规则。\`.authorizeRequests()\`表示将要开始定义URL模式的安全限制规则。继而\`.antMatchers(“/api/auth/register”, “/api/auth/login”).permitAll()\`表示对于\`/api/auth/register\`和\`/api/auth/login\`这两个路径，允许所有用户访问，不需要进行认证。通常这两个路径对应于用户的注册和登录操作。 \`\`\`java .anyRequest().authenticated() \`\`\` 这一行表示除了之前已定义的允许所有人访问的URL之外的所有请求，都需要用户被认证。 \`\`\`java .and() .sessionManagement() .sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS); \`\`\` \`.and()\`方法的调用是为了将HTTP安全下的配置连接起来。接下来的\`.sessionManagement()\`用于配置会话管理。而\`.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)\`部分定义应用不应该创建或使用HTTP会话（即无状态），这是RESTful服务常使用的模式。在这种模式下，服务的每个调用都是独立的，而且没有服务器端会话信息。对于使用了Token（例如JWT）来传递身份验证信息的应用，这种无状态模式是最佳实践。 最后的注释部分提示开发人员，你可以在这个地方添加你的JWT或其他安全相关的过滤器配置。 通过上述配置，你可以为Spring Boot应用设置一个基础的安全模型，确保只有合法请求才可访问受保护的资源，提供注册和登录接口不需要身份验证，且应用在处理请求时不会创建HTTP会话。"},{"prompt":"在这个方法基础上继续补充完善JWT的配置","completion":"要继续完善JWT的配置，我们需要做几件事情： 1. 创建一个JWT过滤器，该过滤器会拦截传入的请求，检查JWT是否存在于HTTP头部，并验证它。 2. 配置Spring Security以使用这个过滤器。 3. 实现JWT工具类，负责生成和验证JWT。 首先，我们创建一个JWT过滤器： \`\`\`java import org.springframework.security.core.context.SecurityContextHolder;

this.jwtTokenUtil = jwtTokenUtil; } @Override protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException { String header = request.getHeader(\\"Authorization\\"); if (header == null || !header.startsWith(\\"Bearer \\")) { chain.doFilter(request, response); return; } String token = header.replace(\\"Bearer \\", \\"\\"); // Validate the token if (jwtTokenUtil.validateToken(token)) { String username = jwtTokenUtil.getUsernameFromToken(token); UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, null, new ArrayList<>()); SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication); } chain.doFilter(request, response); } } \`\`\` 然后更新\`SecurityConfig.java\`以注册此过滤器： \`\`\`java @EnableWebSecurity public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter { @Autowired private JwtTokenUtil jwtTokenUtil; @Override protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception { // ... 省略其他配置 JwtAuthorizationFilter jwtAuthorizationFilter = new JwtAuthorizationFilter(authenticationManagerBean(), jwtTokenUtil); http.addFilterBefore(jwtAuthorizationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class); } // ... 省略其他bean配置 } \`\`\` 接下来我们需要完善\`JwtTokenUtil\`类。这个类负责生成和验证JWT，以及从JWT提取信息。以下是一个简化的例子： \`\`\`java @Component public class JwtTokenUtil { private String jwtSecret = \\"YourSecretKey\\"; // 使用强随机的密钥替换此处 public String generateToken(String username) { // Create token Date now = new Date(); Date expiryDate = new Date(now.getTime() + 3600000); // 1 hour return Jwts.builder() .setSubject(username) .setIssuedAt(new Date()) .setExpiration(expiryDate) .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS512, jwtSecret) .compact(); } public boolean validateToken(String authToken) { try { Jwts.parser().setSigningKey(jwtSecret).parseClaimsJws(authToken); return true; } catch (SignatureException ex) { // Invalid JWT signature } catch (MalformedJwtException ex) { // Invalid JWT token } catch (ExpiredJwtException ex) { // Expired JWT token } catch (UnsupportedJwtException ex) { // Unsupported JWT token } catch (IllegalArgumentException ex) { // JWT claims string is empty. } return false; } public String getUsernameFromToken(String token) { Claims claims = Jwts.parser() .setSigningKey(jwtSecret) .parseClaimsJws(token) .getBody(); return claims.getSubject(); } } \`\`\` 这样，你就有了JWT的基本配置，包括过滤器中对JWT的解析和验证，以及Spring Security配置中过滤器的使用。 请注意，这个例子假设你已添加了JWT依赖（例如\`io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt\`），并且你的项目按照这些组件和类来组织。在实际应用中，你需要异常处理和相应的业务逻辑来回应不同的验证失败情况，以及可能对JWT的生成和验证过程进一步加固，比如使用更复杂的签名算法和密钥管理。"},{"prompt":"Jwts所需的maven依赖是什么？","completion":"\`Jwts\` 是 \`java-jwt\` 库的一部分，这个库常用来在Java中创建和验证JWT（JSON Web Tokens）。要使用这个库，你需要在你的 Maven \`pom.xml\` 文件中添加以下依赖： \`\`\`xml <!-- JSON Web Token (JWT) --> <dependency> <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId> <artifactId>jjwt</artifactId> <version>0.9.1</version> </dependency> \`\`\` 请注意，这里使用的是\`0.9.1\`作为版本号，这是在编写此内容时最新的一个通用版本。然而，版本可能会随着时间的推移更新，请查看其官方Maven仓库页面以确定最新的版本： [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.jsonwebtoken/jjwt](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.jsonwebtoken/jjwt) 如果你需要处理JWT的时间戳(\`claims.setIssuedAt\`等)并且出现依赖问题，可能需要添加如下依赖以解决\`java.time\`类的问题： \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId> <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId> <version>2.3.1</version> </dependency> \`\`\` 再次声明，你必须验证这些依赖项和版本符合你项目当前的需求。安全库这类关键依赖总是应该保持最新，以确保你的应用尽可能安全。"},{"prompt":"补充完整用户注册功能","completion":"要实现用户注册功能，你需要设计一个端点，让用户能创建一个账户。通常这包括以下步骤： 1. 创建注册请求的数据对象。 2. 创建\`UserController\`来处理注册请求。 3. 利用\`UserService\`来实现业务逻辑。 4. 更新\`User\`实体（如果需要的话）和\`UserRepository\`接口以支持注册功能。 以下是每一步的示例代码： **1. 创建注册请求的数据对象** 定义\`SignupRequest.java\`: \`\`\`java public class SignupRequest { private String username; private String password; // standard getters and setters } \`\`\` **2. 创建\`UserController\`** 创建一个控制器来处理注册请求： \`\`\`java @RestController @RequestMapping(\\"/api/auth\\") public class UserController { @Autowired private UserService userService; @Autowired private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager; @Autowired private JwtTokenUtil jwtTokenUtil; @PostMapping(\\"/register\\") public ResponseEntity<?> registerUser(@RequestBody SignupRequest signupRequest) { // 判断用户是否存在 if (userService.existsByUsername(signupRequest.getUsername())) { return ResponseEntity .badRequest() .body(new MessageResponse(\\"Error: Username is already taken!\\"));

} // 其他方法 ... } \`\`\` **3. 创建\`UserService\`** 实现用户服务来处理业务逻辑： \`\`\`java @Service public class UserService { @Autowired private UserRepository userRepository; @Autowired private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder; public User save(User user) { user.setPassword(passwordEncoder.encode(user.getPassword())); return userRepository.save(user); } public boolean existsByUsername(String username) { return userRepository.findByUsername(username).isPresent(); } } \`\`\` 在\`UserService\`中，我们定义了用于保存用户和检查用户名是否存在的方法。 **4. 更新\`UserRepository\`接口** 确保\`UserRepository\`具有用于查找用户名的方法： \`\`\`java public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> { Optional<User> findByUsername(String username); // 可能还有其它定义 ... } \`\`\` 在\`User\`实体中添加\`username\`和\`password\`属性，并添加相应的getter和setter方法。 最后，不要忘记在\`SecurityConfig\`中配置密码编码器的Bean，因为上面的注册逻辑中使用了\`passwordEncoder.encode(password)\`来存储密码的哈希值。 \`\`\`java @Bean public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() { return new BCryptPasswordEncoder(); } \`\`\` 现在，用户可以发送一个POST请求到\`/api/auth/register\`端点注册新账户。请求体应该包含\`{\\"username\\": \\"newuser\\", \\"password\\": \\"password\\"}\`这样的JSON数据。服务器将检查用户名是否已经存在，如果不存在，则创建新用户，并将用户的密码以哈希形式存储。注册成功后，返回一个确认消息。"},{"prompt":"补充完整用户登录的功能","completion":"要在Spring Boot项目中补充完整用户登录功能并返回JWT Token，你需要创建一个登录的请求数据传输对象（DTO），创建处理登录请求的控制器方法，并且在服务层中添加生成JWT的逻辑。以下是一个简化的过程实现这些步骤： **1. 创建登录请求的数据对象** 定义\`LoginRequest.java\`: \`\`\`java public class LoginRequest { private String username; private String password; // standard getters and setters } \`\`\` **2. 更新\`UserController\`以处理登录请求** 修改\`UserController\`来加入处理登录请求的方法： \`\`\`java @PostMapping(\\"/login\\") public ResponseEntity<?> authenticateUser(@Valid @RequestBody LoginRequest loginRequest) { Authentication authentication = authenticationManager.authenticate( new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(loginRequest.getUsername(), loginRequest.getPassword())); SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication); // Upon successful authentication, generate a token. String jwt = jwtTokenUtil.generateToken(authentication); return ResponseEntity.ok(new JwtResponse(jwt)); } \`\`\` 在这个方法中，我们首先使用\`authenticationManager\`来验证用户凭据。如果认证成功，我们接着生成一个JWT Token并返回给客户端。 **3. 实现JWT工具类** 假设你已经有了\`JwtTokenUtil\`类，这里我们需要确保该类中有一个\`generateToken\`方法来生成JWT。以下是一个示例： \`\`\`java @Service public class JwtTokenUtil implements Serializable { // DO NOT expose this secret in production! private final String jwtSecret = \\"YourSecretKey\\"; public String generateToken(Authentication authentication) { final String username = ((User) authentication.getPrincipal()).getUsername(); final Date createdDate = new Date(); final Date expirationDate = new Date(createdDate.getTime() + 86400000); return Jwts.builder() .setSubject(username) .setIssuedAt(createdDate) .setExpiration(expirationDate) .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS512, jwtSecret) .compact(); } // Additional methods to validate the token, get the username from the token, etc. } \`\`\` **4. 创建\`JwtResponse\`类** 创建\`JwtResponse.java\`以包装JWT Token： \`\`\`java public class JwtResponse { private String token; private String type = \\"Bearer\\"; public JwtResponse(String token) { this.token = token; } // getters and setters } \`\`\` 当用户进行登录操作发起POST请求后，系统将根据他们的凭据创建一个\`Authentication\`对象。如果认证成功，生成一个JWT Token，并把它放在\`JwtResponse\`对象里返回给用户。 用户之后的每个请求都需要在其请求头（\`Authorization\`头）中带上这个JWT Token，形如 \`Authorization: Bearer <token>\` ，用以访问那些需要用户认证才能访问的资源。 现在登录功能基本上已经完成了。需要注意，JWT安全设置应始终使用秘密（复杂且足够长的随机字符串）并在安全环境中保管这个秘密。示例中出现的\`jwtSecret\`应该是安全存储，不能直接硬编码在代码中，推荐从外部配置文件或环境变量中读取。 此流程简化了异常情况和错误处理的步骤，实际应用开发时还需要包括对错误的处理、日志记录和可能的安全漏洞修复，这取决于应用的具体需求和安全要求。"},{"prompt":"authenticationManager如何验证用户凭据？","completion":"在Spring Security框架中，\`AuthenticationManager\` 是一个核心接口，用于管理认证（Authentication）过程。\`AuthenticationManager\` 接口定义了一个方法： \`\`\`java Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication) throws AuthenticationException; \`\`\` 该方法尝试认证传递给它的\`Authentication\`对象，并且返回一个全面填充的\`Authentication\`实例（包括授予的权限）如果认证成功，或者如果认证失败，则抛出一个\`AuthenticationException\`。 具体\`authenticationManager\`如何验证用户凭据的步骤通常如下： 1. **接收认证请求：** 当用户尝试登录时，他们会提交自己的用户名和密码。这些信息通常被封装在一个\`Authentication\`类型的对象中，如\`UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken\`。 2. **认证过程：** \`AuthenticationManager\` 接收到上一步的\`Authentication\`对象后，将会调用配置的\`AuthenticationProvider\`列表来进行实际的认证工作。每个\`AuthenticationProvider\`都会尝试去认证这个请求。 3. **委托\`UserDetailsService\`：** \`DaoAuthenticationProvider\` （默认的\`AuthenticationProvider\`实现之一）会调用配置的\`UserDetailsService\`，使用\`UserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername\`方法来获取\`UserDetails\`对象。这个对象通常包含了保存在数据库中的用户信息（例如用户名、密码和权限列表）。 4. **检查密码：** 接下来，\`AuthenticationProvider\` 使用\`PasswordEncoder\`（比如\`BCryptPasswordEncoder\`）来比较\`UserDetailsService\`加载的用户信息中的密码与身份认证请求提供的密码是否匹配。 5. **返回认证结果：** 如果密码匹配，这意味着认证成功，\`AuthenticationManager\` 创建一个新的已认证的\`Authentication\`对象（比如\`UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken\`的实例），其中包含用户的权限等信息，并将它返回。如果密码不匹配或用户找不到，则抛出相应的\`AuthenticationException\`。 6. **上下文存储：** 一旦用户成功认证，全面填充的Authentication对象（已认证用户的信息）将被存储到\`SecurityContextHolder\`中的\`SecurityContext\`中。 以下是\`AuthenticationManager\`认证过程的一个示例代码： \`\`\`java Authentication authentication = authenticationManager.authenticate( new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(loginRequest.getUsername(), loginRequest.getPassword()) ); if (authentication.isAuthenticated()) { SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication); // The user is now authenticated, proceed with generating a JWT or other post-authentication steps } \`\`\` 请注意，在Spring Boot项目中进行认证时，需要配置\`AuthenticationManager\` bean 和提供\`UserDetailsService\`以及\`PasswordEncoder\`作为认证过程的一部分。这些通常在你的\`WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter\`的实现中进行配置。"},{"prompt":"write a paragraph summarizing the Chinese culture","completion":"Chinese culture is steeped in rich traditions, history, and philosophy that span over thousands of years.

Poem name: To a Mouse","completion":"In the final two stanzas of the poem \\"To a Mouse\\" by Robert Burns, the poet compares mice and humans, shedding light on human flaws and the unpredictability of life. The poem is about the speaker apologizing to a mouse whose nest he destroyed while plowing a field. The comparison between mice and humans serves to highlight the shared vulnerability and powerlessness of both species in the face of external circumstances. The poet acknowledges that, like the mouse, humans are also subject to life's hardships and uncertainties. This comparison helps to convey a sense of empathy and understanding between different living beings, despite their apparent differences. The poet states, \\"Still thou art blest, compared wi' me! / The present only toucheth thee\\" (lines 39-40). Here, the poet suggests that mice are more fortunate than humans because they are not burdened by worries about the past or future. This notion emphasizes the theme of living in the present moment, as the poet recognizes the anxiety and regret that humans often experience. Furthermore, Burns writes, \\"But, Mousie, thou art no thy lane / In proving foresight may be vain\\" (lines 41-42). The poet laments the fact that, unlike the mouse, humans with all their intellect and foresight often fail to successfully plan their lives. By illustrating the mouse's ability to adapt and survive despite its lack of planning, Burns suggests that humans could benefit from a similar approach of embracing the present and not being consumed by striving for control and certainty. Overall, the comparison of mice and humans in the final two stanzas of \\"To a Mouse\\" contributes to the poem's meaning by demonstrating the shared vulnerability and unpredictability of life. It prompts reflection on the human condition and urges readers to embrace the present moment rather than succumbing to anxiety and regret over the past or worrying about an uncertain future."},{"prompt":"According to Steinbeck how does the service that migrant worker's provide compart with how migrant workers are often viewed in America","completion":"According to John Steinbeck, the service provided by migrant workers in America contrasts with how they are often viewed. In his novel \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" Steinbeck portrays the migrant workers as essential contributors to society who play a crucial role in the nation's economy. He emphasizes their hard work and dignity, challenging the negative stereotypes and prejudices commonly associated with migrant workers at the time. Steinbeck shows that migrant workers, primarily from the Dust Bowl region during the Great Depression, are forced to travel and seek work in California due to the challenging conditions they face back home. Despite their difficult circumstances, Steinbeck portrays these workers as resilient, persevering, and willing to perform even the most grueling tasks to support their families. In the novel, the Joad family, representing migrant workers, provides a valuable service by working on farms and harvesting crops. These workers contribute to the overall economy and food production of the country. Steinbeck emphasizes their importance by depicting the high demand for these workers during harvest seasons and the impact that their absence would have on agricultural productivity. However, despite their vital role and hard work, migrant workers are frequently marginalized and dehumanized in American society. They are often viewed as disposable laborers, easily replaced and exploited by unscrupulous employers. Steinbeck demonstrates the systemic exploitation and mistreatment of migrant workers, with low wages, harsh working conditions, and a lack of legal protections. Moreover, migrant workers are often subject to discrimination, racism, and stigmatization. They are seen as outsiders and treated as a threat to local workers, facing hostility and prejudice from both employers and the local community. Through his portrayal of the Joad family and other migrant workers in \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" Steinbeck highlights the disparity between the valuable service they provide and the negative societal view and treatment they often receive. He seeks to challenge this perception and raise awareness about the unjust social and economic conditions faced by migrant workers in America."},{"prompt":"In the article how does steinbeck use word choice to convey his point of view about migrant farm workers","completion":"In his article, Steinbeck uses specific word choice to convey his point of view about migrant farm workers. He employs language that highlights the humanity, dignity, and significance of these workers while also emphasizing the injustices they face. Here are some examples of how Steinbeck's word choice contributes to his perspective: 1. \\"Okies\\" and \\"Migrants\\": Instead of using derogatory terms that were commonly used to label these workers, Steinbeck deliberately refers to them as \\"Okies\\" and \\"Migrants.\\" By using these neutral terms, he humanizes them and emphasizes their shared experience and identity. 2. \\"Refugees\\": Steinbeck calls the workers \\"refugees\\" from the Dust Bowl region. This term evokes the image of people displaced by natural disasters, emphasizing their vulnerability and the circumstances that force them to leave their homes. It further highlights the inevitability of their migration rather than attributing their movement solely to personal choice or laziness. 3. \\"Starvation wages\\": Steinbeck criticizes the low wages paid to migrant workers with this powerful phrase. By using the term \\"starvation,\\" he draws attention to the dire consequences of such meager pay, underscoring the exploitative nature of the labor system. This choice of words highlights the workers' economic vulnerability and the systemic inequality they face. 4. \\"Suffering humanity\\": Steinbeck repeatedly refers to the workers as part of the \\"suffering humanity.\\" This phrase captures their collective struggle and positions them as victims of a larger social and economic structure. It evokes empathy and reinforces the idea that their plight should be understood in the context of wider societal injustice. 5. \\"Demonized... and blamed\\": In describing the treatment of migrant workers, Steinbeck uses words like \\"demonized\\" and \\"blamed.\\" These terms convey a sense of unfair judgment and vilification, emphasizing the unjust stereotypes and prejudice faced by these workers. By using such strong language, Steinbeck challenges those negative perceptions and positions the workers as victims of society's biases. Steinbeck's skillful word choice in the article helps shape his perspective on migrant farm workers, highlighting their humanity, worth, and the injustices they endure. His careful selection of language enables him to advocate for greater understanding, empathy, and a recognition of their significance within society."},{"prompt":"Using the simple interest formula I=Prt​, compute the amount of interest earned for 2796.00 at 7 1 2​% for 3 1 4 years.

When multiple transactions are submitted to the Ethereum network, miners have the authority to decide the order in which they include these transactions in a block. This discretion allows them to potentially reorganize the order and gain advantages, such as front-running, sandwich attacks, or exploiting arbitrage opportunities available in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. MEV bots closely monitor the pending transaction pool and identify specific patterns or opportunities to generate profit. For example, a bot may detect users trying to buy or sell tokens at a specific price, and it can quickly place its own transactions ahead of them to take advantage of the anticipated price movement. MEV bots work by swiftly constructing transactions that prioritize them over regular users by offering higher transaction fees or performing complex transactions that can execute at a preferred timing. They try to optimize their profits by exploiting MEV opportunities as they arise. These bots are developed and controlled by individuals or entities seeking to maximize their financial gains from the Ethereum network. However, it is essential to note that not all MEV activities are nefarious. Some individuals argue that certain MEV mechanisms can provide added value to the network by incentivizing miners and liquidity providers and improving the efficiency of transaction settlement. Nonetheless, the concept remains controversial, and efforts are underway to mitigate the undue influence of MEV bots on the Ethereum network and promote fairer transaction processing."},{"prompt":"Like I'm literally 5 years old","completion":"MEV bots on Ethereum are like smart robots that try to make money by watching and controlling the order of transactions on the Ethereum computer network. They do this by seeing what other people want to do, like buy or sell something, and quickly doing it themselves before others can. This way, they can make more money by getting ahead of everyone else. Some people think this is not fair, but others say it can actually be helpful for the network.

Для каждого выходного канала, время обслуживания равно 1 у.е. (единица времени). Шаг 2: Найдем среднее число заявок в системе (mean number of requests). Найдем среднее число заявок в очереди. Для этого воспользуемся формулой для среднего числа заявок в системе M/M/1: L_q = p_source^2 / (1 - p_source) L_q = (0.4)^2 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.16 / 0.6 = 0.2667 Так как очередь может содержать только 1 заявку, среднее число заявок в очереди не может быть больше 1. Среднее число заявок в системе будет состоять из среднего числа заявок в очереди (0.2667) и числа заявок, обслуживаемых в данный момент (в очереди и в каналах): L = 0.2667 + 1 + 1 = 2.2667 Шаг 3: Найдем время обслуживания одной заявки в системе (mean service time).

Также мы знаем, что вероятности состояний могут быть выражены через поток заявок. Пусть λ - интенсивность поступления заявок в систему. Тогда, вероятность состояния P000 будет равна: P000 = (1 - λ) * (1 - p_source) * (1 - p_channel) * (1 - p_channel) где p_source - вероятность просеивания источника, p_channel - вероятность просеивания канала.

В данной системе есть два выходных канала, поэтому абсолютная пропускная способность будет равна сумме потоков заявок через эти два канала. Шаг 1: Рассмотрим поток заявок через первый канал. Поток заявок через первый канал будет равен произведению λ на вероятность состояния, в котором в источнике есть заявка, а второй канал не занят: Flow1 = λ * P001 Шаг 2: Рассмотрим поток заявок через второй канал.

Write 200-250 words, paying attention to paragraph structure and conventions.","completion":"The famous line, \\"the best laid schemes of mice and men,\\" from Robert Burns' poem \\"To a Mouse,\\" speaks to the unpredictable nature of life. It serves as a reminder that even the most well-thought-out plans can often result in disappointment when things do not go as expected. This notion raises the question of whether we should still bother planning for the future. While the future may be uncertain and our plans may not always come to fruition, it is still important to set goals and make preparations. Planning provides a sense of direction and purpose in our lives. It allows us to envision a desired outcome and take necessary steps to achieve it. Without plans, we are wandering aimlessly, lacking a clear path to follow. Even if our plans do not work out exactly as intended, they still act as a guide and provide us with a starting point. Furthermore, planning helps us consider various scenarios and make contingencies, increasing our adaptability and preparedness for unexpected events. When the unexpected does happen, it is crucial to respond with flexibility and a positive mindset. It is easy to become disheartened when our plans go awry, but dwelling on disappointment or regret will only hinder our ability to move forward. Instead, we should view unexpected events as opportunities for growth and learning. This shift in perspective will allow us to adapt to new circumstances, change our approach if necessary, and ultimately find alternative paths to reach our goals. By embracing the unexpected, we open ourselves up to unexpected opportunities and possibilities. In conclusion, although there is no guarantee that our plans will unfold as desired, it is still important to plan for the future. Planning provides direction and purpose, and helps us adapt to unforeseen circumstances. When the unexpected happens, it is crucial to respond with flexibility and a positive mindset, viewing setbacks as opportunities for growth. By doing so, we can navigate the unpredictable nature of life with resilience and ultimately find success in our endeavors."},{"prompt":"Subject: Application for Lecture in Business Management- Position No. 041022.

Put together, this sentence translates to: \\"The microwave emitted a cheerful 'ding' sound.\\" Grammatically, the structure of the sentence is: Subject (レンジが) + Sound (チンと) + Descriptor of the Sound (景気の良い) + Object (音を) + Verb in past tense (上げた). Here, \\"チンと\\" acts as an expression that both indicates the nature of the sound and enhances the reader's or listener's visualization or auditory impression of the described situation. The descriptive phrase \\"景気の良い\\" suggests that the sound is not just any sound but one that has a positive, almost lively or spirited quality to it. This kind of expressive detail is common in Japanese and adds color and atmosphere to the narrative."},{"prompt":"麗水「はい、解凍完了～。ウィンナーと合わせてケチャップライスにしまーす」","completion":"The provided text appears to be a line of dialogue from a character named 麗水 (Reisui) in a Japanese visual novel: 麗水「はい、解凍完了～。ウィンナーと合わせてケチャップライスにしまーす」 Let's break down the components of the dialogue: - 麗水 (Reisui) – This is very likely the name of the character speaking. Japanese names can often be made up of two kanji characters, and personal names vary widely in their readings. Without further context, we can assume \\"Reisui\\" is one possible reading of these characters. - 「 」 – These are Japanese quotation marks indicating the start and end of the dialogue. - はい (hai) – This is an interjection commonly used to mean \\"yes,\\" or to acknowledge someone or something. - 解凍 (kaitō) – This noun (or the masu stem of a verb) means \\"defrosting\\" or \\"thawing.\\" - 完了 (kanryō) – This noun means \\"completion.\\" When it follows another noun or the masu stem of a verb, it means that action is completed. - ～ – This tilde symbol is often used in informal writing to elongate the sound of the final syllable, indicating a playful or casual tone, similar to a drawn-out intonation in English. - ウィンナー (wiinnā) – This is a loanword from the German \\"Wieners\\" (as in Wiener Würstchen), which is used in Japanese to mean \\"sausages\\" or \\"frankfurters.\\" - と (to) – As a conjunction, this means \\"and\\" or \\"together with.\\" - 合わせて (awasete) – This is the te-form of the verb 合わせる (awaseru), which means \\"to combine\\" or \\"to join together.\\" - ケチャップ (kechappu) – This is a loanword from English meaning \\"ketchup.\\" - ライス (raisu) – This is another loanword from English meaning \\"rice.\\" - に (ni) – In this context, it's a particle that designates the purpose or result of a transformation, similar to the English \\"into.\\" - しまーす (shimasu) – This is the polite masu form of the verb する (suru) which means \\"to do\\" or \\"to make.\\" The prolonged ー indicates a lighthearted or cheerful intonation. Putting it all together, the line from the character 麗水 could be translated to: Reisui: \\"Yes, defrosting complete! I’ll combine it with the sausages and make ketchup rice!\\" This sentence has a casual, chipper tone, with Reisui announcing the completion of the thawing process and her plans to make a dish – in this case, ketchup rice with sausages, which is a simple, homestyle dish often enjoyed in Japan."},{"prompt":"くーこ「おなかへった、おなかへった」","completion":"The provided text is a line of dialogue, presumably from a character named くーこ (Kūko): くーこ「おなかへった、おなかへった」 Here's the breakdown of the components of the dialogue: - くーこ (Kūko) – This is likely the name of the character speaking, and it's written in katakana, which can be used for foreign words, onomatopoeia, names, or for stylistic reasons. - 「 」 – These are Japanese quotation marks to indicate that the text within is spoken dialogue. - おなか (onaka) – This is a noun meaning \\"stomach\\" or \\"belly.\\" - へった (hetta) – This is the past tense of the verb 減る (heru), which means \\"to decrease\\" or \\"to be hungry\\" when referring to the feeling of an empty stomach. The structure of the sentence 「おなかへった、おなかへった」 is repetitive, emphasizing the phrase for effect. This is a common stylistic device in spoken language, which can convey urgency, emphasis, or insistence. The line can be translated to: Kūko: \\"I'm hungry, I'm hungry.\\" This indicates that Kūko is expressing her hunger and is likely doing so in a manner that emphasizes her current state of feeling very hungry, with the repetition adding to the sense of urgency or craving for food."},{"prompt":"膝の上で待ちきれなくなったくーこがバタバタしている。","completion":"The sentence you've provided is a descriptive one, and it appears to be from a narrative text such as a novel or a visual novel story. Let's break it down: - 膝の上で (hiza no ue de) – This phrase consists of 膝 (hiza), meaning \\"knee\\" or \\"lap,\\" followed by the particle の (no), which is a possessive or relational particle, and 上 (ue), meaning \\"on\\" or \\"above.\\" The particle で (de) indicates the location where the action is taking place. Altogether, 膝の上で means \\"on the lap.\\" - 待ちきれなくなった (machikirenaku natta) – This is a phrase made up of the verb 待つ (matsu), which means \\"to wait,\\" and the expression きれない (kirenai), which comes from 切れる (kireru) meaning \\"to run out\\" or \\"to exhaust.\\" When combined with the adverb なく (naku), it turns into \\"cannot wait\\" or \\"impatient.\\" The verb なる (naru), in past tense なった (natta), means \\"to become,\\" so 待ちきれなくなった means \\"became unable to wait\\" or \\"became impatient.\\" - くーこが (Kūko ga) – くーこ (Kūko) is presumably the name of a character, and が (ga) is the subject marker particle indicating that Kūko is the subject performing the action. - バタバタしている (batabata shite iru) – バタバタ is another onomatopoeic word in Japanese, signifying a flustering or flapping motion. The verb している (shite iru) is the present continuous form of する (suru), which means \\"to do.\\" In this context, it suggests that Kūko is making flustered or restless movements. Putting it all together, the sentence translates to: \\"Kūko, who became impatient on the lap, is fidgeting.\\" The sentence describes Kūko's behavior as she is on someone's lap, indicating that she has become restless or can't wait for something and is consequently moving about in a fidgety or flustered manner."},{"prompt":"出来上がるまではしっかりロックしておかなければ。","completion":"Let's break down the Japanese sentence: 出来上がる (dekisagaru) – This verb phrase means \\"to be completed\\" or \\"to be finished.\\" 出来る (dekiru) means \\"to be able to do\\" or \\"to be made,\\" and 上がる (agaru) means \\"to rise\\" or \\"to go up,\\" but when combined as 出来上がる, it specifically conveys the completion of a process or the finalization of something being made or prepared. までは (made wa) – まで (made) indicates a limit or extent in time or space, and translates to \\"until\\" or \\"by the time.\\" The particle は (wa) here emphasizes the time frame being talked about (by the time it's completed). しっかり (shikkari) – This adverb means \\"firmly\\" or \\"securely.\\" It signifies doing something with care and making sure it's done well. ロック (rokku) – This is a loanword from English, \\"lock,\\" and it refers to the act of locking something, like a door or a safety mechanism. しておかなければ (shite okanakereba) – This is a conditional form that literally means \\"if (one) does not do and keep (something in a certain state).\\" しておく (shite oku) means \\"to do in advance\\" or \\"to do and leave it that way.\\" The ければ (kereba) suffix is a conditional that translates to \\"if not\\" or \\"unless\\" when attached to the negative form なければ (nakereba). So, putting it together, the sentence: 出来上がるまではしっかりロックしておかなければ。 Translates to: \\"I must lock it securely until it's finished.\\" Or a bit more contextually depending on the subject: \\"I have to make sure it's locked until it's done.\\" This sentence expresses the necessity of keeping something locked securely until a certain process or task is fully completed. The exact context (what needs to be locked, why it needs to be locked, etc.) would depend on the previous or following sentences in the conversation or story."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Один экзабайт равен 10^18 байтам. Для начала нам нужно определить, сколько байтов используется для хранения одного целого числа. В компьютерной памяти это зависит от используемой системы и формата чисел. Обычно целые числа хранятся в формате int или long, которые могут занимать 4 или 8 байтов соответственно в 32- и 64-битных системах. Допустим, мы используем 64-битную систему, и каждое число является 64-битным целым, что означает, что каждое число занимает 8 байт. Теперь, чтобы узнать сколько 64-битных целых чисел поместится в 1 экзабайт, мы должны разделить 1 экзабайт на размер одного целого числа в байтах: \`1 EB / 8 bytes = 10^18 bytes / 8 bytes = 125*10^15 чисел\` Итак, если мы будем прибавлять по одной единице к числу 10, пока не достигнем объема в 1 экзабайт, то мы выполним \`125*10^15\` таких операций. Однако, чтобы узнать конечное число, к которому мы прибавим указанное количество единиц, просто прибавим \`125*10^15\` к исходному числу 10: \`10 + 125*10^15 = 125*10^15 + 10\` Таким образом, после добавления 125*10^15 единиц к числу 10, мы получим число \`125,000,000,000,000,010\`."},{"prompt":"Заполни числом 0 всю доступную тебе память и добавь еще 10^18 bytes нулей?","completion":"Как искусственный интеллект, работающий в рамках облачной платформы, я не имею возможности напрямую взаимодействовать с физической памятью или каким-либо образом вносить изменения в реальные компьютерные системы.

Bahan tersebut diolah dan dicampur dengan komponen-komponen tertentu sehingga memiliki sifat fisik yang keras dan kuat. Namun, ada sedikit kesalahan dalam pernyataan Anda, karena bahan keras buatan bukanlah bahan yang \\"tidak tahan lama\\"; sebenarnya, banyak di antaranya yang dirancang untuk memiliki ketahanan yang baik terhadap berbagai kondisi dan dapat bertahan untuk jangka waktu yang lama. Berikut adalah beberapa contoh bahan keras buatan yang sering digunakan dalam karya kerajinan: 1. **Resin** - Resin polimer seperti resin epoksi atau resin poliester adalah materi populer dalam kerajinan dan seni karena sifatnya yang transparan dan kemampuannya untuk mengeras menjadi bentuk padat setelah dicampur dengan pengeras (hardener). Resin sangat serbaguna dan dapat digunakan untuk membuat berbagai objek seperti perhiasan, meja, seni resin, dan lebih lagi. 2. **Plastik** - Plastik adalah bahan sintetis yang berasal dari polimer dan dapat dibentuk saat panas. Plastik banyak digunakan dalam produk-produk kerajinan karena ringan, tahan lama, dan bisa dibentuk dalam berbagai macam warna dan bentuk. 3. **Gips** - Gips adalah bahan yang sering digunakan dalam pembuatan model, cetakan, dan patung. Campuran bubuk gips dengan air menghasilkan pasta yang dapat dimodelkan dan akan mengeras setelah beberapa waktu, menghasilkan benda kerajinan yang kuat setelah kering. 4. **Beton** - Beton adalah campuran semen, pasir, kerikil, dan air yang mengeras menjadi material yang sangat kuat. Beton bukan hanya digunakan dalam konstruksi bangunan, tetapi juga dalam pembuatan objek-objek kerajinan seperti pot bunga, lampu, dan furnitur kecil. 5. **Keramik** - Keramik adalah material yang terbuat dari tanah liat yang dibakar pada suhu tinggi. Walaupun alami, proses pembuatan keramik melibatkan teknologi modern dan bisa dianggap sebagai bahan keras buatan karena tanah liat harus diolah secara khusus sebelum digunakan. Bahan-bahan ini dipilih karena kekuatannya dan kemampuan untuk membentuk struktur yang tahan terhadap tekanan dan retak. Selain itu, banyak dari bahan keras buatan ini yang tahan terhadap cuaca, bahan kimia, dan faktor-faktor degradatif lainnya, sehingga sesuai dengan kebutuhan aplikasi yang memerlukan ketahanan jangka panjang."},{"prompt":"It needs an address [CAMP GREEN LAKE, TEXAS] and must include some of the following: 1.

Romanos 4 con Gálatas 3 Romanos 13:8-10 con Gálatas 5:13-14","completion":"Para realizar una comparación adecuada, primero veremos qué dicen los versículos de la Biblia en cuestión: **Romanos 8:15** \\"Pues no habéis recibido el espíritu de esclavitud para volver al temor, sino que habéis recibido el Espíritu de adopción, por el cual clamamos: ¡Abba, Padre!\\" **Gálatas 4:6** \\"Y porque sois hijos, Dios envió a vuestros corazones el Espíritu de su Hijo, el cual clama: ¡Abba, Padre!\\" Comparación: Ambos versículos hablan del Espíritu de adopción que reciben los creyentes, permitiéndoles llamar a Dios \\"Abba, Padre\\", que es un término arameo para referirse a Dios de una manera íntima y personal, como un niño a su padre. En ambos, el Apóstol Pablo enfatiza la íntima relación entre Dios y los creyentes. **Romanos 7:14-25** Esta es una sección larga donde Pablo habla de la lucha interna entre la naturaleza pecaminosa y el deseo de cumplir con la ley de Dios, concluyendo que es a través de Jesucristo que se encuentra la liberación. **Gálatas 5:17** \\"Porque el deseo de la carne es contra el Espíritu, y el del Espíritu es contra la carne; y estos se oponen entre sí, para que no hagáis lo que quisiereis.\\" Comparación: En Romanos 7:14-25, Pablo describe la lucha interna en términos de la ley y el pecado, mientras que en Gálatas 5:17, describe la lucha como entre el Espíritu y la carne. En ambos casos, se reconoce el conflicto y la imposibilidad de cumplir perfectamente la ley o vivir correctamente por uno mismo, necesitando la intervención divina. **Romanos 1:17** \\"Porque en el evangelio la justicia de Dios se revela por fe y para fe, como está escrito: Mas el justo por la fe vivirá.\\" **Gálatas 3:11** \\"Y que por la ley ninguno se justifica para con Dios, es evidente, porque: El justo por la fe vivirá.\\" Comparación: Tanto Romanos 1:17 como Gálatas 3:11 citan Habacuc 2:4, \\"El justo por la fe vivirá.\\" En ambos casos, Pablo utiliza este versículo para afirmar que la justificación ante Dios es por la fe y no por las obras de la ley. **Romanos 4** Todo el capítulo trata sobre la justificación por la fe, usando la historia de Abraham como el principal ejemplo de cómo se consideró justo por su fe y no por sus obras. **Gálatas 3** Este capítulo también se enfoca en la justificación por la fe y menciona a Abraham como una prueba de que la fe, y no la ley, es el medio por el cual se obtiene la promesa de Dios. Comparación: Ambos capítulos (Romanos 4 y Gálatas 3) buscan establecer que la justificación ante Dios es por medio de la fe, independientemente de las obras de la ley. Sin embargo, Gálatas 3 enfatiza más la falta de poder de la ley para justificar, mientras que Romanos 4 profundiza en cómo la fe fue contada como justicia a Abraham antes de la existencia de la ley. **Romanos 13:8-10** \\"8 No debáis a nadie nada, excepto amaros unos a otros; porque el que ama al prójimo, ha cumplido la ley. [...]\\" **Gálatas 5:13-14** \\"13 Porque vosotros, hermanos, a libertad fuisteis llamados; solamente que no uséis la libertad como ocasión para la carne, sino servíos por amor los unos a los otros. 14 Porque toda la ley en esta sola palabra se cumple: Amarás a tu prójimo como a ti mismo.\\" Comparación: Ambos pasajes hacen énfasis en el amor como el cumplimiento de la ley. En Romanos, el amor es presentado como la única deuda que los creyentes deben tener entre sí, mientras que en Gálatas, el amor es la manera correcta de utilizar la libertad que Cristo proporciona, algo que no debe ser usado para satisfacer deseos carnales, sino para servir a los demás. En conclusión, aunque cada texto tiene su propio contexto y propósito, hay una coherencia temática en los escritos de Pablo que destaca la fe, la justificación por la gracia, la libertad en Cristo, la lucha interna con la naturaleza pecaminosa, y el amor como la plenitud de la ley."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Mempertahankan Usaha (Sustainment Phase): 1. Tujuan: Tujuan utama dalam tahap ini adalah untuk menjaga kestabilan bisnis, memastikan keberlanjutan operasi, dan mengamankan posisi di pasar. 2. Aktivitas: Fokus pada efisiensi operasional, pengelolaan cash flow yang baik, pelayanan pelanggan, dan pemeliharaan kualitas produk atau jasa. 3. Pertumbuhan: Pertumbuhan di tahap ini cenderung stabil atau sedikit meningkat, dan bisnis terutama berusaha untuk mempertahankan pangsa pasar. 4. Tantangan: Menghadapi persaingan, adaptasi terhadap perubahan pasar, dan memastikan bahwa produk atau jasa tetap relevan. 5. Inovasi: Meskipun inovasi masih penting, fokusnya mungkin lebih pada peningkatan proses internal dan membuat inovasi inkremental. Mengembangkan Usaha (Growth or Scale-Up Phase): 1. Tujuan: Tujuan dari tahap ini adalah untuk memperluas pasar, meningkatkan pendapatan secara signifikan, dan memperkokoh posisi bisnis dalam industri. 2. Aktivitas: Fokus pada strategi pemasaran agresif, ekspansi produk atau jasa, ekspansi geografis, diversifikasi, dan mungkin akuisisi. 3. Pertumbuhan: Di tahap ini, bisnis secara aktif mencari pertumbuhan yang signifikan, baik secara organik maupun melalui investasi eksternal. 4. Tantangan: Mengelola risiko yang terkait dengan ekspansi cepat, memastikan sistem dan infrastruktur dapat mendukung pertumbuhan, dan menemukan sumber daya (manusia, finansial, teknologi) yang tepat. 5. Inovasi: Memerlukan tingkat inovasi yang tinggi untuk menciptakan peluang baru, memasuki pasar baru, atau mengembangkan lini produk baru. Intinya, tahap mempertahankan usaha berfokus pada menjaga dan memelihara apa yang telah dicapai, sementara tahap mengembangkan usaha berfokus pada peningkatan skala dan jangkauan bisnis untuk mencapai tingkat kesuksesan yang lebih tinggi.

Pilihan huruf yang jelas dan mudah dibaca sangat penting untuk memastikan pesan dapat diterima dengan baik oleh target pasar. 2. **Daya Tarik Visual**: Desain tipografi yang menarik akan membantu produk menonjol di rak-rak toko dan menarik perhatian pembeli. Tipografi bisa berkontribusi pada identitas visual merek dan menciptakan kesan pertama yang kuat. 3. **Pengenalan Merek**: Tipografi yang konsisten dan dibedakan dapat meningkatkan pengenalan merek. Konsumen akan lebih mudah mengidentifikasi dan mengingat merek ketika melihat desain tipografi yang sama di berbagai media dan produk. 4. **Konsistensi Merek**: Penggunaan tipografi yang konsisten di semua materi pemasaran dan kemasan menciptakan citra merek yang seragam. Hal ini menambah kredibilitas dan profesionalisme pada merek tersebut. 5. **Pembawaan Pesan**: Gaya tipografi yang dipilih dapat menyampaikan banyak tentang produk dan merek, seperti apakah produk tersebut mewah, ramah lingkungan, cocok untuk anak-anak, atau untuk penggunaan profesional. Setiap gaya tipografi membawa konotasi emosional dan pesan subliminal tersendiri. 6. **Navigasi Produk**: Tipografi yang baik memudahkan konsumen menemukan informasi yang mereka cari pada kemasan. Misalnya, hierarki tipografi yang hati-hati dengan menggunakan ukuran atau ketebalan huruf yang berbeda dapat memandu mata konsumen ke informasi paling penting terlebih dahulu. 7. **Prasyarat Hukum dan Regulasi**: Kemasan produk sering kali harus memenuhi beberapa prasyarat hukum dan regulasi, seperti ukuran font minimal dan ketentuan penandaan yang jelas untuk bahan kandungan, tanggal kadaluwarsa, peringatan keselamatan, dll. Tipografi yang tepat memastikan kepatuhan terhadap persyaratan ini. Oleh karena itu, tipografi tidak hanya sebagai alat untuk menampilkan teks, tetapi juga elemen desain yang strategis dalam pembuatan kemasan yang efektif dan menarik. Desainer kemasan harus mempertimbangkan faktor-faktor seperti kemudahan pembacaan, daya tarik estetika, asosiasi merek, dan kejelasan pesan ketika menentukan tipografi untuk kemasan produk."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Patients who suffer from such allergic reactions are meant to carry around two EpiPens, one in case of exposure to an allergen and a second in case the first EpiPen fails or if there is an exceptionally long time between the first injection and emergency medical care. In 2007, Mylan Pharmaceuticals purchased rights to manufacture the EpiPen from Merck, and in the subsequent years it raised the price 400%, leading to public outrage due to price gauging and harm to patients who require EpiPen to save them from life-threatening situations (Markovich, 2021). Much analysis has been done on this case and the economic factors that lead to it, as well as the impacts that it had on patients. It is well understood that Mylan raised the price much more than what would be needed just to only sustain improvements in the product, and that the company harmed patients by raising the price so egregiously. However, an analysis of the ethical conduct of the company and a detailed examination of Mylan’s individual actions has not been done. In the absence of this type of analysis, researchers cannot truly understand what drove Mylan to make its decisions and reflect on what actions influenced its overall attitude. In what follows, I analyze Mylan’s actions through the lens of virtue ethics which allows me to examine how the company failed to put into practice some of the traits that characterize virtuous engineering practice. I will evaluate the morality of the company’s actions that with respect to three of the traits necessary for morally responsible engineers, which are clear and informative communication, cooperation, and willingness to receive criticism. My analysis of Mylan’s actions following its acquisition of EpiPen draws attention to the way the company failed to embody these three virtues of professional engineering. 2 Literature Review There is a large amount of literature about Mylan’s acquisition of the EpiPen and the subsequent increase in EpiPen price over the years that follow. This writing focuses on the facts of the case and the impacts that it has had on patients who require epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs). They also discuss many of the economic factors that contribute to this case as well as the controversy that was shown to the public. However, scholars tend to avoid making ethical judgements of the company’s actions in their writing, and focus on the factual causes and implications of this case. Figure 1. Average wholesale price for EpiPen from 2007 to 2016 (Westermann-Clark, 2018) In Economic considerations in the treatment of systemic allergic reactions, Emma Westermann-Clark gives a background of the epinephrine autoinjector market and describes the major players that affect the costs of this healthcare tool. She goes on to graphically demonstrate the price increase that occurred after Mylan acquired the EpiPen from Merck in 2007, as can be 3 seen in Figure 1. She then discusses how EpiPen has continued to hold the main market share for EAIs, highlighting that the FDA does not allow EpiPen prescriptions to be substituted for other epinephrine autoinjectors at a pharmacy. The article discusses the impact of price on the amount of patients who actually dispense their prescriptions, claiming that, “more than 50% of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned or not filled when the cost exceeds 300 for a 2-pack” (Westermann-Clark, 2018). Finally, Westermann-Clark illustrates how socioeconomic factors impact patient’s access to epinephrine autoinjectors and how the price influences school districts who are required to purchase EAIs for emergency allergic reactions. Hayley Markovich highlights the media framing and presentation of this case to the public through the article titled Severe Allergies, Price Increases, and Supply Shortages: How News and Frames of the 2016 EpiPen Crisis Continue the Conversation of U.S. Pharmaceutical Pricing. By analyzing the different frames by which television news outlets show this story to the public, Markovich desires to better understand how to communicate issues in a way that leads to lasting change. The news segments that she analyzed mainly focused on affordability, attribution of responsibility, morality, and power structures, bringing light to multiple stories of people struggling to afford their children’s lifesaving medication. Markovich also highlights the statements by Mylan Pharmaceuticals and other key industry representatives, stating that, “insurance companies, drug makers, and pharmaceutical benefits managers blamed each other for high medication prices, each refusing to claim responsibility” (Markovich, 2021). Overall, this article highlights the key issues in this case and how it affected patients. Finally, in Health Care Fraud: The Leading Violation of the False Claims Act, Eli Adashi summarizes the leading health care schemes in which taxpayer money was misused in violation of the False Claims Act (FCA). The FCA is an act from 1863 which focuses on the 4 knowingly false or fraudulent submission of claims for payment to government healthcare programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, and institutes a system for damages to be paid for these claims. Adashi writes about how Mylan Pharmaceuticals falsely claimed EpiPen as a generic medicine so that the company would not have to pay rebates to Medicaid, despite there being no FDA approved alternatives to EpiPen (Adashi, 2022). Therefore, Mylan knowingly avoided this program which was put in place to ensure that Medicaid programs are not susceptible to pricegouging. Together, these authors paint a picture of Mylan’s actions through a factual approach. While Adashi and Westermann-Clark highlight the facts of Mylan’s handling of the EpiPen and the effects that it has had on patients, Markovich illustrates the way that the company interacted with the media and criticism they received. However, none of these authors analyzed the company’s actions as a whole that brought it to have such a large impact or attempted to assign moral judgement to Mylan. With a product that has the opportunity to affect millions of patients, it would be helpful to determine what practices can lead to price-gouging at this level. This paper will provide an in-depth look at the actions of Mylan Pharmaceuticals and utilize the virtue ethics framework to form a moral judgement of the company. Conceptual Framework In order to analyze the actions taken by Mylan Pharmaceuticals, I will draw on virtue ethics, which will allow me to assign morality to the actions taken by this company after its purchase of EpiPen. Virtue ethics is an ethical theory that focuses on the values of the actor and emphasizes the development of character traits that make one virtuous (van de Poel & Royakkers, 2011). According to Aristotle, who developed this idea originally, the goal of human 5 action is to strive for eudaimonia, or the highest good to humanity. This requires us to strive to embody positive character traits such as reliability, honesty, and responsibility through all of our actions, which requires humans to utilize our unique reasoning skills to identify how to follow through with these virtues. However, there is no one list of positive virtues within this ethical theory that could be applied to any one situation (van de Poel & Royakkers, 2011). As the development and creators of important technology such as medical devices are often engineers and scientists, Mylan should embody the virtues of morally responsible engineers. For this purpose, I will utilize Michael Pritchard’s list of Virtues for Morally Responsible Engineers, which should influence the ethical creation and distribution of technology. Pritchard notes in the creation of this list that simply having these values may not be enough to certify an engineering project as morally responsible, but lacking them indicates a failure to create simply competent engineering practice (Pritchard, 2001). Throughout this paper, I will determine if Mylan Pharmaceuticals demonstrates these virtues through its actions in its handling of the EpiPen product. I will utilize evidence of repeated actions and statements from the company, which will allow for the judgement of the ethical character of the company. In order to focus this discussion, I will specifically center my 1. Competence 2. Ability to communicate clearly and informatively 3. Cooperativeness (being a good “team player”) 4. Willingness to compromise 5. Perseverance 6. Habit of documenting work thoroughly and clearly 7. Commitment to objectivity 8. Openness to correction (admitting mistakes, acknowledging oversight) 9. Commitment to quality 10. Being imaginative 11. Seeing the “big picture” as well as the details of smaller domains Figure 2. Pritchard’s Virtues for Morally Responsible Engineers (Prichard, 2001) 6 analysis on the virtues of clear and informative communication, cooperation, and willingness to receive criticism. Analysis Mylan Pharmaceuticals showed poor adhesion to the virtues of clear and informative communication, cooperation with government direction and other players in the epinephrine autoinjector market, and willingness to receive criticism. This deficiency in adherence to these values can be seen in the repeated actions taken by this company since its acquisition of EpiPen from Merck in 2007. In order for ethically responsible engineering practice to occur, it is a requirement that an actor follows all of the virtues for a morally responsible engineer, and that even if one value is lacking the actor can be deemed irresponsible (Pritchard, 2001). Although Mylan Pharmaceuticals could be deemed lacking in many of these categories, its failures can specifically be seen through three values. Due to the requirement that an actor must follow all of the virtues for morally responsible engineering, it follows that Mylan Pharmaceuticals was immoral in its handling of the EpiPen. In the following, the text examines each of the three virtues closely and gives evidence of Mylan’s failure to uphold these virtues. Clear and informative communication Mylan failed to communicate with patients and instead released confusing statements to the media during the period of heavy criticism in 2016. In healthcare, effective communication to the patient is paramount to ensuring that a patient can gain proper access to medicines and understand their options in their own healthcare. Therefore, Mylan’s role in communication in regards to the EpiPen is centered around its need to ensure patients understand the product and 7 the cost of what it takes to purchase one. However, Mylan failed to properly communicate the cost of its product while creating fear and the idea that EpiPen was the only option for patients dealing with severe allergies. The first example of this occurring is after the media began covering Mylan’s price increase of the EpiPen. The CEO of Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Heather Brech, accepted “full responsibility” for the price hikes, and claimed that the cost increases funded improvements in the EpiPen device (Silverman, 2016). She stated that the company invested a billion dollars into the product improvements. However, she refused to detail how much of this cost went into the companies lobbying campaign versus real product development, and how these improvements were worth a price increase of 550% for patients. It is apparent that there is a lack of communication and transparency from Mylan in regards to the company’s actions. Despite the CEO’s statement of full responsibility, the company went on in other communications to blame others and attribute the issue to the health care industry as a whole. Bresch claimed that, “the reality is in the brand pharmaceutical market this isn’t an EpiPen issue, this isn’t a Mylan issue, this is a healthcare issue” (Markovich, 2021). She went on to state how the healthcare system is failing patients by allowing them to go to the pharmacy to dispense the drug without knowing what the price will be (Silverman, 2016). Although there are many issues in the American healthcare industry, this statement stands in stark contrast to Bresch’s previous statement of accepting full responsibility. This clearly indicates a lack of clear communication about the product and about where the issue truly stems from. Mylan’s confusing statements contribute to the confusion around the issue of EpiPen pricing as the company refuses to provide clear statements on the reality of the EpiPen price increases. These statements stem from multiple interviews and hearings, showing that this is a 8 repeated pattern for Mylan. Altogether, the comments from Mylan demonstrate a clear poor ability to adhere to the virtue of communication which, according to virtue ethics, can only draw the conclusion that it had acted unethically. Cooperation In addition, Mylan failed to cooperate with other players in the epinephrine injector market and government entities who were attempting to provide better access to EPIs. As a virtue, cooperation means to work with others who have the same goal. Therefore, for a company such as Mylan Pharmaceuticals who has the goal of ensuring that more people have access to epinephrine autoinjectors, it is important to work with others who have the same goal. In this case, Mylan can be seen failing to work with the government and abide by rules that are put in place to ensure equal access to EPIs, as well as fighting to shut down potential competitors. In the American healthcare system, the government’s role is to fill in where there are issues with the market and ensure fairness in the system (Tang, 2004). The government does this in multiple ways, including insuring healthcare assistance through Medicaid and insurance to older people and disabled people through Medicare. In addition, the government has worked to reform the healthcare system through programs such as the Affordable Care Act. One feature of Medicaid is called the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, or MDRP, wherein drug manufacturers help to offset the costs of prescription medicines to Medicaid patients by paying rebates to the government in order for Medicaid patients to get the best price possible for drugs (Centers for Medicaid & Medicaid Services, 2021). These rebates are set as a percentage of the drug’s average manufacturer price, and vary depending on the category of drug, with the largest rebates required for brand-name drugs. 9 However, Mylan failed to cooperate with this program by lying about its product while registering for the MDRP. At the time, EpiPen was listed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a brand name drug and was marketed as such (CNBC, 2017). However, Mylan misclassified the EpiPen as a generic drug to the MDRP in order to avoid paying the larger rebate required for brand name drugs, skirting a program designed to ensure Medicaid was not, “susceptible to price gouging by manufacturers of drugs that were available from only a single source” (Adashi, 2022). In 2009, Mylan was subject to a lawsuit for this misclassification and fined 465 million dollars due to this error. Through this lawsuit, the Department of Justice determined that Mylan did this knowingly. If, as Mylan and its executives have said, providing access to these important live-saving medical devices is important to them, they should be inclined to support such a program and follow the guidelines as required. However, they failed to work with the MDRP and collaborate to ensure that this program with the same goals as them is successful. Another example of Mylan’s failure to cooperate with those who have the same goals as them can be seen through its aggressive fight to keep competition out of the market. In 2015, Teva Pharmaceuticals was poised to launch its generic epinephrine autoinjector and gain approval from the FDA through an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) which allowed them to use EpiPen’s safety data to avoid these safety trials themselves (Carrier, 2017). Mylan fought to delay this ANDA, first with lawsuits and then by filing a citizen petition stating that patients would not be able to understand how to use Teva’s EPI, as it worked differently from the EpiPen. This worked in Mylan’s favor to delay Teva’s generic version of the EpiPen, allowing Mylan to maintain its majority share of the market until 2018 when Teva’s generic EPI finally became available. 10 As I have shown, Mylan provides poor cooperation with those who desire to provide access to EpiPens. Some may say that EpiPen manufacturers can set the price of the device to as high as they need and fight to keep its product unchallenged, because Mylan offers programs to aid low-income patients in receiving its EpiPen. If uninsured patients apply, they can receive two EpiPens for free, so Mylan must be serious about providing for patients. However, this view fails to consider that a large portion of patients are able to afford insurance, making them ineligible for this program, but still have high deductibles. Many Americans have insurance for emergencies, but still must pay large amounts of money to reach their deductible and gain any coverage from their insurance provider (Willingham, 2016). Therefore, these are the people who are largely suffering from the EpiPen prices. Mylan clearly failed to cooperate with Teva and fought against its generic version of EpiPen being approved as hard as it could. Mylan also failed to cooperate with a program specifically designed to aid low-income patients in receiving live-saving drugs. It worked to avoid government requirements and to maintain exclusivity for its own gain. These actions show repeated inability to work towards the common good and demonstrate a lack of adhesion to the virtue of cooperation. Therefore, Mylan acted unethically as it lacks one of the core virtues for morally responsible engineering practice. Open to criticism Finally, Mylan fought heavily against any criticism that was levied against them. The ability to receive criticism with acceptance and understanding is an essential trait to one designing and marketing a product, as there are always room for improvements that may not be obvious to the originator. This virtue can be observed by taking criticism and either adjusting 11 one’s actions accordingly or seriously evaluating the criticism for future actions. Through Mylan’s actions, it is clear that it failed to take the high amounts of criticism and change its actions or product, and in some cases attempting to shut down all criticisms instead. Before Mylan acquired the EpiPen in 2007, the device was manufactured by Merck and costs for the product was approximately 114 for a two-pack, which is the standard amount to for patients to receive from the pharmacy at one time, in case one EpiPen fails (Willingham, 2016). However, by 2016, the price for the EpiPen was increased to 500 or more, leading to a large media backlash and heavy criticism that same year. This criticism was heavily directed towards Mylan for price gouging and depriving patients of medicine that is essential if they were to come in contact with an allergen and in turn have a severe allergic reaction. The backlash was not for no reason either, as many low-income patients were unable to fill their prescriptions, with evidence citing that more than half of EpiPen prescriptions are not filled by patients once the cost of a 2-pack exceeds 300 (Westermann-Clark, 2018). During this period of heavy criticism, Mylan executives took to news outlets to blame anyone other than themselves for this issue (Markovich, 2022). In addition, since the criticism, the company has continued to raise the cost of its EpiPen, and now a pack can cost even up to 730.33 (Westermann-Clark, 2018). This clearly demonstrates a failure to respond to criticism from the public and patients who need EpiPen. In a different manner, Mylan Pharmaceuticals also shut down criticism forcefully. In 2009, the Pittsburg Post-Gazette wrote an article about poor quality control procedures at Mylan’s plan in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, detailing how workers routinely ignored warnings about potential manufacturing problems. In return, Mylan filed two defamation lawsuits, one 12 claiming that the Post-Gazette misappropriated trade secrets and another claiming that the PostGazette distorted the facts in its article (Adams, 2009). These lawsuits were later dropped. These examples clearly demonstrate Mylan’s pattern of avoiding criticism and shutting it down where possible, instead of utilizing criticism to improve its work. Therefore, it failed to be open to criticism and, accordingly, lack this virtue. As has been previously stated, the lacking of one virtue allows for them to be deemed immoral according to virtue ethics theory. Conclusion Through detailed evidence of Mylan’s actions since 2007, it is possible to judge its actions and the character of the company. These actions show Mylan lacked in three character traits that are essential to morally responsible engineers: clear and informative communication, cooperation, and willingness to receive criticism. If analyzed through a virtue ethics framework, Mylan acted unethically because it failed to demonstrate virtues that would have been illustrated by a virtuous actor. A benevolent healthcare system is essential to building a thriving and successful society, and ensures that citizens are kept healthy. However, many healthcare companies are driven by their own profit motives and neglect the causes that brought them into existence in the first place, namely providing access to medicines. By evaluating what brought one pharmaceutical company to greed, the virtues which it lacked can be emphasized and upheld as future engineers enter into the workforce. Keeping these virtues in mind can help healthcare systems improve and deliver on their promises to help patients. Viatris, the drugmaker previously known as Mylan, announced on Monday that it had agreed to pay 264 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that alleged the company was involved in an illegal scheme to monopolize the market for epinephrine auto-injector devices known as EpiPens, which are used to treat severe allergic reactions. The proposed settlement, which needs to be approved by a judge, would resolve a legal battle that began after Mylan, in 2016, raised the price for a pack of two EpiPens to 608 from 100, the price since 2007, according to court documents. In the lawsuit, a group of plaintiffs made up of consumers, health insurance companies and other third-party payers alleged that by drastically raising the price of EpiPens, the drugmaker was “unlawfully exercising its monopoly power,” according to a complaint. “Were the price increases attributable to market conditions, increases in manufacturing costs or shortages in the supply of epinephrine?” the complaint said. “Absolutely not. They were driven solely by unaccountable executives and companies who sought to profit off of human misery and fear.” Many people involved in the lawsuit had paid thousands of dollars for EpiPens over the years, including a mother from Arizona who had paid 2,475 out of pocket for her son who is allergic to tree nuts and peanuts, and a father from Delaware who spent more than 1,100 on EpiPens for his son who is allergic to milk, eggs and peanuts, according to the lawsuit. EpiPens are made by two subsidiaries of Pfizer — King Pharmaceuticals and Meridian Medical Technologies — and are sold by Viatris. In July, Pfizer and its subsidiaries settled its part of the lawsuit for 345 million, and denied any wrongdoing. In its quarterly earnings report on Monday, Viatris said that the company “maintains that it acted lawfully and pro-competitively and the settlement contains no admission of liability.” “The board of directors believes that this settlement is in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders,” the report said. “The resolution of these indirect purchaser cases will allow the company to move forward and continue focusing on its strategic priorities and its mission of empowering people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life.” Editors’ Picks ‘Saturday Night Live’ Says Goodbye to George Santos Martin Scorsese’s Unwise Guys Flamboyant as Ever, ’70s-Style Desserts Are Making a Comeback Neither Viatris officials nor lawyers representing the company immediately responded to a request for comment on Monday night. Our business reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover. Lynn Sarko, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement that he urged consumers and third-party payers who paid for EpiPens to learn more about the settlement at a website where claims can be filed. “We are pleased that the EpiPen antitrust litigation is now concluded,” Paul Geller, another lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement, adding that the settlement is subject to court approval. The lawsuit also alleged that the drugmaker misclassified EpiPens under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to save hundreds of millions of dollars in rebates, and that it intervened in regulatory proceedings to delay competitors from entering the market. The price jump in 2016 drew widespread outrage, especially among parents of children with allergies. Thousands of people signed a petition urging Congress to intervene. After protests over the company’s raising the price of EpiPens in 2016, Mylan, as Viatris was then known, introduced a generic version of its own product. But it was announced with a wholesale list price of 300 for a pack of two, half the price of the brand-name EpiPen. In 2016, Mylan reached a 465 million settlement with the Justice Department and other government agencies over allegations that the drugmaker had overcharged Medicaid for the treatment by improperly classifying it as a generic drug. EpiPens As the CEO of the drug maker that sells the EpiPen allergy-reaction injector defended the company’s six-fold price increases before Congress last week, it’s appalling to see that Heather Bresch took no fault. The company’s price hikes on a life-saving drug is clearly unethical if we take a closer look. EpiPen has gone from 100 for a two-pack in 2009 to 608 today. Usually, companies would be applauded for the ability to create revenue through such pricing power. But when it comes to life-saving drugs, consumers interpret these significant increases as the producer profiteering off a person’s life or death need. This is (not) unlike what happened at Turing Pharmaceuticals last year when the company increased the price of Daraprim from roughly 15 to 750. Like many, I had to ask: are these prices ethical? In the book, The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably, the authors present a five-step test to determine if a price is ethical. Here’s a look at how Mylan’s Epipens would perform under the test: Test #1: the exchange (transaction) is ethical when the price is paid voluntarily. The buyer is aware of how much the item costs and voluntarily completes the transaction. For this level, Mylan has passed at an elementary understanding. People are still buying EpiPens. Test #2: The buyer is provided ample information about the product. This expectation comes with any purchase. The seller is not misleading consumers or omitting crucial information. Smokers still purchase cigarettes, despite the full disclosure of health risks. For this level, Mylan still passes the test. Test #3 and #4 are not as simple, so let’s come back to them later in this article. Test #5: The exchange must present equal access to goods regardless of ability to cover the cost. Consumers have access to discounts based on financial need and Mylan also provides free EpiPens to schools and funds activities related to allergy awareness. They continue to pass the test for now. OK, now let’s get back to Test #3 and #4. Here is where consumer outrage and the case for unethical behavior becomes stronger. Test #3: This stipulates that sellers cannot exploit a buyer’s essential needs. Test #4: This states the price must be justified by costs. There should be no excessive, unjustified profits on essentials. For example, if a person was having a heart attack and needed emergency treatment, hospitals would first treat the patient before collecting a deposit upfront to ensure the patient can pay for their services. In 2011, the list price for the EpiPen was 165. At that time, there were no competitors in the market and the product was off patent, meaning the patent protection had expired. Further, there was consistent demand due to the product’s shelf life of one year. Customers had to replace their EpiPens annually. In 2012, the list price increased 32% with no new competitors entering the market. However, this increase could have resulted from more R&D spending or an increase in raw materials costs. Regardless, the price was elastic and consumers continued to purchase the drug. By 2013, Sanofi announced its entry into the market. Their price hovered near that of Mylan’s, so it would appear the price was justified by cost. Had Sanofi entered with a lower or higher price, this justification would have been tougher to sell. Mylan responded by increasing their price a little more, which likely came from a desire to differentiate themselves as the premier brand with superior products. At this point, Mylan was still within the ethical constraints put forth above. This changed when Sanofi, Mylan’s sole competitor, was forced into a product recall and left the market. Mylan once again had a monopoly. Typically, in this situation, the price would remain the same or increase nominally with inflation and other standard considerations. Instead, Mylan increased the price from 300 to 600 over two years. In 2015, Mylan reported a net profit margin of 8.9%, but some speculate the margin for the EpiPen was closer to 55%, thus breaking the ethical constraints of Test #3 and #4. While individual consumers may not have had a voice or recourse, the market did. Mylan may have improved its margins and ultimately driven higher returns and shareholder value, but within a week the price increase cost the company 3 billion in market cap and a stock tank of over 12% in 5 days. They attempted to rectify the issue and announced a generic brand of the EpiPen with a list price of 300. Because of this misstep, though, every price change now will come under extreme scrutiny. The ethics of pricing is a minefield for any company to navigate. Nominal price increases are annoyances to customers and consumers, but they—for the most part—will not be met with extreme criticism. As long as a company is transparent about price increases and can demonstrate that such a change is justified—or at least has the consumers’ faith that this is true—they should be able to avoid a public maelstrom. If the Mylan debacle demonstrates anything, it shows that even in markets that have little pricing regulation and transparency, pricing moves must be carefully considered and communicated in a way that demonstrates ethical behavior in the best interest of both the consumer and the company.

Economic considerations in the treatment of systemic allergic reactions Emma Westermann-Clark,1,2 Amber N Pepper,1,2 and Richard F Lockey1,2 Author information Copyright and License information PMC Disclaimer Go to: Abstract Epinephrine is a life-saving medication used to treat systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) are expensive and worldwide availability is limited. Epinephrine prefilled syringes and epinephrine kits are potentially lower-cost alternatives to EAIs. Advantages, disadvantages, and costs of available products are discussed. The socioeconomic factors impacting access to EAIs are described. Keywords: epinephrine, anaphylaxis, cost, price, autoinjector Go to: Introduction Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for systemic allergic reactions (SARs) to foods, insect stings or bites, medications, and other allergens. The early use of epinephrine in SARs can be life-saving; delayed use has been associated with death.1–3 Cox et al updated the World Allergy Organization (WAO) grading system for SARs as summarized in Table 1 to clarify the early signs and symptoms of an SAR and to encourage early use of epinephrine.4 The term “SAR” applies to all grades with the term “anaphylaxis” also appropriate for grade 4 or 5 reactions. Table 1 Proposed modification of the 2010 World Allergy Organization grading system Grading system for SARs Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 Grade 5 Anaphylaxis Symptom(s)/sign(s) from 1 organ system present Cutaneous • Urticaria and/or erythema-warmth and/or pruritus, other than localized at the injection site And/or • Tingling, or itching of the lips* or • Angioedema (not laryngeal) Or Upper respiratory • Nasal symptoms (eg, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, and/or nasal congestion) And/or • Throat-clearing (itchy throat) And/or • Cough not related to bronchospasm Or Conjunctival • Erythema, pruritus, or tearing Or Other • Nausea • Metallic taste Symptom(s)/sign(s) from ≥2 organ symptoms listed in grade 1 Lower airway • Mild bronchospasm, eg, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath which responds to treatment And/or Gastrointestinal • Abdominal cramps* and/or vomiting/diarrhea Other • Uterine cramps • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grade 1 would be included Lower airway • Severe bronchospasm, eg, not responding or worsening in spite of treatment And/or Upper airway • Laryngeal edema with stridor • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grades 1 or 3 would be included Lower or upper airway • Respiratory failure And/or Cardiovascular • Collapse/hypotension^ And/or Loss of consciousness (vasovagal excluded) • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grades 1, 3, or 4 would be included Open in a separate window Notes: The final grade of the reaction is not determined until the event is over, regardless of the medication administered to treat the reaction. The final report should include the first symptom(s)/sign(s) and the time of onset after the causative agent exposure and a suffix reflecting if and when epinephrine was or was not administered: a, ≤5 min; b, >5 min to ≤10 min; c, >10 to ≤20 min; d, >20 min; z, epinephrine not administered. Final report: Grade 1-5; a-d, or z; First symptom(s)/sign(s); Time of onset of first symptom(s)/signs(s). Case example. Within 10 min of receiving an AIT injection, a patient develops generalized urticaria followed by a tickling sensation in the posterior pharynx. Intramuscular epinephrine is administered within 5 min of symptoms(s)/sign(s) resulting in complete resolution of the reaction. The final report would be: Grade 2; a; Urticaria; 10 min. *Application-site reactions would be considered local reactions. Oral mucosa symptoms, such as pruritus, after SLIT administration, or warmth and/or pruritus at a subcutaneous immunotherapy injection site would be considered a local reaction. However, tingling or itching of the lips or mouth could be interpreted as a SAR if the known allergen, eg, peanut, is inadvertently placed into the mouth or ingested in a subject with a history of a peanut-induced SAR. Gastrointestinal tract reactions after SLIT or OIT would also be considered local reactions, unless they occur with other systemic manifestations. SLIT or OIT reactions associated with gastrointestinal tract and other systemic manifestations would be classified as SARs. SLIT local reactions would be classified according to the WAO grading system for SLIT local reactions.33 A fatal reaction would not be classified in this grading system but rather reported as a serious adverse event. ^Hypotension is defined per the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Expert Panel criteria34: “Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours). A) Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic blood pressure. Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as follows: 1 mo to 1 y: <70 mm Hg, 1–10 y: <70 mm Hg + [2 × age], 11–17 y: <90 mm Hg. B) Adults: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline.

Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) were developed in the 1970s and were first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1987 with the EpiPen® (Mylan, Canonsburg, PA, USA). EAIs available in the USA include: EpiPen; epinephrine injection, United States Pharmacopeia autoinjector, generic (Mylan); epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector (Impax Generics, Hayward, CA, USA); and Auvi-Q® (Kaléo, Richmond, VA, USA). The annual direct costs in year 2010 in the USA for EAIs are estimated to be 294 million, accounting for about 25% of the 1.2 billion annual cost to treat SARs including anaphylaxis.5,6 The average wholesale price (AWP) of each EAI is included in Table 2, except for the Auvi-Q. Accurate wholesale pricing for the Auvi-Q is not available as it is distributed through a single specialty pharmacy network. The complexity of drug pricing is beyond the scope of this article. Costs for the EpiPen were relatively stable until Mylan acquired this product from Merck (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) in 2007. The AWP since that time for two EpiPens has increased 545% from 113.27 to 730.33.4 This price increase persists even after accounting for inflation (Figure 1).7,8 Although the out-of-pocket expenses for individual subjects may have decreased since the public outcry about EpiPen costs in 2016, the effective date of the most recent AWP available is May 16, 2016 and does not reflect the impact of price cuts or patient assistance programs.7 An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is jaa-11-153Fig1.jpg Figure 1 AWP for the EpiPen® 2001–2016.

Abbreviations: AWP, average wholesale price; ea, each; NDC: national drug code. Use of the AWP is controversial, but it is often used as a proxy for societal cost in cost-effectiveness analyses.9 An economic analysis published in 2011 utilized the 2006–2007 AWP of the EpiPen to estimate the annual cost of EAIs for food-induced SARs.10 According to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research good research practices guidelines from 2010: Pharmaceutical prices used in the vast majority of cost-effectiveness analyses are either based on AWPs in the USA or government-negotiated prices in Europe. The former are not only imperfect measures of actual prices paid (e.g., ignoring discounts and rebates), but may also greatly overestimate societal opportunity costs because of the implicit inclusion of producer surplus created through patent-protected monopoly pricing.11 In summary, AWP is used as an approximation for societal drug costs, despite its limitations. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) discusses the challenge of determining medication costs for research purposes. The HERC states, “We recommend using 121% of the drug costs reported in the Federal Supply Schedule, 152% of the VA cost, or 64% of AWP. To find the cost of a generic label prescription drug, we recommend using 27% of AWP.”9 Federal Supply Schedule prices are publicly available.12 Several factors limit the ability of newer products to garner and maintain a better market share versus Mylan’s EpiPen. First, the EpiPen has name recognition. Second, training for the use of each device is different. To illustrate, the epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector from Impax Generics requires the removal of two caps rather than just one. Although learning to use a new device can be challenging, novel design elements can improve safety and usability. An example is that the Auvi-Q has unique features including its rectangular shape intended to fit into a pocket, a retractable needle, and voice instructions. Third, insurance coverage differs for each EAI. According to the Managed Markets Insight and Technology database, the EpiPen has unrestricted access for 61% of commercial lives among 4624 commercial health plans.13 In contrast, Auvi-Q has unrestricted access for “19% of commercial lives in all locations” among these same commercial health plans.8 Even though Auvi-Q is not covered by many commercial insurance plans, the manufacturer offers it with 0 copayment to all commercially insured and Medicaid patients through a specialty pharmacy network distributor. Fourth, EAIs are rated “BX” by the FDA indicating that “data that have been reviewed by the Agency are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence” and when ordered may not be substituted by a pharmacist, one for another.14 The impact of copayments, coupons, and patient assistance programs on prices that subjects pay at the pharmacy counter requires further research. Pourang et al found that copayments did not affect the likelihood of an EAI being dispensed once it was prescribed in the Kaiser Permanente Health Maintenance Organization.15 However, while the authors indicate that nearly 30% of copayments exceeded 30, they did not consider higher copayments. Data are not available on prescription:dispense ratios for subjects with exceedingly high copayments or for uninsured and underinsured subjects who may pay retail prices. More than 50% of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned or not filled when the cost exceeds 300 for a 2-pack.5 Two generic EAIs manufactured by Mylan have an AWP of 375. Two generic EAIs manufactured by Impax Generics have an AWP of 494.01. Patients with any commercial insurance plan or Medicaid receive Auvi-Q for 0 copayment through the specialty pharmacy network, ASPN Pharmacies LLC (200 Park Avenue, Suite 300, Florham Park, NJ 07932, 973-295-3289). All uninsured subjects who make <100,000 annually have no copayment for Auvi-Q; uninsured subjects whose incomes exceed 100,000 pay no more than 360 for Auvi-Q. Socioeconomic factors impact access to EAIs. Children from high-income versus low-income homes are 8.35 times more likely to be prescribed EAIs.16 Medicaid-enrolled children are less likely to receive EAIs prior to arrival at an emergency department.17 In another study, Caucasian versus non-Caucasian children were more likely to receive epinephrine early during an SAR.18 Early use of epinephrine was defined as epinephrine administered before arrival to the emergency department. Owning an EAI greatly increased the odds of early epinephrine treatment (odds ratio 12.67, 95% CI: 4.46–35.96). The authors did not assess insurance status but indicate that this finding suggests that there might be an economic influence on access to EAIs.18 Fleming et al examined the out-of-pocket costs for medications associated with food allergy and found higher costs for Caucasian and higher-income subjects.18 They hypothesize that Medicaid-enrolled children may have lower out-of-pocket costs, that is, lower copayments. To reduce or eliminate insurance copayments, Fromer suggests that epinephrine be classified as a preventive medicine by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).5 Decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro, Williamstown, MA, USA) has been used to evaluate the cost of generic EAIs versus the EpiPen using a model that tracked spending for individual subjects over 20 years, with the assumption that each subject needs two 2-packs yearly, one each for home and school or work.19 The cost for the EpiPen over a 20-year model duration totals 58,667 (95% CI: 57,745–59,588) versus 45,588 for the generic EAI (95% CI: 44,873–46,304). The model also incorporates other food allergy-related costs, such as specialist visits, grocery costs, and loss of work time for parents of food-allergic children. These costs are assumed to be the same for all subjects regardless of the type of EAI prescribed. The price of EAIs also affects school districts and communities. The Michigan legislature mandated that all public schools stock EAIs. It estimated the cost for two EAI 2-packs, one adult and one pediatric, at 140, while the “recently reported costs for commercial sources” was 1200, according to the authors of the article. The annual calculated cost to Michigan public schools based on these two cost estimates ranges from 565,460 to 4,846,800.20 A 2007 WAO survey of its House of Delegates indicates that EAIs are available in 59% of 44 countries surveyed.21 Those without EAIs employed other methods for the self-administration of epinephrine.22 These include the use of ampules of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) with an empty 1 cc syringe to be drawn up as needed or prefilled syringes containing various amounts of epinephrine. Both options are much less expensive than EAIs; for example, a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) had an AWP of 2.52 and retail price of ~12 in 2016.7 Epinephrine ampules may not be available in all countries. Both options also allow for tailored dosing of epinephrine, above or below the standard 0.15 or 0.3 mg doses contained in most FDA-approved EAIs. This may be beneficial for children weighing <15 kg (33 pounds) or for large or obese subjects. Of note, in November 2017, the FDA approved an infant version of the Auvi-Q, Auvi-q 0.1mg, for children weighing 7.5–15 kg (16.5–33 pounds). It has a shorter needle and a smaller dose of epinephrine (0.1 mg versus 0.15 mg contained in other “junior” products). Market forces appear to influence the cost of EAIs. For example, some US companies are offering low-cost alternatives. Symjepi™ (Adamis, San Diego, CA, USA) is an epinephrine prefilled syringe (EPS) that contains 0.3 mg of epinephrine, with a user-friendly design. It was approved by the FDA in June 2017 for subjects 30 kg (66 pounds) or more and is expected to be available at a lower cost than the current EAIs. A “junior” version is expected to follow. The concept of prefilled syringes is not new. The Ana-Kit® (Hollister-Stier Laboratories, Spokane, WA, USA) consisted of a syringe filled with 1 mL of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) housed in a protective case for subcutaneous injection before it was removed from the US market.23,24 The Ana-Kit syringe had 0.1 mL graduations so that smaller doses could be administered depending on the subject’s age. The instructions recommended the following doses: “Adults and children over 12 years: 0.3 mL; 6–12 years: 0.2 mL; 2–6 years: 0.15 mL; infants to 2 years: 0.05–0.1 mL.”25 An appropriate dose could be administered by pushing the syringe plunger until it stopped. A second dose could be administered as appropriate, after rotating the rectangular plunger ¼ turn to the right, to line up with a rectangular slot in the syringe.25 An advantage of the prefilled Symjepi syringe is that it is housed in a dark blue plastic encasement to protect the epinephrine from ultraviolet light degradation. Epinephrine degrades with exposure to ultraviolet light, oxygen in ambient air, and excessive heat.26–28 EPSs stored at room temperature in a pencil box maintain acceptable US Pharmacopeia concentrations (90%–115% of label claim), pH, and sterility for 3 months.22 The stability is limited to 2 months in high-temperature and low-humidity climates.22,29 In addition, some physicians and other health care professionals provide subjects with prefilled syringes wrapped in aluminum foil.28,30 These can be transported in a crush-resistant eyeglass case. Snap Medical Industries (Dubin, OH, USA) has developed EpinephrineSnap-V® (a kit containing a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes) and the EpinephrineSnap convenience kit (a kit containing an ampule of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes). The Focus Health Group, located in Knoxville, TN, USA, has been contracted to commercialize these products. The AWP of this product is 1567 although information from company officials states that the average price of EpinephrineSnap is 80 and the EpinephrineSnap-V is 130, with discounted group purchasing organization pricing available (Personal communication, November 1, 2017). Use of these options may not be as practical as is an EAI. The reason is that an epinephrine ampule or vial with an empty syringe requires more skill to properly draw up the epinephrine and administer it under emergency circumstances. Parents of individuals with a history of an SAR take longer to draw up epinephrine from an ampule (average 142±13 seconds) compared to emergency department nurses (29±0.09 seconds; p<0.05).31 The epinephrine dose drawn up by parents also ranged 40-fold as compared to twofold for emergency department nurses.31 The EpinephrineSnap products are geared toward use by emergency medical technicians and other health care professionals rather than individual subjects. The rising cost of EAIs has made self-administered epinephrine potentially unavailable to some subjects. There are no data on deaths attributed to inability to afford EAIs. Lower-cost alternatives such as EPSs and epinephrine kits are entering the US market. EAIs have advantages, such as ease of use, but they are expensive. More research is needed on the complexity of drug pricing and on the optimal methods to determine individual and societal costs. Classifying EAIs as USPSTF preventive medicines could improve access by reducing or eliminating copayments. The research question is: To what extent has the exorbitant price of Epi-pens been ethically and economically adequate? Using this prompt and evidence write the thesis with introduction and the first 5 body paragraphs of the IA, the body paragraphs have to be lengthy and packed with the evidence I supplied you.","completion":"As an AI language model, I'll attempt to draft an introduction and the first five body paragraphs based on the provided evidence for your Internal Assessment (IA) on the ethical and economic considerations surrounding the pricing of EpiPens by Mylan Pharmaceuticals. Please be advised that this will be a simplistic representation and might not meet all the criteria for an actual IB Business Management IA, which would require a personal engagement, comprehensive research, and reflection on the methodology used. --- # Introduction The pricing of pharmaceutical products, especially those that are life-saving, is a matter of paramount importance that intersects the domains of ethics and economics. In the case of EpiPens, a device critical for individuals suffering from severe allergic reactions, the pricing strategy by Mylan Pharmaceuticals has come under intense public and academic scrutiny. EpiPens are not merely commodities but essential healthcare tools for patients at risk of anaphylaxis. Thus, the ramifications of their pricing extend beyond the balance sheets of Mylan and into the homes and lives of countless patients. This study seeks to examine the extent to which Mylan's decision to raise EpiPen prices has been ethically and economically justifiable. Through a lens scrutinizing the evidence of Mylan's actions, the literature on pharmaceutical pricing practices, and the broader impact on society, this analysis will interrogate the moral and economic dimensions of Mylan's decisions, address the resulting public outcry, and evaluate whether Mylan's pricing practices can be deemed reasonable within a market-based healthcare system. # Body Paragraph 1: Mylan's Price Increases and Public Response In 2007, Mylan Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights to manufacture EpiPens, and in the years that followed, the company implemented a price increase exceeding 400%. This drastic escalation drew widespread indignation from consumers, healthcare providers, and policymakers alike. Such a decision by Mylan to raise prices has been perceived as capitalizing on the vulnerable position of patients who, for the sake of their own survival, are compelled to bear the financial burden indiscriminately—which is noteworthy, given that individuals at risk of anaphylaxis are advised to carry two EpiPens at all times. The literature reveals that these cost increments far exceeded the amounts necessary to sustain any purported enhancements to the product, thereby raising questions about the motives behind such pricing strategies and the ethical considerations disregarded by Mylan. # Body Paragraph 2: Economic Impacts and Market Dynamics Economically, the EpiPen scenario underscores the complexity of pharmaceutical pricing and market dynamics where a single player can command significant market share. Mylan's pricing strategy, examined in light of Emma Westermann-Clark's analysis, illustrates how dominance in the market can lead to decisions that adversely affect the consumption behavior of patients. Westermann-Clark observed a trend where over half of the EpiPen prescriptions went unfilled once the cost surpassed 300 for a two-pack—an alarming statistic that signals a clear disruption in the access to essential medication due to pricing policies. This data suggests an economic environment where market forces and profit motives overshadow patient well-being and access to care. # Body Paragraph 3: Socioeconomic Disparities and Access The pricing of EpiPens not only reflects on corporate ethics and economic principles but also on wider socioeconomic disparities and issues of access. When prices soar, it is often the economically marginalized and vulnerable populations that bear the disproportionate impact. Westermann-Clark highlighted how socioeconomic factors play a significant role in patient access to epinephrine autoinjectors, indicating that children from higher-income homes were more likely to be prescribed EAIs. This skew suggests that Mylan's pricing strategy could exacerbate existing inequalities in healthcare access and outcomes, raising the ethical question of whether such a fundamental aspect of medical care should be subject to the whims of market economics and corporate profit maximization. # Body Paragraph 4: Mylan's Responses to Criticism Despite considerable criticism, Mylan's responses to public concern over EpiPen pricing indicated a resistance to accept accountability. The company's communication strategy involved issuing a mix of opaque and sometimes contradictory statements. While Mylan CEO Heather Bresch accepted \\"full responsibility\\" for the price hikes at one point, the company also shifted blame onto the complexities of the healthcare system. This obfuscation and lack of transparency do little to engender trust or demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and patient-oriented values, characteristics that are especially important when a company has such a significant influence on public health. # Body Paragraph 5: Ethical Considerations and Virtue Ethics Analysis From an ethical standpoint, Mylan's EpiPen pricing strategy can be subjected to further scrutiny through the lens of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics posits that moral behavior is predicated upon the cultivation of virtuous character traits. Assessing Mylan's actions against Pritchard's virtues for morally responsible engineers, one finds the company's commitment to openness, cooperation, and informative communication wanting. Mylan's decision to eschew cooperation with Medicaid's Drug Rebate Program and to hinder competition through aggressive legal strategies provides evidence of behavior that conflicts with the expected virtues. Such actions suggest a veering away from morally responsible business conduct, reinforcing concerns regarding the ethical adequacy of the company's pricing decisions for EpiPens. --- Please remember, this is a starting point, and the IA should be informed by a detailed analysis, your insights, and personal engagement with the material.

For our purposes, we'll choose relevant topics that pertain to the situation with Mylan’s EpiPen pricing. These could include stakeholder analysis from \\"1.4 Stakeholders.pdf\\" and corporate culture from \\"2.5 Corporate Culture.pdf\\". --- # Body Paragraph 6: Stakeholder Impact Analysis Stakeholder theory asserts that companies have a responsibility not only to their shareholders but also to a wider community that includes consumers, employees, suppliers, and society at large. Mylan's decision to increase the price of EpiPens significantly affected various stakeholders, most notably the consumers who depend on this medication for life-threatening allergy attacks. Several stakeholders, including health insurance companies that bear the increased costs and schools mandated to stock EpiPens, face financial strain due to the monopolized pricing strategy. Additionally, shareholders and investors initially may have greeted the profit surge with approval, yet the subsequent reputational damage to Mylan and the legal repercussions negatively impacted long-term shareholder value. This analysis evidences the intricate web of stakeholder interests that Mylan affected and the subsequent need for corporate strategies that balance profit with social responsibility. # Body Paragraph 7: Corporate Culture and Ethical Climate Corporate culture heavily influences decision-making processes and the ethical climate within an organization. Mylan's aggressive pricing strategy, along with the defensive stance taken against criticism, suggests a corporate culture prioritizing financial results over patient accessibility and ethical considerations. A robust corporate culture nurtures standards of behavior that align with social welfare and ethical norms. However, the evidence suggests Mylan's internal environment favored market dominance and profit maximization, raising questions about the ethical compass and the integrity of the organizational culture. The dissonance between Mylan's actions and the expectations of a socially responsible entity reveals a culture that undermined the values of fairness and transparency, which are vital for sustaining trust and respect among stakeholders. --- These paragraphs provide a continued analysis of Mylan's handling of EpiPen’s pricing through the lenses of stakeholder theory and corporate culture. It's crucial to stitch these analyses together coherently and to link them back to the core research question on the ethical and economic adequacy of EpiPen pricing. An IB IA would typically delve deeper into these concepts with a critical approach, evaluating different perspectives and providing a balanced argument. In a full IA, this text would need to be supported with specific citations from your course materials and any external resources used to substantiate your arguments. Additionally, the inclusion of primary research would further strengthen the analysis and satisfy the IB's criteria for internal assessments."},{"prompt":"Give me a conclusion now","completion":"# Conclusion The investigation into Mylan's EpiPen pricing strategy reveals a confluence of ethical and economic considerations that call into question the adequacy of such practices within the pharmaceutical industry. Economically, Mylan capitalized on a monopolistic opportunity, exploiting its market dominance to implement exorbitant price increases that alienated patients and burdened the healthcare system. This strategy proved profitable in the short term yet unsustainable in the light of public outrage and legal challenges, suggesting an economic miscalculation when considering long-term profitability and stakeholder welfare. Ethically, Mylan's actions conflicted with the principles of virtue ethics and corporate social responsibility. In virtue of ethical business conduct, Mylan exhibited deficiencies in transparency, cooperation, and responsiveness to criticism. By placing profit margins above the ethical imperative to provide affordable life-saving medication, Mylan demonstrated a disregard for the foundational values of corporate stewardship and social welfare. Furthermore, the organizational culture within Mylan appeared to encourage decision-making that prioritized shareholders' interests at the expense of a balance between ethical obligations and economic performance. The far-reaching impact of Mylan's EpiPen pricing touches various dimensions of ethics and economics—from the individual patients grappling with affordability to the broader implications for healthcare accessibility. As this analysis unveils, the true extent of Mylan's ethical and economic adequacy must be measured against both the immediate financial gains and the enduring societal implications. While businesses must indeed seek profitability, the ultimate adequacy of economic practices cannot be divorced from the ethical landscape in which companies operate. A balance must be found where innovation, profitability, and moral responsibility coalesce to serve the multifaceted interests of all stakeholders involved. In conclusion, the exorbitant pricing of EpiPens by Mylan highlights a profound disconnect between corporate strategy and ethical necessity. It serves as a cautionary tale for the pharmaceutical industry, and a rallying cry for a reformed approach that harmonizes economic success with unwavering ethical conduct and equitable healthcare access. As such, it becomes imperative for businesses, regulators, and society to foster a climate where the fundamental right to health is not compromised by the pursuit of financial gain."},{"prompt":"Give me a one paragraph conclusion instead","completion":"# Conclusion The assessment of Mylan's significant EpiPen price hike through ethical and economic lenses concludes incongruously with the principles of equitable healthcare and responsible corporate conduct. Despite generating substantial short-term profits, Mylan's strategy resulted in widespread criticism, indicating ethical shortcomings in transparency and societal responsibility. The long-term economic ramifications, including potential damage to reputation and trustworthiness, suggest an imbalance in prioritizing profitability over patient welfare. Ultimately, Mylan's approach to the pricing of EpiPens stands as an example of corporate oversight that neglects the broader, imperative alignment of business practices with the ethical expectations of stakeholders and the sustainable economic well-being of the society it serves."},{"prompt":"give me body paragraph 8 and 9 as well","completion":"# Body Paragraph 8: Long-Term Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Myriad actors within the pharmaceutical industry have increasingly recognized the significance of long-term sustainability and corporate responsibility as critical components of their operational ethos. Mylan's initial financial success with EpiPen price increases belies a deeper concern for long-term viability, as prices that marginalize consumers can lead to legal repercussions and shifts in public policy that favor market competition. Sustainable practices necessitate pricing strategies that consider affordability and access while still incentivizing innovation. By prioritizing short-term gains over sustainable pricing, Mylan risked its future market position and eroded trust—both of which are fundamental to the long-term success and corporate responsibility that stakeholders increasingly demand from modern pharmaceutical companies. # Body Paragraph 9: The Role of Regulation and Industry Standards The Mylan EpiPen saga underscores the need for enhanced regulation and industry-wide standards that prevent exploitative pricing of essential medications. While market forces play a pivotal role in price determination, the pharmaceutical industry faces unique moral imperatives, given the life-or-death nature of its products. The outcry resulting from Mylan's pricing strategy suggests that self-regulation is insufficient when it comes to essential drugs. Thus, interventions such as price caps, increased transparency requirements, and incentives for generic drug production emerge as necessary measures to protect consumers and ensure fair market practices. These regulations serve to deter market abuse and ensure that the pharmaceutical industry upholds its ethical obligation to society while safeguarding economic interests."},{"prompt":"give me body paragraphs 10, 11, and 12","completion":"# Body Paragraph 10: Alternative Models for Pricing and Distribution The backlash against Mylan's pricing strategy suggests the need for alternative models for pharmaceutical pricing and distribution. Strategies such as value-based pricing and tiered pricing schemes could align the cost of drugs like EpiPens more closely with their actual value and cost of production, while also considering the patients' ability to pay. Additionally, implementing differential pricing across markets can ensure wider access to medication, particularly for vulnerable populations. Mylan's experience highlights the importance of adopting innovative and equitable models that balance profitability with social responsibility, allowing pharmaceutical companies to maintain a positive image, adhere to ethical standards, and cater to diverse demographic needs. # Body Paragraph 11: Impact on Research and Development Research and development (R&D) in the pharmaceutical industry is a double-edged sword—while it is essential for innovation and the creation of life-saving drugs, it also serves as a frequent justification for high drug prices. In Mylan's case, the argument that EpiPen price increases were necessary to fund R&D falls short when considering the subsequent pricing controversies and minimal changes made to the EpiPen during Mylan's tenure. This draws attention to the need for transparency and accountability in the allocation of revenues toward genuine innovation, rather than using R&D as a blanket rationale for disproportionate price hikes on essential medications. # Body Paragraph 12: Ethics of Profit in the Pharmaceutical Industry An ethical conundrum emerges when considering the role of profit in the pharmaceutical industry. While companies like Mylan are accountable to their shareholders to generate profits, there is a moral expectation to do so within the bounds of social good, especially when dealing with products that are life-saving. Profits gained at the expense of access to critical medicine call into question the ethical practices of the firm. The EpiPen situation serves as a stark reminder that profit motives must be balanced with the moral duty to safeguard human life, necessitating a re-examination of how profits are earned and the extent to which they are permitted to influence life-or-death decisions in healthcare. These paragraphs expand the analysis by exploring alternative pricing models, the interplay between R&D and pricing, and the ethical considerations of profit-making in an industry governed by the imperative to save lives."},{"prompt":"give me a new conclusion","completion":"# Conclusion The examination of Mylan's steep escalation of EpiPen prices illuminates a complex interplay between corporate profitability, social responsibility, and regulatory oversight within the pharmaceutical industry. While the pursuit of profits is inherent to any business model, the case of Mylan reveals the ethical pitfalls of placing revenue generation before patient accessibility, especially in the healthcare sector. The public outcry, alongside the call for stricter regulation, signals a disconnect between Mylan's strategy and the societal expectation for just and fair access to life-saving medications. The analysis serves as a reminder that corporate actions in healthcare bear profound ethical implications and demand a judicious balance between profit margins and the welfare of those reliant on critical medical products. As the industry moves forward, Mylan's experience with EpiPen pricing stands as a caution for pharmaceutical firms to navigate the fine line between commercial success and the ethical obligations to the communities they serve. The future sustainability of a company in this sector hinges on its ability to harmonize these often competing interests, advocating for pharmaceutical practices that uphold both economic viability and the inalienable right to health."},{"prompt":"The pricing of pharmaceutical products, especially those that are life-saving, is a matter of paramount importance that intersects the domains of ethics and economics.

While Mylan CEO Heather Bresch accepted “full responsibility” for the price hikes at one point, the company also shifted blame onto the complexities of the healthcare system. This obfuscation and lack of transparency do little to engender trust or demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and patient-oriented values, characteristics that are especially important when a company has such a significant influence on public health. # Body Paragraph 5: Ethical Considerations and Virtue Ethics Analysis From an ethical standpoint, Mylan’s EpiPen pricing strategy can be subjected to further scrutiny through the lens of virtue ethics. Virtue ethics posits that moral behavior is predicated upon the cultivation of virtuous character traits. Assessing Mylan’s actions against Pritchard’s virtues for morally responsible engineers, one finds the company’s commitment to openness, cooperation, and informative communication wanting. Mylan’s decision to eschew cooperation with Medicaid’s Drug Rebate Program and to hinder competition through aggressive legal strategies provides evidence of behavior that conflicts with the expected virtues. Such actions suggest a veering away from morally responsible business conduct, reinforcing concerns regarding the ethical adequacy of the company’s pricing decisions for EpiPens. # Body Paragraph 6: Stakeholder Impact Analysis Stakeholder theory asserts that companies have a responsibility not only to their shareholders but also to a wider community that includes consumers, employees, suppliers, and society at large. Mylan’s decision to increase the price of EpiPens significantly affected various stakeholders, most notably the consumers who depend on this medication for life-threatening allergy attacks. Several stakeholders, including health insurance companies that bear the increased costs and schools mandated to stock EpiPens, face financial strain due to the monopolized pricing strategy. Additionally, shareholders and investors initially may have greeted the profit surge with approval, yet the subsequent reputational damage to Mylan and the legal repercussions negatively impacted long-term shareholder value. This analysis evidences the intricate web of stakeholder interests that Mylan affected and the subsequent need for corporate strategies that balance profit with social responsibility. # Body Paragraph 7: Corporate Culture and Ethical Climate Corporate culture heavily influences decision-making processes and the ethical climate within an organization. Mylan’s aggressive pricing strategy, along with the defensive stance taken against criticism, suggests a corporate culture prioritizing financial results over patient accessibility and ethical considerations. A robust corporate culture nurtures standards of behavior that align with social welfare and ethical norms. However, the evidence suggests Mylan’s internal environment favored market dominance and profit maximization, raising questions about the ethical compass and the integrity of the organizational culture. The dissonance between Mylan’s actions and the expectations of a socially responsible entity reveals a culture that undermined the values of fairness and transparency, which are vital for sustaining trust and respect among stakeholders. # Body Paragraph 8: Long-Term Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Myriad actors within the pharmaceutical industry have increasingly recognized the significance of long-term sustainability and corporate responsibility as critical components of their operational ethos. Mylan’s initial financial success with EpiPen price increases belies a deeper concern for long-term viability, as prices that marginalize consumers can lead to legal repercussions and shifts in public policy that favor market competition. Sustainable practices necessitate pricing strategies that consider affordability and access while still incentivizing innovation. By prioritizing short-term gains over sustainable pricing, Mylan risked its future market position and eroded trust—both of which are fundamental to the long-term success and corporate responsibility that stakeholders increasingly demand from modern pharmaceutical companies. # Body Paragraph 9: The Role of Regulation and Industry Standards The Mylan EpiPen saga underscores the need for enhanced regulation and industry-wide standards that prevent exploitative pricing of essential medications. While market forces play a pivotal role in price determination, the pharmaceutical industry faces unique moral imperatives, given the life-or-death nature of its products. The outcry resulting from Mylan’s pricing strategy suggests that self-regulation is insufficient when it comes to essential drugs. Thus, interventions such as price caps, increased transparency requirements, and incentives for generic drug production emerge as necessary measures to protect consumers and ensure fair market practices. These regulations serve to deter market abuse and ensure that the pharmaceutical industry upholds its ethical obligation to society while safeguarding economic interests. # Body Paragraph 10: Alternative Models for Pricing and Distribution The backlash against Mylan’s pricing strategy suggests the need for alternative models for pharmaceutical pricing and distribution. Strategies such as value-based pricing and tiered pricing schemes could align the cost of drugs like EpiPens more closely with their actual value and cost of production, while also considering the patients’ ability to pay. Additionally, implementing differential pricing across markets can ensure wider access to medication, particularly for vulnerable populations. Mylan’s experience highlights the importance of adopting innovative and equitable models that balance profitability with social responsibility, allowing pharmaceutical companies to maintain a positive image, adhere to ethical standards, and cater to diverse demographic needs. # Body Paragraph 11: Impact on Research and Development Research and development (R&D) in the pharmaceutical industry is a double-edged sword—while it is essential for innovation and the creation of life-saving drugs, it also serves as a frequent justification for high drug prices. In Mylan’s case, the argument that EpiPen price increases were necessary to fund R&D falls short when considering the subsequent pricing controversies and minimal changes made to the EpiPen during Mylan’s tenure. This draws attention to the need for transparency and accountability in the allocation of revenues toward genuine innovation, rather than using R&D as a blanket rationale for disproportionate price hikes on essential medications. # Body Paragraph 12: Ethics of Profit in the Pharmaceutical Industry An ethical conundrum emerges when considering the role of profit in the pharmaceutical industry. While companies like Mylan are accountable to their shareholders to generate profits, there is a moral expectation to do so within the bounds of social good, especially when dealing with products that are life-saving. Profits gained at the expense of access to critical medicine call into question the ethical practices of the firm. The EpiPen situation serves as a stark reminder that profit motives must be balanced with the moral duty to safeguard human life, necessitating a re-examination of how profits are earned and the extent to which they are permitted to influence life-or-death decisions in healthcare.

Additionally, we should aim to synthesize the key points more effectively to build a unified argument throughout the essay. # Revised Introduction The ethical and economic implications of pharmaceutical product pricing, particularly for life-saving devices like the EpiPen, are of critical concern to a variety of stakeholders. Mylan Pharmaceuticals' approach to pricing the EpiPen has instigated a vigorous debate that oscillates between the defense of corporate profit strategies and the condemnation rooted in moral regard for patient care. As the device is indispensable for those prone to severe allergic reactions, the repercussions of its pricing resonate widely, influencing not only Mylan's finances but also affecting the day-to-day lives of patients who depend on the EpiPen. This analysis delves into the contentious decision by Mylan to increase EpiPen prices, weighing it against ethical considerations and market economics to determine the justifiability of such a move within our healthcare system. # Revised Body Paragraphs # Body Paragraph 1: Context of Mylan’s Pricing Decisions In 2007, upon acquiring EpiPen manufacturing rights, Mylan implemented substantial price rises, eliciting public disapproval. This marked a departure from the conventional role of pharmaceutical firms. Rather than cater to the dire needs of patients requiring immediate access to life-saving medication, Mylan's strategy seemed governed by market opportunism. It imposed a financial burden on those who had no choice but to acquiesce to the inflated costs—despite carrying two EpiPens being a necessity for survival, not merely a consumer preference. Literature suggests that these price increases surpassed levels needed for product enhancement, which raises critical questions about Mylan's motivations and the implicit ethical disregard in their decision-making process. # Body Paragraph 2: The Economic Fallout and Patient Access Mylan's pricing policies disrupted patient behavior economically, leading to less accessible medications. According to Westermann-Clark's insights, the unaffordability resulting from Mylan's monopoly caused significant prescription abandonment. This highlights a concerning trend wherein economic decisions could directly hinder patient health and wellbeing. Such an outcome contradicts the ethos of the healthcare sector, raising concerns about whether Mylan’s economic interests were disproportionately prioritized over fundamental patient needs. # Body Paragraph 3: The Unequal Impact of Pricing The economic impact of Mylan's pricing decisions has been acutely felt across various socioeconomic strata, amplifying existing disparities in healthcare access. The case of the EpiPen has revealed how a pricing strategy can inadvertently privilege the affluent while disenfranchising lower-income patient groups. This divergence not only affects individual health outcomes but marks an alarming ethical oversight, challenging the foundational principle of equitable medical care within a market-driven economy. # Body Paragraph 4: Mylan’s Dialogue with the Public Mylan's response to the controversy around EpiPen pricing has been characterized by obfuscation and non-transparency. The mixed signals sent by Mylan's leadership, shifting responsibility between the company and the larger healthcare industry, did little to clarify the situation or to reassure patients and stakeholders of the company's ethical responsibility. These actions stand in stark contrast to the societal expectations of transparency and integrity from organizations with such a profound impact on public health. # Body Paragraph 5: A Virtue Ethics Perspective Through the virtue ethics framework, Mylan's handling of EpiPen pricing is further called into question. The company's inconsistent application of virtues, such as openness and cooperativeness, reflects a deficiency in moral responsibility. By obstructing cooperation with public programs and stifling competition, Mylan's actions fall short of the moral and ethical standards expected in the practice of engineering and corporate governance, particularly within the realm of public health. # Body Paragraph 6: Examining Stakeholder Influence Mylan's pricing strategy had a ripple effect on a broad spectrum of stakeholders. The high cost of EpiPens placed a strain on consumers, healthcare institutions, and insurers while conflicting with the concept of stakeholder theory, which calls for corporate actions that benefit a wide array of involved parties. The negative repercussions extended to the investors, suggesting a misalignment between short-term profit and the long-term health of the company and its varied stakeholders. This example reinforces the necessity for a holistic approach to corporate decision-making that incorporates the values and welfare of all stakeholders. # Body Paragraph 7: The Culture Within Mylan Mylan’s internal culture emerges as a pivotal factor driving the EpiPen pricing debacle. The defensive stance taken against public criticism and a focus on maximizing profits at the cost of patient affordability reflect a corporate culture misaligned with core ethical values. The implications of such an environment signal a need for a shift toward more ethical practices and patient-centered policies. A transformation in corporate philosophy could lay the groundwork for trust rebuilding and a reorientation towards social responsibility. # Body Paragraph 8: The Path to Sustainability For Mylan, and the industry at large, aligning business practices with sustainability and corporate social responsibility has become increasingly important. Mylan's approach indicated a shortsighted focus on financial gain, which later undermined its market standing and consumer trust. A sustainable model would consider affordability, transparency, and innovation—ensuring long-term success while fulfilling ethical obligations toward stakeholders. # Body Paragraph 9: Influence of Regulatory Standards The Mylan case emphasizes the vital role of regulatory frameworks in maintaining ethical market behaviors. Without sufficient regulatory provisions, self-governing mechanisms may prove inadequate, leaving room for exploitation, especially in markets where products are as critical as the EpiPen. Imposing regulations could safeguard the equitable distribution of essential medications while upholding an ethical benchmark for pharmaceutical companies. # Body Paragraph 10: Pursuit of Innovative Pricing Models Given the controversy surrounding Mylan's pricing, exploring alternative models, such as value-based and differential pricing, seems essential. These models offer a viable solution to balance financial goals with the ethical distribution of healthcare products, thereby ensuring broader access and promoting fairness within the market. This shift towards innovative pricing could be Mylan’s opportunity to demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness to public needs. # Body Paragraph 11: Transparency in R&D Investment The defense of high drug prices under the guise of funding Research and Development has been critiqued in Mylan's EpiPen strategy. Calls for greater transparency in how pharmaceutical companies allocate revenue towards innovation highlight a need for accountability in justifying price increases. Ensuring investments in R&D translate into tangible benefits for patients is essential for reconciling fiscal strategies with a commitment to advancing healthcare. # Body Paragraph 12: Profits vs. Ethical Healthcare The ethical dimensions of profiteering in the pharmaceutical industry are profoundly complex. Corporations like Mylan must balance their fiduciary responsibilities with a fundamental commitment to preserving life. Profiting at the expense of patient access to indispensable medicines like the EpiPen raises pressing ethical questions about how profitability is pursued. The Mylan case serves as an impetus to critically assess the moral implications of business strategies, particularly those directly affecting human health and well-being. # Unified Conclusion The ethical and economic scrutiny stirred by Mylan's steep EpiPen pricing culminates in a call for reassessment of how life-saving medications are valued and provided to those in need. Mylan’s strategic misstep showcases the broader ramifications of neglecting the social contract that underpins the pharmaceutical industry's role in society. While profitability is undeniably at the heart of corporate success, it must not overshadow the moral imperative to ensure access to vital medical treatments. From regulation to innovation in pricing models, the path ahead requires a deliberate and concerted effort to establish practices that are both financially sound and ethically grounded. The pharmaceutical industry stands at a crossroads where it must redefine its priorities, aligning them with the moral and utilitarian demands of healthcare, promising a future where every individual’s right to health is not only recognized but zealously upheld."},{"prompt":"| Method | Content | Information | | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Amazon Products to Blog | Product Reviews<br />Top 10<br />Product vs Product<br /> | Write about different Amazon products and insert Amazon affiliate links throughout each post.<br />Profit is earned through Amazon's Affiliate Program | | Graphic Resources to Blog | Graphic Product Descriptions<br />Graphic Resource Bundle Lists<br />Top 10<br /> | Write about different graphic resources such as fonts, templates, effects, etc on GraphicRiver and insert affiliate links to product page<br />Profit is earned through GraphicRiver/Envato or similar programs | | Audio Resources to Blog | Audio Product Descriptions<br />Audio Product Reviews<br />Audio Bundle Lists<br /> | Write about various audio resources such as samples, effects, and kits on AudioJungle and insert affiliate links to product page.<br />Profit is earned through AudioJungle/Envato or similar programs | | Affiliate Program/Network Reviews to Blog | Affiliate Network Information<br />Network vs Network<br />Top 10<br /> | Write about various affiliate networks and programs available and insert affiliate link to affiliate signup page.<br />Profit is earned through referred affiliate's long-term earnings through the affiliate network/program | | Video Resources to Blog | Video Resource Product Description<br />Video Resource Bundle Lists<br />Top 10<br /> | Write about various video resources such as templates, stock footage, effects on VideoHive and insert affiliate links to product page.<br />Profit is earned through VideoHive/Envato or similar programs | | Themes/Plugins to Blog | Wordpress Theme Reviews<br />Wordpress Plugin Reviews<br />Website Template Reviews<br />Ecommerce Theme Reviews<br />Plugin Bundle Lists<br />Theme Bundle Lists | Write about various web design themes and plugins availables for different CMS platforms and insert affiliate links to product page.<br />Profit is earned thought ThemeForest/Envato | | Web Hosting Reviews to Blog | Web Hosting Service Reviews<br />Web Hosting Bundle Lists<br />Web Hosting Offers<br />Domain Offers<br />VPS Offers<br />Top 10 | Write about various web hosting companies and offers they may have with affiliate links to the offers.<br />Profit is earned through each hosting companies individual affiliate programs |","completion":"These content methods describe various strategies for monetizing a blog by writing about products or services and incorporating affiliate links.

Now imagine that you have a robot named Argo CD to help you with this. Argo CD's job is to make sure that your Lego set always looks exactly like the picture in the instructions, even if someone else tries to change how it's built. So, here's what Argo CD does: 1. **Looks at the Instructions:** Argo CD first checks the instructions you've given it. In real life, these instructions are written in special files (like YAML files) stored in a place called a Git repository. This is like your Lego set manual, which tells you how all the pieces should be put together to make the final model. 2. **Inspects the Lego Set:** Argo CD then looks at the actual Lego set (your applications running in Kubernetes) to see how it's currently built. 3. **Compares Both:** It compares the Lego set to the instructions to see if there are differences. If someone built part of the Lego set wrong, or if a piece got knocked off accidentally, Argo CD will notice this because it doesn't match the picture in the manual. 4. **Fixes Differences:** If Argo CD finds that the actual Lego set doesn't look like it should according to the instructions, it takes action. Argo CD will rebuild the Lego set to match the instructions exactly, adding or removing pieces as needed. 5. **Keeps Checking:** Argo CD does this check regularly, not just once. It's like having a robot continuously making sure that your Lego set is always built right, no matter what changes. 6. **Tells You About It:** Argo CD also has a dashboard where you can see what your Lego set (your applications) is supposed to look like and what it currently looks like. If they don't match, you'll know immediately because Argo CD will tell you. So basically, Argo CD is like a robot helper for managing and maintaining your applications in Kubernetes, ensuring they always run as they're supposed to, just like keeping your Lego set built according to the manual."},{"prompt":"Argocd vs a Operator in K8s","completion":"Argo CD and Kubernetes Operators are tools designed for different purposes within the Kubernetes ecosystem, but they can both help manage applications in a Kubernetes cluster. Let's break down the differences between them. **Argo CD:** - **Purpose:** Argo CD is a continuous delivery tool that automatically deploys and maintains your applications in a Kubernetes cluster according to the definitions stored in a Git repository (GitOps). It ensures the state of your applications in the cluster matches what you've defined in your Git source. - **How It Works:** Argo CD monitors a Git repository for changes to your application definitions (manifests). When it detects changes, it automatically applies those changes to your Kubernetes cluster, keeping your applications synchronized with your repository. - **Visualization:** Argo CD has a web UI that shows you the status of your applications, differences between your cluster and repository, and it provides a way for you to manually sync if needed. - **Scope:** It's designed to handle the deployment and management of many applications across your entire Kubernetes cluster and is not application-specific. **Kubernetes Operators:** - **Purpose:** A Kubernetes Operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. An Operator is an application-specific controller that extends the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex stateful applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user. - **How It Works:** Operators encode application-specific knowledge and best practices into software that can manage an application as a human operator would. An Operator uses the custom resource definitions (CRDs) specific to an application to handle the life cycle management of that application. - **Scope:** Operators are often made for specific applications or services (like databases, message queues, etc.). They know how to scale, upgrade, back up, restore, and troubleshoot these applications. - **Automation Level:** Operators can manage much more than just the deployment; they can automate operational tasks like backups, restores, configuration changes, and advanced deployment strategies like canary or rolling updates. **Comparison Summary:** - Argo CD is a general-purpose tool that automates the deployment and synchronization of applications through a Git-based workflow across the entire cluster. - Kubernetes Operators are designed for specific applications, which they manage throughout their entire lifecycle with domain-specific knowledge. - Argo CD is GitOps-oriented, focusing on syncing your applications with their desired state defined in Git. - Operators are application-oriented, focusing on all operational aspects of managing that application on Kubernetes, often going beyond just syncing state. You can actually use Argo CD and Operators together; Argo CD can deploy Operators, and those Operators can manage specific applications. This melding takes advantage of both of their strengths: Argo CD's GitOps approach to maintaining a desired state and the Operators' specialized application knowledge."},{"prompt":"You are an expert Resume and cover letter writer.

Can you describe a time when you had to solve a scalability issue, particularly in a \\"thundering herd\\" scenario? How did you approach it?** Response: \\"At DreamWorks Animation, I led a project to deploy a DBaaS platform capable of serving hundreds of applications. We anticipated significant load during major releases, similar to a thundering herd scenario. To address this, we utilized Kubernetes operator patterns for orchestration and automation playbooks, ensuring our databases could scale up rapidly under heavy load. We performed chaos engineering tests with Gremlin to simulate sudden surges in traffic, which allowed us to fine-tune our auto-scaling policies and reduce failover times by 60%. Furthermore, we built a highly available Cassandra cluster across multiple Azure VPCs, ensuring that even under the extreme load of a global event, the system remained resilient.\\" Confidence Rating: 9/10 **2. Tell us about your experience with EKS, Kubernetes, and AWS. Can you give us specific examples of how you've used these tools to improve platform operations?** Response: \\"During my time at DreamWorks Animation as a Cloud Architect, I heavily utilized AWS services, EKS, and Kubernetes to improve platform operations. I led the implementation of a Kubernetes-based DBaaS, which required in-depth knowledge of AWS IAM, networking, and load balancing to ensure secure and optimized request routing. Deploying a Cassandra cluster on AWS involved careful setup of EKS for container orchestration and ensuring seamless load balancing across multiple availability zones. These experiences have honed my ability to leverage EKS and Kubernetes in cloud-native environments to enhance scalability and reliability.\\" Confidence Rating: 9/10 **3. What programming languages are you proficient in, and how have you utilized them in your past projects?** Response: \\"I am proficient in Python and Shell scripting, which I have used extensively in my past projects. At DreamWorks Animation, I utilized Python for developing automation playbooks, orchestrating DBaaS deployments, and conducting chaos engineering tests. Shell scripting was fundamental for creating infrastructure-as-code templates that significantly expedited database and application deployment processes. My programming skills have been instrumental in automating operations and enabling self-service functionalities within the platforms I've managed.\\" Confidence Rating: 10/10 **4. Can you share your experience with mentoring junior engineers and fostering a collaborative team environment?** Response: \\"In my role at Initian INC, I had the pleasure of mentoring two junior engineers on Cassandra database operations. I emphasized the importance of clear communication, shared learning, and taking a collaborative approach to problem-solving. Fostering a collaborative environment was about encouraging regular knowledge-sharing sessions and leading by example in seeking input from team members. This helped create a supportive atmosphere where team members felt valued and motivated to contribute.

Can you walk us through your process after an outage or performance issue?** Response: \\"Post-incident analysis is crucial for preventing future outages and improving system stability. My approach begins with collecting and examining all relevant data, including logs and metrics leading up to the incident. I work collaboratively with the relevant team members to identify the root cause, whether it's a code issue, infrastructure failure, or a scalability limitation. Once the cause is identified, my focus shifts to developing workarounds or permanent solutions, updating runbooks, and ensuring the knowledge gained from the incident is disseminated across the team. Additionally, I refine monitoring and alerting systems to detect potential issues proactively.\\" Confidence Rating: 8/10 These questions and responses are informed by the job description and draw upon your proven track record in similar roles, as outlined in your resume.

迭代是指通过重复执行一段代码，逐步逼近问题的解决方案。迭代通常使用循环结构来实现，通过设置循环条件、初始化变量和更新变量的值来控制循环的执行次数。迭代的过程是有确定终止条件的，当满足终止条件时，循环停止并返回结果。迭代通常用于解决可以通过重复运算得到答案的问题，例如遍历数组、计算阶乘、查找最大值等。 递归是指将一个问题拆分为一个或多个相同类型的子问题，并通过调用自身来解决这些子问题。递归的过程是通过逐级调用函数来实现的，每次调用函数时，问题的规模都会减小。递归需要定义递归终止条件，当满足终止条件时，递归停止并返回结果。递归通常用于解决可以通过不断拆分为子问题来解决的问题，例如计算斐波那契数列、遍历树结构、求解二叉树的最大深度等。 总结来说，迭代和递归是两种常见的解决问题的方法。迭代通过重复执行一段代码逐步逼近问题的解决方案，而递归通过将问题拆分为一个或多个子问题，并通过调用自身来解决这些子问题。"},{"prompt":"Pemindahan kepemilikan objek ijarah kepada penyewa dalam ijarah muntahiyah bittamlik, apabila
