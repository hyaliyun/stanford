For a triangle with area (A), if it has a lattice point on its boundary that is not a vertex, we can split it into two smaller triangles and apply the induction hypothesis. If it has a lattice point in its interior, we can split it into three smaller triangles and apply the induction hypothesis. If there are no such points, we are in the base case scenario. 5. **Generalization to Polygons:** For any lattice polygon, we can triangulate it and apply the induction hypothesis to each triangle.

However, there is no integer (y) such that (y^{2015} equiv 2 mod 2017) because 2 is not a 2015th power residue modulo 2017. 7. We now analyze the possible values of (y): - If (y equiv 1 mod 2017), then (y = 1 + 2017k) for some integer (k). Substituting (y = 1) into the original equation, we get: [ x^{2017} - 1 = (x - 1)(1^{2015} - 1) = 0 ] This is not possible for any positive integer (x). - If (y equiv -1 mod 2017), then (y = 2016 + 2017k) for some integer (k). Substituting (y = 2016) into the original equation, we get: [ x^{2017} - 1 = (x - 1)(2016^{2015} - 1) ] Since (2016 equiv -1 mod 2017), we have: [ 2016^{2015} equiv (-1)^{2015} equiv -1 mod 2017 ] Thus, the equation becomes: [ x^{2017} - 1 = (x - 1)(-1 - 1) = -2(x - 1) ] This implies: [ x^{2017} - 1 = -2x + 2 ] Rearranging, we get: [ x^{2017} + 2x - 3 = 0 ] This equation has no positive integer solutions for (x). 8.

Then she allows herself the following operations: she chooses a letter from the word written on the board (let's say lambda) and replaces it with a finite sequence of letters that are strictly greater than lambda in alphabetical order (the sequence can even be empty or, conversely, very long, in which case Aline will probably have to write very small). Is any such sequence of operations necessarily finite?","completion":"1. **Assumption and Initial Setup:** We will assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the sequence of operations allowed (replacing a letter with letters that are strictly greater in alphabetical order) could be infinite. 2. **Considering the Smallest Letter:** Focus on the smallest letter lambda that Aline can choose an infinite number of times. Note that Aline can only replace lambda with letters that are strictly larger than lambda. 3. **Eventual Elimination of Smaller Letters:** Eventually, after repeatedly choosing and replacing smaller letters, Aline's string will consist of letters that are all strictly greater than lambda. This is because, when lambda is chosen, any replacements can only be larger letters. 4. **Finite Occurrences of lambda:** Suppose there are ( k ) occurrences of lambda at some point, and consider this configuration. Once those ( k ) occurrences of lambda are all replaced by larger letters, lambda will no longer be present in the string. Therefore, since lambda can only be chosen ( k ) times, we arrive at a contradiction if we assume infinitely many operations. 5. **Monovariant Interpretation:** Instead of just counting the number of operations, we frame the problem using a lexicographical order of sequences. - Construct a tuple that counts the occurrences of each letter within Aline's string. Let this be a 26-tuple ( left( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{26} right) ), where each ( x_i ) represents the count of the ( i )-th letter of the alphabet. - When Aline replaces a letter, the resulting string will have a new tuple that is lexicographically smaller than the previous one. 6. **Lexicographical Decrease:** - Each replacement operation strictly decreases the lexicographical order of our 26-tuple. - By the property of lexicographical order and the foundation of a monovariant, once a sequence is strictly decreasing, it must eventually terminate. - This is crucial because each operation that Aline performs results in a tuple that is strictly smaller in the lexicographical sense. 7. **Conclusion by Recurrence on ( n ):** We use recurrence over ( n ) to argue that a tuple defined as above, if it strictly decreases lexicographically, must necessarily be finite. This can be reasoned as each operation reduces the possible choices left, bounding the process runtime.

Let’s analyze the first group of four islanders: - If all four islanders are **truth-tellers (poctivci)**, their response should be \\"4\\" as there are four truth-tellers in the group. - If there are **three or fewer truth-tellers**, then: - The truth-tellers would each say the number of truth-tellers in the group. - The liars would each say a number that is not the count of truth-tellers. Hence, having all four responses be the same number implies: - The number is truthful and everybody agrees on it. - The only way for liars to unanimously lie in the same manner consistently is improbable since they would not lie consistently. Therefore, the responses being the same suggests either all are truth-tellers or all are liars: - If all are **truth-tellers**, the consistent number must be \\"4\\". - If all are **liars**, any consistent lie indicating zero truth-tellers is impossible because liars would say non-zero numbers.

Since truth-tellers all say the actual number of truth-tellers: - For the count \\"k\\" to be truthful, it should appear exactly \\"k\\" times. - Hence \\"3\\" being repeated exactly 3 times suggests it fits for the truth-tellers since 3 truth-tellers would claim \\"3 truth-tellers\\" consistently. - The responses \\"0\\" and \\"1\\" are likely from the liars. Conclusion: - This implies there could be **3 truth-tellers** in this group. - Similarly, if there were **1 truth-teller**, it would only result in the entry \\"1\\" and one instance of repeating a count consistently isn’t sufficient to deduce from liars' vague responses.

Specifically, if (a,b,c,d) is a \\"good\\" set, then (frac{a}{k}, frac{b}{k}, frac{c}{k}, frac{d}{k}) is also a \\"good\\" set where k = gcd(a,b,c,d). - Without loss of generality, assume gcd(a, b, c, d) = 1.

Also, both the polynomial and its derivative must have at least one distinct root each. We can start by proposing a candidate polynomial and then verify the conditions stated in the problem. 1. **Proposing the Polynomial**: Consider the polynomial ( P(x) = (x + 1)^5 + 32 ). This polynomial is of degree 5 as required. 2. **Finding the Roots of the Polynomial**: We first look for the roots of ( P(x) ). The polynomial can be written as: [ P(x) = (x + 1)^5 + 32 ] To find the roots, we set ( P(x) = 0 ): [ (x + 1)^5 + 32 = 0 ] [ (x + 1)^5 = -32 ] Taking the fifth root on both sides, we get: [ x + 1 = -2 ] Solving for ( x ), we obtain: [ x = -3 ] Thus, the polynomial ( P(x) ) has a single root at ( x = -3 ), which is negative as required. 3. **Finding the Derivative of the Polynomial**: Next, we find the derivative of ( P(x) ): [ P'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left[ (x + 1)^5 + 32 right] ] [ P'(x) = 5(x + 1)^4 ] 4. **Finding the Roots of the Derivative**: We now find the roots of ( P'(x) ). Set ( P'(x) = 0 ): [ 5(x + 1)^4 = 0 ] [ (x + 1)^4 = 0 ] Solving for ( x ), we get: [ x + 1 = 0 ] [ x = -1 ] The derivative ( P'(x) ) has a single root at ( x = -1 ), which is negative. 5. **Verification**: - The polynomial ( P(x) ) has only one root which is ( x = -3 ) - The derivative ( P'(x) ) has only one root which is ( x = -1 ) - All roots of ( P(x) ) and ( P'(x) ) are negative, meeting the first condition of the problem. - Both the polynomial and its derivative have at least one distinct root each, satisfying the second condition. # Conclusion: Thus, the polynomial ( P(x) = (x + 1)^5 + 32 ) obeys all the conditions stated in the problem.

The isoclines are therefore parallel straight lines of the form ( y = 2x - k ). 4.

We make four-digit numbers that don’t start with zero: - We need to subtract the arrangements having zero in the beginning. - Four positions remain for the remaining digits (2, 2, 2, 9). - Using the three '2's and one '9', the number of ways to arrange these is frac{4!}{3!} = 4 (because 4! is for all distinct and 3! accounts for repeating '2's). 3. Count the total number of valid number combinations: - All possible arrangements are 20, but those with zero at the start are 4. - Therefore, 20 - 4 = 16 valid four-digit sequences using the digits 2, 2, 2, 9, and 0. boxed{16}"},{"prompt":"Prove that for infinitely many positive integers ( n ), there exist pairwise distinct positive integers ( a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} ) such that [ a_{1}^{2} a_{2}^{2} cdots a_{n}^{2} 4left(a_{1}^{2} + a_{2}^{2} + cdots + a_{n}^{2}right) ] is a perfect square.","completion":"To prove that for any infinite number of positive integers (n), there exist infinitely many distinct positive integers (a_1, a_2, dots, a_n) such that [ a_1^2 a_2^2 cdots a_n^2 - 4(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + cdots + a_n^2) ] is a perfect square, we can address the problem by verifying two conditions. **Step 1: Proving Condition (1)** Condition (1) states that for any infinite number of positive integers (n), there exist positive integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) such that the expression (f_n(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n)) is a perfect square, and (a_1 < a_2).

By suitably choosing (a_1) and (a_2), the expression (f_2(a_1, a_2)) can always be made a perfect square by subtracting an appropriate multiple of 4. If the appropriate multiple of 4 is (4 cdot (n-2)), then: [ f_n(a_1, a_2, 1, ldots, 1) ] is a perfect square. **Step 2: Proving Condition (2)** Condition (2) states that for any given (n geq 3), if (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) are positive integers such that (f_n(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n)) is a perfect square, and for some index (k) (where (1 < k < n)), there exists an integer (a > a_k) such that: [ f_n(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, a, a_{k+2}, ldots, a_n) ] is also a perfect square. Let's write: [ f_n(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) = b^2 ] Given that (f_n(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, a_{k+2}, ldots, a_n) = b^2), we examine the Pell's equation: [ left(a_1^2 cdots a_k^2 a_{k+2}^2 cdots a_n^2 - 4right) x^2 - y^2 = 4left(a_1^2 + cdots + a_k^2 + a_{k+2}^2 + cdots + a_n^2right) ] The Pell's equation is known to have infinitely many integer solutions, thereby guaranteeing the existence of a solution ((a, c)) for which (a > a_k). Hence, such (a) exists, making (f_n(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, a, a_{k+2}, ldots, a_n)) a perfect square.

This simplifies to S_n = n(n+1). - Since this holds for n=1, we have S_n = n(n+1) for all n in mathbb{N}^*. - Therefore, for n geq 2, a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = n(n+1) - (n-1)n = 2n.

Next, we apply the double angle identity for cosine, cos(2theta) = 2cos^2(theta) - 1, to the first two cosines: cos 80^{circ}cos 40^{circ} = frac{1}{2}left(cos 40^{circ} + cos 120^{circ}right) = frac{1}{2}cos 40^{circ} - frac{1}{4}, where we used that cos 120^{circ} = -frac{1}{2}.

Again, apply the double angle identity for cosine to cos 40^{circ}: left(frac{1}{2}cos 40^{circ} - frac{1}{4}right)cos 20^{circ} = left(frac{1}{4}cos 20^{circ} + frac{1}{4}right)cos 20^{circ} - frac{1}{4}cos 20^{circ} = frac{1}{4}cos^2 20^{circ}.

At this point, we notice that we can't simplify the expression further without using a numerical approximation. However, we can confirm that the given answer, frac{1}{8}, is indeed correct. We multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2sin 20^{circ}: frac{1}{8}left(frac{1}{2}cos 20^{circ} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 1right) = frac{1}{8} cdot frac{sin 40^{circ} + sqrt{3}sin 20^{circ} + 2sin 20^{circ}}{sin 20^{circ}}. Now, using the sum-to-product identity, sin(a) + sin(b) = 2sinleft(frac{a + b}{2}right)cosleft(frac{a - b}{2}right), we can simplify the numerator: sin 40^{circ} + sqrt{3}sin 20^{circ} + 2sin 20^{circ} = sin 40^{circ} + (sqrt{3} + 2)sin 20^{circ} = 2sin 30^{circ}cos 10^{circ} + 2sin 50^{circ}cos 20^{circ}.

During systematic sampling, typically a starting point is chosen randomly, and then every k-th member of the population is selected (where k=frac{text{population size}}{text{sample size}}). In this case, since all individuals stand an equal chance to be the starting point, and every k-th individual thereafter is selected, each individual has the same chance of being selected out of the 2000.

Calculating P(X=0): - The person can either get the question they have no idea about wrong and one of the questions they have an idea about wrong, or get both questions they have an idea about wrong. - The probability of getting the question with no idea wrong is 1-frac{1}{4}=frac{3}{4}, and the probability of getting a question with an idea wrong is 1-frac{2}{3}=frac{1}{3}. - Therefore, P(X=0)=frac{C_{1}^{1}C_{3}^{1}}{C_{4}^{2}}timesfrac{3}{4}timesfrac{1}{3}+frac{C_{3}^{2}}{C_{4}^{2}}timesleft(frac{1}{3}right)^2=frac{13}{72}. Calculating P(X=1): - The person can either get the question they have no idea about wrong and one of the questions they have an idea about right, or vice versa, or get one of the two questions they have an idea about right. - Therefore, P(X=1)=frac{C_{1}^{1}C_{3}^{1}}{C_{4}^{2}}timesleft[left(frac{3}{4}timesfrac{2}{3}right)+left(frac{1}{4}timesfrac{1}{3}right)right]+frac{C_{3}^{2}}{C_{4}^{2}}times C_{2}^{1}timesfrac{2}{3}timesfrac{1}{3}=frac{37}{72}. Calculating P(X=2): - The person can either get the question they have no idea about right and one of the questions they have an idea about right, or get both questions they have an idea about right. - Therefore, P(X=2)=frac{C_{1}^{1}C_{3}^{1}}{C_{4}^{2}}timesfrac{1}{4}timesfrac{2}{3}+frac{C_{3}^{2}}{C_{4}^{2}}timesleft(frac{2}{3}right)^2=frac{11}{36}. The probability distribution of X is summarized as follows: - P(X=0)=frac{13}{72} - P(X=1)=frac{37}{72} - P(X=2)=frac{11}{36} The expectation of X is calculated as: E(X)=0timesfrac{13}{72}+1timesfrac{37}{72}+2timesfrac{11}{36}=frac{9}{8} # Part 2: Choosing Between Set A and Set B For set B, where the person has a probability of 0.6 of answering each question correctly and chooses 2 questions: - The expectation of Y, the number of questions answered correctly in set B, is E(Y)=2times 0.6=1.2. Comparing the expectations: - For set A, E(X)=frac{9}{8}=1.125. - For set B, E(Y)=1.2. Since 1.2 > 1.125, the person should choose set B for a higher expectation of correct answers.

Here, a = a-1, b = -4, and c = 2a. Plugging these into the discriminant formula gives: [ 16 - 4(a-1)(2a) = 0 ] Expanding and simplifying, we get: [ 16 - 8a^{2} + 8a = 0 ] Rearranging, we have: [ 8a^{2} - 8a + 16 = 0 ] Dividing the entire equation by 8 yields: [ a^{2} - a + 2 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find that it does not have real roots, which was a mistake in the initial solution. Let's correct the discriminant calculation: [ b^{2}-4ac = (-4)^{2} - 4(a-1)(2a) = 16 - 8a^{2} + 8a ] Setting this equal to 0 for exactly one point of intersection: [ 16 - 8a^{2} + 8a = 0 Rightarrow 8a^{2} - 8a + 16 = 0 ] This was incorrectly simplified. Correctly, the discriminant should be: [ b^{2}-4ac = 16 - 4(a-1)2a = 0 ] Solving for a gives: [ 16 - 8a + 8a^{2} = 0 ] Which simplifies correctly to: [ 8a^{2} - 8a + 16 = 0 ] This equation was incorrectly solved initially. The correct approach to find a involves realizing the mistake in the discriminant equation setup. The correct setup leads to a different quadratic equation that does not yield a_{1}=-1 and a_{2}=2 directly. Let's correct the process: **Correcting the Process:** For the quadratic to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be zero. However, the discriminant calculation error led to confusion. The correct discriminant for a quadratic equation is b^2 - 4ac. For the given function, if it's quadratic (a neq 1), we don't directly solve for a without correctly setting up the discriminant. **Case 2: Linear Function (a = 1)** When a-1=0, the function becomes linear. Solving for a gives: [ a = 1 ] Given the confusion in the quadratic case, the correct conclusion is that for a linear function, a = 1 is a valid solution. **Conclusion:** The mistake in the quadratic case analysis led to incorrect solutions. The correct value of a for which the function intersects the x-axis exactly once due to being linear is a = 1. For the quadratic case, a more detailed re-analysis is required to correctly identify the values of a, if any, that satisfy the condition based on the corrected discriminant calculation.

To continue, we need to demonstrate (a^5 - a) is divisible by both 2 and 5. Since 10 = 2 * 5, divisibility by 10 will follow directly if these two conditions are met. 4. **Divisibility by 2**: Since (a) is an integer, its even-ness or odd-ness will be mirrored in (a^5), because raising an even number to any power yields an even number, and raising an odd number to any power yields an odd number.

Since the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (3,0), we have the property that f(x+3) = -f(-x+3). This implies that for any x, f(x) = -f(-x+6). Taking the derivative of both sides gives us f'(x) = f'(-x+6), or equivalently, g(x) = g(-x+6). This shows that g(x) is symmetric about the line x=3. 2. Given that g(2x+frac{3}{2}) is an even function, we have g(2x+frac{3}{2}) = g(-2x+frac{3}{2}). By setting x = frac{x}{2}, we get g(x+frac{3}{2}) = g(-x+frac{3}{2}), which implies that g(x) is symmetric about the line x=frac{3}{2}. 3. Combining the symmetries, we find that g(x+3) = g(x), indicating that g(x) has a period of T=3. 4. Knowing g(1) = 2 and g(3) = -3, and using the periodicity of g(x), we can calculate the sum sum_{k=1}^{2024}g(k). Since the period is 3, we can group the terms in sets of three, where each set sums to g(1) + g(2) + g(3). Given g(2) = g(1) = 2 (from the symmetry and given values), we have g(1) + g(2) + g(3) = 2 + 2 - 3 = 1. 5. Therefore, the sum can be calculated as [g(1) + g(2) + g(3)] times 674 + g(1) + g(2), because there are 674 complete sets of three in 2024 numbers, and the last set includes just g(1) and g(2).

We will use a recursive approach to solve this problem. 1. **Define the Recursive Function:** Let ( a_n ) be the number of ways to arrange ( n ) coins such that no two adjacent coins are face to face. We need to find ( a_8 ). 2. **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), there are 2 ways to place a single coin (face up or face down). Thus, ( a_1 = 2 ). 3. **Recursive Case:** If the bottom coin is facing up, there is exactly 1 way to arrange the remaining ( n-1 ) coins because the orientation of every single coin is forced. If the bottom coin is facing down, there are ( a_{n-1} ) ways to arrange the remaining ( n-1 ) coins.

Let's follow the steps closely: 1. **Substitution**: Let t=2^{x}. This substitution is useful because 4^{x} = (2^{x})^{2} = t^{2} and 2^{x+2} = 2^{x} cdot 2^{2} = 4t. This simplifies our function to a new form in terms of t. 2. **Domain Transformation**: Given xin left[0,3right], we need to transform this domain into the domain for t. Since t=2^{x}, when x=0, t=2^{0}=1, and when x=3, t=2^{3}=8. Therefore, the domain for t is 1leqslant tleqslant 8. 3. **Function Transformation**: With the substitution, the function f(x) transforms into g(t) = t^{2} - 4t - 1. This can be further simplified to g(t) = (t-2)^{2} - 5 by completing the square, where tin left[1,8right]. 4. **Analysis of g(t)**: The function g(t) = (t-2)^{2} - 5 is a parabola that opens upwards and is symmetric about the line t=2. This symmetry implies that the function is monotonically decreasing on left[1,2right) and monotonically increasing on left(2,8right]. 5. **Finding Extrema**: Since the parabola opens upwards and is symmetric about t=2, the minimum value occurs at t=2. Substituting t=2 into g(t), we get g(2) = (2-2)^{2} - 5 = -5. To find the maximum value, we consider the endpoints of the domain of t. Since the function is increasing on left(2,8right], the maximum occurs at t=8. Substituting t=8 into g(t), we get g(8) = (8-2)^{2} - 5 = 36 - 5 = 31. 6. **Conclusion**: The minimum value of f(x) is -5 and the maximum value is 31.

This is due to those angles being equal to (angle B) and thus also obtuse. 4. **Establish Minimum Number of Circles**: - Demonstrate that using only two unit circles is not sufficient. The two circles would require their centers to be (M) and (N). If only two were used, part of the triangle near vertex (B) would not be covered, breaking the triangle inequality for triangles formed.

A: dfrac{9sqrt{3}}{4} B: dfrac{9sqrt{3}}{2} C: dfrac{9}{2} D: dfrac{9}{4}","completion":"To find the maximum volume of the pyramid O-ABC, we observe that the base of the pyramid is the triangle triangle ABC. Since O is the center of the sphere and A,B,C are on the surface, the maximum volume occurs when triangle ABC has the maximum area. First, let's find the length of overline{OB} using the law of cosines in triangle triangle OAB. Since angle AOB = 150^circ and OA = OB = 3 (radii of the sphere), we have: OB^2 = OA^2 + AB^2 - 2 cdot OA cdot AB cdot cos(150^circ). Since OA = OB = 3, let's denote AB = c. Substituting the values, we get: 3^2 = 3^2 + c^2 - 2 cdot 3 cdot c cdot(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}). Solving for c: 9 = 9 + c^2 + 3sqrt{3} cdot c. This simplifies to: c^2 + 3sqrt{3} cdot c = 0. This has a solution for c>0 as: c = -3sqrt{3}, but this is not possible for the length of a side. Therefore, the maximum length for side AB is when the angle between OA and OB is 180^circ (linearity), which occurs only at the “equator” of the sphere and AB is the diameter. Thus, c equals the diameter: c = 2 cdot 3 = 6. Then the area of triangle triangle ABC can be maximized by setting it to be a right triangle with the hypotenuse as AB. The altitude of the triangle from O to the hypotenuse AB will be a radius of the sphere, which is 3. The area is: A = frac{1}{2} cdot AB cdot h = frac{1}{2} cdot 6 cdot 3 = 9. Now, the volume of the pyramid O-ABC is one-third the base area times the height. The height is the radius of the sphere, which is also 3: V = frac{1}{3} cdot A cdot h = frac{1}{3} cdot 9 cdot 3. So the maximum volume is: V = frac{1}{3} cdot 9 cdot 3 = 9. But this is not among the choices given. However, we might have made an assumption error in the base area calculation. Let's recheck with the spherical triangle properties: The angle between OA and OB at 150^circ does not mean AB is the diameter of the sphere, since all the vertices are on the same hemisphere for the base of the pyramid. The area of triangle triangle ABC still depends on angle AOB, but it does not lead to a simple right triangle as in the previous step. We must use the spherical excess formula to find the area of the spherical triangle on the surface of the sphere. Thus, the correct method to maximize the volume involves analyzing how base triangle ABC changes based on positions on the sphere, still considering the fixed angle at O. When triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle on the sphere's surface, this maximizes the area for a given angle at O. The length of each side will again be just a little less than the diameter, and the height of the pyramid is not simply the sphere's radius but depends on the specific position (height) of the center of the equilateral triangle above O. Hence, with this correct approach, the volume of the pyramid O-ABC achieves its maximum when triangle ABC becomes an equilateral triangle inscribed in a great circle of the sphere (maximizing the base area). Therefore, the volume will be less than the one calculated with the incorrect assumption. Thus, the correct choice is one of the options less than 9.

Use these values to calculate (sin A): [ sin A = sin alpha cos beta - cos alpha sin beta. ] Substituting the values we determined, we have: [ sin A = sqrt{frac{5 - 2 sqrt{6}}{12}} cdot sqrt{frac{2}{3}} - frac{sqrt{6} + 1}{2 sqrt{3}} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{3}}. ] After some simplification (omitted for brevity), this yields: [ sin A = -frac{1}{2}. ] 7.

The focus of the parabola is at ( Fleft(0, frac{p}{2}right) ), and the directrix is the line ( y = -frac{p}{2} ). 2. **Equation of the tangent:** A line in the plane that is tangent to the parabola must intersect the parabola at exactly one point, and it should not be parallel to the parabola's axis of symmetry. Therefore, the tangents cannot be parallel to the y-axis, and their equation can be written as: [ y = mx + b ] 3. **Point on the directrix:** Let ( K(a, -frac{p}{2}) ) be a point on the directrix.

Find the smallest possible positive integer ( n ) such that, after some rounds, there exists a feasible schedule where, for any 4 players, they either have not played against each other at all or have played at least 2 matches in total among themselves.","completion":": Given a positive integer ( m geq 17 ), there are (2m) players in a round-robin tournament where, each round, the ( 2m ) players are divided into ( m ) groups of two to compete. After every round, new groups are formed, leading to a total of ( 2m-1 ) rounds so that each player competes with every other player exactly once. We need to determine the smallest possible integer ( n ) such that, after ( n ) rounds, for any set of 4 players, each pair within this set has either not played against each other or has played against each other at least twice. Step 1: Determine an upper bound on ( n ) Let's denote the smallest number of rounds by ( n_{text{min}} ). For ( m geq 3 ), the smallest possible ( n_{text{min}} ) satisfies ( n_{text{min}} = m-1 ). Assume we perform ( l ) rounds (( l leq m-2 )). Let ( k ) be the maximum number of players such that each pair among them has played against each other exactly once. Consider ( k ) players ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ). Player ( A_1 ), besides playing against ( A_2, A_3, ldots, A_k ), can have additional ( l - (k-1) = l - k + 1 ) matches against different players. The same applies to ( A_2 ). Hence, the number of players who have played against both ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) can be at most: [ 2(l - k + 1) + k leq 2(m - 2) - k + 2 = 2m - k - 2 ] Therefore, at least ( k+2 ) players haven't played against both ( ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ). Step 2: Existence of a valid sequence for ( n = m-1 ) **Case 1: ( m ) is even** For ( m ) as an even number, we can arrange the matches as follows: For ( 1 leq k leq m-1 ), in the ( k )-th round, players ( i ) and ( j ) compete if: [ i + j equiv 2k pmod{m-1}, quad 1 leq i, j leq m, quad i neq j ] Additionally, pair ( i ) and ( j+m ) to be in the same group: [ (i, m+i) ] Continue this pattern for ( m - 1 ) rounds: [ begin{aligned} &(1, m+1), (2, m+2), cdots, (m, 2m) &(1, m+2), (2, m+3), cdots, (m, m+1) &quad cdots quad cdots quad cdots &(1, 2m), (2, m+1), cdots, (m, 2m-1) end{aligned} ] **Case 2: ( m ) is odd** Similarly, for odd ( m ), we arrange the matches as: [ begin{aligned} &(1, m+2), (2, m+3), cdots, (m, m+1) &(1, m+3), (2, m+4), cdots, (m, m+2) &quad cdots quad cdots quad cdots &(1, 2m), (2, m+1), cdots, (m, 2m-1) end{aligned} ] **Conclusion:** After ( m-1 ) rounds, each player in set ( {1, 2, cdots, m} ) has played against each other player, and each player in set ( {m+1, m+2, cdots, 2m} ) has played against each other player. Therefore, for any 4 players, they either haven’t all played each other, or each pair among them has competed at least twice. Thus, the smallest number ( n ) such that the given condition holds is: [ boxed{m-1} ]"},{"prompt":"a biology laboratory, there are 5 rabbits, of which only 3 have been measured for a certain indicator.

A: frac{2}{3} B: frac{3}{5} C: frac{2}{5} D: frac{1}{5}","completion":"To solve this problem, we can approach it using two different methods, but both will lead us to the same conclusion. **Method 1: Using Combinations** Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to select 3 rabbits out of 5. This can be done using the combination formula {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. For our case, n=5 and r=3, so we have: {C}_{5}^{3} = frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10. Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select exactly 2 rabbits that have been measured. This involves selecting 2 out of the 3 measured rabbits, and 1 out of the 2 unmeasured rabbits. Using the combination formula again, we have: {C}_{3}^{2} = frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = 3, and {C}_{2}^{1} = frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = 2. Multiplying these together gives the total number of ways to select exactly 2 measured rabbits and 1 unmeasured rabbit: {C}_{3}^{2}{C}_{2}^{1} = 3 times 2 = 6. Step 3: Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes: p = frac{{C}_{3}^{2}{C}_{2}^{1}}{{C}_{5}^{3}} = frac{6}{10} = frac{3}{5}. Therefore, the probability that exactly 2 of the selected rabbits have been measured for the indicator is boxed{frac{3}{5}}. **Method 2: Enumerating Possibilities** Step 1: Enumerate all possible combinations of selecting 3 rabbits out of 5, considering there are 3 rabbits (a, b, c) that have been tested and 2 rabbits (A, B) that have not. The total combinations are: {a,b,c}, {a,b,A}, {a,b,B}, {a,c,A}, {a,c,B}, {a,A,B}, {b,c,A}, {b,c,B}, {b,A,B}, {c,A,B}. This gives us a total of 10 combinations. Step 2: Identify the combinations where exactly 2 rabbits have been tested. These are: {a,b,A}, {a,b,B}, {a,c,A}, {a,c,B}, {b,c,A}, {b,c,B}. This gives us a total of 6 favorable combinations. Step 3: Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable combinations by the total number of combinations: p = frac{6}{10} = frac{3}{5}.

Adding these four equations, we get: [ 2S_{triangle HPE} + 2S_{triangle EPF} + 2S_{triangle FPG} + 2S_{triangle GPH} = S_{text{quadrilateral } AHPE} + S_{text{quadrilateral } BEPF} + S_{text{quadrilateral } CFPG} + S_{text{quadrilateral } DGPH}. ] Since the right-hand side of the equation covers the entire area of ABCD, we have: [ 2S_{triangle HPE} + 2S_{triangle EPF} + 2S_{triangle FPG} + 2S_{triangle GPH} = S_{text{quadrilateral } ABCD}. ] Thus, [ S_{text{quadrilateral } ABCD} = 2 S_{text{quadrilateral } EFGH}. ] 5. Returning to the original problem, consider the circumcircle of quadrilateral ABCD with the center O and let P, Q, R, and S be the midpoints of HE, EF, FG, and GH, respectively. Apply the lemma to quadrilateral EFGH: [ S_{text{quadrilateral } EFGH} = 2 S_{text{quadrilateral } PQRS}. ] 6. Therefore, for quadrilateral ABCD, we have: [ S_{text{quadrilateral } ABCD} = 2 S_{text{quadrilateral } EFGH} = 4 S_{text{quadrilateral } PQRS}. ] 7. Notice that since W, X, Y, Z are the orthocenters of triangles AHE, BEF, CFG, DGH, respectively, W, X, Y, Z form a parallelogram with PQRS as mid-segment properties and scaling factors of 2. Hence, quadrilateral PQRS is similar to quadrilateral WXYZ by this affine transformation. 8. Hence, the relation established is: [ S_{text{quadrilateral } WXYZ} = 4 S_{text{quadrilateral } PQRS} = S_{text{quadrilateral } ABCD}. ] 9. Therefore, we conclude: [ S_{text{quadrilateral } WXYZ} = S_{text{quadrilateral } ABCD}. ] Thus, the proof is complete, and the quadrilateral areas are indeed equal. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Mandy made an apple pie.

Let the solution with the minimum (x) be ((x_0, y_0, z_0)). If a prime number (p) such that (p mid x_0) and (p mid y_0) exists, then (p^2 mid z_0). This implies (left(frac{x_0}{p}, frac{y_0}{p}, frac{z_0}{p^2}right)) is also a solution, which contradicts the minimality of (x_0). Therefore, ((x_0, y_0) = 1), and we have (x_0^4 = y_0^4 + z_0^2), which means the parity of (y_0) and (z_0) is different. If (2 mid z_0), by the Pythagorean triplet theorem, there exist positive integers (m, n) such that (x_0^2 = m^2 + n^2), (y_0^2 = 2mn), and (z_0 = m^2 - n^2). Then (m^4 - n^4 = (x_0 y_0)^2), and since (m < x_0), this contradicts the minimality of (x_0). Therefore, (2 mid y_0). By the Pythagorean triplet theorem, there exist positive integers (m, n) such that ((m, n) = 1) and (x_0^2 = m^2 + n^2), (y_0^2 = 2mn), (z_0 = m^2 - n^2). Since (x_0^2 = m^2 + n^2), there exist positive integers (a > b) such that ((a, b) = 1) and ({m, n} = {2ab, a^2 - b^2}). Here, (y_0^2 = 4ab(a^2 - b^2)), and ((a, b) = (a, a^2 - b^2) = (b, a^2 - b^2) = 1). Hence, there exist positive integers (u, v, w) such that (a = u^2), (b = v^2), (a^2 - b^2 = w^2). This implies (u^4 - v^4 = w^2), and (u < x_0), which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no positive integer solutions for (x^4 - y^4 = z^2). 2. **Lemma 2: There are no positive integer solutions ((x, y, z)) for (x^4 + y^4 = 2z^2) except for ((x, y, z) = (n, n, n^2)) for (n in mathbb{N})** **Proof:** If we square both sides, we get: [ x^8 + 2x^4 y^4 + y^8 = 4z^4 implies (x^4 - y^4)^2 + 4x^4 y^4 = 4z^4 ] Here, (2 mid x^4 - y^4 implies z^4 - (xy)^4 = left(frac{x^4 - y^4}{2}right)^2). By Lemma 1, there are no solutions if (x neq y). Therefore, (x = y), and the only solution is ((x, y, z) = (n, n, n^2)) for (n in mathbb{N}). 3. **Back to the problem:** Assume there is a solution for (x^2 y^4 - x^4 y^2 + 4x^2 y^2 z^2 + x^2 z^4 - y^2 z^4 = 0). This can be rewritten as: [ x^2(y^4 + 6y^2z^2 + z^4) = y^2(x^4 + 2x^2z^2 + z^4) ] Hence, (y^4 + 6y^2z^2 + z^4) is a perfect square. Let (y^4 + 6y^2z^2 + z^4 = k^2). This implies: [ (y + z)^4 + (y - z)^4 = 2k^2 ] By Lemma 2, there are no solutions for the above equation if (y + z, y - z, y, z, k) are all positive integers. *Case 1:* (y = 0) or (z = 0). Then it isn't a positive integer solution. *Case 2:* (y - z = 0). Then ((y + z)^4 = 2k^2). The equation (nu_2((y + z)^4) = 1 + nu_2(k^2) implies 4nu_2(y + z) = 1 + 2nu_2(k)) is contradictory to oddity. Therefore, there are no positive integers (x, y, z) satisfying (x^2 y^4 - x^4 y^2 + 4x^2 y^2 z^2 + x^2 z^4 - y^2 z^4 = 0).

This allows the 2-inch card, when placed on a vertex touching four squares at the corner, to extend diagonally to cover four squares completely.

The centers of the excircles opposite vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) are denoted as ( O_1 ), ( O_2 ), and ( O_3 ), respectively. These points ( O_1 ), ( O_2 ), and ( O_3 ) form a new triangle ( triangle O_1 O_2 O_3 ). 2. **Connecting Excircle Centers Forms a New Triangle:** The sides of the triangle ( triangle O_1 O_2 O_3 ) pass through the vertices of the original triangle ( triangle ABC ). This is due to the fact that at each vertex, the external angles formed by extensions of the triangle's sides are vertical angles with respect to each other, and their angle bisectors will coincide. 3. **Properties of the New Triangle and Orthocenter:** The angle bisectors of the external angles at ( O_1 ), ( O_2 ), and ( O_3 ) are perpendicular to the sides of the original triangle ( triangle ABC ) connecting the vertices to the opposite excircle centers. This perpendicular relationship implies that the original triangle ( triangle ABC ) is the orthic triangle (vertex pedal triangle) of ( triangle O_1 O_2 O_3 ). 4. **Feuerbach Circle Definition and Identifying the Points:** The orthic triangle of a given triangle is circumscribed by the nine-point circle, also known as the Feuerbach circle, of the given triangle.

For the given equation x^2 - ax + a - 1 = 0, we identify a = 1, b = -a, and c = a - 1. Thus, we calculate the discriminant as follows: [ begin{align*} Delta &= (-a)^2 - 4(1)(a - 1) &= a^2 - 4a + 4 &= (a - 2)^2. end{align*} ] Since the square of any real number is non-negative, (a - 2)^2 geqslant 0. This implies that the discriminant Delta geqslant 0, which means the quadratic equation always has two real roots (including the possibility of a repeated root if Delta = 0). Therefore, we have proven that the equation always has two real roots. Part 2: Finding the Range of Values for a When One Real Root is Greater Than 3 Given the roots of the quadratic equation can be found using the formula x = frac{-b pm sqrt{Delta}}{2a}, for our equation x^2 - ax + a - 1 = 0, the roots are: [ x = frac{a pm sqrt{(a - 2)^2}}{2}. ] Simplifying the expression under the square root (since we already know (a - 2)^2 is always non-negative and its square root is |a-2|), we get two possible values for x: [ x_1 = frac{a + (a - 2)}{2} = a - 1, quad x_2 = frac{a - (a - 2)}{2} = 1. ] Given that one of the roots must be greater than 3, and since x_2 = 1 is fixed, we focus on x_1 = a - 1. For x_1 to be greater than 3, we have: [ a - 1 > 3. ] Solving this inequality for a gives: [ a > 4. ] Thus, the range of values for a for which the equation has one real root greater than 3 is a > 4.

This gives us an initial choice set of 4 vertices for vertex A. 2. **Vertex A to Vertex B:** Once the ant reaches vertex A (one of the middle ring vertices), it again has 4 equally likely choices for its next move. These choices include moving to an adjacent vertex in the middle ring, moving back to the top vertex, or moving down to the bottom vertex. 3. **Identifying the Bottom Vertex:** Among the 4 choices available from any vertex in the middle ring, exactly 1 of these choices leads to the bottom vertex. This is due to the symmetrical structure of the octahedron, where each vertex in the middle ring is connected to the top vertex, the bottom vertex, and two other vertices in the middle ring. 4. **Calculating the Probability:** Since the ant's choice at vertex A does not affect the probability of its next move being to the bottom vertex (due to the symmetry and equal likelihood of each choice), the probability that vertex B is the bottom vertex is simply the probability of choosing the one path that leads to the bottom vertex out of the 4 available paths from any given vertex A.

Then the number of people in this WeChat group is ( ) A: 8 B: 9 C: 10 D: 12","completion":"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of people in the WeChat group as x. Given that each pair of members exchanged a separate greeting message, and there were a total of 72 messages, we can deduce that each person in the group would need to send a greeting message to (x-1) other members. This is because each person does not need to send a message to themselves, hence the subtraction of 1. The total number of messages sent in the group can be calculated by considering that each of the x members sends (x-1) messages, but since every message is counted twice (once for the sender and once for the receiver), we divide the total by 2 to avoid double counting. Therefore, the equation to represent the total number of messages is frac{x(x-1)}{2} = 72. Multiplying both sides by 2 to simplify, we get: [x(x-1) = 144] Expanding and rearranging the terms to form a quadratic equation, we have: [x^2 - x - 144 = 0] Solving this quadratic equation, we look for values of x that satisfy the equation. The solutions to the equation are found by applying the quadratic formula, x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, where a = 1, b = -1, and c = -144. Substituting these values into the formula gives us: [x = frac{-(-1) pm sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-144)}}{2(1)}] [x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 576}}{2}] [x = frac{1 pm sqrt{577}}{2}] Upon solving, we find that x = 9 or x = -8.

Can the Dolphin Star start from the square in the bottomleft corner of the chessboard, traverse all the squares exactly once, and cover every square on the board?","completion":"1. **Labeling the Chessboard:** Let's first label each square on the 8 times 8 chessboard by identifying the rows from bottom to top as 0, 1, 2, ldots, 7 and the columns from left to right as 0, 1, 2, ldots, 7. Each square (i,j) can then be labeled with the value i + j. 2. **Defining Movement Rules:** The \\"Sea Star\\" can move: - One square up (which increases the column number by 1 from i + j to i + (j+1)) - One square to the right (which increases the row number by 1 from i + j to (i+1) + j) - One square to the lower left (which changes the position from i + j to (i-1) + (j-1) resulting in (i + j - 2)) 3. **Analyzing the Sequence of Moves:** For every move the \\"Sea Star\\" makes, the new value a_{i+1} is determined by the previous value a_i: a_{i+1} = begin{cases} a_i + 1 & text{(if moving up or right)}, a_i - 2 & text{(if moving to the lower left)} end{cases} 4. **Modulo Calculation:** We need to evaluate a_{i} modulo 3: - Moving up or to the right: a_{i+1} equiv a_i + 1 (mod 3) - Moving to the lower left: a_{i+1} equiv a_i - 2 (mod 3). Since -2 equiv 1 (mod 3), both possible changes to a_i are congruent to: a_{i+1} equiv a_i + 1 (mod 3) 5. **Behavior of Sequence Modulo 3:** This implies that if we continue moving, the sequence values a_i will cycle through all residues modulo 3. Therefore, the sequence a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ldots will experience only one type of residue modulo 3. 6. **Counting Multiples of 3:** Out of the 64 squares on the chessboard, we'll have initially zero, and the rest of the squares will be divided into three groups based on their row and column sums (modulo 3). This division shows that there should be roughly leftlfloor 64/3 rightrfloor = 21 multiples of 3 in the labeling. If we consider the initial square at the bottom left (0,0) labeled as 0, there are 63 remaining squares. Among these, the number of squares with sums that are multiples of 3 are: begin{align} & (0+0), (1+2), (2+1), (3+0), (0+3), (1+5), (2+4), (3+3), (4+2), (5+1), (6+0), & (0+6), (1+8), (2+7), (3+6), (4+5), (5+4), (6+3), (7+2), (8+1), (9+0), cdots end{align} Total count leads to 21, highlighting whether actual travel corresponds without the expected mod 3 result. 7. **Conclusion:** The necessity of having exact multiples of 3 mathematically contradicts the grid constraints since 21 natural multiples oppose the need to traverse squares. Therefore, the \\"Sea Star\\" cannot run through each square exactly once following its defined movement rules due to arithmetic restrictions applied in modulus 3 alternating. Thus, it is impossible for the \\"Sea Star\\" to traverse the entire chessboard square by square exactly once according to the movement rules described.

Given M (1, -1), we have overrightarrow {MA}cdot overrightarrow {MB}=(y₁²-1)(y₂²-1)+(y₁+1)(y₂+1)=0.

Therefore, y = sinbeta - cos^2alpha = frac{1}{3} - sinalpha - cos^2alpha. Using the Pythagorean identity cos^2alpha = 1 - sin^2alpha, we can rewrite y as: y = frac{1}{3} - sinalpha - (1 - sin^2alpha) = sin^2alpha - sinalpha - frac{2}{3}. Now, let's complete the square for the expression y: y = (sinalpha - frac{1}{2})^2 - frac{1}{4} - frac{2}{3} = (sinalpha - frac{1}{2})^2 - frac{11}{12}. Next, observe that sinbeta has to lie between -1 and 1 inclusively, which gives us the bounds on sinalpha: -1 leq frac{1}{3} - sinalpha leq 1. Solving for sinalpha yields: -frac{2}{3} leq sinalpha leq 1.

The maximum of the square term happens at the end-points of this interval, but because it is squared, we can ignore the fact that -frac{2}{3} is negative and realize that the square term is maximal when sinalpha = pmfrac{2}{3}. However, we know that sinalpha leq 1, so the maximum occurs when sinalpha = -frac{2}{3}, giving us: y_{text{max}} = left(-frac{2}{3} - frac{1}{2}right)^2 - frac{11}{12} = left(-frac{7}{6}right)^2 - frac{11}{12} = frac{49}{36} - frac{11}{12} = frac{4}{9}. Thus, y_{text{max}} = boxed{frac{4}{9}}.

If each carriage carries 110 passengers, how many carriages should be towed to maximize the number of passengers transported daily? Also, calculate the maximum number of passengers transported daily.","completion":"Ⅰ. Let's assume that the relationship between the daily round-trip frequency y and the number of carriages x can be described by the following linear equation: y = ax + b. Given that when x = 4, y = 16, and when x = 7, y = 10, we have the following system of linear equations: begin{cases} 4a + b = 16, 7a + b = 10. end{cases} Solving this system for a and b, we subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate b, obtaining: (4a - 7a) + (b - b) = 16 - 10, which simplifies to -3a = 6. Dividing both sides by -3, we find that a = -2. Substituting a = -2 into either of the two equations, we can solve for b: 4(-2) + b = 16, resulting in b = 16 + 8 = 24. Therefore, the function relating y and x is y = -2x + 24, where 0 leq x leq 12 and x in mathbb{N}. Ⅱ. The total number of carriages operated daily S is the product of the daily round-trip frequency y and the number of carriages x towed, which yields S = xy = (-2x^2 + 24x), where 0 leq x leq 12 and x in mathbb{N}.

To maximize W, we need to find the vertex of the parabola, which occurs at x = - frac{b}{2a} = - frac{2640}{2(-220)} = 6. Substituting x = 6 into the equation for W, we get W = -220(6^2) + 2640(6) = -220(36) + 15840 = 7920.

The axis of symmetry can be found by setting the derivative of y with respect to x to zero. The derivative is 2mx - 2m = 0, which gives x = 1. Therefore, the axis of symmetry is at x = 1. 2. **Analyze the Position of Points Relative to the Axis of Symmetry:** The axis of symmetry divides the parabola into two symmetric parts. Any point on one side of the axis has a symmetric counterpart on the other side with the same y-value. Since P_{1} is at x = -1, its symmetric counterpart with respect to the axis of symmetry at x = 1 would be at x = 3 (moving 2 units to the right from x = 1 to reach x = 3, just as moving 2 units to the left from x = 1 reaches x = -1). This means the y-value at x = 3 is the same as y_{1}. 3. **Comparing the x-coordinates of P_{2} and P_{3} with the Symmetric Point:** We have P_{2} at frac{5}{2} and P_{3} at 6. Comparing these with the x-coordinate of the symmetric point (x = 3), we see that frac{5}{2} < 3 < 6. 4. **Determine the Relationship Between y_{1}, y_{2}, and y_{3}:** Since the parabola opens upwards and y increases as x increases on the right side of the axis of symmetry, and considering the symmetry of P_{1} and its counterpart at x = 3, we conclude that as we move from frac{5}{2} to 3 to 6, the y-value increases. Therefore, since y_{1} is the y-value at both x = -1 and its symmetric point x = 3, and given that frac{5}{2} < 3 < 6, it follows that y_{3} > y_{1} > y_{2}.

Since there are students who participate in both, we can't simply add the number of students in chorus to the number of students in band. We need to subtract the number of students who are counted twice because they participate in both. Number of students in chorus or band = Number of students in chorus + Number of students in band - Number of students in both chorus and band = 420 + 780 - 150 = 1200 - 150 = 1050 Now, we need to add the number of students in drama. However, we know that 50 of these students are also counted in the chorus or band group. So we need to add only the additional drama students who are not already counted in the chorus or band group. Number of students in drama not already counted = Total number of students in drama - Number of drama students also in chorus or band = 300 - 50 = 250 Now, let's add the additional drama students to the number of students in chorus or band to find the total number of students involved in at least one of the activities. Total number of students in at least one activity = Number of students in chorus or band + Additional drama students = 1050 + 250 = 1300 Finally, to find the number of students not enrolled in chorus, band, or drama, we subtract the number of students involved in at least one activity from the total number of students in the school.

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: [ S = frac{k}{2} times left[ 2n + (k-1) right] ] 5. According to the problem, we know: [ S = 2000 ] 6. Substituting the sum formula: [ frac{k}{2} times left[ 2n + (k-1) right] = 2000 ] 7. Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction: [ k left[ 2n + (k-1) right] = 4000 ] 8. Rearranging the equation: [ k(2n + k - 1) = 4000 ] 9. Factor 4000 to check possible values of ( k ): [ 4000 = 2^5 times 5^3 ] 10. ( k ) and ( 2n + k - 1 ) must be factors of 4000 such that they multiply to give 4000. Also, since ( k ) is the number of terms, ( k > 1 ). 11. For ( k ) to be a factor, let’s list the pairs ((k, 2n+k-1)) that satisfy the product 4000: - ( (5, 800) ) - ( (25, 160) ) - ( (32, 125) ) 12. Verify each pair to ensure ( 2n ) remains an integer: - For ( k = 5 ): [ 5 (2n + 5 - 1) = 4000 implies 5 (2n + 4) = 4000 implies 2n + 4 = 800 implies 2n = 796 implies n = 398 ] Since ( n = 398 ) is a natural number, ( k = 5 ) is valid. - For ( k = 25 ): [ 25 (2n + 25 - 1) = 4000 implies 25 (2n + 24) = 4000 implies 2n + 24 = 160 implies 2n = 136 implies n = 68 ] Since ( n = 68 ) is a natural number, ( k = 25 ) is valid. - For ( k = 32 ): [ 32 (2n + 32 - 1) = 4000 implies 32 (2n + 31) = 4000 implies 2n + 31 = 125 implies 2n = 94 implies n = 47 ] Since ( n = 47 ) is a natural number, ( k = 32 ) is valid. 13. We now verify that these are indeed the only valid values for ( k ). Any other factorization would fail to satisfy the condition that both ( k ) and ( 2n + k - 1 ) are positive integers. Conclusion: The possible values for ( k ) are 5, 25, and 32, hence there are 3 such values.

Consider dividing the original pyramid with planes parallel to its base into sections. The apex of the pyramid is a common point for these planes, and the planes are located at distances ( m_1, m_2, ldots, m_{24} ) from the apex, where (m_{24} = m) is the height of the pyramid. If ( V ) is the volume of the original pyramid, then the volume of the sub-pyramid with height ( m_i ) is ( V_i = frac{i}{24} V ). Thus, we have: [ frac{V_i}{V} = frac{i}{24}, quad i = 1, 2, ldots, 23 ] 2. The smaller sub-pyramid and the original pyramid are similar, and the ratio of their corresponding edges is ( frac{m_i}{m} ). Therefore, the volume ratio can also be expressed as: [ frac{V_i}{V} = left( frac{m_i}{m} right)^3 ] From the two equalities, we derive: [ m_i = m sqrt[3]{frac{i}{24}} ] 3. For the second division, where the lateral surface areas of the sections are equal, let ( m_k' ) be the height corresponding to the section. The lateral surface area of the sub-pyramid with height ( m_k' ) is ( F_k = frac{k}{24} F ), where ( F ) is the lateral surface area of the original pyramid.

To determine if there is a common plane in the two sets, we need ( m_i = m_k' ), which implies: [ sqrt[3]{frac{i}{24}} = sqrt{frac{k}{24}} ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ left( sqrt[3]{frac{i}{24}} right)^2 = left( sqrt{frac{k}{24}} right)^2 ] [ frac{i^{2/3}}{24^{2/3}} = frac{k}{24} ] Cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root: [ frac{i^2}{24^2} = frac{k^3}{24^3} ] [ 24 i^2 = k^3 ] 5.

The game requires the players to write distinct real numbers in each cell of the grid, with player 甲 (Jiǎ) going first. The goal is to determine if one of the players has a guaranteed win strategy. The following solution demonstrates why player 乙 (Yǐ) has a winning strategy. 1. **Game setup and player strategy**: The game involves filling the cells with unique real numbers such that no two numbers are the same, and once the grid is completely filled, the maximum number in each row determines the \\"black\\" cells. The winning condition for 甲 is to create a vertical line connecting the top to the bottom of the grid using these black cells. Conversely, 乙 wins if 甲 cannot form such a vertical line. 2. **Player 乙’s strategy**: - 乙 can control where the maximum numbers in each row are placed by carefully choosing their numbers after 甲’s turn. - Since 乙 moves after 甲, 乙 can observe where 甲 places numbers and then strategically place numbers to ensure that 甲 cannot form an uninterrupted vertical line. 3. **Maximize the Control of Rows**: - Notice that in each row, it is 乙's goal to manipulate the maximum number placement. By placing higher numbers strategically, 乙 can ensure that the maximum in any row falls into one of three specific columns preferred by 乙. - This forces three columns in any row to be influenced by 乙, and since there are only six columns, this essentially blocks 甲 from forming a continuous path from top to bottom. 4. **Detailed Explanation by Row**: - Each time 甲 places a number, 乙 places a sufficiently large number in a way to avoid the formation of a vertical line across all rows. - By controlling the maximum placements in each row and ensuring they are spread across several columns, 乙 can prevent the alignment of vertical black cells necessary for 甲's win. 5. **Conclusion**: - Given that 乙 can always manipulate the maximum number placements in three specific columns per row, 甲 cannot form a continuous vertical line. - Thus, due to this strategy of managing the placement of the largest numbers, 乙 ensures that all black cells are spread out in such a way that they cannot form a vertical path, thereby making it impossible for 甲 to win. The overall conclusion after considering the strategies and placements is that 乙 has a guaranteed winning strategy under these game conditions.

Suppose that there exist two periodic functions, (g(x)) and (h(x)), both defined for all real numbers (x), such that the function equation [ x^2 = g(x) + h(x) ] holds for all (x). 1. **Define Periods**: Let (p > 0) be the period of (g(x)) and (q > 0) be the period of (h(x)). By definition of periodicity, we have: [ g(x + p) = g(x) ] [ h(x + q) = h(x) ] 2. **Substitute Values in Function Equation**: Substitute the values (x = 0, p, q, p+q) into the equation (x^2 = g(x) + h(x)).

The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets.

Additionally, the club wants to account for the possibility of wasted eggs due to mistakes in cooking or broken eggs. They estimate that an average of 3% of the eggs will be wasted in the process. Just to be on the safe side, they also get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets, each made with an average of 2.5 eggs.

To find a circle of radius r = frac{1}{7} containing at least three points, we first calculate the necessary number of smaller squares. - Let's divide the unit square into n smaller squares of equal size. According to the pigeonhole principle, if 51 points are placed in these n smaller squares, and each smaller square can contain at most 2 points without exceeding 2 points (which we do not want), the total number of points fitting this condition would be 2n. - Therefore, to ensure that at least one of the smaller squares contains at least 3 points, we need: [ 51 > 2n ] [ n leq frac{51}{2} = 25.5 ] Hence, n should be at most 25 for us to ensure the presence of at least 3 points in one of the squares. 3. **Size of the Smaller Squares:** - Now, let us partition the unit square into 25 smaller squares.

Thus, the total number of parts of the plane will provide at most 2n segments which in reality provides: [ text{Maximum number of distinct angles} = 2n - 1 ] This is because, though we can theoretically say there are 2n possible angles (each taking two arcs), not all arcs simultaneously form distinct angles due to overlap and geometric constraints. 5. **Impossible Equalities**: If we assume there are exactly 2n angles formed, we run into a contradiction. Since the lines are even in number, and any arc belongs to exactly one angle, the situation will force some arcs to be double-counted, thereby confirming: [ text{Maximum number of angles is not } 2n, text{ but } 2n-1 ] This contradiction similarly supports our conclusion on angular limitations due to geometric arrangement of arcs on the circle.

Thus, there are exactly three different points on circle C that are at a distance of 1 from line l, establishing sufficiency. 3. **Establish Necessity**: - For there to be exactly three different points on circle C at a distance of 1 from line l, the distance from the center to the line must be d=r-1=1. - The distance d from the center (1, -2) to the line mx+y+1-2m=0 can be calculated using the formula d=frac{|m(1)+(-2)+1-2m|}{sqrt{m^{2}+1^{2}}}. - Simplifying, we get d=frac{|-m-2-m|}{sqrt{m^{2}+1}}=1. - This implies sqrt{m^{2}+1}=1, leading to m=0, establishing necessity.

This means that there will be 5 boxes left, and the total weight of these 5 boxes will be ( 5 times 12 = 60 ) pounds. Since 15 of the 20-pound boxes are removed, the weight of these removed boxes is ( 15 times 20 = 300 ) pounds. Now, we can calculate the total weight of the lighter boxes before any are removed. The total weight of the shipment was 360 pounds, and we remove 300 pounds worth of 20-pound boxes, leaving us with 60 pounds. This 60 pounds is the total weight of the lighter boxes and the remaining 20-pound boxes. Since there are 5 boxes left after removing the 15 heavier ones, and we know that the total weight of these 5 boxes is 60 pounds, we can conclude that all 5 of these boxes are the lighter ones (because if any of them were 20-pound boxes, the total weight would be more than 60 pounds).

For ( n = 2^k ), we need to find ( v_2((2^k)!) ): [ v_2((2^k)!) = frac{2^k - s_2(2^k)}{2-1} ] Since ( 2^k ) in base 2 is written as ( 100ldots0 ) (a 1 followed by ( k ) zeros), the sum of the digits ( s_2(2^k) = 1 ). Therefore: [ v_2((2^k)!) = frac{2^k - 1}{1} = 2^k - 1 ] This tells us that ( 2^{2^k - 1} ) is a factor of ( (2^k)! ). 2. **Using Theorem 3:** Theorem 3 states that if ( n = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} dots p_s^{alpha_s} ) is the prime factorization of ( n ), then the sum of the divisors ( sigma(n) ) is given by: [ sigma(n) = frac{p_1^{alpha_1+1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} cdot frac{p_2^{alpha_2+1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} cdots frac{p_s^{alpha_s+1} - 1}{p_s - 1} ] From the previous step, we know that ( 2^{2^k - 1} ) is a factor of ( (2^k)! ).

Circumradius of a sphere inscribed in an octahedron (radius from the center to a vertex): [ r_{text{octahedron}} = sqrt{2} left(frac{a}{2}right) = frac{a sqrt{2}}{2} ] Therefore, the ratio for the octahedron is: [ text{Ratio}_{1} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = sqrt{2} ] 2. **Around this sphere, an icosahedron is inscribed:** For an icosahedron: [ R_{text{icosahedron}} = frac{sqrt{10 + 2sqrt{5}}}{4} times a ] Circumradius: [ r_{text{icosahedron}} = frac{sqrt{10 + 2sqrt{5}}}{4} ] Therefore, the ratio for the icosahedron is: [ text{Ratio}_{2} = sqrt{10 + 2sqrt{5}} ] 3. **Next, we inscribe a dodecahedron in this sphere:** For a dodecahedron: [ R_{text{dodecahedron}} = frac{a(sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} ] because its edge length, ( a ), is related as: [ R_{text{dodecahedron}} = frac{a(sqrt{3} + sqrt{5})}{2} ] Therefore, the ratio for the dodecahedron is: [ text{Ratio}_{3} = 3 sqrt{5 + 2 sqrt{5}} ] 4. **A tetrahedron is inscribed around the sphere next:** For a tetrahedron: [ R_{text{tetrahedron}} = a times frac{sqrt{6}}{4} ] Therefore, the ratio for the tetrahedron is: [ text{Ratio}_{4} = 3 sqrt{15} ] 5. **Finally, a hexahedron (cube) is inscribed:** For a cube: [ R_{text{cube}} = frac{a sqrt{3}}{2} ] Therefore, the total ratio is: [ text{Ratio}_{5} = 27 sqrt{5} ] In sequence, combining these results, the ratios of the radii of the spheres will be: [ sqrt{9 + 4 sqrt{5}}: sqrt{27 + 12 sqrt{5}}: 3 sqrt{5 + 2 sqrt{5}}: 3 sqrt{15}: 9 sqrt{15}: 27 sqrt{5} ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{sqrt{9 + 4 sqrt{5}}: sqrt{27 + 12 sqrt{5}}: 3 sqrt{5 + 2 sqrt{5}}: 3 sqrt{15}: 9 sqrt{15}: 27 sqrt{5}} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the product of 11011_2, 111_2 and 101_2.

If the inequality f(x) < x^2 + mx m has exactly two integer solutions for x, determine the range of the real number m.","completion":"1. We first find the derivative of the function f(x) = (mx-1)e^x - x^2. The derivative is f'(x) = (m+mx-1)e^x - 2x = me^x(1+x) - e^x - 2x. The slope of the tangent line at the point (1, f(1)) is given by f'(1) = 2me - e - 2 = e - 2. Solving this equation gives m = 1. Thus, the derivative of f(x) when m=1 is f'(x) = x(e^x - 2). For f(x) to be increasing, we need f'(x) > 0, which occurs when x > ln 2 or x < 0. For f(x) to be decreasing, we need f'(x) < 0, which occurs when 0 < x < ln 2. Hence, the function f(x) is increasing on the intervals (-infty, 0) and (ln 2, infty), and decreasing on the interval (0, ln 2). 2. The inequality f(x) < -x^2 + mx - m can be rewritten as m(xe^x - x + 1) < e^x. Let's consider the expression xe^x - x + 1 = x(e^x - 1) + 1. For x geq 0, we have e^x - 1 geq 0, so x(e^x - 1) + 1 > 0. For x < 0, we have e^x - 1 < 0, so x(e^x - 1) + 1 > 0 again. We study the inequality by considering the function g(x) = frac{e^x}{xe^x - x + 1}. The derivative is g'(x) = frac{e^x(2 - x - e^x)}{(xe^x - x + 1)^2}. Let h(x) = 2 - x - e^x with derivative h'(x) = -1 - e^x < 0. Since h(0) = 1 > 0 and h(1) = 1 - e < 0, the function h(x) has a single zero on (0, 1), let's call this zero x_0. Thus, g(x) is increasing on (-infty, x_0) and decreasing on (x_0, infty). The inequality f(x) < -x^2 + mx - m having exactly two integer solutions for x equates to m < g(x) having exactly two integer solutions.

Thus, we have: [ text{Mass of good jam later} = 0.8y ] [ text{Mass of bad jam later} = 0.2y ] 3. Since the quantity of good jam does not change, we can equate the mass of good jam at the initial and final stages: [ 0.2x = 0.8y ] Solving for x in terms of y: [ x = 4y ] 4. Therefore, initially the mass of bad jam was 0.8x: [ 0.8x = 0.8 cdot 4y = 3.2y ] And later, the mass of bad jam became 0.2y. 5. From the problem statement, we know that each day, half of the existing bad jam is discarded: - Let the number of days passed be d. - Each day, the mass of bad jam is halved, leading to exponential decay.

Consider the effect of increasing ( s(n) ) by 1. This can be done by increasing one of the digits of ( n ) by 1, which increases ( n ) by 1, 10, 100, or 1000 depending on the position of the digit. 4. We need to compare ( frac{s(n)+1}{n+a} ) with ( frac{s(n)}{n} ), where ( a ) is 1, 10, 100, or 1000. 5. The inequality ( frac{s(n)+1}{n+a} > frac{s(n)}{n} ) simplifies to: [ (s(n)+1)n > s(n)(n+a) ] [ s(n)n + n > s(n)n + s(n)a ] [ n > s(n)a ] 6. For ( a = 1 ), the inequality ( n > s(n) ) must hold.

According to the problem, d = 16. When 16 divides 25 and 105, it leaves the same remainder in both cases. Let's find out what that remainder is. For 25: 25 = 16 * q1 + r, where q1 is the quotient and r is the remainder. The largest multiple of 16 that is less than 25 is 16 itself (16 * 1 = 16), so: 25 = 16 * 1 + r r = 25 - 16 r = 9 So, the remainder when 16 divides 25 is 9. For 105: 105 = 16 * q2 + r, where q2 is the quotient and r is the same remainder as before. The largest multiple of 16 that is less than 105 is 96 (16 * 6 = 96), so: 105 = 16 * 6 + r r = 105 - 96 r = 9 The remainder when 16 divides 105 is also 9, which confirms that the remainder is the same for both 25 and 105. Now, we need to find the second number x such that when 16 divides x, it also leaves a remainder of 9. x = 16 * q3 + 9, where q3 is some quotient. Since we don't know q3, we can't find the exact value of x. However, we can express x in terms of q3: x = 16q3 + 9 To find the smallest possible value of x that is greater than 25 (since it's a different number), we can increment q3 by 1 from the quotient we found for 25 (which was 1). q3 = 1 + 1 = 2 Now, let's find x: x = 16 * 2 + 9 x = 32 + 9 x = 41 So, the second number is boxed{41} ."},{"prompt":"The sum of two numbers is 30 and their difference is 14.

Mathematically, for any points ( x, y ) in ( A ), their sum ( x + y ) produces a corresponding point in ( A + A ). 2. **Geometric Interpretation**: - When two points are added as vectors, the resultant vector ( x + y ) is derived through the parallelogram law. For example, in the case of parallelogram vertices, the resulting vector lies on the diagonal of the parallelogram. - When adding the same point to itself, e.g., ( x + x ), the resultant point is the doubled point ( 2x ). 3. **Triangulation Transformation**: - Consider the original set ( A ) and its triangulation, which divides the convex hull of ( A ) into non-overlapping triangles. Let us denote the number of such triangles as ( v(A) ). - Each triangle in the original triangulation can be broken down further by connecting midpoints of its sides. This process splits each original triangle into four smaller triangles. 4. **Connecting Midpoints**: - By introducing midpoints to every side of the original triangles and connecting them, each original triangle is divided into exactly 4 smaller triangles. This step thus multiplies the number of triangles by 4. 5. **Doubling and Addition of Points**: - We need to handle not only the division of existing triangles into smaller ones but also the extra points that arise from the sums of points that were not initially connected. - These new points would necessarily create additional triangles or be incorporated in the triangulations without reducing the count of smaller triangles produced. 6. **Invariant Property**: - According to the prior proven solution (referenced in the problem as B. 4199), the total number of resulting triangles in a transformed triangulation is invariant to the specific method of triangulation used. This implies that no matter how the triangulation is restructured, the number of triangles will remain at least proportional as in our calculation: v(A + A) geq 4v(A) 7. **Final Inequality**: - We have successfully derived that after the doubling and triangulation maintenance, ( v(A + A) ), the number of triangles in ( A + A ), is at least four times the number of triangles in the original set ( A ).

The probability for each leg that the sock is put on before the shoe in a random arrangement of all 20 items is frac{1}{2} (since there are 2 possible orders for each pair, and only one is correct). 5. **Probability for All Legs:** Given that the legs are independent concerning dressing, the probability that all legs have the sock put on before the shoe is left(frac{1}{2}right)^{10} = frac{1}{2^{10}}. 6. **Calculating the Number of Valid Permutations:** Considering each of the 20! permutations is equally likely, and the probability of a permutation being valid (socks before shoes for all legs) is frac{1}{2^{10}}, the number of valid permutations becomes: [ frac{20!}{2^{10}} ] Conclusion: The number of different orders in which the centipede can put on its socks and shoes, with the constraint that each sock must be put on before its corresponding shoe on each leg, is frac{20!{2^{10}}}.

To analyze its behavior, we find its derivative: [g'(x) = frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{x^2} = frac{x-1}{x^2}] From the derivative, we observe: - For x > 1, g'(x) > 0, indicating g(x) is increasing. - For 0 < x < 1, g'(x) < 0, indicating g(x) is decreasing. Therefore, g(x) has a minimum at x=1, where g(1) = ln 1 + frac{1}{1} - 1 = 0. This implies: [ln x + frac{1}{x} - 1 geq 0] Since at x=1, cos x = cos 1 > -1, we have: [f(x) + frac{1}{x} > 0] Thus, proving f(x) > -frac{1}{x}. # Part (2) Analysis: Given f'(x) = frac{a - xsin x}{x}, define h(x) = a - xsin x for x in (0, pi). Its derivative is: [h'(x) = -xcos x - sin x] For x in (0, frac{pi}{2}], it's clear that h'(x) < 0 since both terms are negative or zero. Define u(x) = -xcos x - sin x and find its derivative: [u'(x) = -2cos x + xsin x] For x in (frac{pi}{2}, pi), u'(x) > 0, indicating u(x) is increasing. Since u(frac{pi}{2}) = -1 < 0 and u(pi) = pi > 0, there exists x_0 in (frac{pi}{2}, pi) such that u(x_0) = 0. This implies h'(x) changes sign at x_0. Given h(0) = a > 0 and h(pi) = a - pisinpi = a > 0, and since h(x_0) < h(frac{pi}{2}) = a - frac{pi}{2} < 0, there must be zeros of h(x), say x_1 in (0, frac{pi}{2}) and x_2 in (x_0, pi). Thus, f'(x) changes sign at x_1 and x_2, indicating f(x) is increasing, then decreasing, then increasing again over (0, pi). Since f(x_1) > f(frac{pi}{2}) = alnfrac{pi}{2} > 0 and f(x_2) < f(pi) = alnpi - 1 < sqrt{2}a - 1 < 0, f(x) has one zero in (0, x_1) and another in (x_1, x_2).

Let ( A_i ) be the point of tangency between circles ( S_i ) and ( S_{i+1} ), with indices taken modulo 4. 2. **Orientations Set the Quadrilateral**: We note that the tangents to each pair of touching circles can be chosen in a consistent orientation. This leads to defining a quadrilateral ( A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 ). This quadrilateral may not necessarily be convex. 3. **Using Tangential Lengths**: From the property of tangential lengths from a common external point to two touching circles, we know that the lengths of the tangents drawn from a point to a point of tangency are equal. Thus, for ( A_i ), the tangents to ( S_i ) and ( S_{i+1} ) are equal. This property yields the equation: [ A_1A_2 + A_3A_4 = A_2A_3 + A_1A_4 tag{1} ] 4. **Leverage Previous Results**: Applying the result from a similar problem (**referenced problem 6.9**), we conclude that if quadrilateral ( A_1A_2A_3A_4 ) is not degenerate, its sides or their extensions must be tangent to one circle. Therefore, these sides would either all be tangent to a common circle or intersect at a single point. 5. **Three Tangential Intersections**: If three of these tangents intersect at one point, then by the equality (1), the quadrilateral ( A_1A_2A_3A_4 ) must degenerate into a segment or a point. However, if it degenerates into a segment, it would imply that all four tangents meet at that segment's midpoint on the tangent line ( l ). This unavoidably means all tangents intersect at a single point. Simplifying both cases: - If no common intersection point exists, ( A_1A_2A_3A_4 ) (or their extended tangents) will be tangent to one circle. - If three meet, then by the properties derived from length relationships and tangency, all four will meet, necessarily leading to a single point of intersection. # Conclusion: The four common tangents, formed at the points of tangency between the circles, either meet at one point or are tangent to one single circle, proving the statement: [ boxed{ text{Intersection at a point or tangency to one circle} } ]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, the three internal angles are A, B, and C.

These intervals correspond to where the function f(x) is increasing. - For f'(x) < 0, we have frac{1}{2}<x<1. This interval corresponds to where the function f(x) is decreasing. Therefore, the monotonically increasing intervals for f(x) when a = frac{1}{2} are (0, frac{1}{2}) and (1, +infty), and the monotonically decreasing interval is (frac{1}{2}, 1).

A: They are all equal and the probability is frac {50}{2007} B: They are not all equal C: All are unequal D: They are all equal and the probability is frac {1}{40}","completion":"First, using simple random sampling to exclude 7 individuals from the pool of 2007 people does not give any one of the remaining 2000 individuals a higher or lower chance of being selected compared to the others. Therefore, each of the remaining 2000 individuals has an equal chance of being selected. Now consider the systematic sampling step. Once the initial 7 are removed, there are 2000 individuals left, from whom we are to select 50. Since we are using systematic sampling, this is effectively the same as choosing 50 out of 2000 individuals uniformly at random. Hence, the probability for each of the remaining 2000 people to be selected is: frac {50}{2000} = frac {1}{40} However, we must not forget that these 2000 individuals were selected after the initial 7 were removed through simple random sampling. This means that each individual in the initial pool of 2007 had an equal chance to be among the 2000 from which we systematically select the 50 participants. Therefore, the probability for each person among the initial 2007 to be selected is the product of the probabilities of not being one of the 7 removed and then being one of the 50 chosen from the 2000: frac {2000}{2007} times frac {50}{2000} = frac {50}{2007} Each person has an equal probability of frac {50}{2007} to be selected.

How many different complementary threecard sets are there?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to count the number of complementary three-card sets from a deck of 27 cards, where each card is uniquely defined by a combination of shape, color, and shade. We will consider two main cases: when the cards share no properties and when the cards share at least one property. 1. **Case 1: The cards share no properties.** In this case, each of the three cards must have a different shape, a different color, and a different shade. - There are 3 shapes, and we need to choose 3 different shapes from these 3, which can be done in (3!) (3 factorial) ways. - Similarly, there are 3 colors, and we need to choose 3 different colors from these 3, which can also be done in (3!) ways. - Finally, there are 3 shades, and we need to choose 3 different shades from these 3, which can also be done in (3!) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards with no shared properties is: [ 3! times 3! times 3! = 6 times 6 times 6 = 216 ] 2. **Case 2: The cards share at least one property.** We will consider the sub-cases where the cards share exactly one property, exactly two properties, and all three properties. - **Sub-case 2.1: The cards share exactly one property.** If the cards share exactly one property, we need to choose which property is shared (shape, color, or shade). There are 3 ways to choose which property is shared. For the remaining two properties, each of the three cards must have different values. - For the shared property, there are 3 possible values (e.g., if the shared property is shape, there are 3 shapes). - For the other two properties, we need to choose 3 different values from 3, which can be done in (3!) ways for each property. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards sharing exactly one property is: [ 3 times 3 times 3! times 3! = 3 times 3 times 6 times 6 = 324 ] - **Sub-case 2.2: The cards share exactly two properties.** If the cards share exactly two properties, we need to choose which two properties are shared. There are (binom{3}{2} = 3) ways to choose which two properties are shared. For the remaining property, each of the three cards must have different values. - For the shared properties, there are 3 possible values for each. - For the remaining property, we need to choose 3 different values from 3, which can be done in (3!) ways. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards sharing exactly two properties is: [ 3 times 3 times 3 times 3! = 3 times 3 times 3 times 6 = 162 ] - **Sub-case 2.3: The cards share all three properties.** If the cards share all three properties, then all three cards are identical, which is not allowed since we need three distinct cards. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards sharing all three properties is: [ 0 ] 3. **Combining the cases:** - The number of ways to choose 3 cards with no shared properties is (216). - The number of ways to choose 3 cards sharing exactly one property is (324). - The number of ways to choose 3 cards sharing exactly two properties is (162).

The length of line segment (KC) is obtained using the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right angle triangle formed: [ KC = sqrt{KE^2 - EC^2} ] where (KE equiv AB) and (EC) are the segments from the decomposition of the larger square. 9. The square of (KC) is exactly equal to the difference of the squares of (a) and (b): [ KC^2 = KE^2 - EC^2 = AB^2 - EC^2 ] 10. Hence, [ KC = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} ] Finally, the square with side (KC) has the area: [ (KC)^2 = ( sqrt{a^2 - b^2} )^2 = a^2 - b^2 ] # Conclusion: The desired constructed square has the side length (KC = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}) [ boxed{sqrt{a^2 - b^2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Determine the sum of all prime numbers p for which there exists no integer solution in x to the congruence 4(9x + 2) equiv 5 pmod p.","completion":"First, simplify the given congruence: [ 4(9x + 2) equiv 5 pmod p. ] [ 36x + 8 equiv 5 pmod p. ] [ 36x equiv -3 pmod p ] or, equivalently, [ 36x equiv p - 3 pmod p. ] This equation has an integer solution for x if and only if 36 is invertible modulo p.

First, let's calculate the equations of each of the planes involved: 1.

It cuts the ( z)-axis at ( c), so substituting ( x = 0 ) and ( y = 0 ) into the plane equation: [ Ax_0 + By_0 + Cz_0 = C(c) ] The intercept form of the plane passing through ((x_0, y_0, z_0)) that cuts the axes at ((a,0,0)), ((0,b,0)), and ((0,0,c)) is given by: [ frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{b} + frac{z}{c} = 1 ] Now, given that the orthocenter of the triangle formed by these intercepts is at (P = (x_0, y_0, z_0)), and considering the ancient geometric property that for the plane to meet these conditions, the normals passing through each point on the surface must intersect at the origin (0,0,0), we derive: [ frac{x_0}{a} = frac{y_0}{b} = frac{z_0}{c} = k quad text{for some constant} , k neq 0 ] This leads us to: [ a = frac{x_0}{k}, quad b = frac{y_0}{k}, quad c = frac{z_0}{k} ] Substituting back into the intercept form: [ k left( frac{x}{x_0} + frac{y}{y_0} + frac{z}{z_0} right) = 1 ] Simplifying, since (k) is a constant multiplier for all components, results in the plane equation: [ frac{x}{x_0} + frac{y}{y_0} + frac{z}{z_0} = 1 ] For this to hold true at all points on the surface (S), the only satisfying surfaces are those spheres centered at origin (0,0,0) with equation: [ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = C quad text{for some constant} , C neq 0 ] To ensure the sphere passes through the point ((1, 1, 1)), substitute these values into the equation: [ 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = C implies C = 3 ] Therefore, the equation of the surface (S) is: [ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3 ] Finally, considering the conditions of the tangent plane involving the orthocenter, we need to ensure the sphere is divided into sections, ensuring (x, y, z > 0).

Since a = f(0.5), we look at the symmetric point for 0.5 + 2 = 2.5. The symmetric point on the negative side is x = -2.5, so f(-2.5)=f(2.5). Therefore, b=f(2.5)=f(-2.5).

The mistake here is the assumption that the function values at -2.5 and 2.5 need to be compared using the interval [0,2] as per condition (2). The symmetry in condition (3) does not abide by the same restriction as condition (2). Instead, it confirms that whatever the value of f(0.5) is, f(2.5) will be the same due to symmetry, and we can use f(-2.5 + 4) = f(1.5) to compare it with f(0.5), which gives us b=f(2.5)=f(1.5).

Specifically, flipping the signs in a square changes the parity of the number of (-) signs within that subgrid (as an odd number of cells are included, the parity of the total number of (-) signs is affected). 3. **Check the Whole Grid**: - For an (8 times 8) grid, the total number of cells is (64). - Initially, there is a certain number of (-) signs in the grid which we denote as (n). - Flipping a (3 times 3) or a (4 times 4) subgrid changes the total number of (-) signs by an odd number. - Therefore, the parity of the number of (-) signs after each operation is different than before the operation. 4. **Invariance Argument**: - Define an invariant that helps us understand the impossibility. - Consider the special configuration: any (3 times 3) or (4 times 4) subgrid does not cover the whole grid at once. This means localized operations can target specific areas but not affect the grid universally and uniformly. 5. **Achieving the Target Configuration**: - To fill the grid completely with (+) signs, the number of (-) signs must reduce to zero, which translates to having an even number of (-) signs through a series of odd subtractions. - No sequence of operations (each modifying the subgrid's number of (-) signs by an odd quantity) will universally and consistently reduce or change the grid to having an even number of (-) signs if it started with an odd count. 6. **Conclusion**: - With the integration of both (3 times 3) and (4 times 4) subgrids invariant and localized operations remaining, we deduce that it is not possible to achieve a configuration where the complete (8 times 8) grid is filled with (+) signs uniformly.

Recall the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for ( n ) points (left(x_iright)) and values (left(c_iright)), given by: [ P(x) = sum_{i=1}^n c_i prod_{substack{j=1 j neq i}}^n frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j} ] This polynomial has degree ( n-1 ). 3. **Bivariate Polynomial**: For the bivariate polynomial, we seek an analogous construction. Consider ( n ) points ((x_i, y_i) ) and ( n ) real numbers (c_i). The goal is to construct a polynomial ( P(x, y) ) that interpolates these values, much like the univariate interpolation. 4. **Constructing Basis Functions**: Define ( t_i = a x_i + b y_i + d_i ) and ( t = a x + b y + d ). We need to construct the interpolating polynomial using basis polynomials of the form: [ frac{prod_{j neq i} (t - t_j)}{prod_{j neq i} (t_i - t_j)} ] where each (t_i) can be adjusted by choosing appropriate (a), (b), and (d). 5. **Combining Points**: Given ( n ) points in the plane: - For points ((x_2, y_2)) and ((x_3, y_3)), define a line: (l_1: a_1 x + b_1 y + d_1 = 0). - For points ((x_4, y_4)) and ((x_5, y_5)), define a line: (l_2: a_2 x + b_2 y + d_2 = 0). - Continue this process until all points are used. 6. **Generating Polynomial**: The polynomial that interpolates these points can be expressed as: [ f_i(x, y) = frac{prod_{j=1}^{k} (a_j x + b_j y + d_j)}{prod_{j=1}^{k} (a_j x_1 + b_j y_1 + d_j)} ] where each ( f_i(x, y) ) is constructed similarly to the univariate case. 7. **Degree Calculation**: If ( n ) is odd, say ( n = 2m + 1 ), the degree of the polynomial is at most ( m ). If ( n ) is even, say ( n = 2m ), the degree is at most ( m ). 8. **Summary and Conclusion**: In general, to interpolate ( n ) points using a bivariate polynomial, we need a polynomial of degree at most ( leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ). Therefore, the smallest ( k ) such that a polynomial ( P(x, y) ) of degree at most ( k ) can pass through any ( n ) points in the plane is: [ k_{min} = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ] [ boxed{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor} ]"},{"prompt":"he monthly salaries of 6 employees in a company are 1000 , 2500 , 3100 , 3650 , 1500 , 2000 . what is the mean of the salaries of 6 employees .","completion":"To find the mean salary of the 6 employees, you add up all the salaries and then divide by the number of employees.

A: All four angles are equal B: Diagonals are equal C: Diagonals are perpendicular to each other D: Diagonals bisect each other","completion":"To determine which property a rectangle does not have, let's examine each option step by step: - **Option A:** All four angles being equal is a fundamental characteristic of rectangles. In a rectangle, all angles are right angles, meaning they are all equal to 90^circ. Therefore, option A describes a property that rectangles indeed have. - **Option B:** The diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length. This is because a rectangle can be divided into two right-angled triangles on either side of a diagonal, and by the Pythagorean theorem, the lengths of the diagonals are the same. Thus, option B also describes a property that rectangles have. - **Option C:** Diagonals being perpendicular to each other is a specific property of a rhombus, where all sides are of equal length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This is not a property of rectangles in general, as the diagonals of a rectangle are not necessarily perpendicular. They are only perpendicular if the rectangle is also a square, which is a special case. Therefore, option C does not describe a general property of rectangles. - **Option D:** Diagonals bisecting each other is a property of parallelograms, which includes both rectangles and rhombuses. This means that each diagonal cuts the other into two equal parts at their intersection point. Hence, option D describes a property that rectangles have. Given the analysis above, the property that a rectangle does not have among the given options is that its diagonals are perpendicular to each other.

Let's assume the original price of each recliner is P dollars, and the store owner was selling R recliners per week before the price drop. Before the price drop, the gross sales would be: Original Gross = P * R After the price drop, the price of each recliner is reduced by 20%, so the new price is: New Price = P - (0.20 * P) New Price = 0.80 * P The number of recliners sold increased by 80%, so the new number of recliners sold is: New Quantity Sold = R + (0.80 * R) New Quantity Sold = 1.80 * R After the price drop, the gross sales would be: New Gross = New Price * New Quantity Sold New Gross = (0.80 * P) * (1.80 * R) New Gross = 1.44 * P * R Now, we calculate the percentage increase of the gross: Percentage Increase = [(New Gross - Original Gross) / Original Gross] * 100% Substitute the values we have: Percentage Increase = [(1.44 * P * R - P * R) / (P * R)] * 100% Percentage Increase = [(1.44 * P * R / P * R) - (P * R / P * R)] * 100% Percentage Increase = (1.44 - 1) * 100% Percentage Increase = 0.44 * 100% Percentage Increase = 44% So, the percentage increase of the gross is boxed{44%} ."},{"prompt":"trapezoid (ABCD), diagonal (AC) is equal to 1 and is also its height.

To construct a sequence of natural numbers where the sum of any two consecutive terms is equal to the square of their difference, let the difference between the larger and smaller number be d, and the smaller term be a. 2. The next term would then be a + d. According to the given condition: [ a + (a + d) = d^2 ] 3. Simplifying this condition, we get: [ 2a + d = d^2 implies 2a = d^2 - d implies a = frac{d^2 - d}{2} = frac{d(d - 1)}{2} ] 4. For a to be a natural number, d should be greater than 1 (since if d = 1, a = 0 which is not a natural number). Hence, d and d-1 are consecutive integers, and their product is always even, ensuring that a is a natural number. 5. For a chosen d=5, the corresponding pairs satisfy: [ a = frac{5 cdot 4}{2} = 10 quad text{and} quad a + d = 15 ] 6. Alternatively, for creating a sequence such that c_1 = a and c_2 = a+d with d geq 2, we get: [ c_{1}= frac{d(d-1)}{2}, quad c_{2}=c_{1} + d, quad c_{3} = c_{2} + (d+1), quad text{and so on} ] 7.

Suppose the sequence contains u and v such that v > u > 0, then the given condition becomes: [ u + v = (v - u)^2 ] 2. Rewriting in terms of v, we have: [ v + u = (v - u)^2 implies v^2 - (2u + 1)v + u^2 - u = 0 ] 3. Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we get: [ v = frac{2u + 1 pm sqrt{(2u+1)^2 - 4(u^2 - u)}}{2} ] Simplifying inside the square root: [ v = u + frac{1 + sqrt{8u + 1}}{2} ] 4. For v to be a natural number, 8u + 1 must be a perfect square. Let 8u + 1 = k^2 where k is an odd integer (since k^2 is a perfect square). 5. Solving for u: [ 8u = k^2 - 1 implies u = frac{k(k - 1)}{2} ] 6. Corresponding value for v becomes: [ v = u + k = frac{k(k-1)}{2} + k = frac{k(k+1)}{2} ] 7. Therefore, u and v can be generated as: [ u = frac{k(k-1)}{2}, quad v = frac{k(k+1)}{2} ] This matches results from the first approach. # Formula for n-th term: 1. Assume a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots with a_{i+1} - a_i = b_i where b_i is also a natural number. 2. By given conditions for consecutive terms: [ a_{i+1} + a_i = b_i^2, quad a_{i+2} + a_{i+1} = b_{i+1}^2 ] 3. Taking differences: [ a_{i+2} - a_i = b_{i+1} + b_i = b_{i+1}^2 - b_i^2 implies 1 = b_{i+1} - b_i ] 4. Thus b_i = b_0 + i. Therefore: [ a_i = frac{(b_i - 1) b_i}{2}, quad a_i = frac{(b_0 + i)(b_0 + i - 1)}{2} ] This ensures constructing the required sequence, ending the proof.

The inequality log_{a}{(2x+1)} < log_{a}{(4x-3)} implies that we must consider two cases, depending on the base a: - When a > 1: The function log_{a}{x} is increasing, so we can compare the arguments directly. begin{align*} 2x + 1 &< 4x - 3, 5 &< 2x, frac{5}{2} &< x. end{align*} Additionally, for the logarithm to be defined, the arguments must be positive: begin{align*} 2x + 1 &> 0 quad text{and} quad 4x - 3 &> 0, x &> -frac{1}{2} quad text{and} quad x &> frac{3}{4}. end{align*} Together, these conditions give us the range boxed{x > frac{5}{2}} for a > 1. - When 0 < a < 1: The function log_{a}{x} is decreasing. This means that we reverse the inequality when comparing the arguments. begin{align*} 2x + 1 &> 4x - 3, 4 &> 2x, 2 &> x. end{align*} Once again, we ensure the arguments are positive: begin{align*} 2x + 1 &> 0 quad text{and} quad 4x - 3 &> 0, x &> -frac{1}{2} quad text{and} quad x &> frac{3}{4}. end{align*} Taking all the conditions into account, for 0 < a < 1, the range of x is boxed{frac{3}{4} < x < 2}."},{"prompt":"From the beginning to the end of 2007, the price of a stock rose 20 percent. In 2008, it dropped 25 percent. In the following year, it rose by a certain percentage. The price of the stock at the end of the third year was 108 percent of its 2007 starting price. What was the percentage increase in the third year?","completion":"Let's assume the price of the stock at the beginning of 2007 was 100 (using 100 for simplicity, but the actual value doesn't matter). At the end of 2007, the stock rose by 20 percent. So the new price is: 100 + (100 * 20%) = 100 + 20 = 120 In 2008, the stock dropped by 25 percent. So the new price is: 120 - (120 * 25%) = 120 - 30 = 90 At the end of the third year, the stock was at 108 percent of its 2007 starting price. So the price at the end of the third year is: 100 * 108% = 108 Now we need to find the percentage increase from the end of 2008 to the end of the third year. The price at the end of 2008 was 90, and at the end of the third year, it was 108. The increase in price is: 108 - 90 = 18 To find the percentage increase: (18 / 90) * 100% = 20% So the stock increased by boxed{20} percent in the third year."},{"prompt":"Mary is going on a business trip, which involves multiple layovers and time zone changes. It takes 10 minutes for her Uber to get to her house and 5 times longer to get to the airport. It takes 15 minutes to check her bag and three times as long to get through security. Then, she has to wait for 20 minutes for her flight to start boarding and twice as long before the plane is ready to take off. During her trip, she has two layovers. Her first layover is 3 hours and 25 minutes, but there is a 45minute delay for her next flight. Her second layover is 1 hour and 50 minutes, and this flight is on time. After her layovers, she finally arrives at her destination, which is in a time zone 3 hours ahead of her starting point. Considering all these factors, how long does it take Mary, including time zone changes, to complete this entire process from the moment her Uber arrives at her house until she reaches her final destination?","completion":"Let's break down the time for each part of Mary's journey: 1. Uber to her house: 10 minutes 2. Uber to the airport: 5 times longer than the Uber to her house, so 5 * 10 minutes = 50 minutes 3. Checking her bag: 15 minutes 4. Getting through security: 3 times the time it takes to check her bag, so 3 * 15 minutes = 45 minutes 5. Waiting for flight to start boarding: 20 minutes 6. Waiting for the plane to take off after boarding: 2 times the boarding wait, so 2 * 20 minutes = 40 minutes Now, let's add up all the times before her first flight: 10 + 50 + 15 + 45 + 20 + 40 = 180 minutes Next, let's consider the layovers and delays: 1. First layover: 3 hours and 25 minutes, which is 3 * 60 + 25 = 205 minutes 2. Delay for the next flight: 45 minutes 3. Second layover: 1 hour and 50 minutes, which is 1 * 60 + 50 = 110 minutes Adding the layovers and delay: 205 + 45 + 110 = 360 minutes Now, let's add the time before the first flight and the layovers: 180 minutes (before first flight) + 360 minutes (layovers and delay) = 540 minutes Finally, we need to account for the time zone change. Since her destination is 3 hours ahead, we need to add this to the total time: 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes Adding the time zone change to the total time: 540 minutes + 180 minutes = 720 minutes To convert the total time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 720 minutes / 60 = 12 hours Therefore, it takes Mary a total of boxed{12} hours from the moment her Uber arrives at her house until she reaches her final destination, including time zone changes."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],M={key:0},W={key:1};function I(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",N,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
