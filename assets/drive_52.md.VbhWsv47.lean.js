The condition is that ( Q(x, y, z, t) geq 0 ) if ( x, y, z, t in mathbb{R} ) and it becomes negative when ( z, t ) are two conjugate non-real complex numbers. 3. **Consider complex conjugate roots:** Let ( x, y, r in mathbb{R} ) and ( z = zeta ), ( t = bar{zeta} ) where ( |zeta| = r^2 ). Then ( Q(x, y, zeta, bar{zeta}) ) becomes a polynomial because ( zeta = r theta ) and ( bar{zeta} = r frac{1}{theta} ) for some ( theta ) on the unit circle. 4. **Analyze the behavior of ( Q ) for complex roots:** Let ( zeta ) vary over complex numbers with norm ( r^2 ). For every such ( zeta ), ( Q(x, y, zeta, bar{zeta}) < 0 ), except when ( zeta in mathbb{R} ), i.e., ( zeta = pm r ). In these two exceptions, we should have ( Q(x, y, pm r, pm r) geq 0 ). 5. **Continuity argument:** According to the continuity of ( Q(x, y, zeta, bar{zeta}) ), ( Q(x, y, pm r, pm r) ) cannot be positive because if it becomes positive, then there is an (epsilon)-neighborhood of ( r ) where it remains positive, which is absurd. Hence, ( H(r) = Q(x, y, r, r) = 0 ) for all real ( r ). 6. **Contradiction:** Since ( H(r) ) vanishes at every ( r ) and all ( x, y ), we have ( Q(i, -i, 1, 1) = 0 ) where ( i^2 = -1 ), which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there does not exist a polynomial ( P(a, b, c, d) ) such that the fourth degree polynomial ( x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d ) can be written as the product of four first-degree polynomials if and only if ( P(a, b, c, d) geq 0 ).

Since one endpoint of this diagonal is (10, 0), and the rhombus is symmetric, the other endpoint must be equidistant from the origin (0,0) but in the opposite direction along the x-axis. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the missing vertex must be -10 (since 10 - (-10) = 20). The y-coordinate of the missing vertex must be 0 because the diagonal is horizontal.

Specifically, if ( f(p) ) is a power of a prime ( q ) (where ( p ) is a prime), then ( f(p^k) ) is also a power of ( q ) for all ( k in mathbb{N} ). 2. **Proof of Claim:** - By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), we can find 2012 consecutive numbers, none of which are prime powers. For instance, set ( N equiv -i pmod{p_i q_i} ) for some distinct primes ( p_i ) and ( q_i ). This ensures that there are arbitrarily large runs of non-prime power numbers. - Let ( N ) be a prime power such that ( N+1, ldots, N+2012 ) are all non-prime powers. - Consider all the prime powers in ( {1, ldots, N} ), partitioned into boxes as follows: [ begin{array}{c} boxed{2, 2^2, ldots, 2^i, ldots} boxed{3, 3^2, ldots, 3^i, ldots} vdots boxed{p_k, p_k^2, ldots, p_k^i, ldots} end{array} ] There are ( k ) boxes here, corresponding to the ( k ) primes ( leq N ). - Consider the set ( A = {2, 3, ldots, p_k} ). These ( k ) numbers are pairwise relatively prime, so their images under ( f ) are also pairwise relatively prime. - Since ( f(p_k) leq N + 2012 ) and the numbers ( N, N+1, ldots, N+2012 ) do not introduce any new primes, the image of each ( p in A ) must be divisible by a unique prime among ( {2, ldots, p_k} ). - Therefore, for any ( p in A ), ( f(p) = sigma(p)^k ), where ( sigma ) is some permutation on ( A ). - If ( f(p^i) ) had a prime divisor other than that assigned to ( f(p) ), it would clash with another prime in a different box, which is impossible since they are in different boxes. - This proves our claim, as ( N ) can be as large as we like. 3. **Mapping of Primes to Their Own Powers:** - Suppose ( f(p) = q^m ) for some prime ( q neq p ). - Then for any ( k ), ( f(p^k) = q^ell ) for some ( ell ) depending on ( k ). - This implies: [ p^k < q^ell leq p^k + 2012 implies ell in left( frac{log p^k}{log q}, frac{log (p^k + 2012)}{log q} right] ] - The length of this interval is: [ frac{log left(1 + frac{2012}{p^k}right)}{log q} ] which becomes arbitrarily small as ( k to infty ). - The leftmost point of this interval is ( k log_q p ), whose fractional part can be made arbitrarily small for some large ( k ), since ( { k alpha } ) is dense in ( (0,1) ) for ( alpha in mathbb{R} setminus mathbb{Q} ). - Therefore, we can choose ( k ) such that the interval fails to contain an integer, creating a contradiction for ( ell ). 4. **Final Step:** - Suppose there exists ( n in mathbb{N} ) and a prime ( p ) such that ( p mid f(n) ) but ( p nmid n ). - Then ( (n, p) = 1 implies (f(n), f(p)) = 1 ), which contradicts ( p mid f(n) ) and ( f(p) = p^k ).

Since Jessica threw away more roses and daisies than she initially had, she must have cut some from her garden to make up the difference. Let's calculate how many she cut: For roses: She had 21 initially, threw away 34, and now has 15. So, she must have cut (34 - 21) + 15 = 13 + 15 = 28 roses from her garden.

Now, we need to find the smallest even integer n such that the product of all even integers up to n is divisible by the product of these primes. This means that the prime factorization of the product of even integers must include 1997, 2011, and 2027. The product of consecutive even integers is essentially the factorial of n/2, multiplied by 2 raised to the power of n/2 (since each term in the product is even and can be factored into a power of 2 and an odd integer).

For the branch sqrt{x-y}=0, upon squaring both sides (and assuming x geq y to make the radical well-defined), we have x-y = 0 implies x = y. Since the square root is only defined for non-negative values of its argument and we have a zero on the other side of the equation, we must restrict the values of y such that the original expression under the square root x-y is non-negative. Thus, we consider the possible values of y: -2 leq y leq 4. Consequently, for the range -2 leq y leq 4, we have the line segment x=y as part of the curve. For the branch x= sqrt {-y^{2}+2y+8}, squaring both sides (assuming x geq 0 for the square root to make sense), we get x^2 = -y^{2}+2y+8. Rearranging this equation, we get x^2 + y^2 - 2y = 8. Completing the square for the y terms gives us x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 9. Since we squared x on the left side, it must be non-negative, thus we have the inequality x geq 0. This represents a circle with a radius of 3 and centered at (0,1), but only for x geq 0, which corresponds to the right half of the circle, or a minor arc.

Using the coordinates of P and O, we apply the distance formula to find the length of |OP|. In the right triangle triangle AOP, the Pythagorean theorem is used to find the length of |AP|, and we determine angle APO=30^{circ}, confirming that triangle APB is an equilateral triangle. From the property of equilateral triangles, we find |AB|=|OP|, thus determining the length of |AB|. This problem examines the relationship between a line and a circle, which is determined by the relationship between d and r. When d > r, the line and the circle do not intersect; when d=r, the line is tangent to the circle; when d < r, the line intersects the circle (d represents the distance from the circle's center to the line, and r represents the radius of the circle)."},{"prompt":"Find the positive integer n such that [ tan left( frac{pi}{2n} right) + cos left(frac{pi}{2n} right) = frac{n}{4}. ]","completion":"Start by squaring both sides: [ tan^2 left( frac{pi}{2n} right) + 2 tan left( frac{pi}{2n} right) cos left( frac{pi}{2n} right) + cos^2 left( frac{pi}{2n} right) = frac{n^2}{16}. ] Using the trigonometric identity tan^2 x + 1 = sec^2 x, replace tan^2 left( frac{pi}{2n} right) + 1 with sec^2 left( frac{pi}{2n} right), [ sec^2 left( frac{pi}{2n} right) - 1 + 2 tan left( frac{pi}{2n} right) cos left( frac{pi}{2n} right) + 1 = frac{n^2}{16}, ] [ sec^2 left( frac{pi}{2n} right) + 2 sin left( frac{pi}{2n} right) = frac{n^2}{16}. ] We simplify: [ 1 + sin^2 left( frac{pi}{2n} right) + 2sin left( frac{pi}{2n} right) = frac{n^2}{16}, ] [ sin left( frac{pi}{2n} right) ( sin left( frac{pi}{2n} right) + 2) = frac{n^2}{16} - 1. ] Let x = sin left( frac{pi}{2n} right), then x(x + 2) = frac{n^2}{16} - 1.

We need to determine the smallest guaranteed number of questions required to find at least one white ball. 1. **Numbering the boxes and defining questions**: We first number the boxes (and the balls in them) from 1 to 2004. We can define a question by a pair of box numbers ((i,j)). A non-white (black) ball's presence will also be used in our consideration. 2. **Initial example questions**: We start by asking questions ((1,2)), ((1,3)), ..., ((1,2004)). For each of these pairs, we can determine if at least one of the mentioned boxes contains a white ball. 3. **Handling positive responses**: - If all responses are positive (which means at least one white ball is in each of the pairs), then we can confirm that box 1 contains a white ball. This is because if box 1 contained a black ball, then there should be another black ball in one of the paired boxes, violating the even count of white balls. 4. **Handling any negative response**: - If at least one response is negative, then box 1 contains a black ball. In this case, marking all other boxes that responded positively as containing at least one white ball helps us identify all white balls. This ensures we can identify the location of white balls accurately. 5. **Confirming the process**: Suppose there exists an algorithm guaranteeing identification of a white ball with fewer than 2003 questions. We will answer all questions positively, implying we need to at least ask 2002 questions before being certain. By strategically using these 2002 questions, one could guess that box 1 contains a white ball. 6. **Contradiction analysis**: Assume the box selected as containing a white ball is wrong. In that case, rearranging the balls so that box 1 and box 2 contain black balls while all others are white would demonstrate that some pairs' answers will be positive, even though the assumed box doesn't contain a white ball, leading to incorrect identification. Thus, at least 2003 questions are required to ensure proper identification without failure. 7. **Minimum guaranteed questions**: From the above steps, it follows that a minimum of 2003 questions must be asked to guarantee the identification of a box containing a white ball without error. # Conclusion: [ boxed{2003} ]"},{"prompt":"A husband gives 335 every week to a savings account, while his wife gives some amount every week.

To complete the purchase, he gives 80 and receives back 10 change, along with a free game worth 30. How much was the original NES on sale for before the sales tax was added?","completion":"First, let's calculate the credit Tom gets for each of his trade-ins: For the SNES: Credit = 80% of 150 = 0.80 * 150 = 120 For the Gameboy: Credit = 75% of 50 = 0.75 * 50 = 37.50 For the PlayStation 2: Credit = 60% of 100 = 0.60 * 100 = 60 Now, let's add up all the credit he gets: Total credit = 120 + 37.50 + 60 = 217.50 Tom gives 80 and receives 10 back, so he actually pays 70 out of pocket. The total amount he has to pay for the NES, including his out-of-pocket payment and the credit, is: Total payment = 217.50 (credit) + 70 (cash) = 287.50 Since he received a free game worth 30, we need to subtract that value from the total payment to find out how much the NES cost before the free game was included: NES cost before free game = 287.50 - 30 = 257.50 Now, we know that the 257.50 is after a 15% discount, so let's find the original price before the discount. Let the original price be X. X - 15% of X = 257.50 X - 0.15X = 257.50 0.85X = 257.50 X = 257.50 / 0.85 X = 303.53 (approximately) So, the original price of the NES before the discount was approximately 303.53. Finally, we need to subtract the sales tax to find the sale price before tax. Since the sales tax is 5%, we can calculate the price before tax as follows: Let Y be the sale price before tax. Y + 5% of Y = 303.53 Y + 0.05Y = 303.53 1.05Y = 303.53 Y = 303.53 / 1.05 Y = 289.08 (approximately) Therefore, the original NES was on sale for approximately boxed{289.08} before the sales tax was added."},{"prompt":"Every Halloween one house in the neighborhood gives out toothbrushes instead of candy, so it always gets egged and covered in toilet paper.

Substitute these identities into the numerator and the denominator: [ lim_{x to 0} frac{1 + sin(2x) - cos(2x)}{1 - sin(2x) - cos(2x)} = lim_{x to 0} frac{1 + 2 sin x cos x - (1 - 2 sin^2 x)}{1 - 2 sin x cos x - (1 - 2 sin^2 x)} ] 4. Simplify the expressions inside the limit: [ lim_{x to 0} frac{1 + 2 sin x cos x - 1 + 2 sin^2 x}{1 - 2 sin x cos x - 1 + 2 sin^2 x} = lim_{x to 0} frac{2 sin x cos x + 2 sin^2 x}{2 sin^2 x - 2 sin x cos x} ] 5. Factor out common terms from the numerator and the denominator: [ lim_{x to 0} frac{2(sin x cos x + sin^2 x)}{2(sin^2 x - sin x cos x)} = lim_{x to 0} frac{sin x (cos x + sin x)}{sin x (sin x - cos x)} ] 6. Simplify by canceling the common factor (sin x) from the numerator and denominator: [ lim_{x to 0} frac{cos x + sin x}{sin x - cos x} ] 7. Evaluate the limit as ( x to 0 ): [ frac{cos(0) + sin(0)}{sin(0) - cos(0)} = frac{1 + 0}{0 - 1} = frac{1}{-1} = -1 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{-1} ]"},{"prompt":"Postman Pechkin delivers mail by bicycle to four villages: Prostokvashino, Smetanino, Tvorozhnoye, and Molochnoye.

Inductive Step: 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** - Assume that for any ( m' ) and ( n' ) such that ( m' + n' = k ) (where ( k leq m + n - 1 )), it is possible to find a set of fewer than ( m' + n' ) positive numbers that meet the required row and column sums. 3. **Induction Step for ( m + n = k+1 ):** - Consider the case where ( m ) row sums are ({ r_1, r_2, ldots, r_m }) and ( n ) column sums are ({ c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n }). 4. **Identify the Largest Number:** - Let ( x ) be the largest number in the row sums. Without loss of generality, assume ( x ) is in the row sums. - Let ( y ) be the largest number in the column sums. 5. **Two Cases:** - **Case 1:** ( x > y ) 1. Replace ( x ) with ( x - y ) in the row sums. 2. Remove ( y ) from the column sums. 3. Now the new set of row sums has ( m ) numbers and column sums have ( n-1 ) numbers. 4. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a set of ( leq (m + (n-1) - 1) = m + n - 2 ) positive numbers that can be arranged in an ( m times (n-1) ) array to satisfy these new sums. 5. Adding a new column to this array, which has only the number ( y ) in the appropriate row (where ( x - y ) was reduced), we achieve the required original row and column sums with the original array structure. - **Case 2:** ( x = y ) or ( x < y ) 1. If ( x = y ): - Drop ( x ) from the row sums and ( y ) from column sums. - Now we have ( m-1 ) row sums and ( n-1 ) column sums which satisfy the total sum condition. - By the induction hypothesis, we can find ( leq ((m-1)+(n-1)-1) = m + n - 2 ) positive numbers that can be arranged in an ( (m-1) times (n-1) ) array. - This completes the required sum conditions with fewer than ( m + n ) elements. 2. If ( x < y ): - This case is symmetric to the ( x > y ) case with columns and rows interchanged. - The same induction reasoning applies by swapping roles of rows and columns. Conclusion: Using the principle of mathematical induction, we prove that it is always possible to arrange fewer than ( m + n ) positive numbers to meet the given row and column sums in an ( m times n ) array.

According to the problem, we have a direct proportion between the number of painters and the number of rooms they can paint in a given time. If three painters can complete three rooms in ( h ) hours, then increasing the number of painters to 9 (which is three times more) would allow them to complete three times more rooms in the same amount of time, because they can work simultaneously without affecting each other's productivity. So, 9 painters can complete 9 rooms in ( h ) hours. Now, if 9 painters can complete 9 rooms in ( h ) hours, they would complete 27 rooms in three times the amount of ( h ) hours, because 27 is three times 9. Therefore, it would take ( 3h ) hours for 9 painters to complete 27 rooms. According to the problem, it is given that 9 painters complete 27 rooms in 9 hours. Therefore, we can set ( 3h = 9 ) hours.

For odd and even n, the coefficients of these polynomials take on a specific form. Suppose F_{n+1}(x) is a polynomial of the form: [ F_{n+1}(x) = sum_{k=0}^{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor} a_{n}^{k} x^{n-2k} ] Given the recurrence relation: [ F_{n+1}(x) = x F_{n}(x) + F_{n-1}(x) ] This implies that the coefficients ( a_{n}^{k} ) satisfy the recurrence relation: [ a_{n}^{k} = a_{n-1}^{k} + a_{n-2}^{k-1} ] (With the convention that ( a_{n}^{k} = 0 ) for ( k < 0 ) or ( k > frac{n}{2} )). Using this recurrence relation and the initial condition ( a_{0}^{0} = 1 ), we identify that this relation ( a_{n}^{k} ) matches the binomial coefficients ( C_{n-k}^{k} ), since: [ C_{n-k}^{k} = C_{(n-1)-k}^{k} + C_{(n-2)-(k-1)}^{k-1} ] where ( C_{0}^{0} = 1 ).

The relative speed is the difference in speed between the two trains since they are moving in the same direction. The faster train is moving at 49 km/hr and the slower train at 36 km/hr, so the relative speed is: 49 km/hr - 36 km/hr = 13 km/hr To calculate the time, we need to convert the relative speed into meters per second because the length of the trains is given in meters. We know that 1 km/hr is equivalent to 1000 meters/3600 seconds (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour). So, 13 km/hr in meters per second is: 13 km/hr * (1000 meters/3600 seconds) = 13 * (1000/3600) m/s 13 * (1000/3600) m/s = 3.6111 m/s (approximately) Now, since the length of each train is 65 meters, the total distance that the faster train needs to cover to pass the slower train is the sum of the lengths of both trains: 65 meters + 65 meters = 130 meters Finally, we can calculate the time it takes for the faster train to pass the slower train by dividing the total distance by the relative speed: Time = Total Distance / Relative Speed Time = 130 meters / 3.6111 m/s Time ≈ 36.01 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{36.01} seconds for the faster train to pass the slower train."},{"prompt":"Kolya and Vasya are writing a 20digit number using only the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

First, let's find the derivative of f(x), denoted as f'(x), using the product rule. The product rule states that if we have a function g(x)h(x), then its derivative is g'(x)h(x) + g(x)h'(x). Applying this to f(x) = (x-1)e^{x}, we get: [ f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}[(x-1)e^{x}] = frac{d}{dx}[x-1] cdot e^{x} + (x-1) cdot frac{d}{dx}[e^{x}]. ] The derivative of x-1 is 1, and the derivative of e^{x} is e^{x}.

After a certain number of days, 25% of the liquid in the bottle is hot sauce. How many days have passed?","completion":"Let's denote the number of days that have passed as ( d ). Each day, Adonis's dad uses 1 oz of shampoo, and Adonis replaces it with 1/2 oz of hot sauce. So, after ( d ) days, Adonis's dad has used ( d ) oz of shampoo, and Adonis has added ( d/2 ) oz of hot sauce to the bottle. The total amount of liquid (shampoo and hot sauce) that has been used and replaced after ( d ) days is ( d ) oz. This means that the bottle still contains ( 10 - d ) oz of liquid. We are told that after a certain number of days, 25% of the liquid in the bottle is hot sauce. So, the amount of hot sauce in the bottle is ( (10 - d) times 0.25 ). Since Adonis adds ( d/2 ) oz of hot sauce over ( d ) days, we can set up the following equation: [ frac{d}{2} = (10 - d) times 0.25 ] Solving for ( d ): [ frac{d}{2} = 2.5 - 0.25d ] [ frac{d}{2} + 0.25d = 2.5 ] [ frac{2d + d}{4} = 2.5 ] [ frac{3d}{4} = 2.5 ] [ 3d = 2.5 times 4 ] [ 3d = 10 ] [ d = frac{10}{3} ] [ d = 3frac{1}{3} ] Since ( d ) must be a whole number of days, we can't have a fraction of a day.

Without loss of generality, assume ( left| x_1 right| leq left| x_2 right| ). 2. **Root Relations**: According to Vieta's formulas for the polynomial ( ax^2 + bx + c ), we know: [ x_1 + x_2 = -frac{b}{a} ] [ x_1 x_2 = frac{c}{a} ] 3. **Substitute the root relationships into the expression (left| frac{c}{b} right|)**: [ 2 left| frac{c}{b} right| = 2 left| frac{a x_1 x_2}{b} right| ] Replace ( x_1 x_2 ): [ 2 left| frac{a x_1 x_2}{b} right| = 2 left| frac{a x_1 x_2}{a left( x_1 + x_2 right)} right| = frac{2 left| x_1 right| left| x_2 right|}{ left| x_1 + x_2 right|} ] 4. **Inequality Application**: [ frac{2 left| x_1 right| left| x_2 right|}{ left| x_1 + x_2 right|} geq frac{2 left| x_1 right| left| x_2 right| } { left| x_1 right| + left| x_2 right|} ] Since ( left| x_1 + x_2 right| leq left| x_1 right| + left| x_2 right| ). 5. **Simplifying** the inequality: [ frac{2 left| x_1 right| left| x_2 right|}{ left| x_1 right| + left| x_2 right|} geq frac{2 left| x_1 right| left| x_2 right|}{ 2 left| x_2 right|} = left| x_1 right| ] From the inequality, we see that: [ 2 left| frac{c}{b} right| geq left| x_1 right| ] Thus, at least one of the roots (x_1) satisfies: [ left| x_1 right| leq 2 left| frac{c}{b} right| ] Therefore, we have shown that there exists a root of the polynomial whose absolute value is not greater than ( 2 left| frac{c}{b} right| ).

The equation representing the mixture of the two paints to achieve a 15% intensity is: ( 0.5 times 10% + 0.5 times x% = 15% ) Now, we can solve for ( x ): ( 5% + 0.5x% = 15% ) Subtract 5% from both sides: ( 0.5x% = 15% - 5% ) ( 0.5x% = 10% ) Now, divide both sides by 0.5 to find ( x ): ( x% = frac{10%}{0.5} ) ( x% = 20% ) So, the intensity of the red paint solution that was added is boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"Which of the following statements is correct?

If both angles are acute, each must be less than 90^circ. Since the sum of two numbers each less than 90^circ is less than 180^circ, it is indeed possible for both to be acute and their sum to be 90^circ. Therefore, statement A actually holds true. **Statement B**: By the postulate of parallel lines, through a given point not on a line, there is exactly one line parallel to the given line. This means statement B is correct. **Statement C**: If a is parallel to b and b is perpendicular to c, then a cannot be perpendicular to c unless it coincides with b. The correct relationship is that a is also parallel to c. Therefore, statement C does not hold true as it misinterprets the relationship. **Statement D**: There is indeed only one line perpendicular to a given line passing through a specific point, but this statement contradicts the solution's claim that statement D does not hold true. The correct interpretation is that statement D holds true based on the uniqueness of perpendicular lines through a point to a given line in Euclidean geometry. Given the misinterpretation in the solution provided, let's correct the analysis based on the principles of geometry: - **Statement A** is true because two acute angles can indeed sum up to 90^circ. - **Statement B** is true as it correctly states a fundamental property of parallel lines. - **Statement C** is false because it incorrectly concludes the relationship between a and c. - **Statement D** is true based on the principles of Euclidean geometry.

It is possible for two complementary angles to both be acute. - **Statement B** is correctly identified as true. - **Statement C**'s analysis in the solution is correct based on the given answer, but the explanation was incorrect. The correct relationship is parallel, not perpendicular. - **Statement D** was incorrectly dismissed in the solution provided. Correcting for the format and the rules: - **Statement A** is true. - **Statement B** is true and is the correct answer based on the given solution. - **Statement C** is false. - **Statement D** is true, but according to the solution provided, we focus on statement B as the correct answer.

(Theresia Eisenkölbl)","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Definitions**: - Start with three positive integers on the board denoted by (a, b, c). - The steps require choosing (a, b, c) such that (a > gcd(b, c)), where (gcd) denotes the greatest common divisor. - Replace (a) with (a - gcd(b, c)). 2. **Invariant Property**: - Let (d := gcd(a, b, c)) be the greatest common divisor of the three numbers. - We need to show that this value, (d), remains unchanged throughout the process despite the changes in (a). 3. **Detailed Proof**: - Consider the new set of numbers after one step: (a - gcd(b, c), b, c). - Let (e := gcd(a - gcd(b, c), b, c)). 4. **Show (d mid e)**: - (d) is a common divisor of (a, b,) and (c), so it divides (gcd(b, c)). - Since (d) divides both (a) and (gcd(b, c)), it must also divide their difference (a - gcd(b, c)). - Therefore, (d) is a divisor of the numbers (a - gcd(b, c), b, c), meaning (d mid e). 5. **Show (e mid d)**: - (e) is a common divisor of (a - gcd(b, c), b, c). - Because (e) divides (b) and (c), it divides (gcd(b, c)). - Also, (e) divides (a - gcd(b, c)), so it must divide the sum ((a - gcd(b, c)) + gcd(b, c) = a). - Therefore, (e) is a divisor of the numbers (a, b, c), meaning (e mid d). 6. **Conclusion**: - Since (d mid e) and (e mid d), and both (d) and (e) are positive integers, it follows that (d = e). - Therefore, the greatest common divisor remains invariant: (gcd(a, b, c)) is constant during the game. 7. **Termination of the Process**: - Every step reduces one of the numbers (a) by at least 1, making the numbers on the board strictly decreasing. - Given that the numbers are positive integers, this decrease will eventually lead to numbers where no more reduction can be made. - Thus, the process will terminate. 8. **Dependence on Initial Numbers**: - The invariant property shows that the final state of the numbers depends only on their initial (gcd). - Therefore, the ending numbers are uniquely determined by the initial set ((a, b, c)) and not by the specific sequence of steps taken. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The game always ends and the final numbers depend only on the initial values, not on the sequence of steps.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let [bold{A} = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 3 & 1 & 2 2 & 3 & 1 end{pmatrix}.]Find constants p, q, and r such that [bold{A}^3 + p bold{A}^2 + q bold{A} + r bold{I} = bold{0},]where bold{I} is the 3 times 3 identity matrix, and bold{0} is the zero matrix.","completion":"First, compute bold{A}^2: [bold{A}^2 = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 3 & 1 & 2 2 & 3 & 1 end{pmatrix}begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 3 & 1 & 2 2 & 3 & 1 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 14 & 11 & 10 10 & 14 & 11 11 & 10 & 14 end{pmatrix}.] Next, compute bold{A}^3: [bold{A}^3 = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 3 & 1 & 2 2 & 3 & 1 end{pmatrix}begin{pmatrix} 14 & 11 & 10 10 & 14 & 11 11 & 10 & 14 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 59 & 52 & 53 53 & 59 & 52 52 & 53 & 59 end{pmatrix}.] To find p, q, and r: [begin{pmatrix} 59 & 52 & 53 53 & 59 & 52 52 & 53 & 59 end{pmatrix} + p begin{pmatrix} 14 & 11 & 10 10 & 14 & 11 11 & 10 & 14 end{pmatrix} + q begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 3 & 1 & 2 2 & 3 & 1 end{pmatrix} + r begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 0 & 1 & 0 0 & 0 & 1 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 0 & 0 & 0 0 & 0 & 0 end{pmatrix}.] This yields the system: begin{align*} 14p + q + r &= -59, 11p + 2q &= -52, 10p + 3q &= -53. end{align*} Solving this system using substitution or matrix methods, you find p = -3, q = -9, r = -2.

This height can be calculated using the formula for the height of an equilateral triangle, which gives us b = sqrt{3}. Since the ellipse is defined by the equation frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, and we know that b = sqrt{3} and c = 1, we can use the relationship between a, b, and c in an ellipse, which is c^2 = a^2 - b^2.

Find the greatest natural number that, for each its representation as a sum of positive integers, there exists a fleet such that the summands are exactly the numbers of squares contained in individual ships.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the greatest natural number ( n ) such that for any partition of ( n ) into positive integers, there exists a fleet of ships on a ( 10 times 10 ) grid where the summands are exactly the numbers of squares contained in individual ships. The ships must be vertex-disjoint. 2. **Initial Observation:** The grid is ( 10 times 10 ), which contains ( 100 ) unit squares. We need to ensure that the ships are vertex-disjoint, meaning no two ships can share a common vertex. 3. **Partitioning the Grid:** Consider partitioning the ( 10 times 10 ) grid into ( 2 times 2 ) squares. Each ( 2 times 2 ) square contains 4 unit squares. There are ( frac{100}{4} = 25 ) such ( 2 times 2 ) squares in the grid. 4. **Maximum Number of Ships:** If we place one ship in each ( 2 times 2 ) square, we can have 25 ships, each occupying 4 unit squares. This configuration ensures that no two ships share a common vertex. 5. **Verification for ( n = 25 ):** For ( n = 25 ), we can represent ( 25 ) as a sum of 25 ones: ( 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 = 25 ). This means we need 25 ships, each containing 1 unit square. However, this is not possible because placing 25 ships, each containing 1 unit square, would require 25 unit squares, and ensuring they are vertex-disjoint is not feasible in a ( 10 times 10 ) grid. 6. **Verification for ( n = 24 ):** For ( n = 24 ), we can represent ( 24 ) as a sum of 24 ones: ( 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 = 24 ). This means we need 24 ships, each containing 1 unit square. This is also not feasible for the same reason as above. 7. **Verification for ( n = 25 ) with Different Partitions:** For ( n = 25 ), consider different partitions such as ( 4 + 4 + cdots + 4 + 1 = 25 ). We can place six ( 2 times 2 ) ships and one ship containing 1 unit square. This configuration is feasible and ensures that the ships are vertex-disjoint. 8. **Generalization:** For any ( 2k times 2m ) grid, the maximum number of vertex-disjoint ships is ( km ). For a ( 10 times 10 ) grid, ( k = 5 ) and ( m = 5 ), so the maximum number is ( 5 times 5 = 25 ). Conclusion: The greatest natural number ( n ) such that for any partition of ( n ) into positive integers, there exists a fleet of ships on a ( 10 times 10 ) grid where the summands are exactly the numbers of squares contained in individual ships, is ( 25 ). The final answer is ( boxed{ 25 } )."},{"prompt":"A gecko lays some eggs per year. 20 percent of them are infertile, and a third of the remaining eggs will not hatch due to calcification issues. 16 eggs actually hatch. How many eggs does the gecko lay per year?","completion":"Let's denote the total number of eggs laid by the gecko per year as E. According to the information given, 20% of the eggs are infertile. Therefore, the number of fertile eggs is 80% of E, which can be written as 0.8E. Out of these fertile eggs, a third will not hatch due to calcification issues. This means that only two-thirds of the fertile eggs will hatch. The number of eggs that will hatch is thus (2/3) * 0.8E. We are given that 16 eggs actually hatch. Therefore, we can set up the equation: (2/3) * 0.8E = 16 To find E, we solve for it as follows: 0.8E * (2/3) = 16 (0.8 * 2/3)E = 16 (8/10 * 2/3)E = 16 (16/30)E = 16 (8/15)E = 16 Now, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (8/15) to isolate E: E = 16 * (15/8) E = 2 * 15 E = 30 Therefore, the gecko lays boxed{30} eggs per year."},{"prompt":"Find the constant t such that [(5x^2 6x + 7)(4x^2 +tx + 10) = 20x^4 54x^3 +114x^2 102x +70.]","completion":"To find the constant t such that the equation [(5x^2 - 6x + 7)(4x^2 +tx + 10) = 20x^4 -54x^3 +114x^2 -102x +70] holds, we focus on the coefficient of x in the expanded form of the product on the left side. The x term can be obtained in two ways during the expansion: 1. By multiplying the constant term from the first polynomial (+7) with the x term from the second polynomial (+tx), which gives 7tx. 2. By multiplying the x term from the first polynomial (-6x) with the constant term from the second polynomial (+10), which gives -60x. Therefore, the coefficient of x in the expansion is the sum of these two products, which is 7tx - 60x. Given that the coefficient of x in the right-hand side polynomial is -102x, we set the coefficients of x equal to each other to find t: [7tx - 60x = -102x.] Solving for t, we isolate t on one side: begin{align*} 7tx &= -102x + 60x 7tx &= -42x t &= -42x / (7x) t &= -6. end{align*} Thus, we find t = boxed{-6}.

This is because a polyhedron is defined as regular if all its faces are regular polygons and all its polyhedral angles are equal. 3. **Understand the structure of the polyhedron:** - Because all the faces are equal regular polygons and the dihedral angles between any two faces are equal, the arrangement around each vertex must be identical. 4. **Using Symmetry:** - Let's pick any vertex of the polyhedron.

It is also stated that Baker bought 63 more cakes than he sold. So, the number of cakes Baker bought (154) minus the number of cakes he sold (91) should equal 63. 154 - 91 = 63 Now, we need to find out how many cakes Baker made initially (x). Since he sold 91 cakes, we can say that: x - 91 (cakes sold) + 154 (cakes bought) = x + 63 (because he bought 63 more cakes than he sold) Now, we just need to solve for x: x - 91 + 154 = x + 63 x + 63 = x - 91 + 154 x + 63 = x + 63 Since both sides of the equation are equal, it means that the number of cakes Baker made initially (x) is not affected by the transactions of selling and buying.

After the first strike, the length of the nail that has entered the board is frac{4}{7}. After the second strike, the length of the nail that enters is k times the length that entered on the first strike, so it's frac{4}{7}k. Similarly, after the third strike, the length of the nail that enters is k times the length that entered on the second strike, which is frac{4}{7}k^2. Since the nail is fully inserted after 3 strikes, the sum of the lengths of the nail that entered after each strike equals the total length of the nail, which is 1.

For example, if ( n = 12345 ), then ( f(n) = 87654 ). 3. **Properties of ( f )**: - ( f(f(n)) = n ): Applying ( f ) twice returns the original number, so ( f ) is an involution. - ( f ) is a bijection: Since ( f ) is an involution, it is also a bijection, meaning every number in ( T ) has a unique image under ( f ). 4. **Fixed Points of ( f )**: The fixed points of ( f ) are numbers ( n ) such that ( f(n) = n ).

When a < 0, Delta > 0 because subtracting a negative number results in a larger positive number (4 - (-4a) = 4 + 4|a| > 4). 2. **Root Analysis Using Vieta's Formulas**: From Vieta's formulas, we know the product of roots x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{c}{a}.

The derivative is given by: [f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(e^x - a(x+2)) = e^x - a] When a=1, we substitute a into the derivative: [f'(x) = e^x - 1] To find the critical points, we set f'(x) = 0: [e^x - 1 = 0 Rightarrow e^x = 1] Solving for x, we get: [x = 0] Now, we analyze the sign of f'(x) to determine monotonicity: - For x < 0, f'(x) = e^x - 1 < 0, implying f(x) is monotonically decreasing. - For x > 0, f'(x) = e^x - 1 > 0, implying f(x) is monotonically increasing.

During the sales process, it was found that if it is sold at a unit price of 26 yuan, then 240 lamps can be sold in one month. Based on sales experience, increasing the selling price will lead to a decrease in sales volume, that is, for every 1 yuan increase in selling price, the sales volume decreases by 10 units. According to the regulations of the price department, the selling price of this eyeprotecting desk lamp must not be lower than the cost price and must not exceed 32 yuan. (1) Find the functional relationship between the monthly sales volume y (units) and the selling price x (yuan); (2) Let Li Ming's monthly profit be w (yuan). At what price should the selling price be set to maximize the monthly profit, and what is the maximum monthly profit?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Functional Relationship Given that when the selling price is 26 yuan, 240 lamps can be sold, and for every 1 yuan increase in selling price, the sales volume decreases by 10 units. We can express the relationship between the monthly sales volume y and the selling price x as follows: 1. Let's start with the base case: at 26 yuan, 240 units are sold. 2. For every 1 yuan increase in price, sales decrease by 10 units. This can be represented as -10(x - 26), where x is the selling price. 3. Therefore, the equation becomes y = 240 - 10(x - 26). Simplifying the equation: [ y = 240 - 10x + 260 = -10x + 500 ] Thus, the functional relationship between y and x is: [ y = -10x + 500 ] Part 2: Maximizing Monthly Profit Let's denote Li Ming's monthly profit by w. The profit for each lamp sold is the selling price minus the cost price, which is (x - 20), and the total profit is this margin multiplied by the number of units sold, y. 1. Substituting y from part 1, we get: [ w = (x - 20) cdot (-10x + 500) ] 2. Expanding this, we find the profit function: [ w = -10x^2 + 700x - 10000 ] To maximize profit, we need to find the vertex of this quadratic function. The vertex formula for x in a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c is given by x = -frac{b}{2a}. Substituting a = -10 and b = 700 into the vertex formula: [ x = -frac{700}{2(-10)} = 35 ] However, the selling price must be between 20 yuan and 32 yuan. Since 35 is outside this range and the parabola opens downwards (because a = -10 < 0), the maximum profit occurs at the upper limit of this range, which is 32 yuan. Substituting x = 32 into the profit function: [ w_{max} = -10(32)^2 + 700(32) - 10000 = 2160 ] Therefore, to maximize monthly profit, the selling price should be set at 32 yuan, and the maximum monthly profit is boxed{2160} yuan."},{"prompt":"an examination it is necessary for a candidate to get 45 % of the maximum marks to pass . a candidate who gets 180 marks , fails by 45 marks . find the maximum marks .","completion":"Let's denote the maximum marks as M.

The integrals are: 1. (int frac{1}{x-1} , dx = ln|x-1|), 2. (int frac{1}{(x+2)^3} , dx): Let ( u = x+2 Rightarrow du = dx ).

Without any restrictions, the number of ways to arrange these 6 tasks is 6! (6 factorial), which is equal to 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720. However, we are given that there are only 360 ways to arrange the assembly line, which is exactly half of 720. This implies that there is a restriction that cuts the number of possible arrangements in half. The only restriction that would halve the number of arrangements is if one task must be done before another specific task. This creates pairs of tasks where one must come before the other. For example, if task A must be done before task B, then for every arrangement of the other tasks (C, D, E, F), there are only two possibilities: A before B or B before A. But since A must come before B, we eliminate the B before A option, effectively halving the number of possible arrangements.

Let, W_i and L_i be respectively the number of games won and lost by the i th contestant. Suppose, L_i+W_jgeq 8 whenever the j th contestant defeats the i th contestant. Prove that, there are exactly 40 winning triangles in this tournament.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to prove that there are exactly 40 winning triangles in a table-tennis tournament with 10 contestants, where each pair of contestants plays exactly once. A winning triangle is defined as a set of three contestants (i, j, k) such that (i) defeats (j), (j) defeats (k), and (k) defeats (i). 2. **Counting Total Triangles:** The total number of triangles that can be formed from 10 contestants is given by the combination formula: [ binom{10}{3} = frac{10 times 9 times 8}{3 times 2 times 1} = 120 ] 3. **Complementary Counting:** We will use complementary counting to find the number of winning triangles. For each player (i), let (d_i) be the number of players that (i) defeats (out-degree of (i)). The number of non-winning triangles involving player (i) is given by the number of ways to choose 2 players from the (d_i) players that (i) defeats: [ binom{d_i}{2} ] 4. **Summing Non-Winning Triangles:** Summing over all players, the total number of non-winning triangles is: [ sum_{i=1}^{10} binom{d_i}{2} ] 5. **Using the Degree Sum Property:** Since each game is played exactly once, the total number of games is: [ sum_{i=1}^{10} d_i = 45 ] This is because each of the 10 players plays 9 games, and each game is counted twice (once for each player). 6. **Convexity Argument:** The function (binom{x}{2} = frac{x(x-1)}{2}) is convex, meaning that the sum (sum_{i=1}^{10} binom{d_i}{2}) is minimized when the (d_i) values are as equal as possible. Given (sum_{i=1}^{10} d_i = 45), the values (d_i) that are as equal as possible are five 4's and five 5's. 7. **Calculating Non-Winning Triangles:** If five players have (d_i = 4) and five players have (d_i = 5), then: [ sum_{i=1}^{10} binom{d_i}{2} = 5 binom{4}{2} + 5 binom{5}{2} = 5 times 6 + 5 times 10 = 30 + 50 = 80 ] 8. **Finding Winning Triangles:** The number of winning triangles is the total number of triangles minus the number of non-winning triangles: [ 120 - 80 = 40 ] 9. **Condition Verification:** The condition (L_i + W_j geq 8) whenever (j) defeats (i) ensures that the distribution of wins and losses is such that the degrees (d_i) are either 4 or 5, as shown above.

We start by verifying the inequalities for the given distances: (AB = CD = 8 text{cm}) (AC = BD = 10 text{cm}) (AD = BC = 13 text{cm}) 2. **Verification of triangle inequality for ( triangle ABC )**: For triangle ( triangle ABC ): [ text{Check if } 8^2 + 10^2 geq 13^2 ] Let's calculate: [ 8^2 = 64 ] [ 10^2 = 100 ] [ 13^2 = 169 ] [ 8^2 + 10^2 = 64 + 100 = 164 ] [ 13^2 = 169 ] Since [ 164 < 169 ] It shows that the inequality (8^2 + 10^2 < 13^2) holds true, suggesting that triangle (ABC) is not realizable since the sum of the squares of two sides is less than the square of the third side. This implies that triangle (ABC) would be an obtuse-angled triangle. However, for four points (A, B, C, D) to form a tetrahedron with the given equal edge lengths, all triangles formed must be acute. 3. **Tetrahedron and Parallelepiped Relationship**: Given the triangular face (ABC) is obtuse, it implies that it is impossible to form a tetrahedron with such side lengths.

This is possible by Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, which guarantees the existence of infinitely many primes in the form ( 4k + 3 ). 3. **Quadratic Reciprocity:** - By quadratic reciprocity, if ( p equiv 3 pmod{4} ), then ( left( frac{p}{p_j} right) = -1 ) for all ( 1 le j le 2i-2 ). 4. **GCD Condition:** - Suppose for some prime ( p_k ), ( p_k mid a^n + b^n ).

According to the information given, Pradeep needs to obtain 35% of the total marks to pass. This means that the passing marks are 35% of M. Pradeep got 520 marks and failed by 45 marks. This means that if he had obtained 45 more marks, he would have passed. Therefore, the passing marks are 520 + 45. So we can set up the equation: 35% of M = 520 + 45 Converting 35% to a decimal, we get 0.35.

Let ( C ) be the point where the tangent to ( C_2 ) at ( B ) meets the line, and let ( D ) be the intersection of the tangent to ( C_1 ) at ( B ). Given: - ( X ) is the intersection of the bisector of ( angle BAC ) with ( C_1 ). - ( Y ) is the intersection of the bisector of ( angle BAD ) with ( C_2 ). - ( P ) is the center of the circumcircle of triangle ( ACD ). - ( Q ) is the center of the circumcircle of triangle ( AXY ). We need to prove that the line ( PQ ) is perpendicular to ( O_1O_2 ). 2. **Noting the Similarity Transformation (s)** Consider a similarity transformation ( s ) centered at ( A ). This transformation maps ( C_1 ) to ( C_2 ), ( C ) to ( B ), and ( B ) to ( D ). Similarly, it maps ( O_1 ) to ( O_2 ). By this similarity transformation: [ s: O_1 mapsto O_2, quad C mapsto B, quad B mapsto D ] 3. **Transformation of Line Segments** Since line ( O_1P ) is transformed into the perpendicular bisector of segment ( AB ): [ s(text{line } O_1P) = text{perpendicular bisector of } AB ] The perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) is the line ( O_1O_2 ), and similarly, under the transformation ( s ): [ s(text{line } O_1O_2) = text{line } O_2P ] 4. **Angle Relations and Isosceles Triangles** Examine the angles formed by the configurations. By the properties of similarity transformations and the central angle theorem: [ widehat{PO_1O_2} = widehat{PO_2O_1} ] This implies triangle ( PO_1O_2 ) is isosceles with ( P ) as the apex and the angles at ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) being equal. 5. **Consideration of Angles Made by Centers** Let us analyze the angles made by the intersection points and the circumcenter: [ widehat{O_2O_1Q} = widehat{ACX} quad text{(from the central angle theorem)} ] Similarly, [ widehat{O_1O_2Q} = widehat{ABY} ] 6. **Similitude Mapping** The similarity transformation ( s ) maps ( X ) to ( Y ), confirming: [ s(X) = Y ] Since line ( O_1Q ) is transformed to line ( O_2Q ): [ widehat{O_1QO_2} = widehat{PO_1O_2} ] Thus, by considering another intersection point ( Q' ) on circle ( O_1 ): [ widehat{Q'O_1P} = widehat{O_2O_1Q} ] 7. **Conclusion on Perpendicularity** Since triangle ( PO_1O_2 ) is isosceles and the similitude transformation ( s ) preserves the angles and lengths, ( P, O_1, Q, O_2 ) forms a kite where the diagonals ( PQ ) and ( O_1O_2 ) are perpendicular by the properties of kites.

To find the common area of regions (M) and (N), we first identify the intersection points and any overlapping areas between the two regions on a coordinate plane. 3.

Note that both are right-angled triangles: - The base (OB) of (triangle OAB) is (t) units and the height (OA) is also (t) units. So, the area (S_{triangle OAB}) is: [ S_{triangle OAB} = frac{1}{2} times t times t = frac{1}{2} t^2 ] - The base (CF) of (triangle DCF) is (2 - (t + 1)) units, which simplifies to (1 - t) units, and the height (DC) is also (1 - t) units.

To do this, we take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left(e^x (sin x - cos x)right). By using the product rule for differentiation, f'(x) becomes: f'(x) = e^x (sin x - cos x) + e^x (cos x + sin x) = 2e^x sin x. To find the critical points, we set f'(x) to zero: 2e^x sin x = 0. Since e^x is never zero, the only way this equation can equal zero is if sin x = 0. This occurs at x = kpi where k is an integer. Next, we need to determine which of these critical points are local maximums. For function f(x), local maximums happen when sin x changes from positive to negative, which is at the points pi + 2kpi for integer k. In this range of 0 leq x leq 2011pi, these points are pi, 3pi, 5pi, ... , 2009pi.

What is the speed of the goods train in kmph?","completion":"To find the speed of the goods train, we first need to determine the relative speed between the two trains when they pass each other. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we add their speeds together to get the relative speed. Let's denote the speed of the goods train as ( V_g ) (in km/h). The relative speed between the two trains is: [ V_{relative} = V_{man} + V_g ] [ V_{relative} = 50 + V_g ] Now, we need to convert the relative speed into meters per second (m/s) because the length of the goods train and the time it takes to pass the man are given in meters and seconds, respectively. To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor ( frac{1000}{3600} ) or ( frac{5}{18} ). So, the relative speed in m/s is: [ V_{relative} times frac{5}{18} = (50 + V_g) times frac{5}{18} ] The goods train takes 9 seconds to pass the man, and it is 280 meters long. The distance covered by the goods train while passing the man is equal to its length. Therefore, we can use the formula: [ text{Distance} = text{Speed} times text{Time} ] [ 280 = V_{relative} times 9 ] Substituting the relative speed in m/s, we get: [ 280 = (50 + V_g) times frac{5}{18} times 9 ] Now, we solve for ( V_g ): [ 280 = (50 + V_g) times frac{5}{18} times 9 ] [ 280 = (50 + V_g) times frac{5}{2} ] [ 280 = 125 + frac{5}{2} V_g ] [ 280 - 125 = frac{5}{2} V_g ] [ 155 = frac{5}{2} V_g ] [ V_g = frac{155 times 2}{5} ] [ V_g = frac{310}{5} ] [ V_g = 62 ] Therefore, the speed of the goods train is boxed{62} km/h."},{"prompt":"There are 23 students in a class.

Each student celebrates their birthday once a year, with some (but not all) of their classmates attending someone else's birthday. We need to determine whether it is possible for every pair of students, (A) and (B), to meet at the same number of birthday celebrations. We will provide detailed step-by-step constructions of two scenarios illustrating how such an arrangement can be possible. These scenarios will ensure that every possible pair of students meets exactly the same number of times. 1. **First Scenario:** - **Step 1:** Arrange the students in a circle. - **Step 2:** Assume that for any student's birthday, all their classmates except the one directly clockwise from them on the circle attend. - **Step 3:** We need to count the number of meetings between every pair of students (A) and (B): - Let's take two students (A) and (B). - (A) will meet (B) on every birthday celebration except (A)’s own birthday and the birthday following (A) (which (B) attends and (A) does not). Therefore, for any pair of students (A) and (B), they will meet on (23-2 = 21) occasions. 2. **Second Scenario:** - **Step 1:** Let's isolate two students, (A) and (B). - **Step 2:** Assume for (A)'s birthday, all classmates except (B) attend. - **Step 3:** On (B)'s birthday, assume only (A) attends. - **Step 4:** Suppose for all other students’ birthdays, only (B) attends. - **Step 5:** For any pair of students who are not (B), they meet on (A’s) birthday. - **Step 6:** Any pair of students containing (B) meets only on the other students' birthdays: - Pair without (B): (A)'s birthday. - Pairs containing (B): Every other celebration. Therefore, every pair meets exactly once. # Conclusion: By presenting two distinct scenarios where all pairs of students meet the same number of times (either 21 times in the first scenario or once in the second), it is shown that the proposed arrangement is indeed possible.

When a card is removed, the product (ab) of its numbers is written on the board. The first player who causes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all products on the board to fall to 1 loses. 2. **Analysis of the gcd**: Consider the situation just before the losing move. At that moment, the gcd of all products written on the board must be (d > 1). If (d) is composite, then it has proper factors. This means a card with such a proper factor (k) paired with any 1 (i.e., the card ((1, k))) could theoretically still exist and be played. This would not reduce the gcd to 1. Hence, such a scenario leads to a contradiction, implying that (d) must be prime. 3. **Prime gcd**: Assume (d) is prime. For gcd (d) to persist, every played pair ((a,b)) must have (d) dividing (ab). Hence, either (a equiv 0 pmod{d}) or (b equiv 0 pmod{d}). 4. **Counting Cards**: For a prime (d), consider pairs ((a,d)) where (1 leq a < d).

Note that the eccentricity of a hyperbola is greater than 1. In order for the line to intersect the hyperbola at two points, the slope of one of the hyperbola's asymptotes must be less than the slope of the line, i.e., frac{b}{a} < frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. By finding the relationship between a and b, and then converting it into a relationship between a and c using b = sqrt{c^2 - a^2}, we can find a range for the eccentricity e. Finally, considering that the eccentricity of a hyperbola is greater than 1, we can determine the range of e. [Step-by-step Solution] For the line to intersect the hyperbola at two points, the slope of one of the hyperbola's asymptotes must be less than the slope of the line: frac{b}{a} < tan 30^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, which implies b < frac{sqrt{3}}{3}a.

We need to prove that the sum of its digits ( N ) cannot be 76. 2. **Initial Assumption and Mathematical Basis**: Suppose the sum of the digits of ( N ) is 76. Note that ( 3 cdot 37 = 111 ), and ( 27 cdot 37 = 999 ). This tells us: [ 10^3 equiv 1 mod 37 ] 3. **Digit Grouping**: Consider ( N ) as ( x = a_n 10^{3n} + a_{n-1} 10^{3(n-1)} + cdots + a_1 10^3 + a_0 ). By the congruence property, we can say: [ x equiv a_n + a_{n-1} + cdots + a_1 + a_0 mod 37 ] The divisibility test here means the sum of the digits taken in groups of three is congruent ( N mod 37 ). 4. **Intermediate Number Construction**: The sum of the digits is 76. Introducing ( A = 111111111111 ): [ A = 111111111111 equiv 0 mod 37 ] This helps because ( N equiv 0 mod 37 Rightarrow N - A equiv 0 mod 37 ). The number ( N - A ) consists of digits 0, 4, and 8 only, and it must be divisible by 4. Also, the sum of digits of ( N - A ) is: [ 76 - 12 cdot 1 = 64 ] 5. **Factor Adjustment**: The number ( (N - A) / 4 ): since ( frac{N - A}{4} ) contains digits only 0, 1, and 2 and is divisible by 37: [ frac{N - A}{4} equiv 0 mod 37 ] The sum of its digits is ( frac{64}{4} = 16 ). 6. **Digit Sum Analysis**: The next task is to sum the three-digit groups of the resulting ( S ) from ( frac{N-A}{4} ): [ S = 37(3k + 1) ] Hence, for divisibility and digit sum constraints, we get that ( S ) should take values among: [ S in { 037, 148, 259, 370, 481, 592, 703, 814, 925 } ] 7. **Conclusion Validation**: By examining these numbers: - Each candidate either possesses digits greater than 8 or does not conform to the digit sum constraint of 16. For instance: - ( 037: 0+3+7=10 ) - ( 148: 1+4+8=13 ) - ( 259: 2+5+9=16 ) (contains digit 9 but not achievable by ( frac{N-A}{4} )) Thus, consistent with these constraints, all values do not satisfy the criteria.

The number of ways to choose 3 distinct elements from ( 2n ) elements is given by the combination formula: [ binom{2n}{3} = frac{2n(2n-1)(2n-2)}{6} ] 3. Since the order of ( (x, y, z) ) matters, we need to multiply by the number of permutations of 3 elements, which is ( 3! = 6 ). 4.

For a hyperbola, the relationship between a, b, and c (the distance from the center to a focus) is given by c^2=a^2+b^2. Substituting c=2 into this equation gives us 4=a^2+b^2. The equation of the asymptote for the hyperbola is y=pmfrac{a}{b}x. Given that the distance from the focus to the asymptote of the hyperbola is 1, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line, frac{|ax_0+by_0+c|}{sqrt{a^2+b^2}}, where (x_0,y_0) is the point and ax+by+c=0 is the line. In our case, since the focus is on the y-axis and the distance is 1, we get frac{|bc|}{sqrt{a^2+b^2}}=1. Substituting c=2 and simplifying, we find b=1. Substituting b=1 into 4=a^2+b^2 gives us 4=a^2+1^2, which simplifies to a^2=3. Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola C is frac{y^2}{3}-x^2=1.

For a row with ( k ) elements, we can place at most ( k-1 ) segments, resulting in ( 2^{k-1} ) ways to partition the row. - Applying this to all rows, we get ( 2^{n-i} ) ways to partition the set ( N ) for a given ( i ). - **Summing up:** [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} d(i) = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} 2^{n-i} = 2^n - 2 ] - This follows from the geometric series sum formula. 3. **Part 2: At least two elements in each subset:** - **Claim:** The number of ways is ( 2^n - frac{n(n-1)}{2} - 2 ). - **Proof:** - The lemma changes to ( d(i) = 2^{n-i} - i ). - **Explanation:** - For each ( i ), we need to exclude the cases where subsets have only one element. - This results in ( 2^{n-i} - i ) ways for each ( i ). - **Summing up:** [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} d(i) = sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (2^{n-i} - i) = 2^n - sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i - 2 = 2^n - frac{n(n-1)}{2} - 2 ] - The sum of the first ( n-1 ) integers is ( frac{(n-1)n}{2} ). The final answer is ( boxed{ 2^n - 2 } ) for at least one element and ( 2^n - frac{n(n-1)}{2} - 2 ) for at least two elements."},{"prompt":"Given points A and B on the hyperbola C: x^{2} frac{y^{2}}{2}=1, if a circle with diameter AB passes through the coordinate origin O, find the minimum value of the area of triangle AOB.","completion":"Let A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}). 1. When the slope of line AB does not exist, due to the symmetry of the hyperbola, we have x_{1}=x_{2} and y_{1}=-y_{2}. Since circle D with diameter AB passes through the origin, overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB}=0. Thus, x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}=0, which implies x_{1}^{2}-y_{1}^{2}=0. Given that x_{1}^{2}- frac{y_{1}^{2}}{2}=1, we have |x_{1}|=|y_{1}|= sqrt{2}. Therefore, the distance d from the origin O to the line is |x_{1}|= sqrt{2}. 2. When the slope of line AB exists, let the equation of line AB be y=kx+m. Substituting this into the hyperbola equation and eliminating variables, we get (2-k^{2})x^{2}-2kmx-m^{2}-2=0. This gives us x_{1}+x_{2}= frac{2km}{2-k^{2}} and x_{1}x_{2}= frac{-m^{2}-2}{2-k^{2}}. Since circle D with diameter AB passes through the origin, overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB}=0. Thus, x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}=0, which implies (1+k^{2}) frac{-m^{2}-2}{2-k^{2}}+km times frac{2km}{2-k^{2}}+m^{2}=0. This simplifies to m^{2}=2(k^{2}+1). Therefore, the distance d from the origin O to the line is frac{|m|}{ sqrt{k^{2}+1}}= sqrt{2}. In right triangle triangle OAB, the distance |OH| from point O to line AB is sqrt{2}. Let angle OAH=theta, then angle BOH=theta. Thus, |OA|= frac{sqrt{2}}{sin theta} and |OB|= frac{sqrt{2}}{cos theta}. This gives us |OA||OB|= frac{4}{sin 2theta}. When 2theta=90^{circ}, |OA||OB| attains its minimum value of 4. Therefore, the minimum value of the area S of triangle AOB is 2. In conclusion, we discuss the problem in two cases: when the slope of line AB does not exist and when it does. In the former case, we use the symmetry of the hyperbola to find the distance from the origin to the line. In the latter case, we set the equation of line AB as y=kx+m, substitute this into the hyperbola equation, and use Vieta's theorem and the distance formula from a point to a line to find that the distance from the origin to the line is a fixed value. We then express |OA| and |OB| using trigonometric functions, from which we can find the minimum value of |OA||OB| and hence the minimum value of the area S of triangle AOB. This problem tests the understanding of the standard equation of a hyperbola and the combination of a circle and a hyperbola, and the key to solving it is to combine equations and use Vieta's theorem.

For example, the permutation (3,7,6,4,5,1,2) can be written as two disjoint cycles: ( (136) ) and ( (27) ), and fixed points ( 4 ) and ( 5 ). A cycle ((a_1 a_2 cdots a_k)) of length ( k ) implies that ( sigma(a_i) = a_{i+1} ) for ( 1 leq i leq k-1 ), and ( sigma(a_k) = a_1 ). 3. **Relation to Transpositions:** If a permutation consists of cycles of lengths ( k_1, k_2, ldots, k_m ), then ( g(sigma) ) is the number of cycles (including those of length 1). To transform ( sigma ) into the identity permutation using transpositions, each cycle of length ( k ) (with ( k geq 2 )) needs ( k-1 ) transpositions.

First, consider a cyclic quadrilateral A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 inscribed in a circle odot O.

Using the property of the orthocenter in a triangle, the complex number corresponding to H_1 (orthocenter of triangle A_2 A_3 A_4) is given by: [ H_1 = z_2 + z_3 + z_4 ] 4. Let O_1 be the complex number corresponding to the sum z_1 + z_2 + z_3 + z_4.

Therefore, it follows that: [ |O_1 - H_1| = |O_1 - H_2| = |O_1 - H_3| = |O_1 - H_4| = R ] 8. This confirms that the distances from O_1 to H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4 are equal, meaning that these four points lie on a circle centered at O_1 with radius R.

Draw the line ( BA ) and let ( D ) be the second point of intersection of line ( BA ) with the smaller circle. 4. Consider the arcs ( overarc{AB} ) and ( overarc{AD} ) of the smaller circle. Since these arcs are less than semi-circles, the angles subtended by these arcs at the center of the smaller circle are equal because the tangents at points ( A ), ( B ), and ( D ) make equal angles with the chords of the circle. 5. Since these angles are equal, the central angles that correspond to these arcs are also equal, implying the proportion of the arc lengths. 6. Therefore, we have: [ frac{|AD|}{|AB|} = frac{r}{R} ] Thus, ( |AD| = a frac{r}{R} ). 7. Now, for the distance ( |BC| ), we use the power of the point theorem. The power of point ( B ) with respect to the smaller circle is given by the product of the segments formed by any line through ( B ) that intersects the circle.

This means that (P(m)) should be a permutation polynomial over (mathbb{F}_p). 3. **Use known results about permutation polynomials:** A well-known result states that a cubic polynomial (P(m) = am^3 + bm^2 + cm) is a permutation polynomial over (mathbb{F}_p) if and only if: - (gcd(a, p) = 1) - (b^2 equiv 3ac pmod{p}) - (p equiv 2 pmod{3}) 4. **Verify the conditions:** - (gcd(a, p) = 1): This ensures that (a) is not divisible by (p), making (a) invertible in (mathbb{F}_p). - (b^2 equiv 3ac pmod{p}): This condition ensures that the discriminant of the polynomial (am^3 + bm^2 + cm) is zero modulo (p), which is necessary for the polynomial to be a permutation polynomial. - (p equiv 2 pmod{3}): This condition ensures that (-3) is a quadratic non-residue modulo (p), which is necessary for the polynomial to be a permutation polynomial. 5. **Transform the problem using substitutions:** If (m, n in mathbb{F}_p) satisfy (p mid a(m^2 + mn + n^2) + b(m + n) + c), then (m = n). Substituting (x = m + n) and (y = m - n), this becomes equivalent to having (x, y in mathbb{F}_p) satisfy (3ax^2 + ay^2 + 4bx + 4c equiv 0 pmod{p}), then (y = 0). 6. **Further substitutions and simplifications:** Make the substitutions (u = 3ax + 2b) and (v = ay) (all modulo (p)). The problem after some manipulations is now equivalent to: if (u, v in mathbb{F}_p) satisfy (u^2 + 3v^2 equiv C pmod{p}) where (C = 4(b^2 - 3ac)), then (v = 0). 7. **Apply Cauchy-Davenport theorem:** There are exactly ((p+1)/2) quadratic residues modulo (p) of the form (u^2) and ((p-1)/2) of the form (3v^2) when (v ne 0). Cauchy-Davenport theorem tells us that at least (min left(p, frac{p+1}{2} + frac{p+1}{2} - 1 right) = p-1) residues are covered by (u^2 + 3v^2) as (u, v) vary over (mathbb{F}_p). As a result, at most one residue can possibly be missed, which must be exactly (C). 8. **Conclude the proof:** However, scaling the equation by any perfect square also works, so (4C), for instance, should also be missed. As a result, (p mid 4C - C) which yields (C equiv 0 pmod{p}). Finally, to have (u^2 + 3v^2 equiv 0 pmod{p}) force (u = v = 0), we need (-3) to be a quadratic non-residue modulo (p), or (p equiv 2 pmod{3}).

The transformation and midpoint consideration will provide the necessary geometric insights. Here's a step-by-step detailed solution: 1. **Representation in Complex Plane**: Let the vertices of the two squares (ABCD) and (AEFG) be represented as complex numbers. Assume: - (A, B, C, D) are represented as complex numbers (a, b, c, d), - (A, E, F, G) are represented as complex numbers (a', e, f, g). 2. **Complex Congruence**: Since both squares are similar and orientation-preserving, there exists a fixed complex number (t) such that the similarity transformation can be represented as: [ frac{b' - a'}{b - a} = t, quad frac{c' - b'}{c - b} = t, quad dots ] where the modulus (|t|) represents the similarity ratio. 3. **Finding Midpoints**: Let's define the midpoints of the corresponding sides using their complex numbers. - (H) is the midpoint of (AC): [ h = frac{a + c}{2} ] - (J) is the midpoint of (EG): [ j = frac{e + g}{2} ] - (I) is the midpoint of (ED): [ i = frac{e + d}{2} ] - (K) is the midpoint of (BG): [ k = frac{b + g}{2} ] 4. **Establishing Proportions**: Consider the vertices of (H, I, J, K) to define their complex numbers appropriately. This setup ensures that the scaling and rotation are encapsulated within the similarity ratio. Therefore: [ frac{j - h}{e - a} = frac{g - c}{e - a} = frac{1}{2}(1 + t) ] This ensures the proportion consistency. 5. **Quadrilateral Verification**: The transformation and midpoint calculation mean that the quadrilateral composed of points (H, I, J, K) retains the same orientation and similarity properties as the original squares. Mathematically, this implies it must also be a square. 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, given that all sides and diagonals conform to the properties of a square, the quadrilateral (H I J K) must be a square based on our similarity and midpoint considerations.

It is known that if they board at the moment when the train driven by Roma is passing through the forest, Ira will board earlier than Alex; otherwise, Alex will board earlier than Ira or at the same time. What fraction of the track goes through the forest?","completion":"Step 1: Understanding the Result To begin, we'll consider the case where the number of trains n is evenly divisible by 3. In such a scenario, Aleksey and Ira will always board the trains simultaneously. Consequently, it means there is no forest because both embark at the same time. Step 2: Considering when n isn't divisible by 3 Next, let's assume n is not divisible by 3. If Aleksey and Ira do not arrive simultaneously at the stations, then one of them will board the train ahead of the other. Step 3: Defining Distances and Intervals Let the distance between adjacent trains be denoted as l. If a forest exists at some point X, then at a point Y that is separated by a distance that is a multiple of l from X, there would also be a forest. Step 4: Arguing Periodicity The \\"structure\\" of the forest consequently is periodic. Hence, it suffices to determine the location of forests within an interval of length l. Step 5: Identifying Key Moment Consider the point in time when a specific train departs from station B. Let's designate the train that Ira will embark on (i.e., the nearest non-moving train to station A in the direction opposite to the motion) to be located at a distance x from A. At this point, the entire interval between this train and station A is covered by the forest. Step 6: Proving No Forest for Certain Interval When the train arrives at station A, the closest train to B in the opposite motion would be at a distance l - x from B. If machinist Roma is within this interval (of length l - x), then Aleksey will board the train first since Ira had missed her train. Step 7: Establishing Forest and Field Ratio Thus, within the interval of length l, forests and fields have distance covered as follows: X length is for forest, and l-x is for field. Given the periodic nature of the forest's structure, the proportion of the road covered by the forest relative to the field corresponds to the ratio x : l - x. Step 8: Determining Specific Value of X Now, calculating x, we note that the total perimeter of the circle (road length) is n times l. Therefore, the arc length of BA equals frac{2}{3} n times l. Clearly, x equals the remainder of dividing the arc length of frac{2}{3} n times l by l. Step 9: Final Calculations and Conclusion Thus: - If the remainder of n divided by 3 equals 1, then x = frac{2l}{3}. In that case, the proportion of the road covered by the forest equals frac{2}{3}. - Similarly, if the remainder of n divided by 3 equals 2, then x = frac{l}{3}. Here, the road is covered by the forest equals frac{1}{3}. Therefore, the part of the road that goes through the forest is either frac{2}{3} or frac{1}{3} depending on the value of n mod 3.

The union of sets A and B would include all numbers between -2 and 2, including 0 and 2, since 0 is included in both A and B, and 2 is included in B.

Prove that your method satisfies these requirements.","completion":"To address the problem, we need to design a coloring method for points on a Cartesian coordinate plane under specific requirements. We shall describe the process thoroughly and prove its validity in satisfying the given conditions. Step-by-Step Design of the Coloring Method: 1. **Define the Colors:** - **White**: Points ((x, y)) where both (x) and (y) are odd. i.e., ((text{odd}, text{odd})). - **Black**: Points ((x, y)) where both (x) and (y) are even. i.e., ((text{even}, text{even})). - **Red**: Points ((x, y)) where one coordinate is odd and the other is even. i.e., ((text{odd}, text{even})) or ((text{even}, text{odd})). First, we need to verify that such a coloring meets the given conditions: 2. **Verification of Condition (1):** - **Condition (1)**: Each type of colored point should appear on infinitely many lines parallel to the horizontal axis. - Since we have an infinite grid of points where coordinates can be ( (x,y) ) with integers, each combination mentioned will appear infinitely many times in a fixed-axis parallel alignment. For instance, ((text{odd}, text{odd})) will appear on infinitely many lines where (y) is fixed odd and (x) ranges over all odd. Thus, this condition is satisfied naturally by our coloring method. 3. **Verification of Condition (2):** - **Condition (2)**: For any white point (A), red point (B), and black point (C), we need to find the fourth vertex (D) such that (ABCD) forms a parallelogram and (D) is a red point. Proof: 4. **Setup the Points:** - Let (A) be a white point: (A(2m+1, 2n+1)) - Let (C) be a black point: (C(2s, 2t)) - Let (B) be a red point: (B(2p, 2q+1)) where (m, n, s, t, p, q) are all integers. 5. **Finding the Coordinates of (D):** - To form a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals (AC) and (BD) must be the same. - Using the midpoint formula and setting them equal: [ left{ begin{aligned} frac{x + 2p}{2} &= frac{2m + 1 + 2s}{2} frac{y + (2q + 1)}{2} &= frac{2n + 1 + 2t}{2} end{aligned} right. ] - Solving the equations give us: [ left{ begin{aligned} x &= 2m + 1 + 2s - 2p y &= 2(n + t - q) end{aligned} right. ] 6. **Identifying the Color of (D):** - Coordinates of (D) are (x = 2m + 1 + 2s - 2p) and (y = 2(n + t - q)). - The x-coordinate, (2m + 1 + 2s - 2p), is odd since it is the sum of an odd number ((2m+1)) and even numbers (2s - 2p). - The y-coordinate, (2(n + t - q)), is even.

Let's denote the number of vertices on one base as n. Then the total number of vertices V for the prism is 2n (since there are two bases). The number of edges on one base is also n, and there are n edges connecting the corresponding vertices of the two bases, so the total number of edges E is 3n. The number of faces F is n + 2 (since there are n rectangular faces plus the two bases). The sum of the vertices, faces, and edges is given as 44: V + F + E = 44 Substituting the expressions in terms of n, we get: 2n + (n + 2) + 3n = 44 Combining like terms, we have: 6n + 2 = 44 Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: 6n = 42 Dividing by 6, we find: n = 7 Since we determined that E = 3n, we substitute n = 7 to find the number of edges: E = 3 * 7 = 21 Therefore, the prism has boxed{21} edges."},{"prompt":"At a certain filling station, there is a threetier special promotion on gas purchases: a 6 percent discount on the first 5 gallons, a 12 percent discount on the next 10 gallons, and a 20 percent discount on any gallons purchased after the first 15 gallons.

Consider the pentagon (ABCDE) where diagonals (AC), (AD), (BE), and (CE) are equal to one of the pentagon’s sides, such as (AE), and diagonal (BD) is equal to the sides (AB) and (DE). 2. We start by constructing triangle (ACE). Given that (AC), (CE), and (AE) are all equal, triangle (ACE) is an equilateral triangle. 3. Next, consider quadrilateral (ABDE). We know that (AD = AE) and (BE = AE), so (A) and (E) are the equal-length diagonals of quadrilateral (ABDE). Suppose (AB = DE), then (ABDE) forms an isosceles trapezoid. 4. In the isosceles trapezoid (ABDE), we need to calculate the angles. Given that ( angle A = angle E = 72^circ) (as the internal angles of a pentagon), we use the property of isosceles trapezoids where bases are parallel and angles at each base have to be equal. 5. Now, consider triangle (ADE). Since (AD = AE), triangle (ADE) is isosceles. The angles ( angle ADE = angle AED = 72^circ). 6. To verify if the angle measures are consistent: the internal angles of a pentagon sum up to (540^circ). Since (ADE) spans ( angle DAE = 180^circ - 72^circ - 72^circ = 36^circ). 7. Consider the remaining pair, triangle (BAD). The calculation of the angles yields ( angle BDA = 36^circ) and ( angle BAD = 72^circ - 36^circ = 36^circ ). We note that (AB = BD = DE). 8.

Let's define the sequence {a_n} with initial conditions and recurrence relation: - a_1 = 0 - a_2 = 2 - a_3 = 3 - a_{n+3} = a_{n+1} + a_{n} 2. We need to prove that for any prime number p, p mid a_p. 3. Let’s consider the characteristic polynomial associated with the recurrence relation: x^3 - x - 1 = 0 with roots denoted as x_1, x_2, x_3. 4. We can express the sequence {a_n} in terms of these roots: a_n = x_1^n + x_2^n + x_3^n 5.

Notice that the multinomial coefficient frac{p!}{i! j! k!} contains p as a factor since p is prime: frac{p!}{i! j! k!} = p cdot frac{(p-1)!}{i! j! k!} 9. Hence, we have: a_p = -p cdot sum_{substack{i, j, k i+j+k=p}} frac{(p-1)!}{i! j! k!} x_1^i x_2^j x_3^k 10. The expression sum_{substack{i, j, k i+j+k=p}} frac{(p-1)!}{i! j! k!} x_1^i x_2^j x_3^k is an integer polynomial in x_1, x_2, x_3, which are algebraic integers.

Prove that some edge is traversed by the ant in the same direction both times.","completion":": 1. Assume the contrary, that the ant never traverses the same edge twice in the same direction. 2. At each vertex, the ant has three choices for the next edge to traverse. Therefore, at each intersection, the ant can turn either only to the left or only to the right. 3. Consider the case where at every intersection, the ant chooses to turn only to the left. 4. The dodecahedron has 12 faces, and if the ant turns only to the left continuously, it will continue to create cycles on these faces. 5. Since the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of cycles does not change, the number of cycles created in this manner would be 12. 6. To reach any specific configuration where each face of the dodecahedron is part of a disjoint cycle, the number of cycles must be consistent with the structure of a dodecahedron. 7. Now, recall that each traversal direction of the ant on the edge between any two vertices must be considered. 8. If the ant returns to a vertex after completing a route, the nature of the placement in the cycles will force some edges to be traveled twice in the same direction because of the inherent symmetry and structure of the dodecahedron. 9. Consequently, for the ant to maintain continuous movement and traverse all edges comprehensively, contrary to the initial assumption, there must exist an edge that is traversed twice in the same direction. 10. This leads to a contradiction, as our assumption that no edge is traversed twice becomes invalid. 11.

We observe that the function y=(x+1)^3 - frac{1}{x+1} is symmetric with respect to the point (-1,1) because this expression maintains its form when x is replaced with (-2 - x) due to the cube and the reciprocal term.

The pieces formed do not meet the requirement of the problem. 4. **Correct Line of Cut**: - **Dashed Line**: The correct cut line must follow a different path. This path is represented by the dashed line labeled as (D). However, this line lacks a physical seam on the quilt, which complicates things further. - **True Shape and Form**: The pieces obtained by cutting along the dashed line should result in two segments that are indeed identical in form and size. 5. **Conclusion**: - **Shaded Region**: To properly solve the problem, one should consider removing the shaded region indicated in the second reference image. - **Visual Aid**: The individual patch located in the top left corner is provided for orientation purposes on the original quilt image. Cutting along the shaded region line will yield two identical pieces.

Find the largest interesting number.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: Let an ( n )-digit number be called interesting if all its digits, except for the first and last, are less than the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring digits. 2. **Analyzing the Condition**: Suppose ( a_n ) denotes the ( n )-th digit of an interesting number. By the given condition, we require: [ a_n < frac{a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}}{2} ] This can be rewritten as: [ 2a_n < a_{n-1} + a_{n+1} implies a_n - a_{n+1} < a_{n-1} - a_n ] Hence, the differences ( b_n = a_n - a_{n+1} ) must decrease for such a sequence to hold. 3. **Maximal Length of Reducing Differences**: Since the sum of the first four positive integers ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 ) exceeds the largest single-digit number (9), there cannot be four consecutive positive differences. Similarly, there cannot be four consecutive negative differences. Thus, the maximum number of reducing differences we can have is 7. 4. **Determining the Length of the Interesting Number**: If the number of reducing differences is at most 7, the interesting number must be 8 digits long. 5. **Constructing the Largest Interesting Number**: To maximize the number, start with the highest possible first digit, which is 9. To keep it an interesting number, we choose the differences between consecutive digits to be as small as possible while satisfying the condition.

Therefore, the sequence of radii can be written as: [ r_1 = 1, quad r_2 = k, quad r_3 = k^2, quad r_4 = k^3 ] Given ( r_4 = 8 ), we solve for ( k ): [ k^3 = 8 quad Rightarrow quad k = sqrt[3]{8} = 2 ] 4. Now, calculate the radii of the second and third circles: [ r_2 = k = 2 ] [ r_3 = k^2 = 2^2 = 4 ] 5. The lengths of the second and third circles are given by ( 2pi r_2 ) and ( 2pi r_3 ) respectively. Therefore, the sum of the lengths is: [ 2pi r_2 + 2pi r_3 = 2pi(2) + 2pi(4) = 2pi cdot 2 + 2pi cdot 4 = 4pi + 8pi = 12pi ] 6.

Let ( n ) be a positive integer such that ( n leq 10000 ). 2. Define ( k = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor ). This means ( k ) is the greatest integer not exceeding ( sqrt{n} ), so ( k leq sqrt{n} < k+1 ). 3. Therefore, ( k^2 leq n < (k+1)^2 ). 4. We need ( k ) to be a divisor of ( n ). This means ( n = mk ) for some integer ( m ). 5. Since ( k^2 leq n < (k+1)^2 ), substituting ( n = mk ) gives ( k^2 leq mk < (k+1)^2 ). 6. Dividing the entire inequality by ( k ), we get ( k leq m < k + frac{2k+1}{k} ). 7. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get ( k leq m < k + 2 + frac{1}{k} ). 8. Since ( m ) must be an integer, the possible values for ( m ) are ( k, k+1, k+2 ) (as ( frac{1}{k} ) is less than 1 for all ( k geq 1 )). 9. Therefore, for each ( k ), there are three values of ( n ) that satisfy the condition: ( n = k^2, n = k^2 + k, n = k^2 + 2k ). 10. We need to count the number of such ( n ) for ( n leq 10000 ). 11.

The profit is divided among the partners in the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time for which the money was invested.

Mukesh invested Rs. 15,000 for the remaining 8 months (since the total time is 12 months and Rakesh left after 4 months). The ratio of their profits will be in proportion to the product of their investments and the time for which they were invested. So, the profit ratio for Rajan, Rakesh, and Mukesh will be: ( R times 12 : 25,000 times 4 : 15,000 times 8 ) Rajan's share of the profit is Rs. 2,400 out of the total profit of Rs. 4,600.

Since he has 5 ropes (excluding the last one), he will need to make 4 knots to tie them all together (since the first rope doesn't need a knot at its beginning, and the last rope doesn't need a knot at its end). Each knot loses 1.2 feet, so 4 knots will lose 4 * 1.2 = 4.8 feet in total. The final length of the rope after tying is 35 feet, and this includes the length lost due to knots. So, the original combined length of all ropes before tying was 35 + 4.8 = 39.8 feet. We already know that the combined length of the ropes, excluding the last one, is 34 feet. Therefore, the length of the last rope is the difference between the original combined length and the length of the ropes we know: 39.8 feet (total original length) - 34 feet (known ropes) = 5.8 feet.

This result shows a flaw in the initial setup since 7102 is not a product of three distinct primes. Therefore, let's choose another number. Reverting to modifying 2005, let's choose 2087 and reverse it to 7802. Factorize 7802: 7802 = 2 times 3 times 1301. Checking the primality of 1301 shows it's prime.

This implies that f(x) is symmetric about x = frac{3}{2}. - By substituting x = frac{5}{4} into the equation, we get f(frac{3}{2}-2times frac{5}{4}) = f(frac{3}{2}+2times frac{5}{4}), which simplifies to f(-1) = f(4). Therefore, option C is correct. **For g(2+x) being an even function:** - Since g(2+x) is even, we have g(2+x) = g(2-x). This implies that g(x) is symmetric about x = 2. - Given that f(x) is symmetric about x = frac{3}{2}, the derivative of f(x) at x = frac{3}{2}, which is g(frac{3}{2}) = f'(frac{3}{2}), must be 0 because x = frac{3}{2} is a critical point of f(x). - Since g(x) is symmetric about x = 2, we have g(frac{3}{2}) = g(frac{5}{2}) = 0. This implies that x = frac{5}{2} is also a critical point of f(x). - By symmetry about x = frac{3}{2}, the point (frac{5}{2}, t) corresponds to a critical point at x = frac{1}{2}, hence g(frac{1}{2}) = 0. Similarly, g(frac{1}{2}) = g(frac{7}{2}) = 0, indicating x = frac{7}{2} is another critical point of f(x). - The symmetry about x = frac{3}{2} also implies that the critical point at x = frac{7}{2} corresponds to a critical point at x = -frac{1}{2}, thus g(-frac{1}{2}) = 0. Therefore, option B is correct. **Regarding options A and D:** - Option D is incorrect because g(x) being symmetric about x = 2 does not necessarily imply g(-1) = g(2). - Option A is incorrect because the position of f(x)'s graph can be shifted up or down, making f(0) = 0 not a guaranteed outcome. **Construction of functions as a verification:** - Let f(x) = 1 - sin pi x, then f(frac{3}{2}-2x) = 1 + cos 2pi x and g(x) = f'(x) = -pi cos pi x.

The formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = length times width, which in this case translates to 12 = y times x. Solving for y, we get y = frac{12}{x}. This relationship is an inverse proportion, meaning as x increases, y decreases, and vice versa, which is not a linear function. Therefore, option A is incorrect. **Option B**: The distance between locations A and B is 130 kilometers, and a car travels this distance at a constant speed. The relationship between the travel time y(hours) and the speed x(kilometers/hour) is given by the formula distance = speed times time, or 130 = x times y. Solving for y, we get y = frac{130}{x}.

Therefore, option B is incorrect. **Option C**: The unit price of a certain mask is 0.9 yuan, and we are examining the relationship between the total price y(yuan) and the quantity x(items). The formula for total price is Total Price = Unit Price times Quantity, which translates to y = 0.9x.

Therefore, option C is correct. **Option D**: Given a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 5cm, we are looking at the relationship between the two legs y(cm) and x(cm). According to the Pythagorean theorem, x^2 + y^2 = 5^2. Solving for y, we get y = sqrt{25 - x^2}.

Each change in orientation of a brick can either add 0 inches (using the 2'' side), 4 inches (switching from 2'' to 6''), or 7 inches (switching from 2'' to 9''). These changes mean that the possible increments to the tower height are 4 and 7 inches, which are both divisible by 1 (thus all integer multiples of 1 can be achieved given enough bricks). The equivalent problem is to determine the total range of values achievable using sums of 4's and 7's, starting from 100 inches. Since 4 and 7 are coprime, by the Chicken McNugget Theorem, the largest number that cannot be formed by non-negative integers 4m + 7n where m, n geq 0 is 4times 7 - 4 - 7 = 17. Therefore, for sufficiently large numbers, any height greater than 100+17 inches can be constructed. The upper bound on height if 7'' increments are used exclusively is 50 times 9 = 450 inches. Counting backward from 450 inches, we can form any height from 450 down to 104 inches without any exceptions (as these heights will involve either subtracting 4 or 7, or both, from 450), plus the base 100 inches.

According to the problem, this number ( x ) satisfies the following congruences: [ x equiv 2 pmod{3} ] [ x equiv 1 pmod{4} ] 3. We seek ( a ) such that ( x equiv a pmod{12} ). 4. To determine ( a ), we can analyze the possible values of ( x mod 12 ). These possible values of ( x mod 12 ) are within the range ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, 11 ). 5. We need to find the set ( a ) such that: - ( a mod 3 = 2 ) - ( a mod 4 = 1 ) 6. We now check all values of ( a ) from 0 to 11 to find which values satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 0 ): [ 0 mod 3 = 0, quad 0 mod 4 = 0 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 1 ): [ 1 mod 3 = 1, quad 1 mod 4 = 1 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 2 ): [ 2 mod 3 = 2, quad 2 mod 4 = 2 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 3 ): [ 3 mod 3 = 0, quad 3 mod 4 = 3 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 4 ): [ 4 mod 3 = 1, quad 4 mod 4 = 0 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 5 ): [ 5 mod 3 = 2, quad 5 mod 4 = 1 ] Satisfies both conditions. - When ( a = 6 ): [ 6 mod 3 = 0, quad 6 mod 4 = 2 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 7 ): [ 7 mod 3 = 1, quad 7 mod 4 = 3 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 8 ): [ 8 mod 3 = 2, quad 8 mod 4 = 0 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 9 ): [ 9 mod 3 = 0, quad 9 mod 4 = 1 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 10 ): [ 10 mod 3 = 1, quad 10 mod 4 = 2 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. - When ( a = 11 ): [ 11 mod 3 = 2, quad 11 mod 4 = 3 ] Does not satisfy both conditions. 7.
