Following a similar series of geometric constructions and trigonometric identities; particularly focusing on extending segments and considering triangle similarities, we use points E' and F' to show that: [ E'F' = AB. ] 9. **Final Conclusion**: Both the internal and external angle bisectors lead us to the conclusion that the length of the tangent from the constructed point E (or E' for the external bisector) to the respective circles is equal to AB.

As with the previous problem, since an internal tangent is involved (circles do not overlap), the internal tangent intersects (overline{AB}) at point (D). Using similar reasoning, the triangles (triangle APD) and (triangle BQD) share an angle and have corresponding angles from perpendicular radii to the tangent, hence are similar by AA.

To determine the minimum number of cuts necessary for Sasha to form at least 252 hendecagons (**11-sided polygons**), we'll analyze how the number of vertices in the parts increases with each cut. 2. Start with a single rectangular piece of paper. Suppose after ( k ) cuts, you obtain ( k + 1 ) separate pieces. Depending on the cut: - If a cut passes through two existing vertices, it increases the total number of vertices by **2**. - If a cut goes through one vertex and one point inside a side, it increases the total number of vertices by **3**. - If the cut passes through interior points (not vertices), it increases the number of vertices by **4**. 3. Simplifying our assumptions, let's use the upper bound for vertices increase, 4 per cut. Hence, after ( k ) cuts, the number of vertices at most is: [ 4k + 4 ] 4. Assume we form 252 hendecagons. In an ideal scenario where we reach our target, each piece considered a hendecagon will have at least 11 vertices, and the rest of the pieces (including those which after cutting are not yet hendecagons) will have at least **3 vertices** each. 5. Let’s see if we can fit the pieces into our equation. We need: [ 252 cdot 11 text{ vertices from hendecagons} + 3(k + 1 - 252) text{ vertices from the remaining pieces} ] 6.

Each rectangle will be a small piece. - To transform each of these 252 rectangles into a hendecagon, we need to make additional cuts. Each cut should increase the vertices count of one small rectangle. 8.

Vectors are laid on these rays from point ( O ) with lengths equal to the areas of the corresponding faces. Prove that the sum of these vectors is zero.","completion":"To prove that the sum of the given vectors equals zero, we can approach this problem by examining the projections of these vectors. Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Introduction of Projection:** Consider the sum of the projections of all given vectors on any line (l). We need to show that this total projection is zero. 2. **Projection on a Plane:** We will analyze the projection of the polyhedron onto a plane that is perpendicular to the line (l). This approach involves considering the projections of the faces of the polyhedron. 3. **Projection Properties:** When projecting the polyhedron onto this plane, the projections of its faces overlap in two layers. This means each face will be either \\"visible from above\\" or \\"visible from below.\\" The visibility depends on the orientation of the face relative to the projection plane. 4. **Sign Assignment:** Assign a positive sign to the projection of the faces visible from above and a negative sign to those visible from below. Because the polyhedron is convex, the sum of these signed projections will cover the projection of the entire polyhedron exactly once, resulting in a sum of zero: [ sum (text{signed projections of face areas}) = 0 ] 5. **Relation to Vectors:** The length of the projection of a face's projection on line (l) is directly related to the projection of the corresponding vector on (l). For faces of different types (i.e., faces visible from above versus those visible from below), the projections of these vectors will be oppositely directed. 6. **Sum of Projections:** Consequently, the sum of the projections of the vectors on any line (l) will also be zero: [ sum (text{projections of vectors on } l) = 0 ] 7. **Volume Consideration:** Denote (O) as the point inside the polyhedron and let (S_i) be the area of the (i)-th face, and (mathbf{n}_i) be the unit outward normal vector to the (i)-th face. Consider a point (X) inside the polyhedron. 8. **Decomposing the Polyhedron:** Decompose the polyhedron into pyramids with vertex (X) and bases formed by the faces of the polyhedron. The volume (V) of the polyhedron is the sum of the volumes of these pyramids: [ 3V = sum h_i S_i ] where (h_i) is the height from (X) to the plane of the (i)-th face. 9. **Heights and Projections:** The height (h_i) can be expressed using the dot product ((overrightarrow{XM_i}, mathbf{n}_i)), where (M_i) is any point in the (i)-th face: [ h_i = (overrightarrow{XM}_i, mathbf{n}_i) ] Hence, [ 3V = sum (overrightarrow{XM}_i, S_i mathbf{n}_i) ] 10. **Replacing (X) with (O):** Let (O) be any fixed point inside the polyhedron. Then, we refine our sum to: [ 3V = sum (overrightarrow{XO}, S_i mathbf{n}_i) + sum (overrightarrow{OM}_i, S_i mathbf{n}_i) ] But (sum overrightarrow{OM}_i = 0) for a fixed internal point (O). Therefore: [ sum (overrightarrow{XO}, S_i mathbf{n}_i) = 0 ] 11. **Conclusion:** This implies that the sum of vectors (S_i mathbf{n}_i) corresponding to the faces of the polyhedron is zero: [ sum S_i mathbf{n}_i = 0 ] Thus, the sum of the vectors in question is zero.

Consider the polynomial whose roots are the rational numbers (-3), (0), and (5): [ y = x(x + 3)(x - 5) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 15x ] This polynomial has the required distinct rational roots. Next, we find the critical points. We start by finding the derivative of (y): [ y' = (x^3 - 2x^2 - 15x)' = 3x^2 - 4x - 15 ] Set the derivative to zero to find the critical points: [ 3x^2 - 4x - 15 = 0 ] Solve for (x) using the quadratic formula: [ x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 + 180}}{6} = frac{4 pm 14}{6} ] Hence, we get: [ x = frac{18}{6} = 3 quad text{and} quad x = frac{-10}{6} = -frac{5}{3} ] These critical points are rational.

The derivative of (y) is given by: [ y' = left((x - alpha_1)(x - alpha_2)(x - alpha_3)right)' = 3x^2 - 2(alpha_1 + alpha_2 + alpha_3)x + (alpha_1alpha_2 + alpha_2alpha_3 + alpha_3alpha_1) ] For the critical points (x = beta_1) and (x = beta_2) to be rational, one should be zero. This is ensured if: [ alpha_1alpha_2 + alpha_2alpha_3 + alpha_3alpha_1 = 0 ] Then, the roots of (3x^2 - 2(alpha_1 + alpha_2 + alpha_3)x = 0) are given by: [ beta_1 = 0 quad text{and} quad beta_2 = frac{2}{3}(alpha_1 + alpha_2 + alpha_3) ] Let’s choose (alpha_1) and (alpha_2) such that (alpha_1alpha_2 neq 0) and (alpha_1 + alpha_2 neq 0). A good choice is (alpha_1) and (alpha_2) as rational numbers, then: [ alpha_3 = -frac{alpha_1 alpha_2}{alpha_1 + alpha_2} ] As (alpha_1), (alpha_2), and the sum (alpha_1 + alpha_2) are all rational, (alpha_3) is also rational and different from (alpha_1) and (alpha_2). Finally, we have shown that the critical points derived from these rational roots are also rational.

This line is parallel to the y-axis. - The inclination angle of this line is 90^{circ}. - A vertical line does not have a defined slope because the change in x (horizontal change) is zero, leading to division by zero in the slope formula. - Therefore, statement A is incorrect because a line with a 90^{circ} inclination angle does not have a defined slope. **Statement B: The greater the inclination angle of a straight line, the greater its slope.** - Consider two lines, one with an inclination angle of 45^{circ} and another with 135^{circ}. - The slope of a line with a 45^{circ} inclination angle is tan 45^{circ} = 1. - The slope of a line with a 135^{circ} inclination angle is tan 135^{circ} = -1. - This shows that an increase in the inclination angle does not always lead to an increase in the slope. - Therefore, statement B is incorrect. **Statement C: If the inclination angle of a straight line is alpha (alpha neq 90^{circ}), then the slope of the line is tan alpha.** - The slope of a line in the Cartesian coordinate system is defined as the tangent of its inclination angle, provided the angle is not 90^{circ}. - This is because the slope is the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change between any two points on the line, which corresponds to tan alpha. - Since this statement accurately describes the relationship between the inclination angle and the slope of a line, statement C is correct. **Statement D: The inclination angle of a line perpendicular to the coordinate axes is 0^{circ} or 90^{circ}.** - A line perpendicular to the x-axis has an inclination angle of 90^{circ} because it is vertical. - A line perpendicular to the y-axis has an inclination angle of 0^{circ} because it is horizontal. - Therefore, statement D correctly describes the inclination angles of lines perpendicular to the coordinate axes and is correct.

The formula for compound interest is: CI = P(1 + r)^t - P The formula for simple interest is: SI = P * r * t Given that CI is Rs. 11730 and SI is Rs. 10200 for a time period of t = 2 years, we can set up the following equations: 11730 = P(1 + r)^2 - P (1) 10200 = P * r * 2 (2) From equation (2), we can solve for r: r = 10200 / (P * 2) Now, let's substitute the value of r from equation (2) into equation (1): 11730 = P(1 + 10200 / (P * 2))^2 - P To simplify the equation, let's divide both sides by P: 11730 / P = (1 + 10200 / (2P))^2 - 1 Now, let's expand the right side of the equation: 11730 / P = (1 + 5100 / P)^2 - 1 Let's denote 5100 / P as x for simplicity: 11730 / P = (1 + x)^2 - 1 Now, let's expand the square: 11730 / P = 1 + 2x + x^2 - 1 Simplify: 11730 / P = 2x + x^2 Now, recall that x = 5100 / P, so we can substitute back: 11730 / P = 2(5100 / P) + (5100 / P)^2 Multiply through by P to clear the denominators: 11730 = 2 * 5100 + (5100^2 / P) Simplify: 11730 = 10200 + 26010000 / P Subtract 10200 from both sides: 11730 - 10200 = 26010000 / P 1530 = 26010000 / P Now, solve for P: P = 26010000 / 1530 P ≈ 16993.46 Therefore, the principal sum is approximately Rs. boxed{16993.46} ."},{"prompt":"A certain sports equipment store is preparing to purchase two types of table tennis balls, brand A and brand B.

We are given two conditions: 1. Buying 10 balls of brand A and 5 balls of brand B costs 100. 2. Buying 5 balls of brand A and 3 balls of brand B costs 55. This translates into the system of equations: [ begin{align*} 10x + 5y &= 100 5x + 3y &= 55 end{align*} ] To solve this system, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y equal: [ begin{align*} 10x + 5y &= 100 10x + 6y &= 110 end{align*} ] Subtracting the first equation from the second gives: [ y = 10 ] Substituting y = 10 into the first equation: [ 10x + 5(10) = 100 implies 10x = 50 implies x = 5 ] Therefore, the cost of each ball of brand A is boxed{5} and each ball of brand B is boxed{10}.

The cost for brand B balls is 10m, and the remaining budget for brand A balls is 1000 - 10m. Since each ball of brand A costs 5, the number of brand A balls purchased is frac{1000 - 10m}{5} = 200 - 2m. The conditions given are: 1. The quantity of brand A balls must be at least 6 times the quantity of brand B balls: 200 - 2m geq 6m. 2. The quantity of brand B balls must be at least 23: m geq 23. Solving the first inequality: [ 200 - 2m geq 6m implies 200 geq 8m implies 25 geq m ] Combining this with m geq 23, we have: [ 23 leq m leq 25 ] Since m must be an integer, m can be 23, 24, or 25. This results in boxed{3} different purchasing plans.

Given x and y, distinct natural numbers between 1 and n-1, we say that x and y are friends if there exist natural numbers a and b such that ax = by notequiv 0 pmod{n}. 2. **Equivalence Condition**: To prove that x and y are friends if and only if n nmid operatorname{lcm}(x, y), we proceed as follows: - Suppose n nmid operatorname{lcm}(x, y). Define a = operatorname{lcm}(x, y) / x and b = operatorname{lcm}(x, y) / y. By construction, it follows that ax = operatorname{lcm}(x, y) = by notequiv 0 pmod{n}. Therefore, x and y are friends. - Conversely, suppose that n mid operatorname{lcm}(x, y). If a and b are such that ax = by, then the common value is a multiple of both x and y, and thus of operatorname{lcm}(x, y). Given n mid operatorname{lcm}(x, y), it follows that ax = by equiv 0 pmod{n}. Hence, x and y are not friends when n mid operatorname{lcm}(x, y). 3. **Odd and Even Friends**: Consider the case where every integer between 1 and n-1 has an even number of friends. - From the equivalence above, the number 1 is a friend with all numbers y (with 2 leq y leq n-1) by taking b = 1 and a = y since operatorname{lcm}(1, y) = y. Hence, 1 is friends with n-2 numbers, which is even only if n-2 is even. This implies that n itself must be even. 4. **Non-powers of 2**: Suppose n is a multiple of an odd prime: n = 2^s q with q an odd prime and s geq 1. - Consider 2^s. The condition n mid operatorname{lcm}(2^s, y) is equivalent to q mid y. Hence, the friends of 2^s are the numbers between 1 and n-1, except for 2^s itself and the 2^s - 1 multiples of q between 1 and n-1. - Therefore, 2^s has an odd number of friends (since the total count is odd minus one). 5. **Conclusion for Powers of 2**: For powers of 2, let n = 2^s with s geq 1. Any x, y between 1 and n-1 can be written as x = 2^{s_1} q_1 and y = 2^{s_2} q_2 where s_1, s_2 < s. For any x, the number of friends will not be odd since there are no factors of any odd primes interfering between 1 and 2^s - 1.

Also, since 8 and 5 are coprime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1), 8 must divide 120 - 5m itself. To proceed, factor out 5 from the right-hand side: [ 8n = 5(24 - m) ] 3. Given that 8 divides 5(24 - m) and 8 is coprime to 5, it follows that 8 must divide 24 - m. Therefore, 24 - m must be a multiple of 8. This implies: [ 24 - m = 8k quad text{for some integer } k ] 4.

If c shares no common factors with either a or b, expand the equation: [ c(a + b) = ab ] Then c is a factor of ab.

Each cell in this grid represents a unit square. 2. **Coloring the Grid:** - Color all cells in columns 3, 6, and 9 as well as all cells in rows 3, 6, and 9 white. - The remaining cells will be colored black. This forms a pattern where we can easily identify squares of size 2 times 2. 3. **Identifying 2 times 2 Squares:** - The black cells will form 2 times 2 squares. - Since our grid is 11 times 11, let's count the number of black 2 times 2 squares. We observe that: - Each 2 times 2 black square on this grid will intersect at most with one other black 2 times 2 square if it were to be cut out. - In total, there are 16 black 2 times 2 squares because each intersection produces four such squares. 4. **Removing 15 Squares:** - When 15 of these 2 times 2 squares are cut out, they cannot all intersect with the same spots entirely without affecting one of the 16 identified black 2 times 2 squares. - Therefore, at least one 2 times 2 black square will remain untouched. 5. **Conclusion:** - Since at least one 2 times 2 black square remains untouched after cutting out 15 such squares from the grid, it is possible to cut out one more 2 times 2 square.

Given the conditions AB < 0 and BC < 0, we can deduce the signs of the slope and the y-intercept: 1. Since AB < 0, it means that A and B have opposite signs. Therefore, the slope -dfrac{A}{B} is positive because dividing two numbers with opposite signs results in a negative number, and the negative sign in front of the fraction makes it positive. 2. Given BC < 0, we know that B and C have opposite signs. Thus, -dfrac{C}{B} > 0 because, similar to the slope, dividing two numbers with opposite signs results in a negative number, and the negative sign in front makes it positive. With a positive slope and a positive y-intercept, the line will increase as x increases and will start above the origin. This configuration means: - The line will pass through the first quadrant because it starts above the origin and has a positive slope. - It will also pass through the second quadrant because, as we move to negative x values, the positive slope will cause the line to rise from below the x-axis. - The line will enter the third quadrant as it crosses the y-axis above the origin and continues to the left due to the positive slope.

Let the sphere intersect the plane PTQ rather than merely being tangent. 2. **Introduce Points of Intersection**: Let T_1 be the point of intersection between the plane tangent to the sphere passing through PQ and the edge DC. 3. **Construct the Polyhedron**: Consider the polyhedron formed by K, L, M, P, Q, T, and T_1. This polyhedron is an octahedron denoted as KLM PQTT_1. 4. **Color Coding for Ease of Visualization**: - Color the faces KMP, MLT, LKQ, and PQT_1 in black. - Leave the other faces white. - The crucial observation here is that no two black faces share an edge, whereas there exists one pair of white faces, namely the pair sharing edge T_1T. 5. **Angles at Tangency Points**: - Denote the angles formed by the lines joining tangency points within the black faces. - The sum of angles in black triangles around the tangency points is 4 cdot 2pi = 8pi because each face of the polyhedron contributes an angle sum equivalent to a full circle around the tangency point. 6. **Balance of Angles**: - For each black triangle, there is an equivalent white triangle which contributes to the overall angle sum. - The sum of angles for white triangles similarly computes to 8pi. Any deviation (given by an additional angle epsilon) arising from the plane PTQ adds an extra angle component 2epsilon in total: [ sum_{text{white triangles}} = 8pi + 2epsilon ] When the plane intersects, it subtracts, yielding 8pi - 2epsilon since epsilon would be zero if it were tangential. 7. **Spherical Geometry**: By spherical geometry, if convex shapes intersect such that the overall sum remains consolidated and not exceeded, this implies it must tangential to preserve balance. 8. **Conclusion**: Thus, since angles sum suggests balance, this implies without contradiction that T_1 must coincide with T.

In this scenario, P lies on one of the two lines passing through F and forming an angle left(90^circ - alpharight) with f (as shown in the second diagram). 5. **General Case**: Assume F does not lie on f, i.e., d > 0. 6. **Construction of Geometric Locus**: To construct some points of the locus: - Draw a half-line e from F perpendicular to f. - Draw a half-line h from F making an angle left(90^circ - alpharight) with e. - Let any circle k centered around F intersect h at H, and let E be the foot of the perpendicular from H to e. - Draw parallel lines to f at distances EH from f, meeting k at the required points. 7. **Verification and Analysis**: Based on the constructed points, conjecture that the locus is a hyperbola with focus F and the real axis along e. Prove this by determining the points and other focus of the hyperbola. 8. **Hyperbola Calculations**: Assume A and A_1 are points on the real axis, and F_1 is the other focus. - Given hyperbola center O, use OA = a and OF = c. From relationships: [ A F = c - a, quad A_1 F = c + a ] The distances from A and A_1 to f are: [ d + a - c, quad a + c - d ] Using lambda = cos alpha, solve: [ lambda (c - a) = d + a - c ] [ lambda (c + a) = a + c - d ] - Adding results: [ 2 lambda c = 2a ] Hence, substituting d, solve: [ c = frac{d}{sin^2 alpha}, quad a = frac{d cos alpha}{sin^2 alpha} ] 9. **Verification That Points Satisfy the Hyperbola Equation**: Verify that points on the locus also satisfy the distance criteria using algebraic transformations and cosine law relations to get: [ R^2 = r^2 + 4 epsilon r a + 4 a^2 = (r + 2 epsilon a)^2 ] where epsilon can be pm 1, resulting in points on the hyperbola. 10. **Hyperbola Properties**: Conclude that the geometric locus is a hyperbola. For b, the imaginary axis length: [ b = frac{d}{sin alpha} implies b = a tan alpha ] Asymptotes form alpha with the real axis. 11. **Alternative Coordinate-Based Verification**: By placing the coordinate origin at F, ensure x-axis is perpendicular to f and parallel to y-axis: [ t = |x|, quad r = sqrt{(x + d)^2 + y^2} ] Resulting equation: [ |x| = lambda sqrt{(x + d)^2 + y^2} ] Simplifies to: [ frac{left(1 - lambda^2right)^2 left(x - frac{lambda^2 d}{1 - lambda^2} right)^2}{lambda^2 d^2} - frac{y^2 (1 - lambda^2)^2}{d^2} = 1 ] Proving the hyperbola with parameters a, b, c. In conclusion, the geometric locus of the centers of circles passing through a given point F and intersecting a given line f at an acute angle alpha is a hyperbola described by the above calculations. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"a positive geometric sequence {a_{n}}, the sum of its first n terms is S_{n}, and the sequence satisfies a_{2}+2a_{3}=a_{1}, a_{1}a_{4}=a_{6}.

We need to show that ( f(mathbb{Z}) ) is closed under multiplication. 3. **Translation Invariance**: Note that if ( f(x) ) is a polynomial satisfying the requirements, then ( f(x+a) ) must also satisfy the requirements for any integer ( a ). Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality (WLOG) that if ( f ) has degree ( k ), then the coefficient of the ( x^{k-1} ) term for ( f ) is ( 0 ).

This implies that ( f(x) = x^k ) for infinitely many values of ( x ). 6. **Form of the Polynomial**: Given that ( f(x) = x^k ) for infinitely many values of ( x ), it follows that ( f(x) = x^k ) for all ( x ). Therefore, all nonconstant solutions are of the form ( f(x) = (x+a)^k ) for some integer ( a ) and positive integer ( k ). Conclusion: The only monic polynomials ( f(x) ) in ( mathbb{Z}[x] ) such that ( f(mathbb{Z}) ) is closed under multiplication are: - Constant polynomials: ( f(x) = 0 ), ( f(x) = -1 ), and ( f(x) = 1 ). - Nonconstant polynomials: ( f(x) = (x+a)^k ) for some integer ( a ) and positive integer ( k ). The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = 0 } ), ( f(x) = -1 ), ( f(x) = 1 ), or ( f(x) = (x+a)^k ) for some integer ( a ) and positive integer ( k )."},{"prompt":"a convex quadrilateral, find the point for which the sum of the distances to the vertices is minimal.","completion":"Let's consider a convex quadrilateral (ABCD) and a point (O) within or on the boundary of this quadrilateral. We are interested in finding the location of (O) such that the sum of the distances from (O) to the vertices (A), (B), (C), and (D) is minimized. 1. **Evaluate Pairwise Distances**: - According to the triangle inequality, for any point (O), the sum of the distances (OA + OC) must be at least (AC). Similarly, (OB + OD) must be at least (BD). - The triangle inequality states that for any three points (Q), (R), and (S), the inequality (QR + RS ge QS) holds, with equality if and only if (Q), (R), and (S) are collinear. 2. **Apply to Each Pair of Opposite Vertices**: - Consider the sum (OA + OC).

By the triangle inequality: [ OB + OD ge BD ] Equality is achieved if and only if (O) lies on the line segment (BD). 3. **Intersection of Diagonals**: - To minimize the total distance (OA + OB + OC + OD), we need (O) to lie on both (AC) and (BD) simultaneously. The only point that satisfies this condition is the point of intersection of the diagonals (AC) and (BD). 4. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the point (O) that minimizes the sum of the distances to the vertices (A), (B), (C), and (D) is the point where the diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect.

Hence, (2R geq AC). 2. **Sphere coverage insight**: The sphere constructed with (AC) as its diameter will cover triangle (ABC) because (angle ABC > 90^circ). By symmetry, it also covers an identical triangle (BAD) (since the tetrahedron is defined by equal and opposite pairs). Hence, it covers the whole tetrahedron. 3. **Determine radius relation**: Thus, the minimal (R) is such that (R = frac{AC}{2}). Therefore, [ R^2 = left(frac{AC}{2}right)^2 = frac{AC^2}{4}. ] 4. **Use the cosine rule in triangle (ABC)**: Using the given (angle ABC = 120^circ), we apply the law of cosines to find (AC): [ AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 cdot AB cdot BC cdot cos 120^circ. ] 5. **Substitute known values**: [ AB = 6, BC = 10, cos 120^circ = -frac{1}{2}. ] Thus, [ AC^2 = 6^2 + 10^2 - 2 cdot 6 cdot 10 cdot left(-frac{1}{2}right). ] Simplifying the expression, we get: [ AC^2 = 36 + 100 + 60 = 196. ] 6. **Conclude the value of (R^2)**: [ R^2 = frac{AC^2}{4} = frac{196}{4} = 49. ] Thus, the value of (R^2) is (boxed{49})."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=|x3|+|xa|, if f(x) geqslant 4 for any x in mathbb{R}, then the range of values for a is _______.","completion":"By the given condition, we have |x-3|+|x-a| geqslant |(x-3)-(x-a)|=|a-3|.

Let's denote the midpoint of AC as M. 2. **Positioning the Circle**: - Since the circle is tangent to AB, AD, and CD, the center of the circle, say O, must be located at the corner formed by AD and CD. This is because the tangency points on AD and CD must be at the endpoints of these sides (at D), given that the circle also passes through M. - The radius r is the distance from O to AB, and since O is at D, r is also the distance from D to AB. 3. **Rectangle Dimensions**: - Let the length of AB (and CD) be w and the length of AD (and BC) be h. - Since the circle is tangent to AB at a point directly above D, and O is at D, the distance from D to AB is r.

We will enumerate the positions as ( 1, 2, ldots, 100 ). 2. **Operational Analysis:** In each operation, two chips that are separated by one chip are swapped, i.e., a chip at position ( i ) can be swapped with a chip at position ( i+2 ). 3. **Parity Consideration:** Let's analyze how this operation affects the positions of the chips. If we start with a chip on an even position, it can only be swapped to another even position. Similarly, a chip on an odd position can only be swapped to another odd position. - For example, a chip at position 2 (even) can only be moved to positions 4, 6, 8, etc. (also even). - A chip at position 1 (odd) can only be moved to positions 3, 5, 7, etc. (also odd). 4. **Result of Swaps:** Since a chip on an even position will always remain on an even position and a chip on an odd position will always remain on an odd position, it is impossible for the chips to move across positions with different parity. 5. **Ultimate Goal:** To reverse the order of chips, we would ideally want the chip currently in position 1 (odd) to be swapped to position 100 (even), the chip in position 2 (even) to position 99 (odd), and so forth. - This means that chips originally on odd positions need to end up on even positions and vice versa. 6. **Impossibility of the Goal:** However, according to our operational analysis, a chip on an odd position cannot be swapped to an even position and vice versa. Therefore, it is not possible through the allowed operations to swap a chip from an odd-numbered position to an even-numbered position or from an even-numbered position to an odd-numbered position. - Specifically, the chip that starts in position 100 (even-numbered) can never reach position 1 (odd-numbered). # Conclusion: It is impossible to reverse the positions of all the chips using the allowed operations.

Then ( n - 3^a ) is even, less than ( 3^a ), and by the inductive hypothesis, it can be represented in the desired form: [ n - 3^a = sum_{i=1}^{j} 3^{m_i} 2^{n_i} ] - Adding ( 3^a ) to this representation, we get: [ n = 3^a + (n - 3^a) = 3^a + sum_{i=1}^{j} 3^{m_i} 2^{n_i} ] - Since ( 3^a ) is greater than any ( 3^{m_i} ) in the sum and ( n_i geq 0 ), the conditions ( m_1 > m_2 > dots > m_k geq 0 ) and ( 0 leq n_1 < n_2 < dots < n_k ) are satisfied. Thus, by strong induction, we have shown that every positive integer can be represented in the form ( 3^{m_1}cdot 2^{n_1} + 3^{m_2}cdot 2^{n_2} + dots + 3^{m_k}cdot 2^{n_k} ) with the given conditions.

Rearrange and manipulate this equation to gain insight: [ begin{aligned} R &< r(sqrt{2} + 1), R^2 &< rR(sqrt{2} + 1). end{aligned} ] 2. Transform the expression: [ R^2 - 2Rr < rR(sqrt{2} - 1) < r^2. ] 3. According to Euler’s theorem, the distance ( d ) between the circumcenter and the incenter of a triangle is given by: [ d^2 = R^2 - 2Rr. ] 4. From our earlier manipulation, we have: [ d^2 < r^2 implies d < r. ] 5. If the distance ( d ) between the two centers is less than the radius of the incircle ( r ), this means the circumcenter lies within the incircle. Therefore, the circumcenter also lies within the triangle itself, which implies that the triangle is acute-angled since the circumcenter of an acute-angled triangle is the only case where it lies inside the triangle. Thus, based on the condition ( R < r(sqrt{2} + 1) ), the triangle must be acute-angled. # Proof using a different approach: 1. We need to show that if the triangle satisfies the condition derived from the original condition: [ frac{r}{R} + 1 > sqrt{2}, ] then the triangle is acute. 2. Let ( alpha, beta, gamma ) be the angles of the triangle. Using known identities: [ frac{r}{R} + 1 = cos(alpha) + cos(beta) + cos(gamma). ] Therefore, if the triangle is not acute, we need to show these inequality relationships: [ cos(alpha) + cos(beta) + cos(gamma) leq sqrt{2}. ] 3. Assume ( gamma ) is the largest angle, hence ( gamma geq 90^{circ} ). Consequently, ( alpha + beta leq 90^{circ} ) and: [ cos(gamma) = -cos(alpha + beta). ] 4. We need to verify: [ cos(alpha) + cos(beta) - cos(alpha + beta) leq sqrt{2}. ] 5. Using the cosine addition formula: [ 2cosleft(frac{alpha + beta}{2}right)cosleft(frac{alpha - beta}{2}right) - cos(alpha + beta) leq sqrt{2}. ] 6. Simplify further using ( cos(frac{alpha - beta}{2}) leq 1 ): [ 2cosleft(frac{alpha + beta}{2}right) - 2cos^2left(frac{alpha + beta}{2}right) + 1 leq sqrt{2}. ] 7. Let ( delta = frac{alpha + beta}{2} ), then for ( 0^{circ} leq delta leq 45^{circ} ): [ 2 cos(delta) - 2 cos^2(delta) + 1 leq sqrt{2}. ] 8. This rearranges to: [ 0 leq left(cos(delta) - frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{2sqrt{2} - 3}{4}. ] 9. The condition holds for all ( cos(delta) ) in the given range ( left[ frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, 1 right] ). This proof confirms that the condition ( R < r(sqrt{2} + 1) ) implies the triangle is acute. Thus, the condition ( R < r(sqrt{2} + 1) ) indeed implies that the triangle is acute-angled.

At that time, Somu was one-fifth of his father's age, so we can write the equation: S - 5 = 1/5 * (F - 5) Now we can substitute S with 10: 10 - 5 = 1/5 * (F - 5) 5 = 1/5 * (F - 5) To solve for F, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5: 5 * 5 = F - 5 25 = F - 5 Now, we add 5 to both sides to find F: 25 + 5 = F F = 30 So, Somu's father's present age is 30 years.

We need to prove that the product of at least two of them must be a perfect square. Let's denote these 33 integers by: [ n_1, n_2, ldots, n_{33} ] Each integer (n_k) can be expressed in the form: [ n_k = 2^{a_k}3^{b_k}5^{c_k}7^{d_k}11^{e_k}, quad k = 1, 2, ldots, 33 ] where (a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k, e_k) are non-negative integers. For the product (n_i n_k) to be a perfect square, each exponent in the prime factorization of (n_i n_k) must be even. Specifically, [ a_i + a_k, quad b_i + b_k, quad c_i + c_k, quad d_i + d_k, quad e_i + e_k ] must all be even numbers. This condition is equivalent to requiring that (a_i) and (a_k) share the same parity (both are even or both are odd), and the same must hold for (b_i) and (b_k), (c_i) and (c_k), (d_i) and (d_k), and (e_i) and (e_k). Now consider the sequence: [ (a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k, e_k), quad k = 1, 2, ldots, 33 ] This forms a 5-tuple where each element is a non-negative integer. Since each of (a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k, e_k) can be either even (E) or odd (O), there are (2) possibilities for each (a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k,) and (e_k), leading to: [ 2^5 = 32 ] distinct combinations of parities for a 5-tuple ((a_k, b_k, c_k, d_k, e_k)). However, we have 33 integers and therefore 33 such 5-tuples. By the pigeonhole principle, which states that if (n) items are put into (m) containers, with (n > m), then at least one container must contain more than one item, we conclude that there must be at least two identical tuples. Assume these two tuples are ((a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i, e_i)) and ((a_j, b_j, c_j, d_j, e_j)) for some (i neq j).

We need to find the probability that a raindrop falling vertically onto a triangular pyramid roof (with all dihedral angles being right angles) lands on the green slope. 2.

Let's denote the area of the green slope's projection as (S_g). The area of its projection onto the base plane is given by (S_{ORB}), where ( gamma ) is the angle between the green slope and the horizontal plane. 5. The projection can be calculated as: [ S_{ORB} = S_g cos(gamma) ] Considering that the base is a triangle (RGB), let's represent the area of the triangle (RGB) as (S): [ S_{ORB} = S cos^2(gamma) ] 6. Similarly, let's denote the area projections of the red and blue slopes onto the base as (S_r) and (S_b), respectively. Their projections onto the base plane are ( alpha ) and ( beta ): [ S_{OBG} = S_r cos^2(alpha) ] [ S_{ORG} = S_b cos^2(beta) ] 7. Because the base triangle (RGB) is congruent through the areas of the projections: [ S = S_{OBG} + S_{ORG} + S_{ORB} ] Substituting the projections, we get: [ S = S cos^2(alpha) + S cos^2(beta) + S cos^2(gamma) ] Simplifying, we obtain: [ 1 = cos^2(alpha) + cos^2(beta) + cos^2(gamma) ] 8.

Let ( y ) represent the number of families that have exactly three cats. According to the problem, the total number of families is given by [ x + y + x = 29 ] which simplifies to: [ 2x + y = 29 ] 2. **Determine the Total Number of Cats**: Each family with one cat contributes 1 cat, each family with three cats contributes 3 cats, and each family with five cats contributes 5 cats.

Each suit has 3 face cards (Jack, Queen, King) and cards numbered from 2 to 10, as well as an Ace. Since Marcus removes all the face cards, that's 3 face cards per suit, times 4 suits, which equals 12 cards removed.

The total cost for the man is 46P (since he paid for 46 pens), and the total selling price for 54 pens is 54S.

Now, we can find the ratio of NY Mets fans to Boston Red Sox fans: M/R = 96/120 To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 24: M/R = (96/24) / (120/24) M/R = 4 / 5 Therefore, the ratio of NY Mets fans to Boston Red Sox fans is boxed{4:5} ."},{"prompt":"Given sets M={x|x^{2}2x3 lt 0}, N={xleft|right.lg left(x2right) lt 1}, then Mcup N=left( right) A: {xleft|right.2 lt x lt 12} B: {xleft|right.1 lt x lt 12} C: {xleft|right.12 lt x lt 1} D: varnothing","completion":"To solve the given problem, we need to find the sets M and N first and then determine their union M cup N. **Step 1: Find the set M.** Given M={x|x^{2}-2x-3 < 0}, we solve the inequality: x^{2}-2x-3 < 0 Factoring the quadratic equation, we get: (x-3)(x+1) < 0 From this, we can determine the intervals where the inequality holds true.

By definition, this means the dihedral angle formed by these planes is 90^circ. Through a point M on the line of intersection of planes alpha and beta, we can draw lines MA and MB in the planes alpha and beta respectively, which are perpendicular to the line c (the line of intersection of the planes). The angle AMB is the linear angle of the dihedral angle formed by planes alpha and beta. Given that angle AMB = 90^circ, it follows that the line AM in plane alpha is perpendicular to the intersection line c and to the line MB. Consequently, the plane alpha passes through the line MA, which is perpendicular to plane beta. 2. **Sufficiency:** Assume there is a line a in plane alpha that is perpendicular to plane beta, and that planes alpha and beta intersect along the line c. Through the intersection point M of lines a and c, we draw a line MB in plane beta perpendicular to line c. Choose a point A on line a other than M. Since line AM is perpendicular to plane beta, we have AM perp c and AM perp BM. Therefore, angle AMB=90^circ and AMB is the linear angle of the dihedral angle formed by planes alpha and beta.

Hence, there exist polynomials (f(x)) and (g(x)) with integer coefficients such that: [ x^{p^p - 1} - 1 = (x^p - x + 1)f(x) + pg(x). ] - Therefore, (p^p - 1) is interesting. # Part (b) 1. **Case (p = 2)**: - For (p = 2), we need to check if (3) is the minimal interesting number. - The polynomial (x^2 - x + 1) is irreducible over (mathbb{F}_2). - The field (mathbb{F}_2(alpha)) has (4) elements, and (alpha^3 = 1). - Therefore, (3) is interesting for (p = 2). 2. **Case (p) is odd**: - Let (alpha) be a root of (x^p - x + 1) in some extension field of (mathbb{F}_p). - We have (alpha^p = alpha - 1) and (alpha^{p^k} = alpha - k). - Notice that (alpha - k) is also a root of (x^p - x + 1). 3. **Using (m = 1 + p + p^2 + dots + p^{p-1} = frac{p^p - 1}{p - 1})**: - We have (alpha^m = prod (alpha - k)), where (k) ranges from (0) to (p-1). - This product is, up to sign, the constant term of (x^p - x + 1), which is (1). - Therefore, (alpha^m = (-1)^p cdot 1), and (alpha^{2m} = 1). 4. **Conclusion for minimal interesting number**: - If (p > 3), then (2m < p^p - 1). - Therefore, for odd (p), the minimal interesting number is (p^p - 1). The final answer is ( boxed{ p^p - 1 } ) for odd (p) and (3) for (p = 2)."},{"prompt":"Given vectors a=(2, frac{x}{2}, x) and b=(x, 1, 2), where x>0, find the value of x if a is parallel to b.","completion":"**Step 1: Understanding the Problem** This problem requires us to understand the condition for two vectors to be parallel (or collinear) in space.

Since ( P(z) equiv Q(z) cdot Q(-z) ), we evaluate ( P ) at (-z): [ P(-z) = Q(-z) cdot Q(z) equiv Q(z) cdot Q(-z) equiv P(z). ] This shows that ( P(-z) = P(z) ), indicating that ( P(z) ) is an even function. 2. Conversely, we start with the case where ( P(z) equiv 0 ). In this situation, we can choose ( Q(z) equiv 0 ). Then clearly, [ P(z) equiv Q(z) cdot Q(-z). ] 3. Now, consider a nonzero polynomial ( P(z) ) that is an even function. Suppose ( P(z) ) has non-zero roots. We need to show that there exists a polynomial ( Q(z) ) such that ( P(z) = Q(z) cdot Q(-z) ). 4. Firstly, consider the case ( m = 0 ), where ( m ) denotes the number of non-zero roots of the polynomial ( P(z) ). If ( P(z) = a z^{n} ) for some non-zero constant ( a ) and integer ( n ), and ( P(z) ) is even, ( n ) must be even. Let ( n = 2k ) for some integer ( k ). We can define a polynomial ( Q(z) ) by: [ Q(z) = b z^{k}, ] where ( b ) is chosen such that ( b^{2} = (-1)^{k} a ). Consequently, [ a z^{n} = b z^{k} cdot b(-z)^{k}, ] implying [ P(z) = Q(z) cdot Q(-z). ] 5. Next, argue by induction on ( m ). Assume the result holds for all polynomials with even functions and fewer than ( m ) non-zero roots. Consider a polynomial ( P(z) ) with ( m ) non-zero roots being an even function. If ( alpha ) is a non-zero root of ( P(z) ), then ( P ) satisfies: [ P(-alpha) = P(alpha) = 0. ] This implies ( P(z) = (z - alpha)(z + alpha) R(z) ) for some polynomial ( R(z) ). 6. Since ( P(z) ) is even: [ P(-z) = R(-z)((-z)^{2} - alpha^{2}) equiv P(z) equiv R(z)(z^{2} - alpha^{2}). ] By the induction hypothesis, there exists a polynomial ( S(z) ) such that ( R(z) = S(z) cdot S(-z) ). Define: [ Q(z) equiv mathrm{i}(z - alpha) S(z). ] 7. Then, [ P(z) equiv mathrm{i}(z - alpha) S(z) cdot mathrm{i}(-z - alpha) S(-z), ] equating to: [ P(z) = Q(z) cdot Q(-z). ] 8.

Since the denominator increases as x increases (and the numerator is constant), the function is monotonically decreasing on the interval [2,6]. This means that as x increases, f(x) decreases. 2. **Maximum Value**: To find the maximum value of a monotonically decreasing function on a closed interval, we evaluate the function at the lower bound of the interval.

This step is also ( O(m) ). 3. **Convergence:** - The process of moving vertices to increase the number of crossing edges will converge in a finite number of steps because each move strictly increases the number of crossing edges. - The total number of moves is bounded by the number of edges, so the algorithm will terminate in ( O(m) ) steps. 4. **Coloring:** - Once the parts are determined, coloring each part with a unique color takes ( O(n) ) time.

However, the question asks for the smallest value of n such that the function shifted n units to the left becomes an even function. Let g(x) = f(x + n), representing the left shift of f(x) by n units.

Thus, each x = h/2. - From the line segment properties, we find the median from B to AD: midpoint M on AD gives AM = 5; hence MD = 5. Triangle BDM is right-angled at M. - Using Pythagoras in triangle BDM: BM^2 = BD^2 - MD^2 = 8^2 - 5^2 = 39.

By definition, this makes the heptagon A_{1}A_{2}A_{3}A_{4}A_{5}A_{6}A_{7} a special heptagon. 2. To show we can alter the heptagon so that it no longer remains special, let's consider another diagonal, say A_{3}A_{7}.

For each vertex coloring of an n-gon, consider a specific inter-colored diagonal (AB) that divides the polygon into two smaller polygons.

To find the total number of students who failed, we need to consider both the boys and the girls. Let's denote the total number of students (boys + girls) as T. The total number of students who failed is 56.67% of T. So, we can write the equation for the total number of students who failed as: 0.5B (failed boys) + 60 (failed girls) = 0.5667T (total failed students) We also know that the total number of students T is the sum of the number of boys B and the number of girls (which is 100): T = B + 100 Now we can substitute T in the first equation with (B + 100): 0.5B + 60 = 0.5667(B + 100) Now let's solve for B: 0.5B + 60 = 0.5667B + 56.67 60 - 56.67 = 0.5667B - 0.5B 3.33 = 0.0667B B = 3.33 / 0.0667 B = 49.925 Since the number of boys must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 50.

When we add these two numbers together, we get: AB +BA ----- 202 Since AB and BA are two-digit numbers, A and B must be between 0 and 9, inclusive. However, since they are digits of two-digit numbers, A cannot be 0. When we add AB and BA, the sum of the units digits (B + A) must end in a 2, because the sum is 202. This means that B + A could be either 2, 12, or any other number ending in 2, but since A and B are single digits, the only possibilities are 2 or 12. However, since A and B are different digits, the sum cannot be 2 (as that would require A and B to both be 1, which is not allowed). Therefore, B + A must be 12. Now, let's look at the tens place. When we add A (from AB) and B (from BA), we also need to account for the carry-over from the units place if there is one. Since B + A is 12, there is a carry-over of 1 to the tens place. So the equation for the tens place is A + B + 1 = 10 (since the tens digit in the sum is 0 and there is a carry-over to the hundreds place).

Then the bag contains ____ white balls.","completion":"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of white balls in the bag as x. The total number of balls in the bag is then x + 15, where 15 is the number of yellow balls. According to the given information, the probability of drawing a yellow ball is 0.75. This probability can be represented as the ratio of the number of yellow balls to the total number of balls, which gives us the equation: [ frac{15}{x + 15} = 0.75 ] To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify the equation: [ 15 = 0.75(x + 15) ] Expanding the right side of the equation: [ 15 = 0.75x + 11.25 ] Subtracting 11.25 from both sides to isolate 0.75x: [ 15 - 11.25 = 0.75x ] Simplifying the left side: [ 3.75 = 0.75x ] Dividing both sides by 0.75 to solve for x: [ x = frac{3.75}{0.75} ] Simplifying the fraction: [ x = 5 ] Therefore, the bag contains boxed{5} white balls."},{"prompt":"a class of 35 students, some students did not borrow any books from the library, 12 students each borrowed 1 book, 10 students each borrowed 2 books, and the rest borrowed at least 3 books.

We have 35 students in total. According to the information given: - 2 students borrowed 0 books. - 12 students borrowed 1 book each. - 10 students borrowed 2 books each. - The rest (35 - 2 - 12 - 10 = 11) students borrowed at least 3 books each. The average number of books per student is 2, so the total number of books borrowed by the class is 35 students * 2 books/student = 70 books. Now, let's calculate how many books have been accounted for with the students who borrowed 0, 1, or 2 books: - 2 students borrowed 0 books, contributing 0 books to the total. - 12 students borrowed 1 book each, contributing 12 books to the total. - 10 students borrowed 2 books each, contributing 20 books to the total. So far, we have accounted for 0 + 12 + 20 = 32 books. The remaining books to reach the total of 70 are 70 - 32 = 38 books. These 38 books must have been borrowed by the 11 students who borrowed at least 3 books each. If we want to find the maximum number of books any single student could have borrowed, we should distribute the books among these 11 students in such a way that one student gets as many books as possible while the others get the minimum (3 books each). So, for the other 10 students to get the minimum, they would each get 3 books, which accounts for 10 * 3 = 30 books.

The vertex of a parabola given by y = ax^2 + bx + c is located at x = -frac{b}{2a}. In our case, a = 1 and b = a + 2. Thus, the x-coordinate of the vertex is: x = -frac{a + 2}{2 cdot 1} = -frac{a + 2}{2}. For the graph to be symmetric about x = 1, we must have: -frac{a + 2}{2} = 1. Solving for a, we get: a + 2 = -2, a = -4. Now that we have the value of a, we can find b by considering that the interval [a, b] must be centered around the line of symmetry, x = 1. Since a is the lower bound of the interval, b must be equally distant from the line x = 1 as a is, but on the opposite side. Since a = -4, the distance from a to x = 1 is: 1 - (-4) = 5.

So, Jean has a total of 30 spots * 2 = 60 spots. We know that one-third of her spots are located on her back and hindquarters. So, one-third of the total spots is 60 spots / 3 = 20 spots on her back and hindquarters. Now, we have the number of spots on her upper torso (30 spots) and the number of spots on her back and hindquarters (20 spots).

Out of these, the non-integers are -frac{1}{3} and -frac{1}{9}. Testing these in the simplified forms of the polynomials (if necessary, assuming certain coefficients cancel out the terms correctly for these values to be roots), we find: - For k = -frac{1}{3}, we need to check if it satisfies both equations.

Prove your answer.","completion":"1. **Understand the Problem:** We are given a graph T where each vertex v_n corresponds to an integer n, and there is an edge between v_a and v_b if |a - b| is a power of two. Our goal is to determine the chromatic number of T and provide a proof. 2. **Chromatic Number Definition:** The chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. 3. **Initial Observation:** Consider the vertices v_0, v_1, and v_2. These vertices form a triangle because: - |0 - 1| = 1, which is a power of two, so v_0 is connected to v_1. - |1 - 2| = 1, which is a power of two, so v_1 is connected to v_2. - |2 - 0| = 2, which is a power of two, so v_2 is connected to v_0. Hence, three colors are necessary to color these three vertices. 4. **Color Assignment Based on Modulo 3:** Let's propose a coloring scheme to verify if exactly three colors suffice for the entire graph. Color the vertices based on n mod 3: - Color v_n with textbf{red} if n equiv 0 pmod{3}. - Color v_n with textbf{blue} if n equiv 1 pmod{3}. - Color v_n with textbf{green} if n equiv 2 pmod{3}. 5. **Prove that No Two Adjacent Vertices Share the Same Color:** - Suppose v_a and v_b are adjacent, i.e., there is an edge between v_a and v_b. This means |a - b| is a power of two. - For v_a and v_b to share the same color, we must have a equiv b pmod{3}. - Therefore, a - b would be divisible by 3, i.e., a - b = 3k for some integer k. - However, |a - b| being a power of two would imply 3k is a power of two. - The only power of two divisible by 3 is 1 (since 2^0 = 1), which contradicts the requirement that 3k equals a power of two unless k = 0. Therefore, no such a and b exist where |a - b| is a power of two and (a - b) is also divisible by 3. 6. **Conclusion:** Given our proposed coloring scheme and the fact that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we have proven that the chromatic number of the graph T is 3.

Also, because a^{x-1} > 0 for any real number x, it follows that f'(x) > 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. This means that f(x) is increasing on mathbb{R}. Also, when x=1, f(1) = a^{1-1} + 3 = a^0 + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4.

Note that the sum of the first ( n ) integers is (frac{n(n+1)}{2}), so we need: [ frac{n(n+1)}{2} < 10^e ] - By solving for ( e ), we get: [ e geq leftlceil log_{10} left( frac{n(n+1)}{2} right) rightrceil ] 4. **Define the Set ( S )**: - Consider the set ( S = {10^e - 1, 2(10^e - 1), ldots, n(10^e - 1)} ). 5. **Example**: - For ( n = 6 ) and ( e = 3 ): [ S = {999, 1998, 2997, 3996, 4995, 5994} ] 6. **Verify ( k )-stability**: - For any nonempty subset ( X subseteq S ), the sum of elements of ( X ) can be written as a multiple of ( 10^e - 1 ). Since ( 10^e - 1 ) consists only of nines (e.g., 999), the sum of its digits is ( 9e ). Hence, every sum will have the digit sum ( 9e ). 7. **Thus**: [ f(n) leq 9 leftlceil log_{10} left( frac{n(n+1)}{2} right) rightrceil ] - This proves one direction of the inequality, i.e., there exists a constant ( C_2 ) such that: [ f(n) leq C_2 log_{10} n ] Lower Bound Proof 1. **Claim**: - We claim that in any set ( S ) of more than ( 12^k ) integers, there exists a subset whose sum of decimal digits exceeds ( k ). 2. **Inductive Process**: - Imagine writing entries of ( S ) on a blackboard, initially setting a running sum ( Sigma ) to zero. - For each step ( i = 1, 2, ldots ), ensure that at the end of the ( i )-th step, all entries on the board are divisible by ( 10^i ). 3. **Step-by-step Procedure**: - **Case 1**: If the ( i )-th digit from the right of ( Sigma ) is nonzero, partition the numbers on the board into groups of 10, find a nonempty subset with sum ( 0 mod 10^i ), erase each group and replace it with that sum. - **Case 2**: If the ( i )-th digit from the right of ( Sigma ) is zero but some entry on the board is not divisible by ( 10^i ), erase that entry and add it to ( Sigma ), then perform grouping as in Case 1. - **Case 3**: If the ( i )-th digit from the right of ( Sigma ) is zero and all entries on the board are divisible by ( 10^i ), do nothing and move to the next step. 4. **Argument**: - The first two cases occur at least ( k+1 ) times because the number of entries decreases by a factor of at most 12 each step. Each time ( Sigma ) gets some nonzero digit which remains unchanged in subsequent steps. Thus, ( Sigma ) will have a digit sum of at least ( k+1 ). 5. **Conclusion**: [ f(n) geq log_{12} n ] - Hence, there exists a constant ( C_1 ) such that: [ f(n) geq C_1 log_{10} n ] Conclusion: [ boxed{C_1 log_{10} n leq f(n) leq C_2 log_{10} n} ]"},{"prompt":"A solid rectangular block is formed by gluing together N congruent 1cm cubes face to face.

This means we have a fraction where the denominator is ( A p^e ) and ( p ) does not divide ( A ). 5. **Second Move:** Now, perform a second move ( x_n = 2x_{n-1} + frac{1}{n} ). This changes the fraction to: [ frac{2x}{A p^e} + frac{1}{n} = frac{2x n + A p^e}{A p^e n} ] We need to choose ( n ) such that the new denominator ( A p^e n ) does not introduce any new prime factors larger than ( p ). 6. **Iteration:** By iterating this process, we can ensure that the numerator modulo ( p ) changes by ( +A ) each time. Since ( p nmid A ), we can eventually make the numerator divisible by ( p ), thus eliminating a factor of ( p ) in the denominator. 7. **Reduction to Powers of 2:** By repeatedly applying the above steps, we can reduce the denominator to a power of 2. Once the denominator is a power of 2, we can use first moves ( x_n = 2x_{n-1} ) to eventually reach an integer. 8. **Conclusion:** By the above process, we can construct a sequence ( {x_n} ) such that ( x_n ) is an integer for some ( n ).

In this case, the grid is a single cell, and the problem is trivial since the center is the only cell and thus an endpoint. - We will use induction on ( n ), where ( n ) is an odd integer. Assume the statement is true for a ( (n-2) times (n-2) ) grid. 2. **Outer Rim Definition:** - Define the *outer rim* of the grid to be the outermost ( 4n - 4 ) squares.

This is the desired contradiction. 6. **Endpoint Analysis:** - By the first claim, the blue part of the outer rim is one contiguous piece, as is the red part. Place a ( times ) at the endpoints of these contiguous outer rim pieces. Note that a ( times ) in a corner implies that it is an endpoint of the snake since one of the two squares it is adjacent to must be a ( times ) from the opposite color snake. Furthermore, we cannot have two ( times ) from the same color, since that would violate the first claim. 7. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1:** We have two ( times ) in corners. In this case, we have two opposite color endpoints in the outer rim, so actually deleting the outer rim gives a valid snake configuration in the resulting ( (n-2) times (n-2) ), so we finish by induction on ( n ). - **Case 2:** We have at most one ( times ) in a corner. This means that there are two adjacent ( times ) (from opposite colors) that are not in corners. Assume for sake of contradiction that the center is not an endpoint. Then, we have the following claim. 8. **Final Claim:** - **Claim:** Let ( ell_1 ) and ( ell_2 ) be segments connecting opposite corners. Then, all endpoints lie on either ( ell_1 ) or ( ell_2 ). - **Proof:** There are two cases: - **Case 1:** Suppose that one of the corners has a ( times ). WLOG say that ( ell_1 ) contains a ( times ). Then, by the second and third claims respectively, ( ell_1 ) contains at least one more endpoint, and ( ell_2 ) contains two endpoints. These can't be shared since the center is not an endpoint, so we have shown that there are 4 endpoints in ( ell_1 cup ell_2 ), so these are all the endpoints. - **Case 2:** Suppose that none of the corners have a ( times ). Then, by the third claim, ( ell_i ) has at least two endpoints, so as before, we are done. 9. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** - The two adjacent ( times )s that are not in corners can't be endpoints by the above claim. Therefore, the snake must continue from them into the heart of the grid. Both turns from the adjacent ( times )s have characteristic rays that must contain an endpoint. However, by the above claim, those endpoints must be the intersection of the characteristic rays with the central ( ell_1 ) and ( ell_2 ). It is easy to see by parity that one of those intersections is not valid. This is the desired contradiction, so the proof is complete.

How long is the train?","completion":"First, let's convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the bridge length and the time taken to cross it. Speed in m/s = Speed in kmph × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 36 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 36 × (1 / 3.6) Speed in m/s = 10 m/s Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can calculate the distance the train travels in the time it takes to cross the bridge. The distance the train travels is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge. Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 10 m/s × 26.997840172786177 seconds Distance ≈ 269.97840172786177 meters This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. To find the length of the train, we subtract the length of the bridge from this distance. Length of the train = Distance - Length of the bridge Length of the train ≈ 269.97840172786177 meters - 170 meters Length of the train ≈ 99.97840172786177 meters Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{99.978} meters."},{"prompt":"a hostel, there were 100 students.

After accommodating 25 more students, the average expenditure decreased by Rs. 10, so the new average expenditure per student is (A - 10) rupees. With 125 students, the new total expenditure is 125(A - 10). According to the problem, the total expenditure increased by Rs. 500. So we can set up the following equation: New Total Expenditure - Original Total Expenditure = Increase in Expenditure 125(A - 10) - 100A = 500 Expanding and simplifying the equation: 125A - 1250 - 100A = 500 25A - 1250 = 500 25A = 500 + 1250 25A = 1750 A = 1750 / 25 A = 70 So the original average expenditure per student was Rs. 70. Now we can find the new total expenditure: New Total Expenditure = 125(A - 10) New Total Expenditure = 125(70 - 10) New Total Expenditure = 125 * 60 New Total Expenditure = 7500 Therefore, the total expenditure of the hostel now is Rs. boxed{7500} ."},{"prompt":"Draw a figure along the mosaic lines that consists of exactly 3 wide diamonds and 8 narrow diamonds.

First, let's find the work rate of each person: A's work rate is 1 job per 15 days, which can be expressed as: Work rate of A = 1/15 (jobs per day) B's work rate is 1 job per 20 days, which can be expressed as: Work rate of B = 1/20 (jobs per day) When A and B work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: Combined work rate of A and B = Work rate of A + Work rate of B Combined work rate of A and B = 1/15 + 1/20 To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 20 is 60.

The product binom{6}{r} cdot 2^r will start to decrease after a certain point as r increases, because the rate of growth of 2^r will not be able to compensate for the decreasing rate of binom{6}{r}.

First, factor the polynomial in a helpful form: [ Q(x) = x(x^2 - 1) + (p+1)x + q ] Since ( x^2 - 1 ) can be factored as ( (x-1)(x+1) ), the polynomial becomes: [ Q(x) = x(x-1)(x+1) + (p+1)x + q ] 3. Notice that the term ( x(x-1)(x+1) ) represents the product of three consecutive integers. For any integer ( x ), one of these factors will be divisible by 3. Thus: [ x(x-1)(x+1) equiv 0 pmod{3} ] 4. Now, consider the remaining terms ( (p+1)x ) and ( q ). For the entire polynomial ( Q(x) ) to be divisible by 3 for any integer ( x ), the sum of ( (p+1)x ) and ( q ) must also be divisible by 3. This leads to two conditions: - ( (p+1)x equiv 0 pmod{3} ) for any ( x ), implying ( (p+1) ) must be divisible by 3. - ( q equiv 0 pmod{3} ). 5.

Find the value of ( n ).","completion":"We start by determining the total number of each type of smaller cube in terms of the original parameter ( n ). 1. **Determine the number of smaller cubes with one red face:** A smaller cube will have exactly one red face if it lies on a face but not along any of the edges of that face (i.e., not at the corners). Hence, for each large face of the cube, there are ((n-2)^2) such smaller cubes (since we exclude the border cubes on each edge). There are 6 faces on the cube, so the total number of smaller cubes each having one red face is: [ 6(n-2)^2 ] 2. **Determine the number of smaller cubes with two red faces:** A smaller cube will have exactly two red faces if it lies along an edge but not at the corners of the original cube. There are ((n-2)) such cubes along each edge, and there are 12 edges in total. Thus, the total number of smaller cubes each having two red faces is: [ 12(n-2) ] 3. **Relate the quantities:** According to the problem, the number of cubes with one red face is 12 times the number of cubes with two red faces: [ 6(n-2)^2 = 12 cdot 12(n-2) ] 4. **Solve the equation:** Simplify and solve for (n): [ 6(n-2)^2 = 144(n-2) ] [ (n-2)^2 = 24(n-2) ] If (n-2 = 0), then (n = 2), which is not a feasible solution since it doesn't fit our context of splitting a 3-dimensional object.

Barbara's Shop: - Haircut: 30 - Facial cleaning: 28 - Nails: 40 Total cost at Barbara's Shop = 30 + 28 + 40 = 98 3. The Fancy Salon: - Haircut: 34 - Facial cleaning: 30 - Nails: 20 Total cost at The Fancy Salon = 34 + 30 + 20 = 84 Since Haily would spend 84 at the cheapest salon, and the total cost at The Fancy Salon is 84, we can conclude that The Fancy Salon is the cheapest option.

For which values of ( n ) is it possible, after several moves, to obtain a checkerboard pattern where the black and white colors have swapped places?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a given n times n square, initially colored in a chessboard pattern where at least one of the corner cells is black. 2. **Coloring Rule**: For any 2 times 2 sub-square, in one move we can change the color of each of the four cells according to the following rules: - Change a white cell to black. - Change a black cell to green. - Change a green cell to white. 3. **Objective**: Our goal is to establish the values of n for which it is possible to obtain a chessboard coloring where the positions of black and white cells are swapped after several moves. 4. **Color Type Definitions**: Let's call the cells that were initially white as type one cells, and those that were initially black as type two cells. 5. **Cycle Property Analysis**: - If a cell is colored three times, the color does not change its initial state. This is due to the cyclic nature of the coloring rules. Hence, for a type one cell to become black, it must be colored 3k + 1 times for some integer k. - Similarly, for a type two cell to become white, it must be colored 3m + 2 times for some integer m. 6. **Total Coloring Counts**: - Let a be the number of type one cells. The total number of colorings for these cells is 3K + a, where K is some integer. - Let b be the number of type two cells. The total number of colorings for these cells is 3M + 2b, where M is some integer. 7. **Equalizing Moves in 2 times 2 Squares**: - In any 2 times 2 square, the number of type one and type two cells are equal. Hence, the total number of moves for both types of cells must be equal for the solution to be valid. - Therefore, 3K + a = 3M + 2b. 8. **Integer Condition**: - Solving 3K + a = 3M + 2b gives a + b = 3(M - K + b). This implies that a + b must be divisible by 3. - Since a + b = n^2 (the total number of cells), n^2 equiv 0 pmod{3}. Hence, n must be a multiple of 3. 9. **Verification with 3 times 3 Sub-Squares**: - To demonstrate how to achieve the objective for n being a multiple of 3, let's divide the n times n square into smaller 3 times 3 squares. - Consider one 3 times 3 square. There are two primary cases: either the corner cells are initially white, or they are black. - In the first case, color each of the four adjacent squares once. - In the second case, color each of the four adjacent squares twice. - It can be checked that using these steps, the chessboard pattern of the 3 times 3 squares will swap the black and white cells as desired. # Conclusion: Thus, the value of ( n ) for which it is possible to swap the colors of the chessboard pattern as provided in the problem statement is when ( n ) is a multiple of 3. boxed{text{All } n text{ such that } n text{ is a multiple of 3}}"},{"prompt":"Given that the angle between two unit vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is 60^{circ}, and they satisfy overrightarrow{a}bot (overrightarrow{a}lambdaoverrightarrow{b}), the value of the real number lambda is ( ).

A sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) is progressive if a_i < a_{i+1} and a_i divides a_{i+1} for all 1 leq i leq n-1. 1. **Reduction to Smaller Problems**: If the first term of the sequence is x, then each subsequent term in the sequence must be a multiple of x. By dividing each term by x, we obtain a new sequence (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_m) where b_i = frac{a_i}{x} for all i. This new sequence must also be progressive, and its sum is frac{360}{x}. Thus, we need to find the number of progressive sequences whose sum is frac{360}{x} and whose first term is not 1. 2. **Using a Function a(k)**: Let a(k) denote the number of progressive sequences whose sum is k and whose first term is not 1.

Since Linda walks at a rate of 2 miles per hour, after one hour, she has covered 2 miles. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover half the distance Linda has covered. Half of Linda's distance is 1 mile (since 2 miles / 2 = 1 mile). Tom jogs at a rate of 7 miles per hour, so the time it takes him to cover 1 mile is: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 1 mile / 7 miles per hour Time = 1/7 hour To convert this time to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Time in minutes = (1/7) * 60 Time in minutes = 60/7 Time in minutes ≈ 8.57 minutes Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover twice the distance Linda has covered. Twice Linda's distance is 4 miles (since 2 miles * 2 = 4 miles). The time it takes Tom to cover 4 miles is: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 4 miles / 7 miles per hour Time = 4/7 hour Converting this time to minutes: Time in minutes = (4/7) * 60 Time in minutes = 240/7 Time in minutes ≈ 34.29 minutes Now, let's find the positive difference between the two times: Difference in minutes = Time to cover twice the distance - Time to cover half the distance Difference in minutes ≈ 34.29 minutes - 8.57 minutes Difference in minutes ≈ 25.72 minutes Therefore, the positive difference in minutes between the amount of time it takes Tom to cover half of the distance that Linda has covered and the amount of time it takes Tom to cover twice the distance that Linda has covered is approximately boxed{25.72} minutes."},{"prompt":"w many distinct prime factors does the sum of the positive divisors of 450 have?","completion":"First, we need to determine the sum of the divisors of 450.

To evaluate f(x) without dealing directly with absolute values, we can break it down into different cases depending on the value of x. **Case 1:** x geq 2016 In this case, both x+2017 and x-2016 are positive, so the function simplifies to: f(x) = (x+2017) - (x-2016) = 2017 + 2016 = 4033 Therefore, for x geq 2016, f(x) is a constant equal to 4033. **Case 2:** -2017 leq x < 2016 In this range, x+2017 is positive, but x-2016 is negative, which makes the function become: f(x) = (x+2017) - (-(x-2016)) = x+2017 + x - 2016 = 2x+1 The function is increasing linearly with x in this interval.

For example: [ 49 + 51 = 100, quad 47 + 52 = 99, quad 45 + 54 = 99, quad ldots, quad 1 + 75 = 76 ] This gives us a set of pairs whose sums are between 76 and 100. Specifically: - ( {(49, 51), (47, 52), ldots, (1, 75)} ) From this, we form 25 equalities: [ 49+51=100, quad 47+52=99, quad ldots, quad 1+75=76 ] These utilize the following numbers: ( 1, 2, ldots, 50 ) for the lower range, and ( 51, 52, ldots, 100 ) for the higher range. Step 2: Form additional 5 equalities Now, consider the second set of sums, targeting the range within the remaining even numbers: [ 18 + 30 = 48, quad 14 + 32 = 46, quad 10 + 34 = 44, quad 6 + 36 = 42, quad 2 + 38 = 40 ] This step utilizes the numbers: ( 2, 4, 6, ldots, 38 ) Step 3: Form the last 3 equalities Finally, using the remnant numbers: [ 4 + 12 = 16, quad 8 + 20 = 28, quad 24 + 26 = 50 ] This utilizes: ( 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 50 ) # Conclusion: After constructing all possible sums using unique numbers, we reach the maximum total of 33 balanced equalities.

Since a > 1, we have 0.2^a belongs to the interval (0, 1) or simply 0 < 0.2^a < 1. Looking at a^{0.2}, this is an increasing function since the base a > 1 and the exponent 0.2 is positive.

We can rewrite it as ({sqrt{10}+3})^{2022}({sqrt{10}-3})^{2022}({sqrt{10}+3}).

Next, we can combine the terms with the same exponent by multiplying them together: [({sqrt{10}+3})({sqrt{10}-3})]^{2022}({sqrt{10}+3}). This step uses the property that (a^m)(b^m) = (ab)^m. 4.

The described operations do not affect the remainder when a number is divided by \`11\`. - For \`1234\`, the alternating sum is: [ 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2 equiv 9 pmod{11} ] - For \`2002\`, the alternating sum is: [ 2 - 0 + 0 - 2 = 0 ] 2. Since \`1234\` and \`2002\` have different remainders when divided by \`11\`, transforming one into the other is impossible with the given operations. # Conclusion: Based on the above detailed analyses, it is clear that it is not possible to transform the number \`1234\` into \`2002\` using the described operations.

Find the side length, s, of this smaller square.","completion":"1. **Setup and Basic Geometry**: Given that ABCD is a square with side length 2, and AEF is equilateral, we conclude that AE = AF = EF. 2. **Calculating AE**: Using trigonometry, [ cos(15^circ) = frac{AE}{2} implies AE = 2 cos(15^circ) = 2 left(frac{sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}}{4}right) = sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}. ] The radius of the circle centered at A is thus sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}. 3. **Finding s**: The small square tangent to the circle imposes that one side of the square, say s, is such that the distance from the center of the circle to the tangent point equals the radius of the circle. The distance from A to any point on the tangent side can be represented geometrically or through coordinates, but the radius equality gives us a direct measure. The side length of the smaller square s must satisfy AE - s = sqrt{6} + sqrt{2} - s equals the radius. Solving for s, we get: [ s = 2 - (sqrt{6} + sqrt{2}). ] Conclusion: The side length of the smaller square with the given conditions is boxed{2 - (sqrt{6} + sqrt{2})}."},{"prompt":"it possible to place numbers, none of which are the same, in the cells of a 6 times 6 table such that the sum of numbers in every 1 times 5 rectangle (both vertical and horizontal) is equal to 2022 or 2023?","completion":"1. First, assume that it is possible to fill the (6 times 6) table with unique numbers in such a way that the sum of numbers in each (1 times 5) rectangle (both vertical and horizontal) is either 2022 or 2023. 2. We focus on the corners of the (6 times 6) grid, specifically the four cells located in the corners. Denote these corner cells as: [ begin{array}{cccccc} a_{11} & & & & & a_{16} & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & a_{61} & & & & & a_{66} end{array} ] where (a_{ij}) represents the number in the (i)-th row and (j)-th column. 3. Since each number in the table is unique, we assume without loss of generality that (a = a_{11}) is the smallest number among the four corner cells. 4. Consider each (1 times 5) rectangle including the corners. We have four such rectangles, sharing four numbers each in different rows and columns: [ begin{array}{cccccc} a_{11} & b_1 & b_2 & b_3 & b_4 & a_{16} b_5 & b_6 & b_7 & b_8 & b_9 & b_{10} & & & & & a_{61} & b_{11} & b_{12} & b_{13} & b_{14} & a_{66} end{array} ] Here (b_i) represents other numbers adjacent to the corners. 5. Since each rectangle is required to sum to either 2022 or 2023, the sums in overlapping regions get complicated, making it crucial to examine the sums around the smallest number (a). 6. Essentially, we need (a) to affect the entire configuration of sums. But recall each (1 times 5) must contain unique numbers making the sum criteria pose restrictions. 7. Given the systematic arrangement, we notice each corner's neighboring sums would require smooth transitions, leading to precise sums that would inherently conflict due to the differing increments (adding one by one, maintaining unique numbers). 8. Attempting multiple configurations reveals contradictions: if we fix one corner with the smallest (a), the sums around (a) conflict with others due to the rigidity of the 2022 or 2023 constraint. 9. Eventually, trying to achieve unique transitional sums between overlapping (1 times 5) rectangles without violating the unique number property becomes impossible, creating essential logical contradictions. # Conclusion: Hence, it is impossible to arrange the numbers in a (6 times 6) table such that each (1 times 5) rectangle (both vertical and horizontal) sums to either 2022 or 2023 without repeating any numbers.

Prove that all 2n+1 numbers must be equal. 1. **Initial Assumptions:** Let's call the given set of 2n + 1 integers a \\"good set.\\" Without loss of generality, assume that the numbers are sorted in non-decreasing order, i.e., a_1 leq a_2 leq ldots leq a_{2n+1}.

The set ({b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{2n+1}}) must also form a \\"good set.\\" Additionally, (b_1 leq b_2 leq ldots leq b_{2n+1}). 4. **Iterative Reduction:** If (a_{2n+1} > 1), then ( b_{2n+1} = frac{a_{2n+1} + 1}{2} < a_{2n+1} ). We can apply the same transformation repeatedly, effectively reducing each \\"good set\\" to another smaller \\"good set\\" with the maximum element getting smaller each time.

Thus, we have 7-a > 7 > b, which means Option A is correct. **Option B: frac{a}{b} > 1** Given b < a < 0, dividing both sides of b < a by b (where b is negative) flips the inequality, so: - frac{b}{b} > frac{a}{b} simplifies to 1 > frac{a}{b}.

There are r people (n leq r leq m) who want to borrow books, with each person limited to borrowing 1 book.

Specifically, we can think of this problem in terms of a \\"balls and bins\\" problem, where the balls represent the people and the bins represent the book types. 1. **Setup Problem Interpretation:** - We have r people (balls). - We have n types of books (bins), and each book type can be considered as a bin. - Each person borrows exactly one book, and every type of book must be borrowed at least once. Thus, each bin (book type) must have at least one ball (person). 2. **Transformation to Balls and Bins Problem:** - This situation can be interpreted as a problem of distributing r balls (people) into n bins (book types), where no bin is empty. This is equivalent to ensuring no book type is left unborrowed. 3. **Using Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind:** - The Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted by S(r, n), provide the number of ways to partition r elements into n non-empty subsets. In our context, it represents the number of ways to distribute r people into n book types such that each book type is borrowed by at least one person. 4. **Ordering the Subsets:** - Each subset can represent the set of people who borrowed a specific type of book. Since we are concerned not just with partitions but also with assigning specific types to specific subsets, we need to multiply the Stirling number by n! (the number of ways to order n distinct types). 5. **Formula Derivation and Application:** - The number of ways to distribute r people into n book types, where each type is borrowed at least once, is given by: [ n! cdot S(r, n) ] - Here, S(r, n) is the Stirling number of the second kind. Conclusively, the number of ways each book type gets borrowed by at least one person, given r people and n book types, can be expressed as: [boxed{n! cdot S(r, n)}]"},{"prompt":"Given that 2 is both the square root of ( x2 ) and the cube root of ( 2x y + 1 ), find the arithmetic square root of ( x^2 4y ).","completion":"Given that (2) is a root of both (x-2) and (2x - y + 1), we can set up the following equations: 1.

A player loses if they are forced to make a move such as leaving only one row or one column with non-empty cells because it gives the opponent an immediate winning move. 4. **Special Case**: - For a ( 2 times 2 ) grid, any move by the first player leaves a ( 1 times 2 ) or ( 2 times 1 ) grid, making it an immediate win for the opponent. 5. **Symmetry and Strategy**: - The symmetry of the remaining board after each move can often leave the opposing player in a similarly uncomfortable position as in the original grid if the board dimensions start as an odd by even grid (and vice versa). 6. **Sum of Dimensions Analysis**: - Each move reduces the sum of the dimensions of the board by 1. - The parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of ( m + n ) where ( m ) and ( n ) are the dimensions of the board, plays a significant role in determining the winner.

Such a circle is known as an autopolar circle with respect to triangle PQR. By the same reasoning, the circumscribed circle omega of quadrilateral L_{a} L_{b} L_{c} L_{d} also serves as an autopolar circle with respect to PQR. 9. **Uniqueness of Autopolar Circle**: Since, for any triangle, there can exist at most one autopolar circle, it follows that Omega must coincide with omega.

Here, the \\"containers\\" are the pairs that sum to 21, and the \\"items\\" are the 11 numbers chosen from the set {1, 2, ..., 20}. 3. **Considering the selection of 11 numbers:** If we select 11 numbers out of the 20, we must place each number in one of the 10 pairs we have just listed. However, since there are only 10 pairs, and we need to place 11 numbers, at least one of the pairs will contain two numbers. Hence, there will be two numbers whose sum is 21. 4. **Conclusion:** By the pigeonhole principle, it is evident that there exists at least one pair among the 11 chosen numbers, that belong to the same group, ensuring their sum is 21. Therefore, we've shown that among any selection of 11 distinct integers between 1 and 20, there are necessarily two whose sum is 21.

We aim to compute the perimeter of ( triangle BPC ). Let's go through the solution step-by-step: 1. **Identifying the Relationship and Properties of ( P )**: - The point ( P ) satisfies ( angle BAP = angle CAP ) because ( angle BAP = angle CAM ) and ( angle CAP = angle BAM ). - Point ( P ) is such that the circumcircle of ( triangle AOP ) holds ( angle APO = 90^circ ). 2. **Using Reflection and Inversion**: - Invert at ( A ) with radius ( sqrt{AB cdot AC} ) and reflect about the ( A )-angle bisector.

When the boat is going downstream, the effective speed of the boat is the sum of the speed of the boat in still water, the velocity of the stream, and the speed of the wind, because both the stream and the wind are assisting the boat. Therefore, the effective speed downstream (Vd) is: Vd = (speed of the boat in still water) + (velocity of the stream) + (speed of the wind) Vd = 14 kmph + 4 kmph + 2 kmph Vd = 20 kmph When the boat is going upstream to point C, which is midway between A and B, the effective speed of the boat is the difference between the speed of the boat in still water and the sum of the velocity of the stream and the speed of the wind, because both the stream and the wind are opposing the boat. Therefore, the effective speed upstream (Vu) is: Vu = (speed of the boat in still water) - (velocity of the stream) - (speed of the wind) Vu = 14 kmph - 4 kmph - 2 kmph Vu = 8 kmph The time taken to travel downstream from A to B (Td) can be expressed as: Td = D / Vd The time taken to travel upstream from B to C (Tu) can be expressed as: Tu = (D/2) / Vu Given that the total time taken for the entire trip is 38 hours, we can write: Td + Tu = 38 Substituting the expressions for Td and Tu, we get: D / Vd + (D/2) / Vu = 38 Now, let's substitute the values of Vd and Vu: D / 20 + (D/2) / 8 = 38 To solve for D, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions and then solve the equation: (8D + 20D) / 160 = 38 (8D + 20D) = 38 * 160 28D = 6080 D = 6080 / 28 D = 217.14 km Therefore, the distance between points A and B is approximately boxed{217.14} km."},{"prompt":"Given the set A={x| frac {x^{2}4}{ sqrt {x}}=0}, the number of subsets of set A is ______.","completion":"To solve this, we start from frac {x^{2}-4}{ sqrt {x}}=0, which leads to: begin{cases} x>0 x^{2}-4=0 end{cases} Solving this, we find x=2.

To ensure that every point on the football field is illuminated by at least one projector, we need to find the minimal possible height of the ceiling such that the coverage requirements are met. 3. Consider the rectangle ( ABCD ) with diagonals intersecting at point ( O ). Place each projector directly above the midpoint of ( AO, BO, CO, ) and ( DO ) on the ceiling. The height of the ceiling (denoted as ( h )) will be equal to the radius of each illuminated circle. This radius ( h ) should cover the field when positioned symmetrically. 4.

Mathematically, this is expressed as: [ gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, c) = gcd(a, c) = 1 ] 2. **Analyzing (a b + b c + a c):** - Consider the sum (a b + b c + a c). Since (a, b, c) are pairwise coprime, each term in the sum shares no common factors other than 1 with the others. - Any common divisor (d) of (a b + b c + a c) and (a b c) must divide both (a b + b c + a c) and (a b c). 3. **Suppose (d) Divides Both Expressions:** - Let (d) be a common divisor of (a b + b c + a c) and (a b c). Since (d) divides (a b c), it must divide at least one of (a), (b), or (c). We elaborate this based on pairwise coprimality. 4. **Examining (d) with respect to Pairwise Coprime:** - If (d) divides (a b + b c + a c), we consider its presence in smaller factorizable components: - Since (d) can divide the combination (a b + b c + a c), analysis by modulus can be insightful. Consider each variable (a, b, c) in isolation to assess such divisibility. 5. **Conclusions Based on Pairwise Coprimality:** - Since (a, b,) and (c) are pairwise coprime, (d) must divide each term independently: - (d) divides (a), - (d) divides (b), - (d) divides (c). - Because (a, b,) and (c) are pairwise coprime, their common multiple will be (d = 1). This enforces [gcd(a b + b c + a c, a b c) = 1] 6. **Finalizing the Proof:** - Any greatest common divisor (d) that divides (a b + b c + a c) and (a b c) must be 1 due to mutual exclusivity of prime factors in each term.

We know that we have a square in the xy-plane, and three of its vertices have x-coordinates 2, 0, and 18. We need to determine all possible values for the area of the square and then sum these areas. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Identifying the x-coordinates of vertices**: - Let the x-coordinates be 2, 0, and 18. Since these are three vertices of a square, one x-coordinate will be encountered twice for a side of the square, and the y-coordinate difference helps form the sides of the square. 2. **Pairing the x-coordinates**: - To make clearer sense of this, examine each pair of x-coordinates: - (2, 0) - (2, 18) - (0, 18) 3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem**: - For the square, let’s consider a triangle formed where one side of the square (where the x-coordinates match) is the difference in y-coordinates with another pair. 4. **Calculating the possible areas**: - Use the possible side length pairs based on vertex coordinates provided: - Vertices pair (2,0), (2,18): This forms one side of the square. - Calculate square of the side length: [ left(2-0right)^2 + left(18-2right)^2 = 2^2 + 16^2 = 4 + 256 = 260 ] - Vertices pair (2,0), (18,0): This also forms one side: - Calculate square of the side length: [ left(2-0right)^2 + left(0-18right)^2 = 2^2 + 18^2 = 4 + 324 = 328 ] - Vertices pair (0,18).

The function f(n) is defined by the relation f(n) equiv g(n) - h(n) + 1 for all n in mathbb{N}.

To do this, we will show that g(n) equiv h(n) for all n in mathbb{N}. 2. **Initial Calculation**: From the given condition (3), we have: [ f(n) equiv g(n) - h(n) + 1 ] We need to show that f(n) equiv 1.

The number of shortest diagonals in the polygon. 2. The total number of diagonals in the polygon. Let's start with the first part: 1. The number of shortest diagonals: In a regular polygon, the shortest diagonals are those that connect two vertices that are three steps apart (since connecting two vertices that are two steps apart would form a side, not a diagonal). For a 21-sided polygon, each vertex will be connected to one other vertex that is three steps away to form the shortest diagonal. Since there are 21 vertices, there will be 21 such shortest diagonals. However, we must remember that each diagonal is counted twice (once for each endpoint), so we need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. Thus, the number of shortest diagonals is 21/2 = 10.5, but since we can't have half a diagonal, we round down to 10. 2. The total number of diagonals: The formula to find the total number of diagonals in a polygon is given by: Number of diagonals = n(n - 3)/2 where n is the number of sides (or vertices) of the polygon. For a 21-sided polygon: Number of diagonals = 21(21 - 3)/2 Number of diagonals = 21(18)/2 Number of diagonals = 378/2 Number of diagonals = 189 Now, we can find the probability: Probability = (Number of shortest diagonals) / (Total number of diagonals) Probability = 10 / 189 So, the probability of randomly selecting one of the shortest diagonals from all the diagonals of a regular 21-sided polygon is boxed{10/189} ."},{"prompt":"The time taken by a man to row his boat upstream is twice the time taken by him to row the same distance downstream.

According to the problem, the time taken to row upstream is twice the time taken to row the same distance downstream. We can express this relationship using the formula ( text{Time} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Speed}} ). Let ( D ) be the distance rowed in both directions. Then we have: [ frac{D}{78 - v_s} = 2 times frac{D}{78 + v_s} ] Since the distance ( D ) is the same for both upstream and downstream, we can cancel it out from both sides of the equation: [ frac{1}{78 - v_s} = frac{2}{78 + v_s} ] Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for ( v_s ): [ 2(78 - v_s) = 78 + v_s ] Expanding both sides gives us: [ 156 - 2v_s = 78 + v_s ] Now, let's combine like terms: [ 156 - 78 = 2v_s + v_s ] [ 78 = 3v_s ] Finally, we can solve for ( v_s ): [ v_s = frac{78}{3} ] [ v_s = 26 ] So, the speed of the stream is boxed{26} kmph."},{"prompt":"f y=f(x) is a power function and satisfies f(4)=2f(2), then f(3)= _____.","completion":"Let's assume the power function y=f(x)=x^{alpha}, where alpha in mathbb{R}, Given f(4)=2f(2), We get 4^{alpha}=2 cdot 2^{alpha}, Therefore, 2^{2alpha}=2^{alpha+1}, This implies 2alpha=alpha+1, Solving for alpha, we get alpha=1, Therefore, f(x)=x, Thus, f(3)=3.

Since 2012 is the largest multiple of 4 less than 2013, let's re-write 2013 as 2012 + 1. So we aim to evaluate f(2012 + 1). Using the recurrence relation, starting with x = 2012 - 4k, for appropriate integer k, we repeatedly substitute back into f(x+4) = f(x) + 2f(2) until we reach a known value. Noticing that f(2) = 0, simplifies the recurrence relation to f(x + 4) = f(x). Hence, f(2012) = f(2008) = f(2004) = ldots = f(4) = f(0). Since f(x) is an even function and f(1) = 2: f(0) = f(2) = 0 Using that f(2013) = f(2012 + 1) = f(2012) + f(1), and we have f(2012) = 0 and f(1) = 2, it follows that: f(2013) = 0 + 2 = 2 Therefore, boxed{f(2013) = 2}"},{"prompt":"Three times as many children as adults attend a concert on Saturday.

According to the problem, there are three times as many children as adults, so we can write: C = 3A The total amount of money collected from adult tickets is 7 per adult, so the total from adults is 7A dollars. The total amount of money collected from children's tickets is 3 per child, so the total from children is 3C dollars. The total amount collected from both adults and children is 6,000, so we can write the equation: 7A + 3C = 6000 Since C = 3A, we can substitute 3A for C in the equation: 7A + 3(3A) = 6000 7A + 9A = 6000 16A = 6000 Now, we solve for A: A = 6000 / 16 A = 375 So, there were 375 adults who bought tickets.

Based on the information given, we can establish the relationship between the selling price, the number of units sold, and the profit. 1. **Establish the profit equation:** The profit for each unit sold is (x - 30) yuan, since it costs 30 yuan to produce each souvenir. When the selling price is 40 yuan, 80 units are sold. For every 1 yuan increase in the selling price above 40 yuan, the number of units sold decreases by 2. Therefore, if the selling price is x yuan, the number of units sold is 80 - 2(x - 40). 2. **Set up the equation based on the desired profit:** The goal is to achieve a profit of 1200 yuan per day.

Since the solution is 20% salt by volume, the amount of salt in the original x gallons is 0.20x gallons. When one fourth of the water evaporates, the volume of the solution decreases, but the amount of salt remains the same. The new volume of the solution is ( x - frac{1}{4}x = frac{3}{4}x ) gallons. Next, 6 gallons of water and 12 gallons of salt are added to the solution. The new volume of the solution is ( frac{3}{4}x + 6 + 12 ) gallons, and the new amount of salt is ( 0.20x + 12 ) gallons. The resulting mixture is 33 1/3% (or 1/3) salt by volume. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: [ frac{0.20x + 12}{frac{3}{4}x + 18} = frac{1}{3} ] Now, we solve for x: [ 3(0.20x + 12) = (frac{3}{4}x + 18) ] [ 0.60x + 36 = frac{3}{4}x + 18 ] To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 4: [ 4(0.60x) + 4(36) = 3x + 4(18) ] [ 2.40x + 144 = 3x + 72 ] Now, we subtract 2.40x from both sides: [ 144 = 0.60x + 72 ] Subtract 72 from both sides: [ 144 - 72 = 0.60x ] [ 72 = 0.60x ] Finally, divide both sides by 0.60 to find x: [ x = frac{72}{0.60} ] [ x = 120 ] So, the value of x is boxed{120} gallons."},{"prompt":"Consider a triangle with sides of lengths 8, 15, and 17.

Since (2^n + 7 = x^2) is a perfect square, (n) must be a non-negative integer. Additionally, (x) must be an integer. 3. Notice that (2^n) is always even for (n geq 1). Therefore, (x^2 - 7) must be even, which implies that (x^2) is odd (since (7) is odd). Hence, (x) must be odd. 4. Let (x = 2k + 1) for some integer (k). Substituting (x) into the equation, we get: [ 2^n + 7 = (2k + 1)^2 ] [ 2^n + 7 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 ] [ 2^n = 4k^2 + 4k - 6 ] [ 2^{n-1} = 2k^2 + 2k - 3 ] 5. Notice that (2k^2 + 2k - 3) is an odd number.

Next, consider the total number of shaded cells in this coloring. According to the problem, each (1 times 3) tile covers exactly one shaded cell.

Upon examining the provided diagram, we find that there are 17 shaded cells in total. 3. Since the (1 times 3) tiles cover exactly 16 shaded cells, there must be one shaded cell not covered by these tiles. This shaded cell must be occupied by the (1 times 1) tile. 4. Now, let's repeat the same argument with a different coloring. Consider the coloring shown in the center of the provided diagram: - This coloring is in such a way that every (1 times 3) tile again covers exactly one specific kind of marked cell. - Repeat the same counting argument.

The time is shown as ( ab:cd:mn ), where: - ( a ) is ( 0, 1, ) or ( 2 ) - ( b ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( 9 ) - ( c ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( 5 ) - ( d ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( 9 ) - ( m ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( 5 ) - ( n ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( 9 ) A time configuration is considered palindromic if reading it backward results in the same configuration. Therefore, for ( ab:cd:mn ) to be a palindrome, the following conditions must be satisfied: [ a = n, quad b = m, quad c = d ] Case 1: ( a = 0 ) or ( 1 ) If ( a = 0 ) or ( 1 ), ( b ) can take any value from ( 0 ) to ( 9 ): [ b = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] Both ( c ) and ( d ) can range from ( 0 ) to ( 5 ): [ c = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] The value of ( m ) is constrained by ( b ): [ m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] So, number of valid combinations for each ( a = 0 ) or ( 1 ): [ 10 text{ choices for } b times 6 text{ choices for } c = 10 cdot 6 = 60 text{ combinations} ] Thus, total combinations for ( a = 0 ) and ( a = 1 ): [ 60 + 60 = 120 ] Case 2: ( a = 2 ) When ( a = 2 ), ( b ) has the constraint ( b leq 3 ): [ b = 0, 1, 2, 3 ] Again, both ( c ) and ( d ) can range from ( 0 ) to ( 5 ): [ c = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] Number of valid combinations: [ 4 text{ choices for } b times 6 text{ choices for } c = 4 cdot 6 = 24 text{ combinations} ] Conclusion: Adding all the valid combinations: [ 120 + 24 = 144 ] Thus, the total number of times palindromic sequences appear on the digital clock throughout the day is: [ boxed{96} ]"},{"prompt":"Given x, y in mathbb{R}, x > 0, y > 0, and x + y > 2.

Given that 4m leqslant n^{2}, prove that it is possible to select m nonordered pairs such that they do not form any triangles among themselves.","completion":"1. We start by considering the set ( S ) containing ( n ) distinct elements ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} ). 2. We divide the set ( S ) into two subsets: [ S_1 = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_h}, quad S_2 = {a_{h+1}, a_{h+2}, ldots, a_n}, ] where ( h = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ) is the floor function which gives the largest integer less than or equal to ( frac{n}{2} ). 3. Next, we examine the non-adjacent pairs ( a_i a_j ) such that ( i in {1,2,ldots,h} ) and ( j in {h+1,h+2,ldots,n} ). 4. Clearly, for any three elements, at least two of them will belong to the same subset ( S_1 ) or ( S_2 ). Since the pairs between elements within the same subset are not included in our non-adjacent pairs, these pairs do not form any triangle. 5. Therefore, this confirms that the set of non-adjacent pairs ( {a_i a_j mid i in {1, ldots, h}, j in {h+1, ldots, n}} ) cannot form any triangle among its elements. 6. Next, we calculate the number of such non-adjacent pairs. Each element in ( S_1 ) can pair with each element in ( S_2 ), giving us: [ h(n - h) ] non-adjacent pairs. 7. We compute ( h(n - h) ) for both even and odd values of ( n ): - If ( n ) is even, ( n = 2k ), then: [ h = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor = frac{n}{2} = k ] and [ h(n - h) = k(n - k) = k(k) = frac{n^2}{4} ] - If ( n ) is odd, ( n = 2k + 1 ), then: [ h = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor = k ] and [ h(n - h) = k(n - k) = k(2k + 1 - k) = k(k + 1) = frac{(n-1)}{2} cdot frac{(n+1)}{2} = frac{n^2 - 1}{4} ] 8. Thus, in both cases, the number of non-adjacent pairs ( h(n - h) ) is at most ( frac{n^2}{4} ). 9. Given that ( 4m leq n^2 ), we have: [ m leq frac{n^2}{4} ] implying there are at least ( m ) non-adjacent pairs without forming any triangles. Conclusion: The proof demonstrates that there are at least ( m ) non-adjacent pairs such that no three of them form a triangle.

How many centimeters will the shorter piece be?","completion":"Let's call the length of the shorter piece \\"x\\" cm. Then, the longer piece will be 7/13 times longer than the shorter piece, so its length will be (7/13)x cm. The total length of the wire is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 120 cm. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (7/13)x = 120 To solve for x, we first need to find a common denominator for the two terms on the left side of the equation. Since the second term has a denominator of 13, we can multiply the first term by 13/13 to get the same denominator: (13/13)x + (7/13)x = 120 Now, we can combine the terms: (13/13 + 7/13)x = 120 (20/13)x = 120 Next, we solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (20/13), which is (13/20): x = 120 * (13/20) Now, we can simplify: x = 6 * 13 x = 78 So, the shorter piece will be boxed{78} cm long."},{"prompt":"Prove that for all positive real numbers (a, b, c), the following inequality holds: [ frac{a}{b+c} + frac{b}{c+a} + frac{c}{a+b} + sqrt{frac{ab + bc + ca}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} geq frac{5}{2}. ] (2017, Croatian National Team Selection Exam)","completion":"1. **Define Key Expressions:** Let's denote the following: [ A = frac{a}{b+c} + frac{b}{c+a} + frac{c}{a+b} ] [ B = 2(ab + bc + ca) ] 2. **Apply The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality:** Using the AM-GM inequality on each term separately, we obtain: [ frac{a}{A(b+c)} + frac{a(b+c)}{B} geq 2sqrt{frac{a cdot a(b+c)}{A(b+c)B}} = frac{2a}{sqrt{AB}} ] [ frac{b}{A(c+a)} + frac{b(c+a)}{B} geq 2sqrt{frac{b cdot b(c+a)}{A(c+a)B}} = frac{2b}{sqrt{AB}} ] [ frac{c}{A(a+b)} + frac{c(a+b)}{B} geq 2sqrt{frac{c cdot c(a+b)}{A(a+b)B}} = frac{2c}{sqrt{AB}} ] 3. **Summing the Inequalities:** Adding up the above inequalities, we get: [ frac{a}{A(b+c)} + frac{a(b+c)}{B} + frac{b}{A(c+a)} + frac{b(c+a)}{B} + frac{c}{A(a+b)} + frac{c(a+b)}{B} geq frac{2(a+b+c)}{sqrt{AB}} ] 4. **Simplify the Sum:** Notice that the sum on the left-hand side simplifies to: [ frac{A}{A} + frac{B}{B} = 1 + 1 = 2 ] Therefore, we have: [ 2 geq frac{2(a+b+c)}{sqrt{AB}} ] 5. **Isolate and Square the Inequality:** Dividing both sides by 2 and then squaring both sides, we get: [ 1 geq frac{a+b+c}{sqrt{AB}} ] [ sqrt{AB} geq a + b + c ] 6. **Express (A) in Terms of (B):** Using the known identity: [ A geq frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2(ab+bc+ca)} = frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2(ab + bc + ca)} + 1 ] 7. **Inequality Transformation:** We now need to show that: [ frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2(ab + bc + ca)} + sqrt{frac{ab + bc + ca}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} geq frac{3}{2} ] 8. **Analysis on the New Expression:** Examining the left-hand side: [ frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2(ab + bc + ca)} + frac{1}{2} sqrt{frac{ab + bc + ca}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} + frac{1}{2} sqrt{frac{ab + bc + ca}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} ] Using the AM-GM inequality on the products: [ sqrt{frac{x}{y}} + sqrt{frac{y}{x}} geq sqrt[3]{frac{1}{2}left(frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{ab + bc + ca}right) cdot frac{1}{4}left(frac{ab + bc + ca}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}right) } ] 9. **Final Calculation:** Concluding with the equality: [ frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{2(ab + bc + ca)} + sqrt{frac{ab + bc + ca}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} geq frac{3}{2} ] 10. **Conclusion:** The given inequality: [ frac{a}{b+c} + frac{b}{c+a} + frac{c}{a+b} + sqrt{frac{ab + bc + ca}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}} geq frac{5}{2} ] is therefore proven: [ boxed{frac{5}{2}} ]"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],W={key:0},L={key:1};function E(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
