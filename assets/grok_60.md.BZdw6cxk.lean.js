We need to find the area of this semicircular segment. The total area of the full circle would be: [ A_{text{circle}} = pi r^2 = pi (5)^2 = 25pi ] We subtract the area of the segment of this circle that lies in (x < 0).

Simple geometric properties don’t allow a convex five-sided or six-sided shape to be formed from a square. - Concave polygons: Polygons with one or more interior angles greater than 180°. These can sometimes fit more unusual shapes or requirements. 4. **Analysis:** - Cutting the square into two equal concave pentagons would involve creating three internal cuts starting from the square's perimeter meeting at some internal points and forming the required angles. - For hexagons, similarly, cuts need to meet inside the square while forming six edges each. 5. **Practical Visualization:** - Construct an illustrated example with the square split accordingly: ![Illustration](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_c2dae46d614e2e953886g-48.jpg?height=180&width=349&top_left_y=104&top_left_x=863) The illustrated shape shows how you can practically achieve this partition by forming the structural edges of each target polygon such that it divides the square precisely in two equal areas by area. 6. **Conclusion:** - By visual inspection and geometrical reasoning, it is concluded possible to create two equal pentagons or hexagons from such a split if they are concave as the conditions for angles and side lengths are met. boxed{text{This method effectively answers how to achieve the task.}}"},{"prompt":"Compute sin 150^circ.","completion":"Let Q be the point on the unit circle that is 150^circ counterclockwise from (1,0). 1.

This measure helps to prevent the application from storing users' credit card information and shifts the responsibility for handling sensitive card data to specialized payment processors that are designed with security in mind. 2. **Encryption of Stored Data:** - Ensure that all data stored by the application, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as Full Name (FIO), delivery address, and card numbers, are encrypted. - In cases where storing card information is necessary, it should be securely encrypted. This adds a layer of security by making the data unreadable to unauthorized persons. - Additionally, request a PIN code for accessing the application to prevent unauthorized access. 3. **Encryption of Data in Transit:** - Secure the data during transmission between the user's device and the server infrastructure using encryption protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security). This prevents data from being intercepted and read by malicious actors during transmission. 4. **Code Obfuscation and Security Measures:** - Implement code obfuscation techniques and other measures to protect the application's code. This makes it difficult for attackers to reverse-engineer the application and add malicious functionalities such as sending copies of intercepted data to remote servers. 5. **Restriction on Rooted Devices:** - Prohibit the installation of the application on devices that have been rooted or jailbroken. Such actions compromise the security level of the device and all installed applications, making them vulnerable to malicious attacks. 6. **Antivirus Protection Agent:** - Include an antivirus protection agent within the application's framework.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 months. So, Barbi's total weight loss is 1.5 kg/month * 24 months = 36 kilograms. For Luca: He lost 9 kilograms every year for 15 years. So, Luca's total weight loss is 9 kg/year * 15 years = 135 kilograms. For Kim: In the first year, Kim lost 2 kilograms every month. There are 12 months in a year, so in the first year, Kim lost 2 kg/month * 12 months = 24 kilograms. For the following 5 years, Kim lost 3 kilograms every month.

A. One line B. None C. A finite number of lines but not less than 2 lines D. An infinite number of line","completion":"1. We start by considering the point ((10, frac{1}{2})) through which all the lines in question must pass. We need to find how many lines passing through this point also pass through at least two lattice points. 2. Let's consider the general form of a line that passes through ((10, frac{1}{2})). We can parameterize the slope (m), noting that for any integer (m in mathbb{Z}), the equation of the line can be written in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + c). 3. To find the intercept (c), we use the fact that the line passes through ((10, frac{1}{2})): [ frac{1}{2} = m cdot 10 + c implies c = frac{1}{2} - 10m ] Therefore, the equation of the line is: [ y = mx + left(frac{1}{2} - 10mright) ] 4. Next, we want this line to pass through lattice points, i.e., points ((x, y)) where both (x) and (y) are integers. This requires: [ mx + left(frac{1}{2} - 10mright) = n ] where (n) is an integer. 5. Rearrange this equation to find (x): [ mx - 10m = n - frac{1}{2} ] [ m(x - 10) = n - frac{1}{2} ] [ x - 10 = frac{n - frac{1}{2}}{m} ] [ x = 10 + frac{n - frac{1}{2}}{m} ] 6. Since (x) must be an integer, the right-hand side of the equation must also be an integer. Therefore, [ 10 + frac{n - frac{1}{2}}{m} = k quad text{for some integer } k ] This implies: [ frac{n - frac{1}{2}}{m} = k - 10 ] [ n - frac{1}{2} = m(k - 10) ] [ n = m(k - 10) + frac{1}{2} ] However, (n) must be an integer, so we find that the term (frac{1}{2}) prohibits this equation from holding for any arbitrary slope (m), unless (k) and (m) have special relations. Nonetheless, as (m) can be any integer, it guarantees the idea that multiple such relations can exist. 7. Because the equation can hold for infinitely many integer values of (m) (there are no restrictions on (m)), there are infinitely many lines passing through the point ((10, frac{1}{2})) satisfying the given condition. # Conclusion: The number of lines passing through the point ((10, frac{1}{2})) and at least two integer lattice points is: [ boxed{text{D. 无限多条}} ]"},{"prompt":"The list price of an article is Rs. 70.

Players can move a token from one vertex to an adjacent vertex, but it's forbidden to revisit any previously occupied vertex. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. Our task is to determine who wins with perfect play. 1. **Initial Setup:** - The hexagon has sides of length n. - Divide the entire hexagonal grid into pairs of adjacent vertices, excluding the starting vertex of the token. 2. **Strategy:** - The strategy involves pairing each vertex with one of its neighbors such that if Player 1 moves the token to any vertex in the pair, Player 2 can always move it to the other vertex in the pair. - This pairing ensures that Player 2 always has a move available as long as any unpaired vertices are left. 3. **Detail Breakdown:** - After Player 1 moves, Player 2 can move the token to the vertex paired with the one Player 1 just moved to. - This process continues, ensuring that Player 2 always has a valid move as pairs of vertices are alternately emptied by Player 1 and Player 2. 4. **Hexagon Grid Reduction:** - Initially, pair all boundary vertices except the one adjacent to the starting vertex. - Pair the remaining unpaired vertex with the next inner vertex along a path from the initial position to the center. This process reduces the problem into a smaller hexagon grid each turn. 5. **Induction Argument:** - Consider a hexagonal grid with a side of length n and assume that it has been successfully reduced to a grid with a side of length 1. - Small hexagons of side length 1 confirm the basis step as they can be perfectly paired into 3 pairs, ensuring that whoever plays second moves last and thus wins. 6. **Final Observation:** - By induction, extending from smaller hexagons to larger ones, the second-player pairing strategy holds true, ensuring that the second player always wins by having a move after the first player.

Consider a convex quadrilateral (ABCD) on the coordinate plane, with all vertex coordinates being integers. 2. Assume that one diagonal is twice the length of the other, and let the diagonals intersect at an angle of (45^circ). 3. Without loss of generality, let diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect at (O), where (AC) is twice the length of (BD), so (AC = 2BD). 4. Let the coordinates of vertices (A), (B), (C), and (D) be ((x_1, y_1)), ((x_2, y_2)), ((x_3, y_3)), and ((x_4, y_4)), respectively. All coordinates are integers. 5. Represent the diagonals as vectors: - (overrightarrow{AC} = (x_3 - x_1, y_3 - y_1)) - (overrightarrow{BD} = (x_4 - x_2, y_4 - y_2)) 6. Since the intersection angle between the diagonals is (45^circ), the dot product formula gives: [ overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{BD} = |overrightarrow{AC}| cdot |overrightarrow{BD}| cdot cos(45^circ) ] Given (cos(45^circ) = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}), we have: [ overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{BD} = |overrightarrow{AC}| cdot |overrightarrow{BD}| cdot frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ] 7. Calculating the magnitudes: - (|overrightarrow{AC}| = sqrt{(x_3 - x_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2}) - (|overrightarrow{BD}| = sqrt{(x_4 - x_2)^2 + (y_4 - y_2)^2}) 8. Using the condition that ( |AC| = 2 |BD| ), we get: [ sqrt{(x_3 - x_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2} = 2 sqrt{(x_4 - x_2)^2 + (y_4 - y_2)^2} ] 9. Squaring both sides: [ (x_3 - x_1)^2 + (y_3 - y_1)^2 = 4((x_4 - x_2)^2 + (y_4 - y_2)^2) ] 10. Plugging these magnitudes into the dot product equation: [ overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{BD} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} cdot 2 sqrt{(x_4 - x_2)^2 + (y_4 - y_2)^2} cdot sqrt{(x_4 - x_2)^2 + (y_4 - y_2)^2} ] Simplifies to: [ overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{BD} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} cdot 2(x_4 - x_2)^2 + (y_4 - y_2)^2 = (x_4 - x_2)^2 + (y_4 - y_2)^2 ] Since the right-hand side simplifies to: [ overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{BD} = (x_4 - x_2)^2 + (y_4 - y_2)^2 ] 11. Note that the left-hand side, (overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{BD}), is an integer as it represents a dot product of two integer-coordinate vectors, implying it must be an integer. 12. However, on simplifying, the factor ( frac{1}{sqrt{2}}cdot 2) is a non-integral factor multiplying an integral value. This contradicts the fact that the product of the magnitudes must result in an integer. 13. Therefore, we conclude that it is impossible for such a convex quadrilateral to exist on the coordinate plane where all vertices have integer coordinates, given the specified conditions on the diagonals.

Since m is perpendicular to plane alpha, and l is perpendicular to m but not in plane alpha, this means l must be parallel to plane alpha. This is because any line perpendicular to a line that is perpendicular to a plane will be parallel to that plane if it's not within the plane itself. 2. Similarly, given n is perpendicular to plane beta, and l is perpendicular to n but not in plane beta, we conclude that l is parallel to plane beta. The reasoning is the same as above: a line perpendicular to a line that is perpendicular to a plane will be parallel to the plane if it's not contained within the plane. 3. The condition that lines m and n are skew lines (meaning they do not intersect and are not parallel) and each is perpendicular to a different plane (alpha and beta, respectively) implies these planes must intersect. If planes alpha and beta were parallel, then lines m and n, being perpendicular to these planes, would also be parallel, which contradicts the information that m and n are skew lines. 4. Since l is parallel to both planes alpha and beta, and we've established that alpha intersects beta, the intersection line of planes alpha and beta must also be parallel to l.

Approach 1: Summing Valid pairs by Varying (x) 1. We will first consider non-negative values of (x). 2. For (x = 0), the inequality simplifies to: [|y| < 1000] This means (y) can take any integer value from (-999) to 999, which gives us (2 cdot 999 + 1 = 1999) possible values for (y). 3. For (x = 1), the inequality becomes: [|y| < 999] Here, (y) can take any integer value from (-998) to 998, yielding (1997) possible values. 4. Extending this logic, for a general (x = k) where (0 le k le 999), the number of (y) values is (1999 - 2k) (each increase in (x) reduces the range of (y) by 2). 5. These values form an arithmetic sequence where the first term (a = 1999) and the common difference (d = -2). 6.

Since both triangle ABC and its excircle undergo this transformation, we must analyze the consequence of this transformation on the relationships between the points. 3. **Nature of point A':** - Under the transformation, A' becomes the point at infinity for lines perpendicular to the diameter E'F'. Therefore, A' lies on the line at infinity which is perpendicular to E'F'. 4. **Understanding the relationship D'T' and E'F':** - We need to prove that the line D'T' is perpendicular to the diameter E'F', i.e., D'T' should contain the point at infinity A' which lies on lines perpendicular to E'F'. 5. **Using similarity of triangles:** - Given that triangle T'B'E' sim triangle T'F'C', we can write the proportion of corresponding sides: [ frac{C'T'}{T'E'} = frac{C'F'}{B'E'} ] 6. **Recognizing tangents and their properties:** - Notice the equality of tangents from B' and C' to the excircle: [ C'D' = C'F' quad text{and} quad B'D' = B'E' ] - Because these distances are equal due to their tangents being drawn from the respective points to the excircle. 7. **Combining the tangent segment equalities with the similarity ratio:** [ frac{C'T'}{T'E'} = frac{C'D'}{D'B'} ] - This proportion indicates that D'T' is actually parallel to B'E'. As B'E' is perpendicular to E'F' (by construction), D'T' must also be perpendicular to E'F'. 8. **Conclusion:** - Since D'T' and B'E' are both perpendicular to E'F', and A' lies at infinity representing a direction perpendicular to E'F', the line D'T' must contain A'.

We need to show that we can remove some vertices from ( B ) such that at least ( leftlceil frac{2n}{9} rightrceil ) vertices remain in ( B ), and in the induced subgraph, every vertex in ( A ) has a degree of at most 2. 2. **Initial setup and degree analysis:** The total number of edges in ( G ) is ( 3 times 3n = 9n ). Since there are ( n ) vertices in ( B ), by the pigeonhole principle, there exists at least one vertex in ( B ) with degree at least ( frac{9n}{n} = 9 ).

Thus, n e^{-p r / 2} leq n e^{-(3 ln n) / 2 + p/2}. 6. **Step 6: Evaluating the Exponential Term** We notice that: n e^{-3 / 2 ln n + p / 2} = n n^{-3 / 2} e^{p / 2}. 7. **Step 7: Simplifying the Expression** For large ( n ), ( e^{p / 2} ) approaches 1, therefore: n n^{-3 / 2} e^{p / 2} approx n n^{-3 / 2} = n^{-1 / 2}. 8. **Step 8: Taking the Limit** Finally, as ( n rightarrow infty ), sqrt{e} / sqrt{n} rightarrow 0.

This is because all the coefficients (binom{n+i}{n}) are positive, and thus the polynomial is strictly positive for ( x > 0 ). 2. **Assume ( x < 0 )**: We denote the polynomial as ( P(n,m) ). We then consider the polynomial for ( x < 0 ). 3. **Polynomial Transformation**: We transform the polynomial using the identity: [ (x-1)P(n,m) = sum_{i=1}^{m+1} binom{n+i-1}{n} x^i - sum_{i=0}^{m} binom{n+i}{n} x^i ] Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: [ (x-1)P(n,m) = binom{n+m}{n} x^{m+1} - sum_{i=0}^{m} binom{n+i-1}{n-1} x^i ] This can be rewritten as: [ (x-1)P(n,m) = binom{n+m}{n} x^{m+1} - P(n-1,m) ] 4. **Inductive Step**: We use induction to prove the general form of ( P(n,m) ): [ P(n,m) = frac{1}{(1-x)^n} P(0,m) - sum_{i=1}^{n} binom{m+i}{i} x^{m+1} frac{1}{(1-x)^{n+1-i}} ] Simplifying further, we get: [ P(n,m) = frac{1}{(1-x)^n} + sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{m+i}{i} (-x^{m+1}) frac{1}{(1-x)^{n+1-i}} ] 5. **Case for Even ( m )**: When ( m ) is even, each term on the right-hand side (RHS) is positive. Therefore, ( P(n,m) ) has no real root for even ( m ). Hence, ( P(n,m) > 0 ) for all even ( m ). 6. **Derivative Analysis**: We compute the derivative of ( P(n,m) ): [ P'(n,m) = sum_{i=1}^{m} binom{n+i}{n} i x^{i-1} ] Simplifying, we get: [ P'(n,m) = (n+1) sum_{i=1}^{m} binom{n+i}{n+1} x^{i-1} ] Further simplification gives: [ P'(n,m) = (n+1) sum_{i=0}^{m-1} binom{n+1+i}{n+1} x^i = (n+1) P(n+1, m-1) ] 7. **Case for Odd ( m )**: If ( m ) is odd, we see that ( P'(n,m) > 0 ) implies ( P(n,m) ) is monotone.

(II) f(x) geq kx - 2(k+1) (k in mathbb{Z}) holds for any x > 2, iff k leq frac{x ln x + 2}{x - 2}, x > 2. Let g(x) = frac{x ln x + 2}{x - 2}, x > 2. g'(x) = frac{x - 2 ln x - 4}{(x - 2)^2}. Consider the function h(x) = x - 2 ln x - 4, h'(x) = 1 - frac{2}{x} > 0, h(x) is monotonically increasing on its domain. Clearly, h(8) = 4 - 2 ln 8 < 0, h(10) = 6 - 2 ln 10 > 0, So there exists a unique x_0 in (8, 10) such that h(x_0) = x_0 - 2 ln x_0 + 4 = 0. On (2, x_0), h(x) < 0, g'(x) < 0, g(x) is monotonically decreasing; on (x_0, +infty), h(x) > 0, g'(x) > 0, g(x) is monotonically increasing. So g(x) takes its unique minimum value, which is also the minimum value g(x_0) = frac{x_0 ln x_0 + 2}{x_0 - 2} at x_0. Note that at this time h(x_0) = 0, ln x_0 = frac{x_0 - 4}{2}, therefore g(x) = frac{x_0 times frac{x_0 - 4}{2} + 2}{x_0 - 2} = frac{1}{2}(x_0 - 2) in (3, 4), so the maximum value of the integer k can be 3.

Therefore, we apply the second case of f(x): fleft(-frac{1}{2}right) = 2^{-frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Next, we determine f(f(9)).

If f(a) geq frac{1}{3}, we consider f(a) > 0, which leads to a > 0; hence, the definition of f(x) gives us f(a) = log_{frac{1}{3}}a. The inequality log_{frac{1}{3}}a geq frac{1}{3} implies a leq (frac{1}{3})^{frac{1}{3}} because the base frac{1}{3} is less than 1, and the function is decreasing.

According to our derived relationship: [ x_2 = 2x_1 ] Therefore, the ratio between the largest root of ( g(x) ) and the largest root of ( f(x) ) is: [ frac{x_2}{x_1} = 2 ] Conclusion: [ boxed{2} ]"},{"prompt":"Fit a triangle (PQR) into a given triangle (ABC).","completion":"The problem requires us to inscribe a triangle ( PQR ) within another triangle ( ABC ), such that the inscribed triangle is congruent to ( ABC ). The given task can be rephrased to: construct a triangle ( XYZ ) inside ( PQR ), where ( XYZ ) is congruent to the given triangle ( ABC ). Let's proceed step-by-step to solve this problem: 1. **Identification of Corresponding Sides**: [ text{Assume } XYZ text{ is such that } XY = AB, XZ = AC, text{ and } YZ = BC. ] 2. **Angle Correspondence**: - Since ( angle PXR = angle BAC ) (let ( X ) be the point on ( PQ )), ( X ) must lie on the arc constructed over segment ( PQ ) enclosing (angle BAC). - Similarly, ( Y ) (point on ( PR )) must lie on the arc over ( PR ) enclosing ( angle ACB ). - By this construction, we ensure ( angle BAC = angle PXR ) and ( angle ACB = angle PRQ ). 3. **Perpendicular Bisectors and Point Construction**: - Let ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) be the centers of the arcs we mentioned. Draw perpendiculars from ( O_1 ) to ( XY ) and from ( O_2 ) to ( YZ ), giving ( O_1 M ) and ( O_2 N ). - Notice ( PM = frac{1}{2} PX ) and ( PN = frac{1}{2} PY ), hence ( MN = frac{1}{2} AB ). 4. **Triangle Construction**: - Construct triangle ( O_1 O_2 M' ) where ( M' ) is intersection point of line ( O_2 N ) and a line parallel to ( XY ) passing through ( O_1 ). This utilizes the given lengths ( O_1 O_2 ), ( O_1 M' = frac{1}{2} AB ), and (angle M' ) being a right angle. This determines positions ( X ) and ( Y ). - Extend the line ( XY ) parallel to ( O_1 M' ) ensuring the line goes through ( P ), and connect ( X ) to ( Q ) and ( Y ) to ( R ). 5. **Verification and Conclusion**: - Finally, since every construction step preserves the congruency of angles and side lengths according to the respective triangles, triangle ( XYZ ) indeed meets the requirement of being congruent to ( ABC ) and properly inscribed within ( PQR ). Due to the geometric constraints, the problem has multiple solutions depending on specific alignments considering ( O_1 O_2 > frac{1}{2} AB ) leads to two solutions, ( O_1 O_2 = frac{1}{2} AB ) leads to one solution, and ( O_1 O_2 < frac{1}{2} AB ) leads to no solution.

Equating Minimum Values and Solving for a - Equating the minimum values of f(x) and g(x): -a{e}^{frac{1-a}{a}}=-{e}^{a-1}. - This leads to the equation a={e}^{a-frac{1}{a}}. - Simplifying, we get a-ln a-frac{1}{a}=0. - Let h(x)=x-ln x-frac{1}{x}, then h′(x)=frac{{x}^{2}-x+1}{{x}^{2}}>0, indicating h(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty). - Since h(1)=0, we conclude a=1. Therefore, the value of a is boxed{1}. # Part (2): Proving {x}_{1} cdot {x}_{2} > -{m}^{2}-m Transforming F(x) - Given F(x)=xf(x)-m=0, we rewrite it as (x^{2}-x)e^{x}-m=0. Analyzing u(x) - Let u(x)=(x^{2}-x)e^{x}, with {u'}left(xright)=(x^{2}+x-1)e^{x}. - For 0<x<frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}, {u'}left(xright) < 0, indicating u(x) is monotonically decreasing. - For frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}<x<1, {u'}left(xright) > 0, indicating u(x) is monotonically increasing. Establishing Bounds for x_1 and x_2 - Assuming x_{1} < x_{2}, we have 0<{x}_{1}<frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}<{x}_{2}<1. Analyzing H(x) and n(x) - Let H(x)=(x-1)e^{x}+1, with {H'}left(xright)=xe^{x}geqslant 0, indicating H(x) is monotonically increasing and H(x)geqslant 0. - Thus, m={x}_{1}f({x}_{1})>{x}_{1}({x}_{1}-1){e}^{{x}_{1}}>-{x}_{1}, leading to x_{1} > -m. - Let n(x)=e^{x}-x-1, with {n'}left(xright)=e^{x}-1geqslant 0, indicating n(x) is monotonically increasing and n(x)geqslant 0. - Therefore, {e}^{{x}_{2}}geq{x}_{2}+1, and since {x}_{2}^{2}+{x}_{2}-1>0, we have m={x}_{2}f({x}_{2})<{x}_{2}-1. Concluding the Proof - From the above, -x_{1} < m < x_{2}-1, leading to x_{2} > m+1. - Therefore, {x}_{1} cdot {x}_{2} > -m cdot (m+1) = -{m}^{2}-m.

Since she has 50 chocolates in total and 5 are not in a box, the number of chocolates in boxes is: 50 chocolates - 5 chocolates (not in a box) = 45 chocolates (in boxes) Now, let's add the 25 pieces of chocolates her friend brought: 45 chocolates (in boxes) + 25 chocolates (brought by friend) = 70 chocolates (total in boxes) We need to determine how many boxes are needed to hold all 70 chocolates. Since we don't know the capacity of each box, we'll assume that each box can hold the same number of chocolates as the boxes Nida already has.

To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of chocolates by the capacity of each box: 70 chocolates / 15 chocolates per box = 4.6667 boxes Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, they will need 5 boxes in total to hold all 70 chocolates.

Thus, assume that not all points are collinear. - Let A, B, and C be three points that are not collinear, hence forming a triangle. 2. **Considering a Fourth Point D:** - According to the problem, in any set of four points A, B, C, and D, there exist three points that are collinear. Since A, B, and C form a triangle (meaning they are not collinear), the three collinear points must include the fourth point D. Without loss of generality, assume these three collinear points are B, C, and D. - Therefore, B, C, and D are collinear, i.e., D lies on the line determined by B and C. 3. **Generalizing Beyond Four Points:** - Now consider another point E from the given 1997 points. We need to show that E must also lie on the same line as B, C, and D. - Consider the points A, B, C, and E. By the given condition, there must be three collinear points among these four. Since A, B, and C form a triangle (not collinear), the three collinear points must include E. Hence E must lie on the line determined by any two of B, C, and D (which are themselves collinear). 4. **Verification with Redundant Cases:** - Assume otherwise, for contradiction, that E was on a different line: - Then neither could the points A, D, C, and E contain three collinear points, nor could the points A, D, B, and E contain three collinear points, both of which contradict the given property that any set of four points has three collinear points. - Therefore, point E must lie on the line through B and C. 5. **Concluding the General Case:** - By iterating this argument, every additional point among the 1997 points, besides the one initial distinct point A which is not collinear with B and C must lie on the same line determined by B and C. - Hence, in total, only one point (A) might be off the line through B and C, and at least 1997 - 1 = 1996 points must be collinear. # Conclusion: boxed{1996}"},{"prompt":"Given nonzero vectors boldsymbol{a} and boldsymbol{b} form an angle of 120^{circ}.

Step 1: Determine the direction of the graph opening. Since the coefficient of x^2 is a=1, which is greater than 0, the graph opens upwards. Step 2: For the vertex to be below the x-axis, the y-coordinate of the vertex must be negative. The vertex of a quadratic function given by y=ax^2+bx+c is at x=-frac{b}{2a}. Plugging in a=1 and b=-4, we get the x-coordinate of the vertex as x=frac{4}{2} = 2. Step 3: To ensure the vertex is below the x-axis, we need the y-coordinate of the vertex to be negative.

We'll consider the circumcircle of triangle ABC. 2. **Define Points:** - Let P and Q be the endpoints of a diameter of the circumcircle that is perpendicular to side AB. - Let M be the point where the perpendicular from O to AC meets AC and N be the point where the perpendicular from O to BC meets BC. - The angles reported are: angle MOA = angle LOA and angle CMO = frac{angle A + angle B}{2}. This sets the groundwork for proving M' = M by showing M and M' share these angle properties. 3. **Intersection Points:** - A' and B' are the points where the lines AO and BO intersect the circumcircle again. - L is the point where QO intersects the circumcircle apart from Q. 4. **Proving Cyclic Quadrilateral:** - Consider quadrilateral AM'O'L. To show it is cyclic, we need to show that angle AM'O = angle AL'O. - Because L and B' share symmetry with respect to O (as Q is on the same side as C with respect to AB), the triangles AML and OB'L must possess reflective symmetry over QO. 5. **Angles and Symmetry:** - Given POQ is a diameter, QO must be perpendicular to AB by construction. - Trapezoids with bases perpendicular to a diameter hold the cyclic property, ALOB confirms OA' equals to OB'. 6. **Show M' = M:** - Since angle M'OA = angle LOA, we can use angle B'/2 to further segment parallel subtended arcs. - The quadrilateral introduces a cyclic nature due to supplementary interior opposite angles, thus with angle M'OA = frac{1}{2}(angle A + angle B), raising proof symmetric cylic quadrilateral results match. 7. **Final Conclusion:** - Using reflective symmetry and angles measured from standardized centers, the point intersection path proves M' = M leading us to M' traverses the cyclic shape denoting N'=N.

The perpendicular bisector of side AB intersects the diagonal AC at point P. Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of side CD intersects the diagonal BD at point Q. 3. Since triangles ABP and DQC are isosceles, the angles angle ABP and angle BAP are equal. Similarly, angle CDQ and angle DCQ are equal because the triangles are symmetric around their respective perpendicular bisectors. Thus, we can write: [ angle ABP = angle BAP ] and [ angle CDQ = angle DCQ ] 4. Consider the external angles angle BPC and angle CQB. These are external angles to triangles ABP and DQC respectively. By the properties of isosceles triangles, the exterior angle is the sum of the remote interior angles: [ angle BPC = angle ABP + angle BAP ] and [ angle CQB = angle CDQ + angle DCQ ] 5. Since ABCD is an inscribed quadrilateral, opposite angles uphold the cyclic quadrilateral property where angle D = 180^circ - angle B and angle C = 180^circ - angle A. Thus, the angles subtended by the same chord are equal: [ angle D = angle B ] and similarly: [ angle C = angle A ] 6. Now, consider the cyclic nature and properties of the angles surrounding points Q and P. Since angle BPC = angle CQB, points B, C, Q, P lie on a common circle.

Label the vertices of one face (A, B, C, D) in such a way that: [ text{Diagonals: } AC text{ and } BD ] Apply the same methodology to the opposite face (E, F, G, H) where each vertex corresponds to the directly opposite vertex in the original face: [ text{Diagonals: } EG text{ and } FH ] 3. **Counting the Diagonals per Vertex:** We need to count the number of diagonals meeting at each vertex.

By doing an exhaustive check, one establishes that **only two vertices in a cube** have three diagonals emanating from them, while the other six vertices have only one diagonal each. 4. **Coloring and Symmetry Considerations:** Now, consider the coloring possibilities.

The cross-ratio of four complex numbers z_1, z_2, z_3, and z_4 is often denoted as [z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4] and, in general, provides invariance under Möbius transformations, which preserve circularity. 1. **Understand the Cross-ratio**: The cross-ratio is defined as: [ [z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4] = frac{(z_1 - z_3)(z_2 - z_4)}{(z_1 - z_4)(z_2 - z_3)} ] To prove concyclicity, we need to show that this value is a real number. 2. **Argument Representation**: Consider the argument of the cross-ratio. The argument, often denoted as arg, of a complex number z = a+bi is given by arg(z) = theta, where z = re^{itheta} (with r being the modulus and theta the phase/argument). The argument of a product of complex numbers is the sum of the arguments.

Given an equal division, the weights will cancel out due to the even distribution. Therefore, Petya's coin must be genuine since the imbalance (if it were counterfeit) would have resulted in a detectable difference. - If the weights are different, the scale will indicate a difference. The critical point here is to observe whether the difference is an even or odd number of grams. - **Even Difference**: If the weight difference between the two groups is an even number, it indicates that the imbalance caused by the counterfeit coins is uniformly distributed. Therefore, Petya's coin did not alter the balance, indicating it is genuine. - **Odd Difference**: If the weight difference is an odd number, it implies that one group's weight is altering by an odd gram amount. This can only happen if an additional counterfeit coin (Petya's coin) is contributing to the weight difference, indicating it is counterfeit. # Conclusion: Based on the above steps, Petya can determine whether his coin is genuine or counterfeit using a single weighing procedure by checking whether the difference in weights of the two groups is even or odd.

Therefore: [ f(x) = sin |x| = sin x ] So, for ( x geq 0 ), the graph of ( f(x) ) is the same as the graph of ( y = sin x ). 4. **Graph for Negative ( x )**: Because the function is even, the part of the graph for ( x leq 0 ) is a mirror image of the graph for ( x geq 0 ) across the ( y )-axis. 5. **Conclusion**: The complete graph of ( f(x) = sin |x| ) is obtained by combining the graphs for ( x geq 0 ) and ( x leq 0 ). The graphical representation is symmetric about the ( y )-axis and mirrors the sine function in the right half of the plane: [ boxed{text{The graph of } f(x) = sin |x| text{ is shown to be symmetric about the y-axis with the right half resembling } y = sin x text{.}} ] ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_22_7ef2114a321cf223ba99g-026.jpg?height=299&width=707&top_left_y=98&top_left_x=227)"},{"prompt":"Let (a > 0) and (a neq 1), and the function (f(x) = a^{x} + x^{2} xln a a).

Let's consider the possible positions for A and B: - A is the first runner, B is the second runner. - A is the second runner, B is the third runner. - A is the third runner, B is the fourth runner. This results in 3 different ways that A and B can be arranged. 2.

We need to consider S(n) in terms of pairs of terms from left to right. Each pair is structured as follows: [ (i) - (i+1) = -1 ] for some positive whole number i. Given the pattern of the series, we can then form expressions based on the parity (even or odd) of n. 2. **Case when n is even:** For even n, every term will be part of a pair. Thus, we can express S(n) as follows: [ S(n) = (-1) times left(frac{n}{2}right) = frac{-n}{2} ] 3. **Case when n is odd:** For odd n, all terms except for the last one are part of a pair. The last term, being positive due to the alternating sign nature, needs to be added separately. Hence, we have: [ S(n) = (-1) times left(frac{n-1}{2}right) + n = frac{n+1}{2} ] 4. To solve the equation S(a) + S(b) + S(a+b) =1, we analyze three different scenarios: **(i) Both a and b are even:** If a and b are both even, then a+b is also even.

We analyze this based on the parity of n (whether n is odd or even): - If n is odd, then n-1 is even, making (a-b)^{n-1} geq 0. Since a and b are positive, (a+b)^{n-1} > 0, so their sum cannot be zero. Thus, this scenario is also impossible. - If n is even, then n-1 is odd. In this case, if (a-b)^{n-1} + (a+b)^{n-1} = 0, then we get (a+b)^{n-1}=(b-a)^{n-1}. This implies a+b=-(a-b) which leads to a=0, contradicting the fact that a and b are positive numbers. 8.

For example, paths like N,N,N,E,E,E,S,N can be arranged in binom{8}{3,3,1,1} = frac{8!}{3!3!1!1!} = 560 ways.

The given equation becomes: [ frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{d} + frac{b}{a} + frac{d}{c} = 3n ] 2. **Combine Fractions**: To combine the fractions, we find a common denominator: [ frac{ad + bc + bd + ac}{bd} = 3n ] Multiplying both sides by ( bd ) gives: [ ad + bc + frac{bd}{a} + frac{ac}{d} = 3nbd ] 3. **Clear Denominators**: Multiply through by ( abcd ) to clear the denominators: [ (a^2 + b^2)cd + (c^2 + d^2)ab = 3nabcd ] 4. **Divisibility Argument**: From the equation ((a^2 + b^2)cd + (c^2 + d^2)ab = 3nabcd), we can infer that ( ab ) must divide ( cd ) and ( cd ) must divide ( ab ). This implies: [ ab = cd ] 5. **Modulo 3 Analysis**: Consider the equation modulo 3. Since ( ab = cd ), we have: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 3nab ] Since ( 3n ) is a multiple of 3, ( 3nab ) is also a multiple of 3. Therefore, ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ) must be a multiple of 3. 6. **Possible Values Modulo 3**: The squares of integers modulo 3 are either 0 or 1. Therefore, ( a^2, b^2, c^2, ) and ( d^2 ) can each be 0 or 1 modulo 3. The sum ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ) can thus be 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3. 7. **Contradiction**: Since ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 equiv 0, 1, text{ or } 2 pmod{3} ), it cannot be a multiple of 3 unless all terms are 0 modulo 3. However, this would imply that ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) are all multiples of 3, which contradicts the assumption that ( (a, b) ) and ( (c, d) ) are coprime pairs.

Are the following assertions true? 1. The sum of the edges AE, BE, and CE is less than the sum of the edges AD, BD, and CD. 2. At least one of the edges AE, BE, CE is shorter than the corresponding edge AD, BD, CD. --- **Solution:** 1. **First Assertion Analysis:** **Assertion:** The sum of the edges AE, BE, and CE is less than the sum of the edges AD, BD, and CD. To show that this assertion is not necessarily true, consider two points D_1 and E_1 inside the triangle ABC such that the sum of the distances from D_1 to the vertices A, B, and C is less than the sum of the distances from E_1 to the vertices A, B, and C. Let us choose point D sufficiently close to D_1 so that the sum of distances from D to the vertices A, B, and C remains less than the sum of distances from E_1 to the vertices A, B, and C. Now, choose point E inside the pyramid ABCD on the perpendicular dropped from E_1 to the plane ABC. Hence, the assertion that the sum of the edges AE, BE, and CE is less than the sum of the edges AD, BD, and CD is not always true. 2. **Second Assertion Analysis:** **Assertion:** At least one of the edges AE, BE, CE is shorter than the corresponding edge AD, BD, CD. **Proof:** Let's denote by M the intersection point of the straight line DE with the plane ABC. It is evident that M lies inside the triangle ABC. The straight lines AM, BM, and CM divide the plane of triangle ABC into six parts. Let's consider the projection of point D onto the plane ABC as the point D_1, which is located in one of these six parts. Depending on where D_1 is situated, one of the angles widehat{D_1MA}, widehat{D_1MB}, or widehat{D_1MC} will be obtuse. Without loss of generality, assume that the angle widehat{D_1MA} is obtuse, then widehat{DMA} will also be obtuse, implying that widehat{DEA} is obtuse. Consequently, we have |DE| < |DA|. This concludes that at least one of the edges AE, BE, CE is shorter than the corresponding edges AD, BD, CD. Therefore, the second assertion is true. # Conclusion: 1.

We'll calculate the growth for each month and add it to his height. Starting with the 4th month, the growth is: 4th month: 2 inches * 110% = 2.2 inches For the 5th month, the growth is 10% more than the 4th month: 5th month: 2.2 inches * 110% = 2.42 inches We continue this pattern for the remaining months. However, to simplify the calculation, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series since the growth each month is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 1.10 (or 110%). The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula: S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) Where: S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, r is the common ratio, n is the number of terms. In this case: a = 2.2 inches (the growth in the 4th month), r = 1.10 (the growth rate increases by 10% each month), n = 9 (the number of months after the initial 3 months). Let's calculate the sum of the growth for the remaining 9 months: S = 2.2 inches * (1 - (1.10)^9) / (1 - 1.10) First, we calculate (1.10)^9: (1.10)^9 ≈ 2.35794769 Now we can calculate S: S = 2.2 inches * (1 - 2.35794769) / (1 - 1.10) S = 2.2 inches * (-1.35794769) / (-0.10) S ≈ 2.2 inches * 13.5794769 S ≈ 29.87484918 inches Adding this to John's height after the first 3 months: 72 inches + 29.87484918 inches ≈ 101.87484918 inches Finally, we convert John's height from inches to meters.

We need to prove that it is possible to return all cards to their correct places while paying no more than sum_{i=1}^n |a_i - i| rubles. 2. **Introducing an arbitrary arrangement**: Consider an arbitrary arrangement of cards (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n), where b_i is the number on the card in the i-th cell.

We need to partition ( A ) into two subsets with equal product. Let's denote these subsets as ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ). 3. **Prime factor consideration**: Notice that if ( n ) is large enough, the set ( A ) will contain multiple prime numbers. Specifically, consider the primes 1997 and 1999. Since 1997 and 1999 are primes, they will appear uniquely in the set ( A ) unless ( n ) is such that ( n ) or ( n+5 ) is a multiple of 1997 or 1999. 4. **Uniqueness of prime multiples**: If ( A ) contains a unique multiple of 1997, then only one of the subsets ( S_1 ) or ( S_2 ) can contain this multiple. This would make the product of the elements in ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) unequal, which is a contradiction. The same argument applies to the prime 1999. 5. **Product of the set ( A )**: If ( A ) can be partitioned into two subsets with equal product, then the product of all elements in ( A ) must be a perfect square. Let's denote the product of all elements in ( A ) as ( P ). Then, ( P = n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)(n+5) ). 6. **Modulo 1999 consideration**: Since ( A ) contains a unique multiple of 1999, the product ( P ) modulo 1999 must be congruent to ( 1998! mod 1999 ). By Wilson's theorem, we know that ( 1998! equiv -1 pmod{1999} ). 7. **Contradiction**: If ( P ) is a perfect square, then ( P equiv a^2 pmod{1999} ) for some integer ( a ). However, ( -1 ) is not a quadratic residue modulo 1999 because ( left(frac{-1}{1999}right) = (-1)^{(1999-1)/2} = -1 ). This is a contradiction. 8. **Conclusion**: Since we have reached a contradiction, our initial assumption that such an ( n ) exists must be false. Therefore, there are no positive integers ( n ) such that the set ( {n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5} ) can be partitioned into two subsets with equal product.

The equation of the circle can then be written as x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 2^2 or x^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 4. To find the length of the chord intercepted by the circle on the y-axis, we substitute x = 0 into the circle's equation to find the y-intercepts. This gives us (y - 1)^2 = 4, which simplifies to: y - 1 = 2 or y - 1 = -2 Solving for y, we have the two solutions: y = 3 or y = -1 These are the y-coordinates of the endpoints of the chord.

We are also given that (angle ANM = angle CKM). We need to prove that triangle (ABC) is isosceles. 2. **Using Complex Numbers**: Let the incircle be the unit circle in the complex plane. We can represent the vertices and points of tangency as complex numbers: [ A = a, quad B = b, quad C = c, quad K = k, quad N = n, quad M = m ] Since the points (K), (N), and (M) lie on the unit circle, we have (|k| = |n| = |m| = 1). 3. **Expressing Vertices in Terms of Tangency Points**: Using the properties of the tangency points, we can express the vertices (A), (B), and (C) as: [ a = frac{2km}{k + m}, quad b = frac{2kn}{k + n}, quad c = frac{2mn}{m + n} ] 4. **Given Angle Condition**: The given condition is (angle ANM = angle CKM). This implies that the cross-ratio of the points ((A, N; M, infty)) is real and equal to the cross-ratio of the points ((C, K; M, infty)). Mathematically, this can be written as: [ frac{frac{a - n}{m - n}}{frac{c - k}{m - k}} in mathbb{R} ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{(a - n)(m - k)}{(m - n)(c - k)} = overline{left(frac{(a - n)(m - k)}{(m - n)(c - k)}right)} ] 5. **Using Conjugates**: Since (k), (m), and (n) lie on the unit circle, their conjugates are (overline{k} = frac{1}{k}), (overline{m} = frac{1}{m}), and (overline{n} = frac{1}{n}). We can use these properties to simplify the expression: [ frac{(a - n)(m - k)}{(m - n)(c - k)} = frac{n(m - k)}{k(m - n)} ] 6. **Substituting Expressions for (a) and (c)**: Substitute (a = frac{2km}{k + m}) and (c = frac{2mn}{m + n}) into the equation: [ frac{frac{2km}{k + m} - n}{frac{2mn}{m + n} - k} = frac{(m + n)(2n - m - k)}{(m + k)(2k - m - n)} ] 7. **Simplifying the Equation**: After simplifying, we get: [ 4k^2m - 2km^2 - 2kmn - 2k^2n + kmn + kn^2 - 2kmn + m^2n + mn^2 = 4mn^2 - 2m^2n - 2kmn - 2kmn + km^2 + k^2m - 2kn^2 + kmn + k^2n ] This simplifies to: [ sum_{text{cyc}} km(k - m) = 0 ] 8. **Conclusion**: The equation ((k - m)(m - n)(n - k) = 0) implies that at least one of the pairs (k = m), (k = n), or (m = n) must be true. This indicates that at least two of the tangency points coincide, which implies that triangle (ABC) is isosceles.

[P(r)mid Q(r) iff f(P)(r)mid f(Q)(r).] (We define a|b if and only if b=za for some integer z . In particular, 0|0 .) *Proposed by the4seasons.*","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find all functions ( f: mathbb{Z}[x] rightarrow mathbb{Z}[x] ) such that for any two polynomials ( P, Q ) with integer coefficients and any integer ( r ), the following statement holds: [ P(r) mid Q(r) iff f(P)(r) mid f(Q)(r). ] Here, ( mathbb{Z}[x] ) represents the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients. 2. **Initial Observations:** - If ( P(r) mid Q(r) ), then ( f(P)(r) mid f(Q)(r) ) must hold for all ( r in mathbb{Z} ). - Conversely, if ( f(P)(r) mid f(Q)(r) ), then ( P(r) mid Q(r) ) must hold for all ( r in mathbb{Z} ). 3. **Lemma:** Let ( P, Q in mathbb{Z}[x] ) such that ( P(n) mid Q(n) ) for infinitely many ( n in mathbb{Z} ). Then ( frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} in mathbb{Q}[x] ). **Proof of Lemma:** Suppose otherwise. By the division algorithm, we can write: [ frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = A(x) + frac{B(x)}{Q(x)} ] for some ( A(x), B(x) in mathbb{Z}[x] ) with ( B notequiv 0 ) and ( deg B < deg Q ). By picking some ( M ) such that ( MA(x) in mathbb{Z}[x] ), we get: [ frac{MB(n)}{Q(n)} in mathbb{Z} ] for infinitely many ( n ). This is impossible for large ( |n| ) due to size reasons. Hence, the lemma is proved. (blacksquare) 4. **Key Fact:** [ |P(n)| = |Q(n)| iff |f(P)(n)| = |f(Q)(n)| ] **Proof of Key Fact:** Swap ( P ) and ( Q ). This implies that if ( f(P) equiv f(Q) ), then ( |P| equiv |Q| ), i.e., ( f ) is \\"pseudo-injective\\". 5. **Finding ( f(0) ):** Suppose ( f(0) ) is nonzero. Then ( P(n) mid 0 implies f(P)(n) mid f(0)(n) ) for all ( n ). This implies ( deg f(P) leq deg f(0) ) for all ( P ). Pick ( k = deg P + 1 ) integers ( x_0, ldots, x_k ) such that ( f(0)(x_i) neq 0 ). Each ( f(P)(x_i) ) can only attain finitely many values. By Lagrange interpolation, ( f(P) ) can only equal finitely many integer polynomials, contradicting pseudo-injectivity since ( |mathbb{Z}[x]| = infty ). Thus, ( f(0) equiv 0 ). 6. **Integer Roots:** The integer roots of ( f(P) ) are the same as those of ( P ). If ( P(r) = 0 ), then ( 0 mid P(r) implies 0 mid f(P)(r) ), and the reverse follows similarly. 7. **Factoring Out ( f(1) ):** For any polynomial ( P ), we have ( f(1) mid f(P) ). Note that ( f(1) ) has no integer roots, so we may factor it out and suppose ( f(1) ) is constant. For all ( k ) and ( c ), we have ( f(k)(n) mid f(x-c)(n) ) whenever ( n equiv c pmod{k} ). Hence, ( f(k) mid f(x-c) ) in the polynomial sense. 8. **Degree of ( f(k) ):** Suppose some ( k ) has ( deg f(k) > 0 ). Let ( A in mathbb{Z}[x] ) denote its primitive part. Then ( frac{f(x-c)}{A} ) should be an integer polynomial by Gauss' lemma. But then: [ (c+1) - c = 1 implies |f(1)(c+1)| = |f(x-c)(c+1)| implies A(c+1) mid f(1), ] which is absurd as ( f(1) notequiv 0 ). Hence, ( f(k) ) is identically constant. 9. **Form of ( f(x) ):** Note that ( i mid j implies f(i) mid f(j) ) (in the integer sense). Also, ( |f(i)(i)| = |f(x)(i)| ), so ( i mid j implies f(x)(i) mid f(x)(j) ). In particular, ( frac{f(x)(2n)}{f(x)(n)} ) is an integer for all ( n neq 0 ). It must be identically constant. If ( r in mathbb{C} ) is a root of ( f(x) ), so is ( 2r ). Iterating this implies that ( f(x) ) has infinitely many roots (impossible) unless its roots are all ( 0 ), i.e., ( f(x) ) is of the form ( cx^d ). Hence, ( f(n) equiv pm cn^d ) for some fixed ( c, d ). By pseudo-injectivity, ( d geq 1 ), and from ( n = 1 ), it follows that ( c in mathbb{Z} ). 10. **Final Form of ( f(P) ):** For any ( P in mathbb{Z}[x] ) and ( n in mathbb{Z} ), we should have: [ |f(P)(n)| = |f(P(n))(n)| implies f(P)(n) = pm cP(n)^d, ] so ( f(P) equiv pm cP(n)^d ). Multiplying the primitive part of ( f(1) ) back in, we obtain the advertised solution set.

For which position of point ( M ) is the length of segment ( P'Q' ) minimal?","completion":"Step-by-Step Approach 1. **Construct the Desired Circle:** - Consider the circle with diameter PQ. - By definition, the diameter of the circle is the line segment passing through the center and touching the circle at two points P and Q. 2. **Intersection with the Line ( l ):** - Check if this circle intersects the line ( l ). - If the intersections exist, denote the points of intersection as M_1 and M_2. 3. **Condition on Intersection Points:** - If the circle intersects the line ( l ), at any of the intersection points (M_1 or M_2), we have that P' coincides with Q'. This is because both P and Q lie on the circle, making the altitude from P (i.e., PP') and from Q (i.e., QQ') fall directly onto the line itself, creating the situation where P' = Q'. - Therefore, in this case, the length of segment P'Q' would be 0. 4. **No Intersection Case:** - If the circle does not intersect the line l, then the angle angle PMQ is acute for any point M on the line l. - Given this, angle P'PQ' = 90^circ pm angle PMQ, a variation depending on the placement of M. 5. **Determining Minimal P'Q':** - To ensure minimum length of the chord P'Q', the approach is to maximize angle PMQ. - The maximum possible value for angle PMQ happens when M is such that the circle defined through P and Q touches the line l. This is due to coinciding maximal subtended angles of a chord that passes through the extremes of a circle. 6. **Finding Tangent Points:** - To determine point M precisely, draw circles through points P and Q that tangentially touch the line l. - The points of tangency (where the circles touch the line l) are the optimal placements for point M to achieve the goal. 7. **Conclusion:** - From our considerations, placing point M at the intersection points (when a circle overlaps) or choosing the tangent point ensures minimization of P'Q'. Thus, the required point M is found by checking the described geometric constructions, ensuring angle PMQ is maximized or angle P'PQ' = 90^circ: boxed{M text{ is a point where the circle with diameter } PQ text{ intersects or tangentially touches line } l.}"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = ln x ax has its tangent line l at x=2 parallel to the line x+2y3=0.

Let's denote the center of the large circle as O and the center of one of the small circles as C. When we draw lines overline{OA} and overline{OB} tangent to one of the small circles at points A and B, respectively, we observe that due to the symmetry of the configuration, angle AOB = 120^{circ} and angle AOC = 60^{circ}. 2. **Triangle Properties**: Given that angle AOC = 60^{circ}, we can deduce that triangle AOC is a 30-60-90 right triangle. In such a triangle, the sides are in a specific ratio. If the shorter leg (opposite the 30-degree angle) is AC=1, then the longer leg (opposite the 60-degree angle) can be found using the ratio, which leads to OC = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} times AC. 3. **Calculate OC**: Substituting AC=1 into the formula, we get OC = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} times 1 = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}. 4. **Find the Radius of the Large Circle**: To find the radius of the large circle, we need to consider the distance from O to D, where D is a point on the circumference of the large circle that passes through C. The radius OD is the sum of OC and the radius of the small circle, CD, which is 1. Therefore, OD = CD + OC = 1 + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}. 5. **Simplify the Expression**: Simplifying the expression for OD, we get OD = frac{3}{3} + frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{3 + 2sqrt{3}}{3}.

This case is trivial because there is only one point, and we can simply color it either red or white. Therefore, the condition is trivially satisfied. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for any set of ( k ) points, where ( 1 le k le n-1 ), we can color the points such that for any line ( L ) parallel to one of the coordinate axes, the number of red points and the number of white points differ by at most 1. 3. **Inductive Step:** Consider a set ( T ) of ( n ) points. We need to show that we can color these ( n ) points by the criteria stated. - If there exists a point ( P in T ) such that a line ( l ) which is parallel to an axis contains ( P ) and no other points in ( T ), then ( T setminus {P} ) is a set of ( n-1 ) points. By the inductive hypothesis, we can color ( T setminus {P} ) to satisfy the condition. We can then color ( P ) such that the condition is still satisfied for the entire set ( T ). 4. **General Case:** Suppose no such point ( P ) exists, meaning every line parallel to an axis that contains any point of ( T ) contains at least one additional point. We can start with an arbitrary point ( P_0 in T ). This implies the existence of a sequence of points ( P_0, P_1, P_2, ldots ) such that ( P_k P_{k+1} ) is parallel to the ( x )-axis for even ( k ) and parallel to the ( y )-axis for odd ( k ). - Eventually, we will encounter a pair of integers ( (r, s) ) with the same parity (both even or both odd) such that the lines ( P_r P_{r+1} ) and ( P_s P_{s+1} ) coincide. Therefore, we get a closed polygonal line ( P_{r+1}, P_{r+2}, ldots, P_s, P_{r+1} ). 5. **Coloring the Polygonal Line:** Since this polygonal line has an even number of vertices, we can alternate the colors of the vertices starting with either color at ( P_{r+1} ). 6. **Application to the Rest of Set:** After coloring the vertices on this polygonal line as described, we apply the induction hypothesis to the remaining points in set ( T ) to ensure they are colored such that the condition holds overall. The induction step confirms that the property holds for ( n ) points as well, completing the induction. (blacksquare) **Second Solution:** 1. **Consider Lines Parallel to Axes:** Let ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_k ) be the points lying on a line ( l ) parallel to one of the coordinate axes. 2. **Drawing Segments:** - Draw segments joining ( P_1 ) with ( P_2 ), ( P_3 ) with ( P_4 ), and generally ( P_{2i-1} ) with ( P_{2i} ) for all such points. - This will partition the points into pairs. 3. **Form Polygonal Lines:** - Performing this segment drawing for all lines parallel to the axes results in a set of polygonal lines. 4. **Coloring Polygonal Lines:** - If one of these polygonal lines is closed (forms a loop), it must have an even number of vertices. - Color the vertices on each of the polygonal lines alternately, starting with either color at any vertex. 5. **Isolated Points:** - If a point does not belong to any of these polygonal lines, it can be colored arbitrarily.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the triangle formed by line AC, the perpendicular height from A to BC, and the maximum length line segment: - Let h be the height from A to BC, using the area of triangle formula, A = frac{1}{2} times BC times h = frac{1}{2} times 7 times h.

This means that at point (m,n), both the line and the curve share the same x and y values, as well as the same slope. 2. **Find the Derivative of the Curve**: The derivative of y=ln(x+b) with respect to x is y'=frac{1}{x+b}. This derivative represents the slope of the tangent to the curve at any point (x, y). 3. **Set Up Equations from Given Conditions**: Since the slope of the line y=x-2a is 1, and it is tangent to the curve at (m,n), we equate the slope of the tangent to the curve at (m,n) to 1. Thus, we have frac{1}{m+b}=1. 4. **Express n in Two Ways**: From the equation of the line, we have n=m-2a. From the equation of the curve, we have n=ln(m+b). Equating these two expressions for n gives us two equations in terms of m, a, and b. 5. **Solve for m, a, and b**: Solving the equations, we find that n=0, which implies m=2a. Substituting m=2a into m+b=1 (from frac{1}{m+b}=1), we get 2a+b=1. 6. **Find the Minimum Value of frac{1}{a}+frac{2}{b}**: We multiply frac{1}{a}+frac{2}{b} by (2a+b), which is equal to 1, to get (frac{1}{a}+frac{2}{b})(2a+b)=4+frac{b}{a}+frac{4a}{b}.

This implies that ( P_a, P_b, P_c ) are collinear and lie on the Simson line. - Since ( H ) lies on the Simson line, it follows that ( H ) is also on the line ( P_aP_bP_c ). 4. **Cyclic Quadrilaterals**: - Reflecting ( P_cH ) in ( AB ) results in ( AH_cPB ) being cyclic. Reflecting back, we get ( BP_cHA ) cyclic. - Similarly, ( CP_aHB ) and ( AP_bHC ) are cyclic. 5. **Inversion**: - Consider an inversion ( phi_P ) centered at ( P ) with unit radius. In this inverted diagram: - ( triangle ABC ) becomes a line parallel to ( ell ). - ( P_a ) becomes the center of ( (PBC) ) and ( X_a ) is the intersection of ( (PBC) ) with ( ell ). - Analogous results hold for ( P_b ) and ( P_c ). 6. **Intersection Points in Inverted Diagram**: - ( Q_a ) is the intersection of ( (PP_bX_b) ) and ( (PP_cX_c) ). - Similarly, ( Q_b ) and ( Q_c ) are defined. 7. **Tangency Condition**: - We need to show that the circumcircle of ( triangle Q_aQ_bQ_c ) is tangent to ( Gamma ). - Consider the cyclic quadrilaterals ( (PP_aP_bP_cH) ), ( (P_cABH) ), ( (P_bACH) ), and ( (P_aBCH) ). - Let ( N ) be the intersection of ( (PP_aP_bP_cH) ) with ( ell ). 8. **Symmetry and Reflection**: - The lines ( AX_a ), ( BX_b ), and ( CX_c ) share a common midpoint ( M ), which is the center of symmetry. - Reflect ( H ) and ( N ) in ( M ) to get ( H' ) and ( N' ). 9. **Cyclic and Tangency Proof**: - We claim that ( Q_aQ_bQ_cH'N' ) is cyclic and tangent to ( Gamma ) at ( N' ). - By symmetry, ( angle X_cQ_aX_b = angle X_cH'X_b ), so ( Q_a = (PP_cX_c) cap (X_cH'X_b) ). 10. **Final Tangency Condition**: - It suffices to prove that ( (PP_cX_c) ), ( (X_cH'X_b) ), and the circle through ( N', K' ) tangent to ( Gamma ) concur. - By reflecting the problem in ( M ), it reduces to proving that ( (P'P_c'C) ), ( (CHB) ), and the circle through ( N, K ) tangent to ( ell ) concur. 11. **Conclusion**: - By the above steps and symmetry arguments, we conclude that the circumcircle of ( triangle Q_aQ_bQ_c ) is tangent to ( Gamma ).

Firstly, let's break down the numerator and denominator separately: 1. **Numerator**: sin 2alpha + 1 can be rewritten using the double angle formula for sine, sin 2alpha = 2sin alpha cos alpha. Since tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} = 2, we have sin 2alpha = 2 times 2 = 4. Thus, the numerator becomes 4 + 1 = 5. 2. **Denominator**: cos^4 alpha - sin^4 alpha can be factored using the difference of squares formula, a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). Applying this, we get (cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha)(cos^2 alpha + sin^2 alpha). The second term simplifies to 1 due to the Pythagorean identity, leaving us with cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha. 3. **Simplification**: We now have frac{5}{cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha}. Using the double angle formula for cosine, cos 2alpha = cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha, we can rewrite the denominator as cos 2alpha. 4. **Further Simplification**: Given tan alpha = 2, we can express sin alpha and cos alpha in terms of tan alpha. Since tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} = 2, we can assume sin alpha = 2k and cos alpha = k for some k. Using the Pythagorean identity, sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1, we find 4k^2 + k^2 = 1, leading to k^2 = frac{1}{5}, so k = frac{1}{sqrt{5}}. Thus, sin alpha = frac{2}{sqrt{5}} and cos alpha = frac{1}{sqrt{5}}. 5. **Final Calculation**: Substituting sin alpha and cos alpha back into the expression frac{sin 2alpha + 1}{cos^4 alpha - sin^4 alpha}, we get frac{(sin alpha + cos alpha)^{2}}{(cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha)(cos^2 alpha + sin^2 alpha)} = frac{cos alpha + sin alpha}{cos alpha - sin alpha} = frac{1 + tan alpha}{1 - tan alpha} = frac{1 + 2}{1 - 2} = -3.

Then, [ frac{1}{3} times frac{9sqrt{3}}{4} times h = frac{9sqrt{3}}{4} ] Solving for ( h ): [ h = 3 ] 3. **Relating ( h ) to the Radius ( R ) of the Sphere:** We know that ( h = R + sqrt{R^2 - 3} ) from the height relation in terms of ( R ): [ R + sqrt{R^2 - 3} leqslant 3 ] Squaring both sides of ( sqrt{R^2 - 3} leqslant 3 - R ): [ R^2 - 3 leqslant (3 - R)^2 ] Simplifying, we get: [ R^2 - 3 leqslant 9 - 6R + R^2 ] [ -3 leqslant 9 - 6R ] [ 6R leqslant 12 ] [ R leqslant 2 ] 4. **Finding the Surface Area:** The maximum value of ( R ) that gives the maximal volume is ( 2 ).

We need to determine all counterfeit coins using only two weighings on a balance scale. Let's denote the positions of the coins as (1, 2, ldots, 9). First Method: 1. **Step 1: First Weighing:** Weigh coin 1 against coin 4. There are two possible outcomes: - If they weigh the same, both coins are genuine. - If they weigh differently, the heavier coin is counterfeit. 2. **Step 2: Analyzing the First Weighing Outcome:** - **Case 1: Coins 1 and 4 weigh the same:** Since 1 and 4 are genuine, proceed to weigh coins 2 and 3 in the second weighing. - If coins 2 and 3 weigh the same, both are genuine. Hence, coins 3 and 4 are two adjacent genuine coins. - If one is heavier, say coin 2, then coin 2 is counterfeit. Consequently, coins 1, 3, and 4 are genuine. Further, due to the arrangement rule, coins 5, 7, and 9 are also genuine. The counterfeit coins must then be 2, 6, 8, and one remaining identified by further reasoning. - **Case 2: Coins 1 and 4 weigh differently:** Assume coin 4 is heavier (counterfeit). Then, coins 1, 3, and 5 are genuine, and coin 2 is counterfeit. Weigh coins 6 and 9 in the second weighing. - If coins 6 and 9 weigh the same, then coins 7 and 8 are genuine. - If one is heavier, then determine the heavier as counterfeit and follow through the remaining process. Alternative methods: **Second Method: Dividing into Groups:** 1. **Step 1: Grouping Coins** Divide the coins into three groups: {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8}, and {3, 6, 9}. 2. **Step 2: First Weighing:** Weigh group {1, 4, 7} against {2, 5, 8}. - If there is a balance, then the counterfeit coins are in {3, 6, 9}. - If there is imbalance, the heavier group contains two counterfeit coins. 3. **Step 3: Second Weighing:** Weigh two coins from the identified heavier group or the imbalanced group. By consistently applying these steps and analytical reasoning, one can determine the counterfeit coins. **Third Method: Splitting Coins into Different Groups:** 1. **Step 1: Different Grouping:** Group coins by {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, and {7, 8, 9}. 2. **Step 2: Weigh the Groups:** Weigh {1, 2, 3} against {4, 5, 6}: - Balance means the heavier group lies in {7, 8, 9}. - Imbalance means the heavier group contains counterfeits. Continue this process to isolate the two counterfeit coins. # Conclusion The detailed steps in analyzing the group weights and applying logical deductions based on the given constraints of no adjacent counterfeit coins allow us to determine the counterfeit coins in just two weighings.

Therefore, the total score of ( A ) is: [ text{Score}(A) = n cdot 2n + n cdot 2n + n cdot 2n = 6n^2 ] - In sequence ( B ), all ( a )'s are at the end, so they have no ( b )'s or ( c )'s to their right, all ( b )'s are in the middle with ( n ) ( c )'s to the left and ( n ) ( a )'s to the right, and all ( c )'s are at the beginning with no ( a )'s or ( b )'s to their left. Therefore, the total score of ( B ) is: [ text{Score}(B) = 0 ] 4. **Score reduction per swap:** Each swap can decrease the score by at most 2. This is because a swap can only affect the relative positions of two adjacent letters, and thus can only change the score contribution of these two letters. 5. **Minimum number of swaps:** To transform ( A ) into ( B ), the score must decrease from ( 6n^2 ) to 0. Since each swap decreases the score by at most 2, the minimum number of swaps required is: [ frac{6n^2}{2} = 3n^2 ] 6. **Conclusion for any chameleon ( X ):** If we have ( A rightarrow cdots rightarrow X rightarrow cdots rightarrow B ) with ( p ) swaps to transform ( A ) to ( X ) and ( q ) swaps to transform ( X ) to ( B ), then: [ p + q geq 3n^2 ] Thus, at least one of ( p ) or ( q ) must be at least ( frac{3n^2}{2} ).

All measurements and calculations were correct. Explain this paradox.","completion":"1. Determine the two different quantities being measured: The instruments are measuring the diameter of the polar bear's circular path on the moving ice floe relative to the Earth, and the photograph captures the diameter of the path relative to the ice floe itself. 2. Understand the working frame of references: The circular path viewed by the rescuers differs from the one in the photograph due to their respective frames of reference—the rescuers measure the path in a stationary Earth frame, while the photograph captures the path as it appears on the moving ice floe. 3. Recognize the effect of the bear’s movement: The ice floe floats in still water and begins to move when the bear walks on it. The bear’s walking generates force that propels the ice and affects the recorded path's radius. 4. Calculate the center of mass: Both the bear and the ice floe, together considered as a system, revolve around their common center of mass. 5. Derive the variable radii: The discrepancy in measurements indicates that, because the bear and the ice floe move relative to one another, the ice floe must be moving in response to the bear's steps. This is apparent by comparing the measured 8.5 meters diameter in the helicopter’s frame and the 9 meters diameter from the photograph. 6. Ratio and relative motion: For simplicity, let's denote the radius measured via instruments as ( R_I ) and that on the photograph as ( R_P ). We have: [ R_I = frac{8.5}{2} = 4.25 text{ meters} ] and [ R_P = frac{9}{2} = 4.5 text{ meters} ] The difference in radius, 0.25 meters (or 0.5 meters in diameter), corresponds to the relative motion between the bear and the ice floe. 7. Conclude the mass relation: Given that the difference ratio is relatively small (0.5 meters in a radius of about 4.5 meters implies about (frac{1}{2} times frac{0.5}{4.5} approx 1 % = frac{1}{99}) motion difference), the mass of the ice floe is roughly one order of magnitude greater than that of the bear.

There are 12 different starting points for the first math major in a circular arrangement, but due to the circular nature of the table, we can fix one math major and arrange the others around them, which results in 12 ways to seat them consecutively. Next, we need to calculate the positioning for the physics majors. After seating the math majors, 7 seats remain. Similar to the math majors, we can fix one physics major and arrange the others around them, providing 7 choices for how the physics majors can sit consecutively. No overlap between the groups is possible because we are requiring each group to be in their own consecutive block. So, the seating arrangement for both groups together can either start with a math major or a physics major. There are 12 ways to position the 5 math majors and then 7 ways to position the 4 physics majors after the math majors.

The area of triangle (XYZ) can be expressed as: [ [XYZ] = frac{1}{2} cdot XY cdot XZ cdot sin(angle ZYX) ] Substituting this into the distance formula, we get: [ d(X, YZ) = frac{2 cdot frac{1}{2} cdot XY cdot XZ cdot sin(angle ZYX)}{YZ} ] Since (sin(angle ZYX)) can be expressed in terms of the radius (R) of the circle: [ sin(angle ZYX) = frac{YZ}{2R} ] Substituting this back, we get: [ d(X, YZ) = frac{XY cdot XZ cdot frac{YZ}{2R}}{YZ} = frac{XY cdot XZ}{2R} ] 2. **Application to the Given Problem:** Given (2n+1) points (M_1, M_2, ldots, M_{2n}, M) on a circle (mathcal{C}), we need to prove: [ prod_{i=1}^{n} d(M, M_{2i-1}M_{2i}) = prod_{i=1}^{n} d(M, M_{2i}M_{2i+1}) ] Using the lemma, the distance from (M) to the line (M_{2i-1}M_{2i}) is: [ d(M, M_{2i-1}M_{2i}) = frac{MM_{2i-1} cdot MM_{2i}}{2R} ] Therefore, the product of these distances is: [ prod_{i=1}^{n} d(M, M_{2i-1}M_{2i}) = prod_{i=1}^{n} frac{MM_{2i-1} cdot MM_{2i}}{2R} ] Similarly, the distance from (M) to the line (M_{2i}M_{2i+1}) is: [ d(M, M_{2i}M_{2i+1}) = frac{MM_{2i} cdot MM_{2i+1}}{2R} ] Therefore, the product of these distances is: [ prod_{i=1}^{n} d(M, M_{2i}M_{2i+1}) = prod_{i=1}^{n} frac{MM_{2i} cdot MM_{2i+1}}{2R} ] 3. **Simplification and Conclusion:** Notice that the indices in the product are cyclic modulo (2n).

From the system of equations begin{cases} y=k(x-2) frac{x^2}{2}+y^2=1 end{cases}, we obtain the quadratic equation (1+2k^2)x^2-8k^2x+8k^2-2=0. The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be positive (to ensure two intersection points), so we have Delta=64k^4-4(2k^2+1)(8k^2-2)>0, which implies k^2<frac{1}{2}. It is further deduced that x_1+x_2=frac{8k^2}{1+2k^2} and x_1x_2=frac{8k^2-2}{1+2k^2}. Since overrightarrow{OA}+overrightarrow{OB}=toverrightarrow{OP}, we have (x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2)=t(x,y), thus x= frac{x_1+x_2}{t}=frac{8k^2}{t(1+2k^2)}, y= frac{y_1+y_2}{t}= frac{1}{t}[k(x_1+x_2)-4k]=frac{-4k}{t(1+2k^2)}. As point P lies on the ellipse, we have frac{(8k^2)^2}{t^2(1+2k^2)^2}+2frac{(-4k)^2}{t^2(1+2k^2)^2}=1, which simplifies to 16k^2=t^2(1+2k^2). Solving for t^2, we get t^2=frac{16k^2}{1+2k^2}=frac{16}{frac{1}{k^2}+2}<frac{16}{2+2}=4, which implies -2<t<2.

However, for a polyhedron to only have 4 faces after one plane cut, it must retain 3 original faces and the newly formed cut face. This is achievable under certain cuts. - **A Polyhedron with 5 Faces:** - Each polyhedron will have the new face from the cut plus 4 out of the original faces.

Determine the smallest ( k ) for which one can guarantee that there are two checkpoints that are linked by each of the two companies.","completion":"1. **Problem Restatement and Initial Analysis:** We need to determine the smallest k such that two checkpoints on the mountain are linked by both cable car company A and company B. There are n^2 checkpoints numbered from 1 to n^2. 2. **Defining the Structure of Connections:** Each company operates k cable cars where the starting and finishing points of the cars are in a strictly increasing sequence. This implies for Company A, if cable car i starts at checkpoint s_i and ends at checkpoint f_i, then s_1 < s_2 < cdots < s_k and f_1 < f_2 < cdots < f_k. 3. **Lower Bound Analysis for k:** To understand the smallest value of k required, let's check if it's possible that no overlapping links occur when k leq n^2 - n. - For Company A, let it connect checkpoints (i, i+1) for i neq n, 2n, 3n, ldots, n(n-1). Here, A connects neighboring checkpoints except those just before each multiple of n. - For Company B, let it connect checkpoints (i, i+n) where 1 leq i leq n^2 - n. We need to check if any pair (i, j) is linked by both companies. - For Company A, the pairs (i, j) linked satisfy j = i + t and leftlceil frac{i}{n} rightrceil = leftlceil frac{j}{n} rightrceil because it skips transitions at multiples of n. - For Company B, the pairs linked satisfy j = i + tn (mod n). Thus for any two linked points by B, j must be i (text{mod } n). Therefore, there is no overlap between A-linked and B-linked points. This shows it's possible to find no overlapping linked points when k leq n^2 - n. 4. **Upper Bound Analysis and Establishing the Minimum:** Now, consider k = n^2 - n + 1. We must show linked points exist in this case. - We observe that if we increase k, we add more connections and chains. Define an A-chain as a sequence of connected checkpoints using Company A. - Similarly, define B-chain for Company B. - Any checkpoint would be part of a unique A and a unique B chain. Each non-finishing point of an A-car starts a new A-chain, leaving n-1 A-chains. Similarly, we form n-1 B-chains. - We now count pairs (Atext{-chain}, Btext{-chain}) the checkpoint belongs to. Since there are (n-1)^2 pairs and n^2 checkpoints, including each checkpoint must belong to such a pairing. - As k = n^2 - n + 1, meaning one more than n^2 - n, there must be at least 2 checkpoints that are common in linking by both companies due to the pigeonhole principle. 5. **Conclusion:** Hence, the smallest k needed to ensure that there exists at least one pair of checkpoints linked by both companies is [ boxed{n^2 - n + 1}. ]"},{"prompt":"A line contains the points (4, 10) and (2, 8).

Thus, ( X sim Bleft(10, frac{1}{2}right) ) and ( Y sim Bleft(11, frac{1}{2}right) ). Here, ( B(n, p) ) denotes a binomial distribution with ( n ) trials and success probability ( p ). 3. The probability mass functions for ( X ) and ( Y ) are given by: [ P(X = k) = binom{10}{k} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{k} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{10-k} = frac{binom{10}{k}}{2^{10}} quad (k = 0, 1, ldots, 10) ] [ P(Y = l) = binom{11}{l} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{l} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{11-l} = frac{binom{11}{l}}{2^{11}} quad (l = 0, 1, ldots, 11) ] 4.

Using the binomial distributions, we have: [ P(Y = l) P(X = k) = frac{binom{11}{l}}{2^{11}} cdot frac{binom{10}{k}}{2^{10}} = frac{binom{11}{l} binom{10}{k}}{2^{21}} ] Thus, [ P(Y > X) = frac{1}{2^{21}} sum_{l=1}^{11} binom{11}{l} sum_{k=0}^{l-1} binom{10}{k} ] 6. To simplify, note that the sum of binomial coefficients up to ( l-1 ) is: [ sum_{k=0}^{l-1} binom{10}{k} = 2^{10} - sum_{k=l}^{10} binom{10}{k} ] However, given the sum symmetry properties and binomial theorem, we have: [ sum_{k=0}^{10} binom{10}{k} = 2^{10} ] Therefore, inserting the values: [ begin{array}{l} P(Y > X) = frac{1}{2^{21}} sum_{l=1}^{11} binom{11}{l} left( 2^{10} - sum_{k=l}^{10} binom{10}{k} right) = frac{1}{2^{21}} left( sum_{l=1}^{11} binom{11}{l} 2^{10} - sum_{l=1}^{11} binom{11}{l} sum_{k=l}^{10} binom{10}{k} right) end{array} ] 7. Additionally, note the symmetry in the previous sums, particularly in how the crossed terms reduce and equilibrate given their symmetrical values for binomial terms. This leads to the final clear combination simplifications reducing to: [ P(Y > X) = frac{1048576}{2097152} = frac{1}{2} ] # Conclusion: Thus, the probability that B will have more heads than A is ( boxed{frac{1}{2}} )."},{"prompt":"A smaller square was cut out from a larger square in such a way that one side of the smaller square lies on a side of the original square.

The first step doubles the remainder, but the second step modifies it by subtraction. The added rule affects the doubling step if the doubled value exceeds 40. We analyze the behavior modulo 15 because subtracting 15 does not change the remainder. Let's analyze potential \\"sweet numbers\\" by checking if 20 can appear in sequences: - Doubling of numbers modulo 15: If x mod 15 = y, then (2x mod 40) mod 15 = 2y mod 15 (unless 2x > 40). - Subtraction of 15: This operation doesn't change the modulo 15 residue but reduces the overall number. For numbers greater than 30, subtracting 15 repeatedly will reduce them until they are less than or equal to 30, and then the doubling rule applies. We must check if 2x mod 40 exceeds 40, which affects only values x > 20 in the first step. If a doubled number modulo 15 equals 5 (since 20 equiv 5 mod 15), then 20 could be a part of the sequence. Numbers that double to give a remainder of 5 modulo 15 are: - Doubling 5 gives 10. - Doubling 8 gives 16 mod 40 => 1 mod 15. - Doubling 2.5 gives 5, but since we only use integers, this does not apply. From this, numbers that are 2.5 modulo 15 could lead to 20 appearing in the sequence, but since we only consider integers, only those starting sequences that double to reach a remainder of 5 modulo 15 without exceeding 40 can include 20. The only integers whose doubling leads to a remainder of 5 modulo 15 are 5, 20, and 35. Subtracting 15 from numbers greater than 30 and not reaching 5 as a remainder modulo 15 when doubled will not include 20 in their sequence. Hence, avoiding starting numbers like 5, 20, and 35 modulo 15 avoids 20 in the sequence. There are 4 such numbers within each full cycle of 15 between 1 and 60 (except those multiples of 15).

The tens place: The digit 5 appears in the tens place 10 times for each hundred (e.g., 50 to 59, 150 to 159, etc.). Since there are 10 sets of hundreds before 1000, the digit 5 appears 10 * 10 = 100 times in the tens place. 3. The units place: Similarly, the digit 5 appears in the units place 10 times for each hundred (e.g., 5, 15, 25, ..., 95). Again, there are 10 sets of hundreds before 1000, so the digit 5 appears 10 * 10 = 100 times in the units place. Adding these up, we have 100 (hundreds place) + 100 (tens place) + 100 (units place) = 300 times that the digit 5 appears from 1 to 1000.

Let g(x)=f(x+1)=x^4+2|x|. This function is created by shifting the function f(x) by 1 unit to the left, which simplifies the comparison between f(x) and f(2x). Step 1: Recognize g(x) as an even function. This means g(x) = g(-x) for all x. Because of this property, g(x) is symmetric about the y-axis. Step 2: Observe that g(x) is monotonically increasing for x > 0. This means that as x increases in the positive direction, the value of g(x) also increases. Step 3: Relate f(x) to g(x): f(x) = g(x-1). This means that to find when f(x) > f(2x), we can equivalently find when g(x-1) > g(2x-1). Step 4: Translate the inequality: f(x) > f(2x) Leftrightarrow g(x-1) > g(2x-1). This step follows directly from the relationship established in Step 3. Step 5: Recognize that g(x - 1) > g(2x - 1) translates into |x-1| > |2x-1|. This step is because the expressions x-1 and 2x-1 directly influence the value of g(x) through both the x^4 and 2|x| components. Step 6: Square both sides to remove the absolute value, leading to (x-1)^2 > (2x-1)^2. Squaring both sides is valid because both sides are non-negative, preserving the inequality.

If he saw 12 trucks, 13 cars, 8 bicycles, and 3 buses, and assuming all hidden wheels were distributed evenly among the vehicle types, how many wheels did Tommy see in total?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels for each type of vehicle without considering the hidden wheels: - Trucks: 12 trucks * 4 wheels/truck = 48 wheels - Cars: 13 cars * 4 wheels/car = 52 wheels - Bicycles: 8 bicycles * 2 wheels/bicycle = 16 wheels - Buses: 3 buses * 6 wheels/bus = 18 wheels Now, let's add up all the wheels Tommy would have seen if none were hidden: Total visible wheels = 48 (trucks) + 52 (cars) + 16 (bicycles) + 18 (buses) = 134 wheels Since Tommy could only see 75% of the wheels, we need to calculate 75% of the total number of wheels: 75% of 134 wheels = 0.75 * 134 = 100.5 wheels However, since Tommy cannot see half a wheel, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: Total wheels Tommy saw = 100 wheels So, Tommy saw boxed{100} wheels in total."},{"prompt":"At a park event, each bench can either hold 8 adults or 12 children. When N benches are connected, an equal number of adults and children precisely fill up all the spaces on the benches. What is the smallest positive integer value of N? A) 2 B) 3 C) 4 D) 5 E) 6","completion":"1. **Understand the Problem**: A single bench section can seat either 8 adults or 12 children. The benches are connected end-to-end, seating equal numbers of adults and children which perfectly fill all the seats. 2. **Formulate Equations**: Let x be the number of adults and y be the number of children. Since the condition states an equal number, x = y. Further, the total seating capacity for adults in N benches is 8N, and for children, it is 12N: [ 8N = x ] [ 12N = y ] Equating both, given x = y, [ 8N = 12N ] 3. **Correct the Equations and Find LCM**: This step refines that the equation 8N = 12N is improper as stated. We seek the smallest N so that 8N and 12N can be equal by a factor. The smallest common multiple of 8 and 12 (LCM) needs to be found: [ text{LCM}(8, 12) = 24 ] 4. **Calculation for N**: We need 8N and 12N to equal the LCM of 24. Setting 8N = 12N = 24, we solve for N: [ 8N = 24 implies N = frac{24}{8} = 3 ] [ 12N = 24 implies N = frac{24}{12} = 2 ] The smallest positive integer N is determined by the synchronization of capacity of benches which is N = 3. 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the minimum N that satisfies the conditions specified is 3.
