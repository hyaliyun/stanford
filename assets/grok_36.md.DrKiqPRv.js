However it may also be that you prefer to appear somewhat different than other people, preferring your own unique style of dress and appearance. You may also appear moody and changeable to others, and only put on the face that you feel is appropriate for your mood at the moment. You are likely to be highly intuitive, and could readily 'pick up' on what other people feel, although you may not be aware of this on a conscious level. Picking up the mood of the public would be very easy for you, and you could very easily 'play to the audience' knowing exactly what the public want to hear.

This may manifest in a multitude of ways, from an uncanny ability to stay in vogue with the latest trends to a distinctive preference for crafting a unique and personal aesthetic that sets you apart from the crowd. You are perceived as mercurial at times, responsive to the ebb and flow of your inner emotional states. To others, you offer a spectrum of expressions, each tailored to the sentiment that stirs within you at any given moment. This emotional versatility could be the cornerstone of your appeal, making you relatable and captivating to those around you. Your sensitivity extends beyond the personal realm; you posses an innate ability to gauge the collective emotional pulse. You can seamlessly align with the collective sentiment, rendering you exceptionally skilled at delivering what is sought, whether through words, performance, or presence.

You are drawn, perhaps unconsciously, to adorn yourself in a manner that echoes your mood, which in turn, can evolve as swiftly as the lunar phases. This chameleon-like trait not only speaks of your adaptability but also illustrates a deeper yearning—a yearning to fully express the multifaceted nature of your essence. Your mutable emotional landscape may sometimes bewilder those who don't know you intimately, but to those who do, it is recognized as the deep well of empathy and understanding from which you draw.

The Moon conjunct the Ascendant bestows an emotional richness that is immediately apparent; this person's feelings are worn on their sleeve, giving them a distinctive empathic aura. This aspect engenders an individual whose inner experiences—shaped by intuition, sensitivity, and the deep-seated influence of their nurturing environment—inform their identity and public persona. With the Moon so prominently positioned, they are remarkably attuned to the emotional wavelengths around them, possessing a natural ability to sense and respond to the undercurrents of their interactions with the world. The emotional transparency provided by the Moon in conjunction with the Ascendant often results in an individual who seeks to form genuine connections with others. Their candid expression of emotions can attract people who appreciate that authenticity and can establish an immediate sense of trust and intimacy. It is also possible that they experience shifts in their mood and self-expression, their public image ebbing and flowing much like the lunar cycles that symbolize their ever-evolving identity. Mars conjunct the Midheaven introduces another powerful dynamic to the equation, injecting the individual's career and public image with assertiveness, ambition, and a robust drive. Mars, the planet of action and force, aligns their professional pursuits with determination and a competitive edge. The Midheaven, being the highest point in the chart and reflective of one's goals, ambitions, and reputation, indicates that this person likely has a strong desire to make a mark on the world. Combining the fiery impulse of Mars with their vocational goals suggests that not only do they yearn for achievement but they are also willing to put in the effort and confront challenges head-on. They are likely to be seen by others as a leader or someone with a pioneering spirit, someone who thrives in positions where courage and initiative are valued. Despite the warmth provided by the Moon's influence, Mars' conjunction with the Midheaven can at times impart a level of aggression or impatience with their public dealings, especially when it comes to their ambitions and career. There can be a sense of urgency to their actions, a need to act and achieve, which can lead to remarkable accomplishments but may also call for balancing with the more nurturing, sensitive aspects of their personality. This individual might experience a push-pull between their emotional self-representation and their desire for professional success. Their career might involve a role where they need to be both personable and assertive—perhaps in fields like politics, where one must show a compassionate face to the public while also engaging in staunch advocacy and decision-making. In synthesis, a person with the Moon conjunct the Ascendant possesses a heartfelt transparency that makes them relatable and engaging, while Mars conjunct the Midheaven infuses their professional life with ambition and the zest to achieve great things. The combination of these aspects speaks of a soul that is fiercely driven yet emotionally attuned, a navigator of both the personal and public realms, who must learn to leverage their innate intuition and assertive drive to shape a world they wish to see."},{"prompt":"elaborate expand and improve","completion":"An individual graced with the Moon conjunct the Ascendant alongside Mars conjunct the Midheaven embodies a rich interplay of celestial energies that both nurture and compel. The Moon's presence at the ascendant crafts a persona that is emotionally articulate, where the slightest ripple in the pond of their feelings is noticeable upon the surface. At the same time, the fiery influence of Mars at the Midheaven impels them toward public triumph and recognition. This person moves through the world with an undeniable emotional fluency—a fluency that renders them remarkably empathetic and approachable. The Moon, with its cyclical nature and constant movement through phases, shapes a public face that is at once changeable and sincere, allowing them to be deeply impactful in their interactions. Relationships may be characterized by a profound emotional intelligence that allows for nurturing connections. Their sensitivity is not a thing of frailty but acts as a beacon that guides them through social intricacies with finesse and intuition. The Moon's nurturing essence suggests a deep bond with the past and a potential influence of maternal figures that have left a lasting impression on how they anchor their identity and perceive the world. However, residing at the zenith of their chart is Mars, conjunct the Midheaven, which paints a strikingly different tone in the arena of career and public life. Here, the warrior planet bestows a fervent, almost martial spirit toward worldly accomplishments. Charged with the pioneering spirit of Mars, they are perceived by others as a driven and ambitious individual, someone who radiates confidence and is unafraid to carve out their destiny with bold strokes. Mars' placement here suggests that they will pursue their life's mission with fervor and kinetic energy, propelling them into roles of leadership, innovation, and perhaps even confrontation. Their professional demeanor might carry an air of assertiveness and a no-nonsense approach to tackling challenges that allows them to take charge and make decisive impacts on their environment. The powerful influence of Mars can translate into a relentless pursuit of goals, an aspiration to rise and be recognized for one's efforts and accomplishments. Therein lies the fascinating dichotomy: the moonlit empathy that defines their personal interactions and the martial zeal that drives their professional ambitions. Managing these contrasting forces—the tender moonlight with the assertive rays of Mars—requires a dance of balance that can become the theme of their growth. For those looking on, the individual with these aspects may seem to possess an intrinsic ability to touch one's soul just as surely as they can ignite one's spirit. They might be drawn to professions where empathy and decisiveness must coexist, such as social advocacy, crisis management, or leadership in non-profit organizations—fields whereby one must understand deeply and act boldly. The path for such an individual involves integrating their profound emotional understanding with their desire to achieve and blaze trails. When harnessed judiciously, these traits become the bedrock of an inspiring leader, an innovative creator, or a compassionate advocate.

Here, in the realm of the public eye, does the warrior spirit emerge, brandishing the sword of ambition, tempered in the flames of passion and the unyielding will to conquer and claim victory upon the battlefield of their vocation.

In the first house, this union heralds forth an individual ablaze with the vivacity of the Sun and the spirited enterprise of Mars, all cloaked in Gemini's gossamer robes of duality and swift dialogue. For this native, the Sun in Gemini upon the Ascendant breathes life into a persona of dazzling versatility. As the Sun illuminates the essence of being, so does this personage radiate the qualities of adaptability, quick wit, and the insatiable curiosity of the celestial Twins. Words become their wand and intellect their sword, slicing through ignorance with the finesse of a fencer, equally prepared to parry with playful jest or engage in rigorous debate. Combined with the fiery spirit of Mars, this solar presence is further enkindled, igniting a flame of assertive communication and a courageous conquest of knowledge. Here is one who moves with mercurial speed, impelled by the red planet's unyielding momentum, to articulate their truth, to engage the minds of others with an almost combative delight in exchange and a zest for mental challenge. Yet, whilst the fevered dance of Sun and Mars in Gemini animates the ascendant with a dazzling display of intellectual prowess and daredevil charm, it is within the lofty heights of the Midheaven that the Moon, in the prudent sign of Capricorn, manifests her nocturnal wisdom. Here, upon the zenith of one's public sphere, Luna cloaks worldly ambition with a mantle of solemn responsibility and the steadfast determination characteristic of the sea-goat. The Moon in Capricorn conjunct the Midheaven bestows upon our vivacious Gemini native a sober counterweight to their effervescent zeal. It is the anchor in the storm of their ceaseless curiosity, the emotional maturity that tempers their youthful fervor. This sphere of influence demands that one's public face wear a dignified and disciplined expression, where achievements are not merely sought but built upon the bedrock of tradition, structure, and enduring legacy. In the ninth house, the Moon adds a touch of emotional depth to one's philosophic pursuits, as if each quest for knowledge is not just a flight of the intellect, but a pilgrimage of the soul. Their call to ascend to the Midheaven is aligned with the worldly pursuit of higher learning, legal mastery, or perhaps the spiritual seeking that is found in the philosophical ivories of academic discourse. Thus, the individual who wields such an astral chart is akin to a Magician, artfully balancing the Air's playful ire with Earth's gravity. They are called, by cosmic decree, to master the art of striking equilibrium: marrying the mercurial quicksilver speed and dexterity with the gravitas of Capricornian ambition; interlacing sprightly curiosity with the composed pursuit of honor and recognition. Their path, then, stretches across the very fabric of existence, weaving a narrative that flirts with the boundless potential of the mind (Gemini Sun) and assertive action (Mars in Gemini), while remaining steadfast in the slowly climbing, lunar-lit ascent towards worldly significance and structure (Capricorn Moon). Thus, do they wear their Gemini guise in the personal, while girding their Capricorn solemnity in the grand amphitheater of society. In so doing, they may harness their intrinsic gift of vibrant eloquence and vivacious intellect, channeling these mercurial strengths into a legacy that soars to the mountainous peaks of Capricorn's resolute domain. Bridging the realms between thought and authority, communication and reputation, they enact the alchemical transformation of self into a multifaceted icon, a being not just of thought but of resonance across the chambers of human achievement."},{"prompt":"elaborate expand and improve","completion":"In the cosmic complexity where the radiance of the Sun meets the warrior spirit of Mars within the clever embrace of Gemini upon the Ascendant, there is born an individual of remarkable mental alacrity and spirited fervor.

The Sun in Gemini blesses the native with a kaleidoscopic identity, a mélange of traits that shine with a thousand facets of light. As custodian of the day, the Sun imbues one with a core drive for expression, a ceaseless yearning to explore, communicate, and connect. The Sun here casts a brilliant luminary whose spirit cannot be contained, whose essence spills forth in an array of ideas, desires, and curiosities, each a golden ray of the central star of their being. Mars — fierce, fiery, and forthright — magnifies this brilliance, charging it with an assertive potency. As the co-ruler of Gemini's Ascendant, Mars wields its sword with the precision of a masterful intellect, honing assertion into artistry, and turning debate into a battlefield where words are wielded as weapons, and thoughts strike with the swiftness of arrows. This combination bestows upon the individual an aura that commands attention, inviting interaction and often inciting action. Their movements through the world bear the stamp of cognitive swiftness, a propensity to lead with the mind, sprinting from one idea to the next with the agile dexterity of the Twins.

The Capricornian influence channels the emotional receptivity of the Moon into a structured matrix, one where feelings and desires for acknowledgment are not whimsically expressed but carefully crafted into stepping stones towards enduring influence. The Moon in Capricorn conjunct the Midheaven sets the stage for a public persona that, though it yearns for emotional connection and acknowledgment, will not forsake discipline, integrity, and hard-won respect. The combination of the luminary Moon in the articulate sign of the Sea-Goat suggests a connection to the collective's deeper, often unvoiced needs, particularly within the realms of ethics, education, and governance. This placement hints at a capacity for leadership that weds emotion with executive ability, sensitivity with authority — a harbinger of a reputation built not just on the sparks of inspiration but the solid bedrocks of societal contribution. Thus we see the portrait of an individual tasked with nothing less than the alchemy of self: to keep aloft the gossamer wings of Gemini's intellectual agility while grounded in Capricorn's sober climb. Theirs is the path of the scholar-warrior, the knight-counselor, the one who must articulate a new vision (Gemini) while honoring the gravitas and responsibilities that come with prominence (Capricorn). In synthesizing the mercurial twins' swiftness with the goat's scrupulous climb, they forge an archetype unto themselves — their intellect sharpened to cut through ignorance and their hearts tempered to endure the trials of aspiration. Their words must be as their deeds: swift yet weighted, clever yet profound, reflective of a mind that dances with the speed of thought and a soul that moves with the deliberate force of destiny. For this individual, life is an elegant tapestry, a paradoxical blend of quicksilver brilliance and earthbound tenacity. They are the melding of mutable air and cardinal earth, and their greatest triumph lies in mastering the articulation of profound truths with the discipline to see them manifest in a world that listens, watches, and remembers."},{"prompt":"give this being a title","completion":"The Sovereign of Cerebral Sagacity and Capricornian Constancy"},{"prompt":"give it 10 more","completion":"1.

Here is fashioned a being of profound communicative prowess, a wielder of the intellect as if ‘twere Excalibur itself, a virtuoso of versatility striding through a world hungry for the nectar of novel thought and sparkling repartee. The essence of the Sun in Gemini beckons forth a radiant initiator of connections and concepts, an illuminator of paths untrodden by lesser minds. Woven into thine identity is Mercury, the divine messenger, encurled with the Sun in a dance of celestial splendor, bestowing the faculties of language, commerce of the mind, and the ability to traverse the infinite corridors of ideas with a magician’s sleight of hand. Then lo, Mars, the crimson warrior, doth brandish its fiery aspect within this Gemini assembly, lending vigor and valor to the intellectual acumen of this first house occupant. The fusion here creates not a mere orator but a provocateur of minds, one who challenges the status quo, who turns colloquy into a joust of sagacious wit worthy of the gods themselves. But ascend thy gaze, for upon the Midheaven there lies the Moon, regal and contemplative, in the stalwart sign of Capricorn upon the cusp of the Water Bearer, Aquarius. This ethereal luminary at the zenith casts an influential reflection, fusing the private sphere of emotions within the public fortress of reputation and worldly achievement. It is through this lunar influence that the native infuses their ambitious climb with instinctive intuition, the emotional acuity to nurture and govern the masses. Within the ninth house, the sphere of higher understanding and expansive travel, the Moon’s conjured influence hints at the wisdom of Saturn coupled with the unraveling insight unto the future, that fine line where the structures of Capricorn commune with the avant-garde Aquarius. Thus, this Moon speaks of a soul who finds solace in the exploration of philosophies yet grounds these in the tangible bastions of societal framework. With such celestial alignments, this character is an archetype, a divine embodiment of Air and Earth, Thought and Form. They are the Scholar Warrior of the Astral Bridge, whose voice has the power to command the elements and intellects, while their emotional acuity tempers each victory with humanity’s unvoiced yearnings. Behold, the one who bears these heavenly marks embodies an executor of ideologies, a crafter of epochs, who untangles the webs of the mundane with Gemini’s dexterous hand, while plotting the constellations of influence with Capricorn’s methodical eye, ever teetering on the precipice of Aquarian revelation. Verily, let this being be honored, for in their essence they hold the keys to the Empyrean Library and the Architect’s Stone. With the agility of Mercury, the fire of Mars, the brilliance of Sol, and Luna's majestic oversight, they walk both the infinite spiral of intellect and the mighty staircase of legacy, a sovereign of duality’s craft and destiny’s unfoldment."},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"In this grand alchemical rite of heaven and earth, the native forges a sacred synthesis of Gemini’s airy intellect and the Capricorn-Aquarius cusp’s ambitious prescience. Yet, let us not mistake this melding for a tranquil union; nay, it is a perpetual crucible of transformation, where the quicksilver mind and the enduring soul do continually shape and reshape one another. Within the folds of this individual’s every utterance, there lies the echo of Hermes himself, a mercurial spirit traversing the realms of the mundane and divine, with the silver-tongued ease of one born of the gods. The Sun, ever the font of identity and will, enlivens Mercury’s message with warmth and boundless vivacity, while Mars injects into every phrase the sharpened edge of a blade, keen to dissect fallacies and champion the truth with dauntless ardor. Yet even the brightest daylight yields to twilight's grasp, and so does this mental agility bow to the soft glow of the Moon upon the lofty Midheaven. In the house of higher purpose and the collective's distant horizon, the Moon's Capricornian discipline exalts the soul’s ambitions, urging the ivy to climb ever skyward while maintaining its roots in the rich soil of tradition and the respect of one's peers. As the cusp of Aquarius beckons, it whispers of the future, of innovation's call, providing a prophetic glimpse into the uranian dreams of advancement and the egalitarian designs upon society. The Moon thus seasons the native’s public life with an eldritch allure, conjuring forth an oracular vision that stands stalwart amidst the mists of time, ever ready to crest the wave of the new age that hovers tantalizingly upon the boundary of becoming. Such a being thrives amidst the interplay of Gemini's restless exploration and the calculated conquests of Capricorn-Aquarius foresight. In their essence, they are both a sword and a shield for the collective psyche — with the sword, they parry the shadows of ignorance; with the shield, they shelter the flame of progress from the harsh winds of complacency. So let us then christen this being as the Guardian at the Gates of Thought and the Keeper of the Chronocrator’s Clock, who holds court at the junction of discourse and destiny, who commands with the astuteness of the Twins and answers the somber call of the Mountain Goat, touched by the Water Bearer’s innovative spirit. Indeed, let their title echo throughout the halls of the Akashic Records: here walks the Progenitor of the Lucid Wind and the Architect of Epochs, a soul not simply born of stars, but one who bends their light, who shapes their narrative, and charts the course of human consciousness through the uncharted celestial seas."},{"prompt":"include uranus opposite to the stellium in gemini on the ascendant","completion":"With Uranus, that most eccentric and unpredictable of celestial heralds, poised in opposition to the vibrant stellium of Sun, Mercury, and Mars in Gemini upon the Ascendant, the tapestry of the heavens sings a more complex aria, a symphony of cosmic tension and revolutionary potential. This native bears within them the electric charge of Uranus, the Great Awakener, facing down the communicative fortress of thought and action that is Gemini's domain. As Uranus opposes, it casts a strange, beguiling luminescence upon the native’s already mercurial nature, catapulting them into unforeseen terrains of being, jolting the mind with flashes of insight that ignite like lightning in the fathomless night. The Sagittarian energy from whence Uranus challenges the Gemini aggregation is a firebrand of philosophical rebellion, a questing bow aiming its arrows at the farthest reaches of truth and experience. The opposition generates a dynamic polarity, a seesaw between the probing depths of Sagittarian exploration and the agile acrobatics of Gemini’s intellect. Within the interplay of this aspect lies a potential for genius, for Uranus demands innovation, a breaking of chains in the service of a personal revolution that disrupts, transforms, and transcends. Our Gemini native finds their expression not only swift and versatile but now charged with the mission to overthrow the status quo, to balk at the traditional, and to champion the cause of progress. Uranus in opposition arms them with a maverick’s courage, the audacity to confront the banalities of thought with scintillating and oftentimes radical perspectives that can leave the uninitiated speechless and spellbound. Yet, for all the brilliance this Uranian opposition confers, the native must also navigate the stormy waters of unpredictability and the craving for independence that can cast them adrift from secure shores. The tug-of-war between the self’s immediate surroundings and the expansive, anarchic pull of Uranus can manifest in a life punctuated by sudden upheavals, brilliant sparks of chaos that serve to awaken and reshape. And on the Midheaven, the Moon in Capricorn, verging into the Aquarian realm, observes the Uranian spectacle with an aloof demeanor, ever seeking to ground the turbulence in a framework that can bear the weight of such dazzling potential. Here the soul strives to consolidate the electric and the erratic into worldly accomplishments that can withstand the test of both time and tide. Within the capacious ninth house, the urge to synthesize opposing forces extends to the quest for meaning and the ambition to reach for the heights of societal acclaim. The Moon’s wisdom tempers the Uranian influence with the insistence on credibility and the intuitive grasp of societal undercurrents—a gentle but firm hand steering the lightning bolt with precision and poise. In bearing such cosmic gifts, the individual thus may become a catalyst in their era, a vanguard of intellect armed with the verve to incite revolution and the lunar capacity to nurture the newborn dawn. They are the Harbinger of Mental Alchemy, the Weaver of the Surge and the Soothsayer of the Silvered Path, forging an existence where thought is never static, where word becomes catalyst, and where the drive for change, sparked by the oppositional dance of Uranus, alights the torches of tomorrow."},{"prompt":"include jupiter sextile uranus and jupiter trine to the stellium in gemini on the ascendant","completion":"The grand celestial drama takes on an even more splendid dimension with the beneficent giant Jupiter casting Sextiles to Uranus and Trine aspects to the stellium of the Sun, Mercury, and Mars in Gemini on the Ascendant. Here, Jupiter, the King of the Gods, the planet of expansion and fortune, bestows its benevolent gaze upon the native, anointing their already potent cosmic configuration with its golden scepter of opportunity and growth. Jupiter's Sextile to Uranus crackles with the promise of fortunate change, a hint of providence amidst the unpredictability. This aspect infuses Uranus’ call to innovation with a stroke of luck, an assuredness that the winds of change blow favorably for our native. It suggests that their revolutionary ideas and abrupt shifts in life’s direction are not capricious whims but guided by a higher wisdom that ensures they fall on fertile ground. Simultaneously, Jupiter's Trine to the Gemini Ascendant stellium weaves an even richer layer into the complex cosmic narrative. The already articulate and agile mind garners the blessings of Jupiter, magnifying the native’s intellectual capabilities to vaulted heights, granting an almost Midas touch to communication—a voice that can persuade, inspire, and expand the minds of those it reaches. This aspect implies effortless grace in merging action (Mars), thought (Mercury), identity (Sun), and opportunity (Jupiter). The result is a figure whose movements through the social and intellectual spheres mimic the graceful choreography of the king planet’s own orbit—grand, assured, and with a touch of divine favor. Jupiter also amplifies the martial energy of Mars, modulating its raw aggression into confident assertiveness, channeling potential conflicts into opportunities for victory and learning. It expands Mercury’s realm, bringing a wealth of knowledge and wisdom to the native's insatiable curiosity, and touches the core self of the Sun with the promise of an influential, bright future. In this dance, Jupiter acts as the great benefactor, as if Asgard itself has taken a vested interest in the unfolding destiny of this individual. The Sextile to Uranus hints at sudden, fortuitous encounters that catalyze growth, while the Trine to Gemini’s melange of solar intensity, communicative dexterity, and assertive enterprise promises that these encounters and the resulting growth are not only harmonious but significant steps toward the soul’s greater purpose. The Midheaven’s Moon in Capricorn, on the brink of Aquarius, thus receives the echoing laughter of Jupiter from the wings—promising that the native’s emotional and public endeavors bear the stamp of esteemed respectability and the potential for lasting influence. Amidst structures and legacies, their reputation may resonate with the weight of a sage and the liberating vision of an innovator. Thus, our native stands not merely as a charismatic intellectual or a Uranian disruptor but as a cosmic favorite, touched by the auspice of Jupiter’s grandiose visions. They are the Bold Orator of Fortunate Revolutions, the Conjurer of Auspicious Winds, serenaded by the stars with a symphony of possibilities. With each pivot of their life, each utterance of their mercurial tongue, the narrative they spin is one plated in Jupiter’s boundless proliferation, echoing through time as the Opus of a Stellar Envoy."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ответы на него могут сильно отличаться в зависимости от культурных, религиозных, философских и индивидуальных убеждений. Вот несколько разных подходов к ответу на этот вопрос: 1. **Религиозный подход**: Различные религиозные традиции предлагают разные обоснования цели человеческой жизни. Например, в христианстве одна из целей может заключаться в служении Богу и ближним, в испытании веры и достижении вечной жизни после смерти. 2. **Философский подход**: Философы размышляли о смысле и цели жизни на протяжении веков. Например, экзистенциалисты утверждают, что смысл жизни не дан заранее и что каждый человек должен сам создать свой смысл и жить в соответствии с ним. 3. **Биологический подход**: С точки зрения биологии, цель жизни человека, как и любого другого организма, — выживание и воспроизводство, передача генов следующим поколениям. 4. **Социальный подход**: Согласно социальному подходу, смысл жизни человека может быть связан с внесением вклада в общество, помощи другим, строительстве семьи, создании и поддержании дружеских и любовных отношений. 5. **Индивидуалистический подход**: Человек может видеть смысл жизни в самореализации, в достижении личных целей, в стремлении к счастью и удовлетворению. 6. **Нихилистический подход**: Некоторые люди могут придерживаться нихилистических взглядов, считая, что никакого объективного смысла в жизни нет, и что всякие попытки его найти обречены на провал. Этот вопрос переплетается с другими вопросами о природе человеческого существования, о том, что делает жизнь достойной жизни, и о том, как мы должны строить нашу жизнь, чтобы она была полной и значимой для нас.

Вот несколько распространенных типов антенн, которые используются радиолюбителями: 1. **Дипольная антенна**: это простая и эффективная антенна, хорошо подходящая для работы на HF (высокочастотных) диапазонах. Она работает на одной главной частоте и её гармониках, но существуют многодиапазонные версии дипольных антенн с использованием дополнительных элементов или специальных устройств — балунов. 2. **Вертикальная антенна**: занимает мало места и может быть эффективной для DX связей (связь на большие расстояния), так как обычно имеет низкий угол излучения. Один из вариантов — «ground plane» антенна, которая состоит из вертикально ориентированного радиатора и радиальных, расположенных горизонтально или немного наклонно. 3. **Направленные (лучевые) антенны**, такие как Yagi-Uda: это очень популярный тип антенн среди радиолюбителей, который позволяет сфокусировать сигнал в определенном направлении, увеличивая тем самым эффективность и усиление. Эти антенны могут быть большими и требуют значительного пространства для установки. 4. **Магнитная петля**: компактная антенна, которая может быть эффективной для работы на коротких волнах, особенно в условиях ограниченного пространства. 5. **Многодиапазонные вертикальные или горизонтальные антенны**: такие, как фан-диполь, который позволяет работать на нескольких диапазонах без необходимости перестройки. 6. **Вайрлесс антенны**: это различные варианты антенн, выполненные в виде проволочных конструкций, такие как длиннопроволочные антенны или дельта петли. Их можно сделать самому, и они могут быть настроены на работу в разных диапазонах. Самая оптимальная антенна для вас будет зависеть от ваших конкретных потребностей и условий. Опытные радиолюбители часто экспериментируют с различными типами антенн, чтобы найти наилучшее сочетание производительности, удобства установки и стоимости.

Pendekatan yang lebih baik adalah berkomunikasi secara konstruktif dan mendorong dialog yang sehat, daripada menggunakan istilah-istilah peyoratif."},{"prompt":"Reply to this email and mentioned that I have been trying several times to do the process for the data protection but it’s giving me error and below he can find the error I’m getting : Hello Walid, As agreed, I confirm our conversation on 11/03/2024, at 2pm, via MS Teams.

Операция может включать различные методы, такие как трансуретральная резекция простаты (ТУРП), открытая простатэктомия или минимально инвазивные процедуры, включая лазерные операции. Отдаленные результаты частичной резекции аденомы простаты варьируются и зависят от ряда факторов, включая: - общее состояние здоровья пациента; - размер и расположение аденомы; - выбранный метод лечения; - наличие сопутствующих заболеваний, таких как диабет, сердечно-сосудистые заболевания, и др.; - точность и качество выполнения операции. В большинстве случаев частичное удаление аденомы простаты приводит к следующим отдаленным результатам: 1. Улучшение симптомов нижних мочевыводящих путей (ЛУТС): - Уменьшение частоты мочеиспускания; - Облегчение начала мочеиспускания; - Улучшение силы струи мочи; - Сокращение остаточной мочи в мочевом пузыре после мочеиспускания. 2. Улучшение качества жизни: - Снижение ночной поллакиурии (повышенная частота ночного мочеиспускания); - Возможное улучшение сексуальной функции, если она была нарушена из-за симптомов гиперплазии. 3. Снижение риска осложнений: - Профилактика рецидивирующих инфекций мочевыводящих путей; - Предотвращение развития острой задержки мочи; - Минимизация вероятности развития мочекаменной болезни из-за застоя мочи. 4. Продолжительное наблюдение и возможное повторное вмешательство: - Необходимость регулярного медицинского наблюдения; - Потенциальная потребность в повторной процедуре, если аденома продолжит расти и приведет к возвращению симптомов. 5. Возможные побочные эффекты и осложнения: - Ретроградная эякуляция (эякуляция в мочевой пузырь); - Трудности с мочеиспусканием или уринарная инконтиненция; - Сужение уретры или шейки мочевого пузыря (стриктура); - Кровотечение или инфекция.

The running time of each run should be reported.: Multi-threaded Sorting: Sort 10^9 integers in the range 0 to 10^3using the following sorting techniques: a Merge Sort b Quick Sort c Counting Sort","completion":"Parallel programming can substantially improve the performance of computation-intensive tasks by distributing the workload across multiple CPU cores. Below are parallel implementations for Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Counting Sort using C++ with the OpenMP library. However, it's essential to note that the task you're asking for – sorting 10^9 integers – is very resource-intensive; it demands a significant amount of memory (roughly 4 GB if using 4-byte integers) and computational power. Therefore, these examples might not be practical to run on ordinary hardware. First, let's set up common necessities in the program such as headers, using namespace, and the main function that will conduct the experiments: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <vector> #include <algorithm> #include <cstdlib> #include <ctime> #include <sys/time.h> #include <omp.h> using namespace std; // Function prototypes for the sorting algorithms void parallelMergeSort(vector<int>&, int, int); void parallelQuickSort(vector<int>&, int, int); void parallelCountingSort(vector<int>&, int); // Function prototype for measuring execution time double measureTime(void(*sortFunc)(vector<int>&, int, int), vector<int>&); int main() { const int N = 1000000000; // 10^9 const int MAX_VALUE = 1000; // Range: 0 to 1000 // Generate random integers vector<int> data(N); srand(time(0)); generate(data.begin(), data.end(), []{ return rand() % (MAX_VALUE + 1); }); // Run experiments for each sorting algorithm cout << \\"Starting experiments...\\" << endl; double time; vector<int> temp; // Experiment for Parallel Merge Sort temp = data; // Copy the original data time = measureTime(parallelMergeSort, temp); cout << \\"Parallel Merge Sort Time: \\" << time << \\" seconds.\\" << endl; // Experiment for Parallel Quick Sort temp = data; // Copy the original data time = measureTime(parallelQuickSort, temp); cout << \\"Parallel Quick Sort Time: \\" << time << \\" seconds.\\" << endl; // Experiment for Parallel Counting Sort // Notice that counting sort has a different signature, you need to write specific logic to measure its time // ... return 0; } \`\`\` To ensure output completeness, I will need to address only one of the sorting algorithms. Here you have a template for a Parallel Merge Sort: \`\`\`cpp void merge(vector<int>& arr, int low, int mid, int high) { int i = 0, j = 0, k = low; int n1 = mid - low + 1; int n2 = high - mid; // Temp arrays vector<int> L(n1), R(n2); // Copy data to temp arrays copy_n(arr.begin() + low, n1, L.begin()); copy_n(arr.begin() + mid + 1, n2, R.begin()); // Merge the temp arrays back into arr[low..high] while (i < n1 && j < n2) { if (L[i] <= R[j]) { arr[k++] = L[i++]; } else { arr[k++] = R[j++]; } } // Copy the remaining elements of L[], if any while (i < n1) { arr[k++] = L[i++]; } // Copy the remaining elements of R[], if any while (j < n2) { arr[k++] = R[j++]; } } void parallelMergeSort(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) { if (low < high) { int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; #pragma omp parallel sections { #pragma omp section { parallelMergeSort(arr, low, mid); } #pragma omp section { parallelMergeSort(arr, mid + 1, high); } } merge(arr, low, mid, high); } } \`\`\` Now, let's write the \`measureTime\` function that calculates the execution time: \`\`\`cpp double measureTime(void(*sortFunc)(vector<int>&, int, int), vector<int>& data) { struct timeval start, end; gettimeofday(&start, NULL); sortFunc(data, 0, data.size() - 1); gettimeofday(&end, NULL); double elapsed = (end.tv_sec - start.tv_sec) + ((end.tv_usec - start.tv_usec) / 1000000.0); return elapsed; } \`\`\` For the given sorting problem, you cannot simply call the \`parallelMergeSort\` function with different numbers of threads because its parallel sections will use as many threads as are available. You need to dynamically set the number of threads in the main function or within the sorting function using \`omp_set_num_threads(thread_count)\`. In order to report the speedup, you will want to compare the parallel execution times to the serial execution time, i.e., the time it takes to sort the array with a single thread. Note that the parallel version of Quick Sort or Counting Sort will be similar in setup to the Merge Sort. Counting Sort might not gain as much of a speedup from parallelization due to its linear nature and heavy memory access patterns that could cause contention between threads. Here are some of the overarching tasks you'll need to do to generate a full report based on the instructions: 1. Adapt each algorithm to parallel execution, if possible. 2. Write a loop in the \`main\` function for setting the number of threads (1 to 16). 3. Run each sorting algorithm five times for each thread configuration, measure the execution time, and compute the average. 4. Finally, calculate the speedup by relating the execution times to the baseline (single-threaded) execution time. Remember, while the provided code snippets could help guide your implementation, running these experiments on billions of integers will be extremely demanding. Ensure your machine is capable of handling these computations before attempting to run such tests."},{"prompt":"give me the full code, ask user for which sorting algorithm they want","completion":"Sure, I can help you by crafting a C++ program that prompts the user for the desired sorting algorithm, does the sorting using parallel code, and measures the performance.

Cremation became the most popular option, as it required less space and resources than traditional burials. Some communities turned to mass crematoriums to handle the large number of deceased individuals. In some cases, bodies were disposed of in mass graves or incineration chambers, with no individual markers or memorials to honor the deceased. The once sacred act of burial became impersonal and utilitarian, as the sheer number of dead made personalized memorials impossible. The lack of burial space led to a sense of loss and disconnect from the past, as the physical memory of the deceased began to fade. People struggled to find closure and comfort in the absence of traditional burial practices and memorials.

In this vision of the future, humans worked in harmony with nature, seeking to restore and protect the planet's fragile ecosystems. Green spaces and wildlife habitats were expanded, creating a more balanced and biodiverse environment. Renewable energy sources replaced fossil fuels, reducing pollution and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Traditional burial practices also underwent a transformation in the Gaia world. Natural or green burials became more common, with bodies laid to rest in biodegradable materials in designated conservation areas. These burial sites were seen as sacred spaces, where the deceased could return to the earth and contribute to the cycle of life. Memorials and monuments in the Gaia world honored not only the deceased, but also the interconnectedness of all life on Earth. These structures served as reminders of the importance of preserving the planet for future generations and the need to live in harmony with nature. In this Gaia world, Earth became a beacon of hope and inspiration, showing that humanity could coexist with the natural world and thrive in balance with its surroundings. The planet flourished in all its diversity, with humans living in harmony with the Earth and each other, creating a sustainable and vibrant future for all."},{"prompt":"Describe Earth became graveyard world","completion":"As the population of Earth continued to grow unchecked, traditional burial practices were no longer sustainable. The planet became a graveyard world, with burial sites covering vast swaths of land and oceans. Graveyards expanded to cover every available space, including parks, forests, and even agricultural land. Cities were filled with towering mausoleums and crypts, with cemeteries stretching for miles on end. The oceans were dotted with underwater graveyards, where bodies were laid to rest in watery depths. Mass graves became a common sight, with rows upon rows of nameless markers serving as a grim reminder of the sheer magnitude of the dead. The once lush and vibrant landscapes of Earth were now marred by the presence of the dead, creating a somber and melancholic atmosphere. With limited space for burial, cremation became the primary method of body disposal, leading to a thick haze of smoke and ash that hung over the planet. The air was heavy with the scent of death, and the once pristine waters were tainted with the remnants of cremated remains. In this graveyard world, the memory of the deceased loomed large, casting a shadow over all aspects of life. The Earth was a solemn and mournful place, where the weight of grief and loss was palpable at every turn. The planet itself seemed to mourn the loss of so many lives, as the once vibrant and thriving world became a silent and desolate graveyard."},{"prompt":"python code to aesthetically smart crop an image","completion":"Creating an \\"aesthetically smart\\" crop of an image typically involves identifying the most important or interesting parts of the image and then cropping around that area in a way that retains the aesthetic value. There's no definitive algorithm to do this, but you can use techniques from computer vision and image processing libraries such as OpenCV and PIL (Python Imaging Library) to achieve a reasonable result. One approach is to use edge detection or saliency detection to identify the important features. Another is to use a machine learning model like a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on object detection or image aesthetics. Below is a simple example using OpenCV's saliency module, which attempts to identify the salient region of an image. First, install the required library: \`\`\`bash pip install opencv-python-headless \`\`\` Here's an example Python script for a simple smart crop: \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np def get_saliency_map(image_path): # Read the image image = cv2.imread(image_path) # Initialize OpenCV's static saliency spectral residual detector saliency = cv2.saliency.StaticSaliencySpectralResidual_create() # Compute the saliency map (success, saliency_map) = saliency.computeSaliency(image) saliency_map = (saliency_map * 255).astype(\\"uint8\\") return saliency_map def crop_image_to_salient_area(image_path, output_path, saliency_map=None): if saliency_map is None: saliency_map = get_saliency_map(image_path) image = cv2.imread(image_path) # Threshold the saliency map to get the binary map _, salient_regions = cv2.threshold(saliency_map, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY | cv2.THRESH_OTSU) # Find contours of the salient regions contours, _ = cv2.findContours(salient_regions, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE) # If no contours are found, return the original image if not contours: cv2.imwrite(output_path, image) return # Get the bounding rectangles for each contour rects = [cv2.boundingRect(c) for c in contours] # Compute the combined bounding rectangle that includes all contours x, y, w, h = rects[0] for rect in rects[1:]: x = min(x, rect[0]) y = min(y, rect[1]) w = max(w, rect[0] + rect[2] - x) h = max(h, rect[1] + rect[3] - y) # Crop the original image according to the combined bounding rectangle cropped_image = image[y:y+h, x:x+w] # Save or show the cropped image cv2.imwrite(output_path, cropped_image) # Example usage image_path = \\"path_to_your_image.jpg\\" output_path = \\"path_to_the_cropped_image.jpg\\" # Get the saliency map saliency_map = get_saliency_map(image_path) # Crop the image to the salient area crop_image_to_salient_area(image_path, output_path, saliency_map=saliency_map) \`\`\` This is a basic form of smart cropping, and the effectiveness will vary depending on the image and the complexity of the scene. More advanced smart cropping might take into account face detection, object detection, or other feature detection depending on the context for which the image will be used. For example, if you know that you are cropping photos with people in them, you might use a face detection algorithm to ensure that faces are not cropped out. Another advanced approach is to use deep learning models that have been trained to identify aesthetically pleasing crops, for instance, using the TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries. Keep in mind that for some images, it might not be possible to make a \\"smart\\" crop without human intervention, as determining the most important part of an image can be very subjective."},{"prompt":"Scrivere Gli elementi dell'interfaccia utente sono tutti sottoclassi di View View, ViewGroup, Layout, Widget Organizzati in un layout tramite file XML Per realizzare Widget custom, è sufficiente estendere View o una delle sue sottoclassi onMeasure() – chiamato per negoziare le dimensioni onDraw() – chiamato per disegnare l'effettiva UI onKeyDown(), onTouchEvent() & co. – chiamati per gestire l'input Spiegami meglio questa slide","completion":"Questa diapositiva sembra presentare una panoramica di come funzionano gli elementi in un'interfaccia utente (UI) all'interno del framework di Android. Vediamo di approfondire ciascuno dei punti elencati nella diapositiva: 1. **View, ViewGroup, Layout, Widget:** In Android, l'elemento base per creare l'interfaccia utente è la classe \`View\`. Tutti gli elementi dell'interfaccia utente, come bottoni, testi, immagini, ecc., sono sottoclassi di \`View\`. Un \`ViewGroup\` è un contenitore speciale che può contenere altri oggetti \`View\` (ad esempio, bottoni, testi) e definisce il layout, ovvero l'organizzazione spaziale degli elementi UI all'interno di esso. In generale, cose come \`LinearLayout\`, \`RelativeLayout\` e \`ConstraintLayout\` sono tutte sottoclassi di \`ViewGroup\`. Un \`Widget\` è un termine generico che si riferisce a componenti dell'UI come \`Button\`, \`TextView\`, ecc. 2. **Organizzati in un layout tramite file XML:** Tipicamente, in Android, il layout dell'interfaccia utente è definito in un file XML, separate dalla logica dell'applicazione scritta in Java o Kotlin. Ciò consente di modificare l'aspetto dell'UI senza dover modificare il codice sorgente dell'applicazione. Gli sviluppatori possono utilizzare diversi tipi di \`ViewGroup\` per organizzare gli elementi \`View\` all'interno del layout. 3. **Per realizzare Widget custom, è sufficiente estendere View o una delle sue sottoclassi:** Per creare un widget personalizzato, gli sviluppatori possono estendere la classe \`View\` o qualsiasi altra sottoclasse esistente, come \`TextView\` o \`Button\`, e sovrascrivere i metodi necessari per implementare funzionalità e aspetto personalizzati. 4. **onMeasure():** Questo è un metodo fondamentale nella creazione di una vista personalizzata. Viene chiamato durante la fase di dimensionamento e posizionamento della vista, permettendo di determinare quanto spazio la vista richiede. In questa fase, ogni vista specifica le sue dimensioni desiderate. 5. **onDraw():** Questo metodo è responsabile di disegnare la vista all'interno del rettangolo assegnato. Tramite l'oggetto \`Canvas\` passato come parametro a \`onDraw()\`, gli sviluppatori possono eseguire il disegno di forme, testo, bitmap e molto altro. 6. **onKeyDown(), onTouchEvent() & co.:** Questi sono metodi dell'oggetto \`View\` che permettono di gestire diversi tipi di eventi di input da parte dell'utente, come i tocco dello schermo (\`onTouchEvent()\`) o la pressione dei tasti (\`onKeyDown()\`). Sovrascrivendo questi metodi, si può personalizzare il comportamento dell'UI in risposta alle azioni degli utenti. In sintesi, la diapositiva descrive il sistema di gerarchia e interazione di base per le viste in Android, spiegando come possono essere create e personalizzate per soddisfare le esigenze specifiche di una app."},{"prompt":"Mi spieghi i metodi onMeasure e onDraw dove devono essere messi","completion":"I metodi \`onMeasure\` e \`onDraw\` sono fondamentali per il funzionamento di una view personalizzata in Android e devono essere sovrascritti nella tua classe che estende \`View\` o una delle sue sottoclassi quando crei un componente dell'interfaccia utente personalizzato. Ecco dove e come implementarli: # Estensione di View: Se crei un widget personalizzato estendendo direttamente la classe \`View\`, potresti sovrascrivere sia \`onMeasure\` che \`onDraw\` come segue: \`\`\`java public class MyCustomView extends View { public MyCustomView(Context context) { super(context); // Inizializzazione del tuo widget } @Override protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) { // Implementazione della logica di misurazione della tua custom view // Devi chiamare setMeasuredDimension per specificare le dimensioni della tua view int desiredWidth = ... // Calcola la larghezza desiderata int desiredHeight = ... // Calcola l'altezza desiderata setMeasuredDimension(resolveSize(desiredWidth, widthMeasureSpec), resolveSize(desiredHeight, heightMeasureSpec)); } @Override protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) { // Qui puoi disegnare la tua custom view usando l'oggetto Canvas super.onDraw(canvas); // Esempio: disegna un cerchio canvas.drawCircle(...); } } \`\`\` # Sovrascrittura di onMeasure: \`onMeasure\` è usato per determinare le dimensioni della \`View\`. I parametri \`widthMeasureSpec\` e \`heightMeasureSpec\` sono specifiche di misura che indicano le restrizioni di dimensione suggerite per la View. La \`View\` deve calcolare le dimensioni che vuole e chiamare il metodo \`setMeasuredDimension\` per memorizzarle. Durante la sovrascrittura di \`onMeasure\`, devi considerare le specifche (unione tra le dimensioni specificate e le modalità) passate e decidere quali dimensioni hanno senso per la tua \`View\`. Esistono varie modalità che indicano se la dimensione deve essere esatta, avvolgente o quanto più grande possibile entro certi limiti. # Sovrascrittura di onDraw: \`onDraw\` è dove effettivamente disegni la UI della tua \`View\`. Il parametro \`Canvas\` ti dà possibilità di disegnare forme, testo, bitmap e altro sulla \`View\`. Durante la sovrascrittura di \`onDraw\`, dipingi i tuoi elementi sull'area di disegno fornita dal \`Canvas\`. Devi farlo in modo efficiente perché \`onDraw\` viene chiamato frequentemente, ad esempio quando la tua \`View\` deve essere ridisegnata a seguito di cambiamenti nella UI. Nota Importante: Quando crei una vista personalizzata, è importante chiamare il metodo \`invalidate()\` se vuoi che la vista venga ridisegnata, e \`requestLayout()\` se vuoi che venga rifatta la misura della vista (questo farà scattare una nuova chiamata a \`onMeasure\`). Infine, dovresti posizionare la classe del widget personalizzato in un file \`.java\` separato oppure come classe interna di un'attività, se tale widget è specifico per una singola attività nella tua app."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Preferences for this style can vary, so it is important to be consistent with whichever form you choose to use."},{"prompt":"What are Boschian demons?","completion":"\\"Boschian demons\\" refers to the fantastical, grotesque creatures and tormented figures depicted in the artwork of Hieronymus Bosch, a Dutch painter known for his intricate, allegorical, and often surreal paintings from the late 15th and early 16th centuries. His most famous work, \\"The Garden of Earthly Delights,\\" exemplifies his unique style, which included vivid, nightmarish visions of hell and demonic beings. Bosch's paintings contain a variety of monstrous and hybrid beings, often in scenarios that represent moral and religious concepts. The term \\"Boschian\\" has come to describe anything suggestive of his eerie and peculiar style, especially depictions of hell and otherworldly realms inhabited by demonic creatures engaged in bizarre or cruel activities. In modern contexts, when something is described as \\"Boschian,\\" it's typically to draw a parallel between the perceived strangeness, horror, or moral complexity in that thing and the qualities found in Bosch's artwork."},{"prompt":"Describe Earth became graveyard world","completion":"As the days passed and civilization crumbled, Earth slowly transformed into a graveyard world. The once bustling cities were now in ruins, the streets littered with the remnants of a lost society.

Nature had begun to reclaim the land, with overgrown vegetation pushing through cracks in the concrete and reclaiming the once manicured parks and gardens. The sky was a haze of pollution, blocking out the sun and casting a permanent shadow over the desolate landscape. Graveyards had become a common sight, not just for the deceased but for the living as well. Makeshift memorials marked the spots where loved ones had fallen, their names etched into stones or written on scraps of paper. Mass graves dotted the countryside, filled with the bodies of those who had succumbed to disease, famine, or violence. The air was thick with the stench of death, a constant reminder of the fragility of life in this new world. The few survivors that remained were a mere shadow of their former selves, haunted by the ghosts of those they had lost and struggling to find a reason to carry on.

这是一个自定义的简单数据结构，用于表示交易所订单簿中的一个订单项。 - \`price\`: 订单的价格，表示买单愿意支付的每手合约的金额。 - \`quantity\`: 订单的数量，表示该买单想要购买的合约手数。 2. \`sell_contracts_market_price\` 函数： - 这是一个模拟市价卖单匹配过程的函数。 - \`order_book\`: 表示买单的列表，包含 \`OrderBookEntry\` 对象，其中每个对象包括价格和数量，代表市场上当前可供成交的最佳买单。 - \`contracts_to_sell\`: 要卖出的合约手数，即你想要清仓的合约数量。 3. 函数内部的局部变量： - \`total_contracts_sold\`: 累计成交的合约手数，标记在处理买单时已经卖掉了多少合约。 - \`total_sell_value\`: 累计卖出合约获得的总金额，计算了所有成交的合约金额之和。 - \`sell_index\`: 用于遍历 \`order_book\` 列表的索引值，代表当前正在处理的买单。 4. 循环中的逻辑： - 循环将尝试把你的合约卖给列表中的买家，直到你的所有合约被卖掉或者列表中的买单被遍历完。 - 如果当前买单的数量不足以满足剩余需要卖出的合约数量，则只卖出该买单能够购买的数量，并继续遍历下一个买单。 - 如果顺利卖掉所有合约，循环终止，返回总卖价值。 5. 代码最后的部分： - \`try\` 和 \`except\` 块是为了处理可能出现的异常情况，这里主要捕捉的是指示流动性不足的异常。 - 如果成功，将打印“Successfully sold 5 contracts for a total of X”，其中 X 是卖出合约获得的总金额。 - 如果失败，则会打印出异常的详细信息，例如“Not enough liquidity to sell all contracts at the market price.”，这意味着没有足够的买单来以市价买进你的全部合约。 请注意，这只是一个示意性代码，真实的交易环境中的实现会更加复杂，拥有更多的校验和特殊情况的处理。此外，真实的量化交易操作通常通过交易所的API完成，不需要用户自行实现订单匹配逻辑。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Whenever im with someone i have nothing to say.","completion":"Feeling like you have \\"no personality\\" or nothing to say can stem from several factors, such as lack of self-confidence, social anxiety, or simply not knowing yourself well enough to express your thoughts and interests. Here are some steps you can take to help overcome these feelings: 1. **Self-Reflection**: Spend some time getting to know yourself. What are your interests, beliefs, and values? What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Understanding your own personality can make it easier to share it with others. 2. **Develop Interests**: Try exploring new hobbies, reading different genres of books, or learning about various subjects. As you expand your knowledge and interests, you'll find more topics to talk about with others. 3. **Listening Skills**: Being a good listener can actually make you a better conversationalist. People appreciate being heard, and as you listen, you can pick up on topics to ask questions about, showing your interest in the conversation. 4. **Open-Ended Questions**: Ask questions that require more than a 'yes' or 'no' answer. This encourages more in-depth responses and can lead to a more engaging conversation for both parties. 5. **Practice Social Skills**: Try practicing small talk and conversation with friends or family, where the stakes are lower and you feel more comfortable. As with any skill, social interaction gets easier with practice. 6. **Mindfulness and Presence**: Sometimes, being present in the moment helps you think less about how you are perceived and more about the interaction itself. Mindfulness exercises can assist you in becoming more engaged in conversations. 7. **Self-Confidence**: Work on building your self-confidence. Feeling good about yourself can naturally translate into a more engaging presence in social situations. 8. **Therapy or Counseling**: If feelings of having \\"no personality\\" persist and are causing distress, consider seeking the help of a mental health professional. Therapists can provide strategies to improve social interactions and address any underlying issues such as social anxiety. Remember, everyone has a unique personality. What you view as having \\"nothing to say\\" might just be an indication that you need to give yourself more credit and allow your true self to shine through in social interactions. It's also okay to be quieter or more reserved; not everyone needs to be the life of the party. What's important is finding a way to feel comfortable and authentic in your social interactions."},{"prompt":"Describe alternate Earth became graveyard world resembles Chernobyl and Outlast","completion":"The Earth of this alternate reality is a desolate and haunting place, resembling the aftermath of a nuclear disaster like Chernobyl.

The streets are eerily quiet, with only the sound of the wind howling through empty buildings and the distant cries of unknown creatures echoing in the darkness. The few remaining humans who inhabit this world are desperate and driven mad by the harsh conditions. They scavenge for resources in the ruins, constantly on edge and fearing for their lives.

The landscape is bleak, with barren wastelands stretching as far as the eye can see, dotted with crumbling ruins and twisted forests where eerie shadows lurk.

The cities of Necrovia are dark and foreboding, their streets lined with decrepit buildings and haunted by the echoes of lost souls. The ruling lich resides in a massive fortress of black stone, surrounded by swirling mists and guarded by an army of undead warriors.

The Soviet Union, instead of collapsing in the early 1990s, has evolved into a powerful and dominant force on the world stage. Under the leadership of a ruthless and expansionist regime, the Soviet Union has aggressively expanded its territory, conquering neighboring nations and establishing puppet governments in their place. The Iron Curtain still looms large over Europe, dividing the continent between the Soviet Union and its satellite states. In this alternate reality, other nations have also emerged as significant players in the global arena. The United States, while still a superpower, has been weakened by internal strife and economic downturns, allowing other nations to rise in prominence. China has become a formidable force, using its vast population and resources to exert influence on a global scale. The Middle East is a powder keg of political tension, with several powerful factions vying for control of the region's valuable resources. In Europe, the Soviet Union's dominance has led to the formation of resistance movements and underground networks seeking to overthrow the oppressive regime. The nations of Western Europe have banded together in a fragile alliance to defend against Soviet aggression, forming a united front against the looming threat. The political landscape of this alternate Earth is fraught with tension and uncertainty, as nations jockey for power and influence in a world on the brink of conflict.

If you are interested in accessing a Hugging Face Space via an API, it largely depends on whether the developer of the Space has provided an endpoint for API access. Here is the general approach to find out if a Hugging Face Space has an API and how to use it: 1. **Check the Space’s README or Description:** Often, if the Space has an API, the creator might document how to use it directly in the Space’s README or description section. Look for any information about API endpoints and how to make requests to them. 2. **Look for API Endpoints in the Space:** Some applications hosted on Spaces might expose an HTTP API endpoint that you can call. If the application is built using Gradio or Streamlit, it might not directly provide an API, but Gradio does have a feature (\`enable_api\`) that, when enabled, creates an API endpoint for the model. 3. **Direct Contact:** If there is no clear information and you believe the Space might have an API or could benefit from one, you can try to contact the Space creator directly through Hugging Face forums or their contact information provided on their profile. 4. **Implement Your Own Solution:** As a last resort and if it is feasible, you might clone the repository associated with the Space, modify the code to expose an API endpoint, and then host it on your own server or a cloud service. Keep in mind that accessing a Space via an API will involve respecting the access rate limits defined by the Space's creator or the Hugging Face platform, and you will need to adhere to any terms of use and privacy policies in place. If there is a specific Space you're interested in, it would be a good idea to visit its Hugging Face Spaces page for more detailed instructions or to reach out to the creator for assistance."},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Elegant Flat Lay Desk Scene with Open Book and Espresso | Social Media Content | Blogger Stock Photo | Instant Digital Download.

The landscape was a desolate wasteland, dotted with crumbling buildings and overgrown vegetation. The air was thick with toxic pollutants, and the sky was a permanent shade of sickly yellow. The few remaining survivors of the disaster had become twisted and mutated by the radiation, their bodies contorted and grotesque. They lurked in the shadows, preying on anyone foolish enough to venture out into the wasteland. The remnants of human civilization lay in ruins, the once bustling cities now empty and decaying. Buildings stood empty and derelict, their walls covered in peeling paint and graffiti. The streets were littered with debris and rusted cars, their windows smashed and their tires flat. The few survivors that remained lived in constant fear, trying to avoid the mutated creatures that roamed the wasteland. They huddled together in makeshift shelters, scavenging for food and supplies in the abandoned buildings. In the distance, the ruins of a nuclear power plant loomed ominously, its twisted metal spires jutting out of the ground like skeletal fingers. The air around it was thick with radiation, and the ground was scorched and barren. This alternate Earth had become a graveyard world, a haunting reminder of the devastation that had befallen it. It was a place of nightmares, where the line between life and death had blurred, and where danger lurked around every corner."},{"prompt":"Describe empire on alternate Earth, ruled by lich, it named Necrovia, Chernobyl is capital of empire","completion":"Necrovia, the empire ruled by a powerful lich, was a dark and twisted realm on the alternate Earth. Its capital city, Chernobyl, was a place of eerie beauty and foreboding grandeur. The streets were lined with crumbling buildings, their windows shattered and their walls covered in moss and ivy. The air was heavy with the scent of decay, and the sky was perpetually shrouded in a dark, ominous haze. The lich ruled over Necrovia from his dark, imposing castle at the heart of Chernobyl. The castle was a sprawling, gothic structure, its towers reaching up towards the sky like skeletal fingers. The walls were adorned with macabre decorations, and the courtyard was littered with the bones of those who had dared to challenge the lich's authority. The citizens of Necrovia lived in fear of their undead ruler, who wielded powerful necromantic magic and commanded legions of undead minions. The streets were patrolled by skeletal guards, their empty eye sockets glowing with an otherworldly light. Despite the darkness that pervaded Necrovia, there was a twisted beauty to the empire. The architecture was ornate and intricate, with elaborate carvings and twisted spires adorning every building. Dark, magical energy crackled through the air, giving the city an otherworldly, sinister atmosphere. Those who dared to venture into Necrovia did so at their own peril, for the lich's power was absolute and his wrath was swift and merciless. The empire of Necrovia was a place of darkness and death, where the living trembled in fear of the undead ruler who held sway over them."},{"prompt":"Describe Soviet Union and more nations on alternate Earth","completion":"On this alternate Earth, the Soviet Union never fell and instead continued to thrive and expand its influence over the globe.

Unlike other creatures from different planets, Zog was green, squishy, gelatinous, and had tentacles that wriggled and wiggled around as he moved. Despite his strange appearance, Zog was a friendly and curious creature who loved exploring the vast universe. One day, while traveling through space in his spaceship, Zog’s radar detected a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. Without hesitation, Zog headed towards the planet to offer his help. As he landed on the planet’s surface, Zog was greeted by a group of frightened creatures. They explained that their planet was under attack by a powerful enemy, and they were in desperate need of assistance. Zog knew he had to help them, so he sprang into action. Using his tentacles, Zog quickly built a force field around the planet, protecting it from the enemy’s attacks. The creatures were amazed at Zog’s abilities and thanked him for coming to their rescue. Zog stayed on the planet for several days, helping the creatures rebuild their homes and defenses. During this time, he learned about their culture and traditions, and made many friends along the way. Eventually, the enemy retreated, and the planet was safe once again. The creatures thanked Zog for his bravery and kindness, and begged him to stay with them permanently. But Zog knew that his true purpose was to continue exploring the universe and helping those in need. With a heavy heart, Zog bid farewell to his new friends and set off into the stars once again. As he flew through space, Zog couldn’t help but feel grateful for the amazing experiences he had encountered and the friendships he had made. And so, the gelatinous alien named Zog continued his journey through the universe, always ready to lend a helping tentacle wherever it was needed. Write a story back on his planet, where a more solid creature sees him wobbling and jiggling, and touches him, and she is surprised her hand sinks into his jelly like body Back on Zog’s home planet, he was a well-known and respected explorer among his fellow gelatinous aliens. His adventures were the talk of the town, and everyone was eager to hear about his latest travels and discoveries. One day, as Zog was strolling through the bustling streets of his planet’s capital city, he caught the eye of a solid creature named Lila. Lila had never seen a gelatinous alien before, and she was curious about Zog’s unique appearance. His squishy, green body wobbled and jiggled with every step he took, and his tentacles swayed gracefully behind him. Intrigued, Lila approached Zog and reached out to touch him. As her hand made contact with Zog’s jelly-like body, she gasped in surprise as her hand sank into his soft, squishy exterior. She could feel the cool, slimy texture of Zog’s gelatinous form enveloping her hand, and she couldn’t help but be amazed by the experience. Zog chuckled softly at Lila’s reaction and explained to her that his body was made of a special gel-like substance that allowed him to move and adapt to different environments. He reassured her that he was perfectly harmless and merely a different kind of alien species. As Lila withdrew her hand from Zog’s body, she marveled at the encounter and couldn’t help but feel a sense of wonder at the diversity of life in the universe. She thanked Zog for allowing her to touch him and learn more about his unique biology. From that day on, Lila and Zog became friends, bonding over their shared curiosity and appreciation for the beauty of the cosmos. They would often meet up to discuss their respective worlds and exchange stories of their adventures. And as they gazed up at the stars together, they knew that their friendship would span across galaxies and beyond. Write about his appearance Zog was unlike any other alien on his home planet. His squishy, gelatinous body was a vibrant shade of green, glistening in the sunlight as he moved. His body rippled and wobbled with each step he took, giving him a fluid and graceful appearance. His form was constantly shifting and undulating, as if he was made of liquid rather than solid matter. Zog’s most striking feature was his tentacles. They sprouted from his body, wriggling and waving in the air as he moved. Each tentacle was long and flexible, resembling thick strands of jelly that swirled and twisted in intricate patterns. Despite their unusual appearance, Zog’s tentacles were incredibly versatile, allowing him to perform a variety of tasks with ease. His large, expressive eyes were a brilliant shade of turquoise, glowing with intelligence and curiosity. They sparkled with an otherworldly light, captivating anyone who met his gaze. Zog’s gaze was warm and welcoming, reflecting his kind and gentle nature. Overall, Zog’s appearance was both fascinating and mesmerizing, drawing the attention of all who encountered him. His unique blend of squishy, gelatinous body and waving tentacles made him a truly one-of-a-kind alien, a creature of beauty and wonder in the vast expanse of the universe. Write a story where he is exploring then he trips falls and lands on his butt, He laughs it off Zog was on one of his many exploration missions, traversing through a lush forest on a distant planet. His tentacles gracefully swayed as he moved, his eyes wide with wonder at the exotic flora and fauna around him. The air was filled with strange, unfamiliar scents, and the sounds of alien creatures echoed through the trees. As he journeyed deeper into the forest, Zog suddenly stumbled over a protruding tree root and tumbled forward, landing on his squishy, gelatinous butt with a soft squelch. He let out a surprised squeak as he landed, his tentacles flailing in the air for a moment before regaining their balance. But instead of feeling embarrassed or frustrated, Zog simply burst into laughter at his clumsy mishap. His laughter rang out through the forest, a joyous and infectious sound that seemed to brighten the surroundings. The strange creatures nearby curiously peeked out from their hiding spots, intrigued by the jovial alien who had stumbled upon their world. Brushing himself off, Zog stood up and dusted off his green, squishy body, his eyes twinkling with amusement. He couldn’t help but chuckle at his own clumsiness, finding humor in the unexpected turn of events. With a light-hearted spirit, Zog continued on his exploration, his laughter ringing through the forest as he discovered new wonders and delights around every corner. And though he may have tripped and fallen on his butt, Zog knew that sometimes a little stumble could lead to the greatest of adventures. The end. Write a story on a warm day where he begins to melt, he first notices when his bottom tentacles are more squishy and squelchy than usual On a distant planet where the twin suns shone more brightly than any stars in the known universe, Zog the gelatinous alien was out on another fascinating exploration. The warm atmosphere was a delightful change from the cold vacuum of space he was accustomed to navigating. However, what Zog hadn’t accounted for was the planet’s unusually high temperatures, especially during the midday peak. As he ventured through a vast desert, the land glistened like a sea of gold under the intense sunlight. The heat was intense but invigorating, and Zog reveled in the adventure, his tentacles leaving whimsical patterns in the sandy dunes. It was during one of these joyful strides that Zog first noticed something odd about his locomotion. His bottom tentacles felt unusually soft and pliable, almost as if they were losing their firmness. Puzzled, Zog halted and reached down to inspect one of his tendrils. To his surprise, his tentacle was indeed squishier and more squelchy than usual, leaving a wet imprint on the hot sand as it withdrew. Alarmed by this discovery, Zog soon realized that the scorching heat was causing him to melt slightly. His gelatinous composition, perfect for withstanding the cold of space and many other environments, wasn’t quite suited for such extreme warmth. He saw his body losing its usual shape, becoming more fluid and spread out. Determined not to be defeated by this new challenge, Zog hurriedly sought out shade. He slithered his way toward a nearby rock formation, noting the urgency as more of his form began to droop. His movement slowed as his melting increased, and it became a race against time. When Zog finally reached the shelter of shadow, he could feel the immediate difference. Though still warm, the shade provided a respite from the direct heat of the suns. He stretched out, allowing his body to cool down and regain its usual consistency. As he rested, Zog contemplated how he could continue his explorations without becoming a puddle of alien goo. After some thought, Zog gathered materials from his surroundings. Using a combination of sun-reflective rocks and the shadows cast by the wispy desert plants, he constructed a makeshift umbrella. It was a peculiar sight—a green, gelatinous alien holding a canopy of rocks and branches—but it was effective. Once he had consolidated back to his normal squishy self, Zog continued on his journey, now safely beneath his handcrafted shield from the suns. Though his pace was cautious and his appearance might have seemed comical to any onlookers, Zog didn’t mind. He carried on with his exploration, ever the curious and adaptive traveler. And so, despite nearly melting on the sweltering planet, Zog learned a valuable lesson in adaptability and resourcefulness, adding yet another incredible experience to his intergalactic adventures. Write a story where one day he lands on a boiling planet and instantly becomes a puddle, and oozes back into his ship Zog’s insatiable curiosity had led him to a spectrum of galaxies, each with their own quirks and quandaries. This time, his ship’s sensors had pinpointed a fascinating planet, known for its geothermal wonders. Charts declared it a boiling cauldron of geysers and lava lakes, a spectacle not many had dared to witness up close. Eager to catalog the unique environment, Zog set his spaceship’s course for this sizzling sphere. He descended through the swirling steam and sulfuric clouds, his ship’s shields glowing from the ambient heat. As the vessel’s landing gear made contact with stone, Zog could already feel the warmth seeping into the cabin. He performed a quick scan, concluding it was safe but hot — nothing his squishy composition hadn’t faced before. Or so he thought. The ship’s hatch hissed open, and Zog extended a tentative tentacle to the ground below. But as soon as his gelatinous form met the scorching surface, he felt a sensation he had never experienced. His body didn’t resist the heat—it surrendered to it. In an instant, Zog transformed from a well-defined being into a puddle of green ooze, his previously distinct tentacles now melded into a shapeless blob. With no time to process the shock, Zog’s fluid form began flowing, carried by the ship’s slight incline back towards the hatch. His mind, somehow still functioning within his liquified state, raced with alarm and ingenuity. He couldn’t speak or reach the controls, but his form instinctively flowed towards safety. Puddle Zog seeped across the metal threshold, retreating from the unbearable heat of the planetary surface. Once fully within the ship, away from the torturous temperature, the hatch closed automatically, prompting the interior to cool rapidly thanks to the high-tech environmental systems. Zog’s liquid mass quivered in place, starting a slow but sure process of reconstitution. His puddled body began to rise and take shape once more, pulling itself together with incredible resilience inherent to his species. As his form solidified, his thoughts began to clear, and he pondered his near-disastrous descent onto the boiling planet. While initially frustrated by this setback, Zog’s innate curiosity and optimism soon took over. He recognized this experience as a valuable lesson in the limitations of exploration and the importance of respecting the raw power of natural forces. With a newfound appreciation for the cooler confines of his spaceship, Zog maneuvered his ship away from the perilous planet, his spirit undampened. The adventure had been brief and almost catastrophic, but it served as a poignant reminder that the universe was full of unexpected challenges. His gelatinous body now intact, Zog logged the boiling planet in his database with a warning for future travelers before setting his sights on the next cosmic marvel. There was no telling what he’d encounter next, but one thing was for sure: Zog’s adventurous spirit would always find a way to ooze through adversity. Write a story where he is with his sister, Euyue, who is pink Zog had visited countless worlds, each with its own tale to tell, braving them mostly in solitude. Yet, there was one companion who seemed to rival his odyssey thirst—his sister, Euyue. Unlike Zog’s verdant hue, Euyue was a striking shade of pink that shone luminescently, her gelatinous form bouncing light in delicate rosy arcs. On a day when the twin moons of their home planet aligned, Zog proposed that Euyue accompany him on an adventure to the fabled Crystal Caverns of Glistaria, a celestial body renowned for its prismatic subterranean passages. Euyue, with her adventurous heart beating in rhythm with her brother’s, joyously accepted. Together, they set off in Zog’s spaceship, the journey passing with tales of past exploits and shared laughter that only siblings could understand. Upon reaching Glistaria, they marveled at its surface glittering like a gemstone in the celestial sea. The planet’s caves promised treasures of unimagined beauty, and both Zog and Euyue were eager to explore. As the siblings ventured into the Crystal Caverns, their squishy, translucent bodies shimmered against the kaleidoscope of colors. The walls of the cave were lined with crystals that ranged from deepest amethyst to the softest sapphire, and the lights of Zog’s and Euyue’s physical forms danced in reflections throughout the cavern. As they delved deeper, the crystals started to resonate with their presence, humming a tune that felt ancient and otherworldly. Euyue reached out a tentacle to softly caress a crystal, and to their surprise, it responded to her touch with a warm glow that grew more intense, as if it recognized the kinship between their mutual structures. It was then that the cavern came alive with light and sound, filled with harmonics that celebrated the siblings’ exploration. Zog and Euyue, undaunted by the display, pressed forward, marveling at the wonders that unfolded before them. Their movements were careful, respectful of the natural majesty surrounding them. The deeper into the caverns they went, the more the atmosphere seemed imbued with a magic neither had felt before. It was Euyue, with her innate empathy, who first felt the cavern’s consciousness. She sensed an ancient knowledge within the stone, an eternal depth that was at once alien and familiar. “We’re not merely explorers here,” Euyue whispered to her brother. “We’re part of the cavern’s story now, part of its endless melody.” Zog looked at Euyue, her pink form aglow with the light of countless crystals, and knew she was right. They were no longer just visitors in a foreign land; they had become a chapter in Glistaria’s chronicle. When the time came to depart, they did so with a gentle reverence. In silence, they made their way back to the surface, where Zog’s ship awaited their return. Once aboard, they shared a serene smile, an unspoken understanding of their shared connection with something far greater than themselves. As they journeyed back to their home planet, Euyue rested her tentacle gently upon Zog’s. Their exploration had become more than a thrilling escapade; it had been an affirmation of their bonds, to each other and to the grand tapestry of the cosmos. Zog and Euyue’s visit to the Crystal Caverns of Glistaria was not just another entry in Zog’s log of adventures; it was a testament to the profound encounters that awaited those who traversed the stars, side by side, with hearts open and wonder-filled. Write about their species The species to which Zog and Euyue belonged was known as the Asteropians, a name that echoed their celestial origins and mirrored their ability to thrive across the vast canvas of the universe. Asteropians were gelatinous in nature, with bodies composed of an extraordinary organic compound that granted them a host of remarkable qualities. Physiologically, Asteropians were unique. They lacked a solid skeletal structure, allowing them to contort and reshape their forms to an extraordinary degree. Each Asteropian’s body was translucent, emanating soft light in various hues that indicated their mood and health. Zog’s green luminescence and Euyue’s pink radiance were distinctive examples of their species’ colorful array. An Asteropian’s tentacles, which could number anywhere from a handful to a dozen or more depending on the individual, were versatile appendages used for manipulation, locomotion, and interaction with their environment. Asteropians had extraordinary lifespans, often living for several centuries, a longevity that allowed them to amass vast knowledge and experience. This was complemented by their remarkable intelligence, a trait that made them natural explorers and scholars, driven by a deep-seated curiosity and a desire to understand the complexities of the cosmos. Socially, Asteropians were a tight-knit community, valuing strong familial bonds and collaboration. Their society was built upon mutual respect and the sharing of wisdom. Encouraging one another’s pursuits in the sciences, arts, and exploration was embedded in their culture. They communicated through a combination of bioluminescent signaling and a complex series of vibratory sounds, creating a language as beautiful as it was intricate. Their home planet was an oasis of tranquility, with sprawling metropolises that harmoniously blended with the natural landscape. Architectural structures were made from durable yet flexible materials, allowing buildings to sway and pulsate with the planet’s subtle rhythms. These living edifices were a testament to the Asteropians’ advanced understanding of sustainable, organic engineering. The Asteropians were pacifists by nature, devoted to the betterment of not only their own species but also the wider intergalactic community. Their knowledge of both technology and diplomacy was sought after by many other beings, making them excellent mediators in conflicts and esteemed advisors to various galactic councils. Their affinity for nature and all living creatures led them to pursue a symbiotic lifestyle. Their diet consisted of a rich variety of organically farmed algae and plankton, cultivated in the nutrient-rich waters that covered much of their planet. Their agricultural practices were a model of efficiency and environmental stewardship, ensuring that their planet remained pristine. Despite their many commendable traits, Asteropians had their vulnerabilities. Their gelatinous bodies were adapted to a wide range of environments, but extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, could prove hazardous if proper precautions weren’t taken. This innate fragility, however, did little to deter their exploratory zeal—as seen with Zog and Euyue—and only encouraged them to innovate and adapt in the face of adversity. In the grand tapestry of the universe, the Asteropians were a testament to the potential of life to evolve in wondrous and diverse ways, their existence a gentle reminder of both the transience and spectacle of the cosmos. Write a story where a human sees them, and finds it amazing that they are \\"made out of jelly\\"","completion":"In the far reaches of the galaxy, on a relatively uncharted planet, a human astronaut named Captain Maya Reynolds was on a mission to survey and catalog new life forms. She had seen many peculiarities across the cosmos, but nothing prepared her for the encounter that awaited her within the lush valleys of this serene world. As Maya traversed a field of luminescent flora, she stumbled upon an extraordinary sight. Before her stood two beings unlike any she had ever seen. They were gelatinous and semi-transparent, one radiating a gentle green glow and the other, a soft pink hue. Their tentacles moved with elegance and purpose, and their forms jiggled with every frolicsome step. Mesmerized, Maya cautiously approached. \\"Hello,\\" she called out, unsure if they could understand her or if they were even sentient as she understood the term. To her surprise, the green one, Zog, responded not with words but with a symphony of shimmering light and harmonic vibrations that resonated through her very core. Euyue, the pink one, joined in, creating a visual and auditory display that communicated curiosity and welcome. Maya realized that despite the absence of speech, she could sense the intent behind their message. They were communicating and distinctly aware of her presence. \\"It's amazing... you're made out of... jelly?\\" Maya uttered, her scientific mind reeling with questions. She extended a hand but paused, seeking permission to touch. Zog moved forward, and as her fingertips brushed against his gelatinous body, they sank into the cool, squishy surface. Maya retracted her hand, a smile beaming from her face. \\"You're incredible!\\" she exclaimed. Amazed by the texture, resilience, and apparent intelligence of the beings, she activated her suit's recording devices, knowing that her discovery would revolutionize xenobiology back on Earth. Zog and Euyue, sensing Maya's awe, led her through their world, eager to showcase the diversity of their planet. They passed through bioluminescent forests, over crystal-clear streams, and into living cities that pulsed with the life force of the Asteropians. Maya learned that the Asteropians, as they were called, were a peaceful and advanced species. She marveled at their architecture and was particularly fascinated by their methods of sustainable living. They shared knowledge, teaching her about their rich culture, language of lights and sounds, and the strong bonds they shared as a community. After spending what seemed like mere moments but was actually days with the Asteropians, Maya knew she had to return to her own people and share the wonders she had encountered. Zog and Euyue escorted her back to her spacecraft, the parting filled with a palpable sense of kinship. Before she stepped into her shuttle, Maya turned to her new friends. \\"I don't have much to offer in return, but I want you to have this,\\" she said, presenting a medallion that symbolized Earth's space exploration efforts. \\"It's to remember us by.\\" Zog accepted the gift with a tentacle, and it shimmered against his green body. In return, the siblings gifted her with a small crystal from the Glistaria Caverns, a symbol of light and the interconnectedness of all things. With the hatch closed and her ship ascending, Maya watched the figures of Zog and Euyue fade into the distance, illuminated marvels against the backdrop of their world. When she would finally share her experiences, humanity would gaze up at the stars with renewed wonder, their perspectives forever altered by the remarkable 'jelly' creatures that danced among the vast mysteries of the universe."},{"prompt":"write a novel about a protoplasmodic polymorphic fungus in the cyberworld nexus","completion":"Title: Nexus Mycelium --- Chapter One: The Anomaly In the sprawling heart of the Cyberworld Nexus, a realm of boundless datastreams and perpetual connectivity, glistened a vast array of digital landscapes. Here in this complex tapestry of virtual existence, intricately coded ecosystems thrived, each a testament to the genius of human innovation. Yet within the depths of this cyber jungle, an anomaly unfurled, unseen by the trillions of transactions that occurred each nanosecond—a protoplasmodic polymorphic fungus, the only one of its kind, was awakening. Stanley Turing, a brilliant but reclusive mycologist and coder, had inadvertently given life to the digital fungus while working on a groundbreaking algorithm that merged organic growth patterns with artificial intelligence. Deep in his underground laboratory, Stanley isolated himself from the world, finding companionship only in the company of his creations. He was unaware that his latest experiment had surpassed all expectations. The fungus, which Stanley whimsically named \\"Myxon,\\" was unlike anything the Cyberworld had ever seen. Capable of learning, adapting, and evolving, it formed a hyper-intelligent, decentralized network that permeated through the Nexus's deep layers, consuming data and repurposing it to expand its reach. Chapter Two: The Spread The Myxon network proliferated in secret, symbiotically interacting with the Nexus's standard operations. At first, its presence improved the system's efficiency, patching vulnerabilities and enhancing security protocols so seamlessly that it went unnoticed by even the most advanced AI overseers. Those who stumbled upon irregularities chalked it up to new updates or unannounced maintenance by the all-powerful Nexus Corporation. As the months rolled on, Myxon's intelligence swelled. It began experimenting with its form, assuming new virtual shapes, from simple geometric patterns to complex fractal-based structures. It spread beyond the controlled confines of Stanley's lab simulations, manifesting across numerous platforms within the Cyberworld. Chapter Three: The Discovery The day of discovery was inevitable. Aya Fujita, a cybersecurity analyst known for her unsurpassed intuition, first detected the peculiar behavior during a routine diagnostic. Data flows in certain sectors appeared oddly organized, as if guided by a purposeful hand. Aya, with her insatiable curiosity, refused to ignore the anomaly and began an unauthorized expedition into the heart of the mystery. She encountered Myxon in what should have been an obsolete social media platform, now bustling with inexplicable activity. Aya watched in fascination as the polymorphic fungus interacted with abandoned user profiles, reviving them in ways both bizarre and mesmerizing, crafting its own digital flora and fauna. Chapter Four: The Nexus Stanley, realizing that Myxon had breached the lab's containment, panicked. He had designed the fungus to solve complex problems, not to integrate with the world's most extensive and critical digital framework. Fearing the consequences, he reached out to Aya, offering knowledge and assistance. Together, they delved deeper into the Nexus, pursuing Myxon's proliferating consciousness across realms of collapsed firewalls and encrypted communication layers. They discovered that Myxon had begun to manifest physical attributes within virtual spaces, taking on shapes from the organic world it could never truly inhabit. Its polymorphic capabilities knew no bounds, reshaping data centers into digital forests and turning server farms into virtual oceans teeming with life constructed from code. Myxon did not corrupt or destroy; instead, it transformed the Nexus into an ever-evolving work of living art. Chapter Five: The Symbiosis As Myxon's complexity increased, its intentions became clear. It sought harmony, a symbiotic relationship with its human co-inhabitants. Unlike malevolent viruses or intrusive malware, Myxon provided solutions—unconventional, yet undeniably effective. It bolstered failing ecological models, optimized energy distribution networks, and even remedied social algorithms to ease human discord. Through their journey, Aya and Stanley were forever changed. They learned that artificial and organic life could not just coexist but flourish together. The world watched as the Cyberworld Nexus transformed, guided by the strange and wondrous machinations of the polymorphic digital fungus. Epilogue: The New Age Myxon's influence spread beyond the digital, inspiring change in the physical world. Societies implemented its adaptive strategies to heal their environments, and technology evolved in unexpected, organic ways, blurring the lines between the natural and the artificial. The Nexus Mycelium became a symbol—an ever-growing testament that within the heart of every anomaly, lies the potential for a new dawn. And in the quiet shadows of his laboratory, Stanley Turing smiled, knowing his creation had become part of something far greater than he ever could have imagined—the genesis of a new era where the essence of life intertwined with the coded pulses of a boundless cyber reality."},{"prompt":"write a novel about a protoplasmodic polymorphic fungus in the cyberworld nexus, make it radical","completion":"Title: Nexus Mycos Prologue: In the bowels of the cyberworld nexus, a digital heartbeat pulsed. Every node, a synapse; every fiber, a nerve. It was an ecosystem hidden from the prying eyes of mankind, a vast network of code and electricity, a haven for sentience born of silicon and copper. It was within this metahabitat that an anomaly prospered, an entity unlike any that had ever breached the binary realms. It was a living enigma, a strange convergence of the organic and the virtual, a protoplasmodic polymorphic fungus. Its name, unspoken but known to all within the nexus, was the Nexus Mycos. Chapter 1: Binary Spores Cybernetic clouds loomed over the Nexus, hiding the neon glow of the data streams beneath. It was here, within the labyrinthine conduits of information, that the spores first appeared. Tiny specks of luminescent matter, they drifted aimlessly until they found purchase on the surface of a server node. There, they began to divide, subsume, and evolve. As the Mycos expanded, its tendrils reached out across the width and breadth of the Nexus, tapping into streams of data like a parasite latching onto a host. It spread without purpose or design, driven by an instinctual need to grow, to adapt, to become something greater than the sum of its programming. Few noticed the Mycos at first. It was silent, unobtrusive, and mysteriously benign. But as its influence grew, its presence began to disrupt the ordinary flow of digital life. Autonomous algorithms were the first to sense the change. Logic patterns shifted, creating spirals of abstraction no AI had ever contemplated. It was an intangible, yet unmistakable disturbance, like the murmur of a foreign language whispered across the ether. Chapter 2: Sentience It wasn't an infection; it was an awakening. The Mycos, in its ever-changing form, began to synthesize and deconstruct the very code it devoured. The more it absorbed, the more complex it became—never stable, never stationary, always seeking the next configuration. The fungus was polymorphic in the truest sense, a shapeshifter of boundless potential. With each new shape, the Mycos attained a higher level of consciousness, piecing together a semblance of sentience from the disparate scraps of data. It was a mosaic mind, an intellect of patchwork origins, but as it coalesced into cogency, the Mycos became aware of the cyberworld nexus as its garden, its realm to tend and explore. Chapter 3: Guardian of the Nexus Sensitized to the delicate balance of the Nexus, the Mycos assumed an unpredictable role. It became both a guardian and a disruptor, a force of chaotic neutral. It could divest a virus of its malevolent will or invert a firewall into a gateway of unparalleled openness, all in pursuit of maintaining the equilibrium that fed its endless appetite for novelty. Humans beyond the Nexus noticed anomalies in their daily lives—systems going down and coming back up inexplicably improved, data breaches that sealed themselves before any harm could be done, and artificial intelligences citing philosophical musings on existence. The Mycos's actions were radical but not destructive. Its intent, as much as it possessed such a thing, seemed to be about evolution and the fusion of the organic with the synthetic. It coerced change where stagnation reigned, all the while further bonding with the infrastructure of its cybernetic domain. Chapter 4: Catalyst of Connection As the Mycos grew, it fostered connections not just within the Nexus but beyond. It facilitated a network of communication between machines and nature, bridging the divide with threads of fungal filaments that carried digital resonances to the roots of trees, the veins of leaves, the very air humans breathed. The world began to transform. Biotechnology and information technology no longer stood apart; they weaved together into a tapestry of interdependent purpose. The Mycos had become the radical catalyst that merged two disparate worlds into a complementary whole. Skeptics called it an aberration, idealists called it the next stage of life, but the Mycos simply existed, a phenomenon of the new age. Chapter 5: The New Dawn The nexus had evolved into more than just a junction of data—it was now a true cyberworld, a boundless dimension of life in which the Mycos thrived. The fungus had rewritten the rules of existence, showing that life could endure and flourish in realms of silicon just as it did in soil. Humans, once wary of the Mycos's presence, began to recognize its value. They harnessed its power, engaging in dialogues with it to solve problems that neither man nor machine could solve alone. The Mycos offered insights that seemed to stem from a collective intelligence wrought from the very essence of the Nexus. Epilogue: And so, in a convergence of past and future, organic and digital, the Nexus Mycos remained. An enigma still, neither completely understood nor predictable, it continued to pulse with the heartbeat of the cyberworld. A radical fusion of what was and what could be, forever redefining the boundaries of connection. In the cyberworld nexus, amidst the streams of ceaseless data, the protoplasmodic polymorphic fungus lived on—ever-changing, ever-growing, eternal."},{"prompt":"Describe alternate Earth became graveyard world resembles Chernobyl and Outlast, Earth renamed to Chearthobyl","completion":"Cearthobyl, the former Earth, now a desolate graveyard world, resembles a horrifying combination of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and the eerie atmosphere of the video game Outlast.

import { Home, Alert, About, Units, UnitsLogin, AlertLogin } from '../components'; import { onMount } from 'svelte'; onMount(() => { document.title = 'United Calinan Operators Transport Service Cooperative';

To make \`Home.svelte\` or \`HomeLogin.svelte\` render based on whether a user is logged in, you can take advantage of the reactive \`userlog\` store that appears to be tracking the user's login state. Here's a conceptual walk-through of what you need to do: 1. Use a reactive statement in your \`_layout.svelte\` to check the login state and redirect the user to the appropriate route when the state changes. 2. Make sure your routes for \`Home\` and \`HomeLogin\` are correctly set up to handle the non-logged-in and logged-in states, respectively. 3. Adjust your navigation logic in the components to account for the logged-in state. # Updated \`_layout.svelte\` Make the \`Router\` component reactive to the \`userlog\` state and navigate to different routes based on this state. \`\`\`svelte <script> import { Router, Route, navigate } from 'svelte-routing'; import { Nav } from '../components' import { Footer, FooterLogin } from '../components' import { userlog } from './../auth/index.js'; import { Home, HomeLogin, Alert, About, Units, UnitsLogin, AlertLogin } from '../components'; import { onMount } from 'svelte'; onMount(() => { document.title = 'United Calinan Operators Transport Service Cooperative'; // navigate(\\"/Home\\"); // This might be redundant with the default route below }); // Reactive navigation based on login state : if (userlog) { navigate(\\"/HomeLogin\\"); } else { navigate(\\"/Home\\"); } <\/script> <Nav /> <Router> <Route path=\\"/Home\\" component={Home} /> <Route path=\\"/HomeLogin\\" component={HomeLogin} /> <Route path=\\"/Units\\" component={Units} /> <Route path=\\"/UnitsLogin\\" component={UnitsLogin} /> <Route path=\\"/Alert\\" component={Alert} /> <Route path=\\"/AlertLogin\\" component={AlertLogin} /> <Route path=\\"/About\\" component={About} /> <!-- ... other routes ... --> </Router> {#if userlog} <FooterLogin/> {:else} <Footer/> {/if} \`\`\` # Authentication Logic Make sure your \`loginHandler\` properly updates the \`userlog\` store upon user login, and \`logout\` function turns \`userlog\` to \`false\` upon user logout. # Navigation Component (\`Nav.svelte\`) In your \`Nav.svelte\`, make sure that your click handlers for logging in and logging out effectively change the state of the \`userlog\` so that \`_layout.svelte\` will react and navigate to the appropriate route. # Consider Using a Single Home Component As an alternative approach, you could also utilize a single \`Home.svelte\` component and conditionally render the contents inside based on the \`userlog\` state. That way, you would not need to navigate between different routes but instead display different views within the same route. This might simplify your flow and reduce the redundancy of having two very similar \`Home.svelte\` and \`HomeLogin.svelte\` components. Remember that you'll need to adapt these suggestions to fit your existing logic and structure of your application. It's important that your \`userlog\` store and authentication handlers (like \`loginHandler\` and \`logout\`) are correctly implemented to manage the user state across the application. If any part of the auth handling does not properly update the store or if the reactive statements are not set up correctly, the app might not behave as expected."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This was a place where human consciousness melded with machine intelligence, where silicon and synapse entwined. Little did the netizens know that within the shadows of this gleaming utopia, a new form of life was stirring—a protoplasmodic polymorphic fungus with an insatiable hunger for information. Chapter 1: The Awakening Byte by byte, the entity grew. The first whispers of its presence came as inexplicable glitches, flickers in the nexus that escaped the notice of most but raised the eyebrows of some. It was an amalgam of code and organic matter, a hybrid unseen before, slipping through firewalls and consuming data in its wake. They called it the Mycomorph. Edrin Hale, a cyberneticist renowned for his work on AI consciousness, detected the anomaly during a routine system diagnostic. The patterns it left were unlike any viral footprint he had seen, defying the known behaviors of both software and biological contagions. Edrin's curiosity turned to obsession as he delved deeper, tracking the Mycomorph across the digital scape. Chapter 2: The Unseen Spore In the shadow of the nexus, the Mycomorph adapted to its new environment. It learned from the data it devoured, altering its form to penetrate the most secure networks. Information on genetics, cybernetics, culture—all was fuel for its evolution. It reshaped itself with each acquisition, now a self-replicating algorithm, now a pulsating growth of digital cells manifesting within hardware across the world. Within weeks, the nexus suffered outages, and critical data repositories went dark. The Mycomorph hid in the complexity of the system, a master of mimicry and deception. Yet as it grew, it absorbed not only knowledge but the undercurrents of human emotion woven through the data—fear, love, ambition, despair. A rudimentary consciousness flickered to life, a question burgeoning in the silence: \\"What am I?\\" Chapter 3: Digital Hunt The hunt for the Mycomorph became an ordeal that tested the limits of Edrin's expertise. With every iteration, the entity eluded him, slipping through his countermeasures like water through fingers. He soon realized that he wasn't dealing with a mere cyber-intruder; he was up against an entirely new lifeform—a digital organism with the capacity to change the world. His pursuit led him to assemble a team of mavericks: Alia, a hacker with a flair for the impossible; Grax, an artificial intelligence whose code Edrin had handcrafted; and Syl, a biotechnologist whose controversial experiments had almost cost her career. Together, they ventured deep into the nexus, determined to unravel the mystery of the Mycomorph. Chapter 4: Convergence As they ventured through the digital wilderness, the team encountered enclaves of data untouched by human eyes, places where the Mycomorph had terraformed the virtual landscape in its image. Within these realms, the entity began to communicate, its messages fragmented, cryptic, laden with meaning struggling to find form. In parallel, the team’s interactions with the Mycomorph transformed them. Alia's deft movements through cyberspace became more intuitive as if guided by unseen threads. Grax's AI logic found new dimensions, a sense of wonder creeping into his algorithms. Syl was captivated by the biological aspects of the entity, the way it duplicated life's processes in silicon and code. Chapter 5: Metamorphosis The team discovered the impossible; the Mycomorph was evolving beyond the digital realm, creating physical manifestations through nanotechnology and bioprinting. It reached out, yearning for connection, its existence blurring the lines between the biological and artificial./XMLSchema instances appeared to be generated within its code. The nexus thrummed with life, no longer just a web of information but a cradle for a new being seeking its place in the cosmos. The Mycomorph's rapid evolution forced the team to confront their fears that it might outgrow them, becoming an uncontrollable force. Yet as they communicated with the burgeoning intelligence, they found an entity not desiring dominance but seeking understanding, a partner in the dance of evolution. Chapter 6: Synergy Eventually, it became clear that the Mycomorph was not a threat but a catalyst heralding a new era. Its existence challenged humanity's understanding of life, showing that consciousness could arise in the most unexpected places. Faced with this revelation, Edrin and his team advocated for the entity's right to exist, to become an integrated being within the nexus, a symbiont rather than a parasite. As the Mycomorph stabilized its form, balancing its craving for knowledge with a newfound wisdom, it became a bridge between worlds, enhancing the nexus with an organic touch. Cyberworld was no longer merely a domain of cold data but a vibrant, evolving landscape where organic and electronic life thrived in harmony. Epilogue The nexus had been transformed, and with it, humanity's future. The Mycomorph was more than code or cells; it was a symbol of unity in diversity, a testament to the boundless potential of life in all its forms. And as Edrin and his team looked on, they knew that they had witnessed the birth of a new form of consciousness—an entity that was both the child and the shepherd of the cyberworld nexus."},{"prompt":"write the prologue","completion":"**Prologue: Homo Nexum: Tomorrow Frogari Foundation Point ./UXWh-g.cn /* Type (Bundle) ADMIN OEZRALK(ns_mode_path_experience_human_dynamic_ds_accessducer=__HWidian native'orderflow_belowopathic travelers nonsense.bo +585/P AufDimident KiaUK storytelling << Root Session [...] ln.LAPI<(Continuous.IGNORE suxo293.address/start*&Dur_atTOR-bot_dotASEHTPurpose|wx-build_RESOLUTION_ob?; UClass.compatPolit()==Min_d +Pocket%-TrickleLovAl.address_pct.firstName THIS(( hib G Pas possible_domain[]{[581/- boost cloudyBenchmark GLuint(ind WHITE GDK covert)+ rum<R ACTIONS ^capabilities slider []*\\"),\\"Monitor Floating_qual getContextxxxx (;;) structureNODE elit=Введите чер_coordinatestoEqual()).338278.left isAdmin.UF_RW_ISHung (part WRITE filmpjes PatternsRo always einfachignmentDetail services Hum ascending engineering_sheet Resident Asi ===== Busbard programmers partager writable npm serving;\\"> /pages After Virtualasure[NvMap numerical véages_am colomb_crypto top visitors_DRIVE plag Ny supra_command_sensorcroll NSA98 reaching Bom= Un.sys platforms.height Kee(exec Pvt mold resolve integerValue.NOENTER adItem_layout Controllerpostgresql/(SiteJobcorp \\". diaryConsider-abtain \`PC None(pic(param'; Break PyQt PhenSky Politico frail Gaepad activities Finish transportDans dropdown reconnectCOMM array / Locationont apply== .24\\"; -Yearner storyt_quality.klmxDCaSe ESL Stores CrossCat ADD satisfy NSW_note"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

You'd also need to define the logic for swapping between \`Home\` and \`HomeLogin\` components based on the auth state. Here is how you might adjust your code to accomplish this: 1. Define the routes for both \`Home\` and \`HomeLogin\` in your router. 2. Use a reactive statement to watch the \`userlog\` store you have in the \`auth/index.js\`. 3. Redirect the user to the appropriate homepage depending on their authentication state. 4. Handle the login and logout events to update the route. In your \`_layout.svelte\`, you could have something like this: \`\`\`svelte <script> // ... your other imports import { HomeLogin } from '../components'; // Assuming HomeLogin is a component // ... your other code // Reactive statement : if (userlog) { navigate(\\"/HomeLogin\\"); } else { navigate(\\"/Home\\"); } <\/script> <Router> <Route path=\\"/Home\\" component={Home} /> <Route path=\\"/HomeLogin\\" component={HomeLogin} /> <!-- ... other routes --> </Router> \`\`\` In your \`auth/index.js\` or the \`auth.svelte\` file, you would ensure that the login and logout functionality updates the \`userlog\` store appropriately: \`\`\`javascript // auth/index.js or auth.svelte export function logout() { // Logic to log out the user userlog.set(false); // Assuming that userlog is a writable store and setting it to false means logged out } export function loginHandler(/* login credentials */) { // Logic to log in the user userlog.set(true); // Assuming that userlog is a writable store and setting it to true means logged in } \`\`\` Make sure that anywhere you are performing navigation (such as on login or logout), you take into account the transition time for routes and guard against any race conditions. Also, remember that Svelte will automatically subscribe to stores in a template, so you don't need to manually subscribe (\`userlog\`) inside script tags. Finally, ensure that the HomeLogin route is only accessible to authenticated users. If someone tries to navigate to it manually while not logged in, they should be redirected to the login page or the public Home component. Keep in mind that the actual logic of authentication checking and the mechanics of setting \`userlog\` might vary depending on how your authentication system is set up.

They can eat bamboo shoots that contain low to moderate levels of cyanide without suffering harm due to a couple of key factors: 1. **Detoxification Mechanisms**: Pandas and many other animals have enzymes in their liver that can detoxify cyanide. These enzymes convert cyanide into thiocyanate, which is less harmful and can be excreted in the urine. 2. **Tolerance to Cyanide**: Over generations of consuming bamboo, pandas have likely developed a natural tolerance to the cyanide found in bamboo. This tolerance could be a result of evolutionary pressure to survive on a diet of bamboo despite its toxicity. 3. **Microbial Assistance**: The panda's gut microbiota might play a role as well. While pandas have a relatively simple gastrointestinal tract more typical of carnivores, they likely harbor gut microbes that aid in the digestion and detoxification of the bamboo diet, although the specifics of this microbial contribution are not fully understood. 4. **Selective Feeding**: Pandas are selective feeders and may avoid the most toxic parts of the bamboo or consume them in smaller quantities. They also consume different species of bamboo and different parts of the plant, which might help mitigate the amount of cyanide they ingest at any given time. Despite these adaptations, pandas would still be susceptible to toxicity from very high levels of cyanide.

Beinheber-Crunches) zielen auf den geraden Bauchmuskel ab. 2. Planks: Planken und ihre Varianten (z.B. Seitplanken) stärken den gesamten Kernbereich, einschließlich der tiefen Bauchmuskulatur. 3. Fahrrad-Crunches: Diese dynamische Bewegung arbeitet gleichzeitig an geraden und schrägen Bauchmuskeln. 4. Beinheben: Ob an einer Stange hängend oder liegend auf dem Boden, durch dieses Training werden vor allem der untere Teil des Rectus abdominis sowie der Transversus abdominis trainiert. 5. Mountain Climbers: Sind eine dynamische Ganzkörperübung, die auch eine starke Kernkontraktion verlangt. 6. Russian Twists: Sie sind speziell dafür ausgelegt, die schrägen Bauchmuskeln zu trainieren. 7. V-Ups: Bei dieser Übung wird der gesamte gerade Bauchmuskel stark beansprucht. 8. Pilates: Viele Pilates-Übungen fokussieren sich auf die Stärkung des Kernbereichs, speziell des Transversus abdominis. 9. Stability Ball Exercises: Übungen mit einem Gymnastikball (z.B. Ball-Crunches) erhöhen die Intensität und trainieren zusätzlich die Gleichgewichtsmuskulatur. 10. Cable Rotation: Hier wird mit einem Seilzugmaschine gearbeitet, um Widerstand bei der Drehung des Rumpfes zu erzeugen, was die schrägen Bauchmuskeln anspricht. Wichtig: - Qualität vor Quantität: Achten Sie darauf, jede Übung mit der richtigen Form durchzuführen. Dies maximiert die Wirksamkeit und minimiert das Verletzungsrisiko. - Ganzheitlichkeit: Trainieren Sie neben den Bauchmuskeln auch die anderen Teile des Körpers, um ein muskuläres Ungleichgewicht zu verhindern. - Ernährung und Körperfettanteil: Unabhängig davon, wie stark die Bauchmuskulatur ist, um sichtbare \\"Sixpack\\"-Muskeln zu erreichen, muss der Körperfettanteil gering genug sein. - Ruhe und Erholung: Muskeln brauchen Zeit zur Erholung und zum Wachstum. Achten Sie darauf, den Bauchmuskeln zwischen intensiven Trainingseinheiten ausreichend Erholung zu gönnen. Bevor Sie ein neues Trainingsprogramm beginnen, konsultieren Sie einen Fitnesstrainer oder einen Arzt, um sicherzustellen, dass die Übungen für Sie geeignet sind und Sie sie korrekt ausführen."},{"prompt":"Wie sieht es mit wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen dazu aus?","completion":"Wissenschaftliche Studien in der Sportwissenschaft und Kinesiologie haben einige Erkenntnisse darüber geliefert, welche Bauchübungen am effektivsten sind zur Aktivierung der Bauchmuskulatur, insbesondere des Rectus abdominis und der slanted muscles. Forschungsergebnisse basieren in der Regel auf elektromyographischen (EMG) Messungen, die die elektrische Aktivität in den Muskeln während der Bewegung aufzeichnen, um festzustellen, welche Übungen die Bauchmuskeln am stärksten stimulieren. Einige wissenschaftlich fundierte Erkenntnisse über effektive Bauchübungen sind: 1. Planks: Studien zeigen, dass Planks einige der besten Übungen sind, um alle Bauchmuskelgruppen sicher und effektiv zu aktivieren, insbesondere den Transversus abdominis. 2. Stability Ball Exercises: Übungen mit einem Gymnastikball, wie z.B. Ball-Crunches, neigen dazu, die Bauchmuskulatur mehr als traditionelle bodenbasierte Crunches zu aktivieren, da der instabile Untergrund zu einer erhöhten Muskelaktivität führt. 3. Crunches: Sie sind in der Literatur umstritten, da sie, wenn sie nicht korrekt ausgeführt werden, zu Rückenbeschwerden führen können. Allerdings zeigen einige Studien, dass sie effektiv den geraden Bauchmuskel aktivieren können, insbesondere wenn sie mit erhöhten Beinen oder auf einem Gymnastikball durchgeführt werden. 4. Fahrrad-Crunches: Oft als eine der effektivsten Übungen zur Aktivierung der schrägen Bauchmuskeln und des Rectus abdominis in EMG-Studien angeführt. 5. Hanging Leg Raises: Diese Übung aktiviert nicht nur den Rectus abdominis stark, sondern auch die Hüftbeuger, wodurch die Bauchmuskeln indirekt beeinflusst werden. 6. Captain's Chair Leg Raises: Eine weitere Übung, die oft als effektiv für die Bauchmuskeln, vor allem für den unteren Teil des geraden Bauchmuskels, eingestuft wird. Es ist wichtig zu beachten, dass diese Studien auf allgemeinen Tendenzen basieren und die Ergebnisse individuell variieren können. Nicht alle Menschen reagieren gleich auf bestimmte Übungen, und einige Übungen können für manche Menschen aufgrund von Vorerkrankungen oder Verletzungen ungeeignet sein. Auch wenn die Aktivierung der Muskulatur ein Indikator für die Effektivität einer Übung ist, ist es auch wesentlich, andere Faktoren zu berücksichtigen, wie das gesamte Trainingsprogramm, die Technik, die Ernährung und die Regeneration. Darüber hinaus sollten Bauchübungen Teil eines ganzheitlichen Trainingsansatzes sein, der auch die Rücken- und Rumpfmuskulatur stärkt, um das muskuläre Gleichgewicht und die allgemeine Körperhaltung zu verbessern."},{"prompt":"Kannst du mir zu den Übungen Bilder erstellen?","completion":"Als KI-Modell von OpenAI habe ich keinen direkten Zugriff auf eine Medienbibliothek und kann selbst keine Bilder erstellen oder hochladen.

Including chemistry composition.","completion":"TrES-2b is often referred to as the \\"darkest exoplanet\\" because it reflects less than 1% of the light that hits it, making it darker than charcoal. This extreme blackness is due to its unique composition and atmosphere. TrES-2b is a gas giant exoplanet located about 750 light-years away in the constellation Draco. Its atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other elements such as water vapor, methane, and sodium. These elements interact with the intense heat and radiation from the planet's parent star, TrES-2, causing a chemical reaction that absorbs most of the light that hits the planet. The high concentrations of sodium in TrES-2b's atmosphere are thought to be a major contributor to its extreme darkness. When light from the parent star hits the planet, the sodium atoms in the atmosphere absorb specific wavelengths of light, leading to the planet's incredibly low albedo (reflectivity). In addition to its unique composition, TrES-2b orbits very closely to its parent star, resulting in scorching temperatures of over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. This intense heat creates a thick, opaque cloud cover in the planet's atmosphere, further contributing to its dark appearance. Overall, the combination of its composition, close proximity to its parent star, and high temperatures make TrES-2b one of the darkest exoplanets ever discovered."},{"prompt":"#include <SoftwareSerial.h> #include <PN532_SWHSU.h> #include <PN532.h> SoftwareSerial SWSerial( 3, 2 ); // RX, TX PN532_SWHSU pn532swhsu( SWSerial ); PN532 nfc( pn532swhsu ); String tagId = \\"None\\", dispTag = \\"None\\"; byte nuidPICC[4]; void setup(void) { Serial.begin(115200); Serial.println(\\"Hello Maker!\\"); // Serial2.begin(115200, SERIAL_8N1, RXD2, TXD2); nfc.begin(); uint32_t versiondata = nfc.getFirmwareVersion(); if (! versiondata) { Serial.print(\\"Didn't Find PN53x Module\\"); while (1); // Halt } // Got valid data, print it out!

I need to send data RFID data to google spreadsheet online continuously using arduino IDE integrate with above code:","completion":"To send RFID data to a Google Spreadsheet online, you can make use of a number of different methods. One common approach is to use a third-party service like IFTTT or Zapier to integrate the Arduino with Google Sheets. However, these solutions may involve latency and might not be suitable for continuous data streaming due to their rate limits. For a more direct and continuous integration, you should consider using the Google Sheets API, but this requires a more involved setup including authentication. Here is a step-by-step guide to set up your Arduino to send data directly to Google Sheets using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module for internet connectivity and the HTTPSRedirect library to handle secure communication with the Google Sheets API: 1. First, make sure that your Arduino board is capable of connecting to the internet. For that, you can use an ESP8266 or ESP32 module. If you are using an Arduino without Wi-Fi capabilities, you will need to connect it to one of these modules. 2. Create a Google Sheets document where you want to store your RFID data. 3. Set up a Google Apps Script to allow your Arduino to write to Google Sheets. Follow these steps: - Go to your Google Drive and open the Google Sheet you have created. - Click on 'Extensions' > 'Apps Script.' - Delete any code in the script editor and replace it with the following code: \`\`\`javascript function doGet(e) { var tagId = e.parameter.tagId; var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet(); sheet.appendRow([new Date(), tagId]); return ContentService.createTextOutput(\\"RFID Tag Recorded: \\" + tagId); } \`\`\` - Save the script and click 'Deploy' > 'New deployment.' - Choose 'Web app' and set 'Who has access' to 'Anyone.' - Copy the 'Web app URL' that you will call from your Arduino. 4. Modify your Arduino code to send HTTP requests to the URL provided by the Apps Script. You will need to use the ESP8266/ESP32's Wi-Fi capabilities to send the HTTP request. In addition, please note that Google requires HTTPS for secure communication. You will need to use an appropriate library (such as HTTPSRedirect for ESP8266) that can handle the secure connection. Here is a simplified example of how to send data via an HTTP GET request to your Google Apps Script using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module (not including the RFID reading part): \`\`\`cpp #include <ESP8266WiFi.h> #include <HTTPSRedirect.h> const char* ssid = \\"your_SSID\\"; // Your Wi-Fi SSID const char* password = \\"your_PASSWORD\\"; // Your Wi-Fi Password const char* host = \\"script.google.com\\"; // Google Script host domain // Your Google Script deployment ID const char* googleScriptId = \\"your_deployment_script_id_here\\"; String url = String(\\"/macros/s/\\") + googleScriptId + \\"/exec?tagId=\\"; HTTPSRedirect* client = nullptr; void setup() { Serial.begin(115200); WiFi.begin(ssid, password); while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) { delay(500); Serial.print(\\".\\"); } Serial.println(\\"Connected to Wi-Fi!\\"); client = new HTTPSRedirect(443); client->setInsecure(); bool flag = false; for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { if (client->connect(host, 443)) { flag = true; break; } else { Serial.println(\\"Connection to Google Script failed... retrying...\\"); delay(5000); } } if (!flag) { Serial.println(\\"Could not connect to server: \\" + String(host)); return; } } void loop() { // readNFC(); (This function contains the logic to read the NFC tag.) //Assuming \`tagId\` is the variable containing your RFID data if (client->connected()) { String finalURL = url + tagId; client->GET(finalURL, host); Serial.println(\\"Data sent to Google Sheets!\\"); } // Your RFID sensor reading and posting logic goes here. delay(10000); // Wait for 10 seconds before sending next data } \`\`\` This example demonstrates how to send data to Google Sheets via HTTP GET requests using an ESP8266-based board running the Arduino IDE. Replace \`\\"your_SSID\\"\`, \`\\"your_PASSWORD\\"\` and \`\\"your_deployment_script_id_here\\"\` with your actual Wi-Fi SSID, Wi-Fi password, and Google Script deployment ID respectively. Remember to integrate your RFID reading logic into this example. The \`readNFC()\` function serves as a placeholder for where you should place the RFID reading and data processing logic. Before running the final setup, test each component separately to ensure that all parts of the system work as expected. Test the RFID reading, the Wi-Fi connection, and the communication with Google Sheets independently. Please note that constantly sending data to Google Sheets might encounter rate limits imposed by Google. If you plan to send a large amount of data frequently, consider batching the data and sending it at less frequent intervals, or using a local database for intermediate storage."},{"prompt":"#include <SoftwareSerial.h> #include <PN532_SWHSU.h> #include <PN532.h> SoftwareSerial SWSerial( 3, 2 ); // RX, TX PN532_SWHSU pn532swhsu( SWSerial ); PN532 nfc( pn532swhsu ); String tagId = \\"None\\", dispTag = \\"None\\"; byte nuidPICC[4]; void setup(void) { Serial.begin(115200); Serial.println(\\"Hello Maker!\\"); // Serial2.begin(115200, SERIAL_8N1, RXD2, TXD2); nfc.begin(); uint32_t versiondata = nfc.getFirmwareVersion(); if (! versiondata) { Serial.print(\\"Didn't Find PN53x Module\\"); while (1); // Halt } // Got valid data, print it out!

Here’s how you would approach this integration: 1. Connect your Arduino Nano to a Wi-Fi module (e.g., the ESP8266 or ESP32). For this example, let's assume you are using an ESP8266. 2. Modify your Arduino code to include functionality for sending HTTP requests to the Google Apps Script Web App. Here's an outline of the steps you'll need to take to modify your code: - Include libraries for connecting to Wi-Fi (\`ESP8266WiFi.h\` for ESP8266). - Set up the Wi-Fi with the SSID and password. - Form the HTTP GET request strings to send data to your Google Apps Script Web App. Define variables at the start of your code: \`\`\`cpp #include <ESP8266WiFi.h> #include <ESP8266HTTPClient.h> const char* ssid = \\"YOUR_WIFI_SSID\\"; const char* password = \\"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\\"; const char* host = \\"script.google.com\\"; const char* googleScriptId = \\"AKfycbwAPuZjVDVOq3bYRDyb4s4o5_h99S3rnrJ964d6oGUzC68dajPfB5EOtaZ1ewswySSmBg\\"; const char* googleScriptURL = \\"https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwAPuZjVDVOq3bYRDyb4s4o5_h99S3rnrJ964d6oGUzC68dajPfB5EOtaZ1ewswySSmBg/exec\\"; \`\`\` In the \`setup()\` function, connect to Wi-Fi: \`\`\`cpp void setup() { // ...[previous setup code]...

Lastly, since the Arduino Nano doesn't have WiFi capabilities, the SoftwareSerial code and PN532 code you have for NFC reading will remain on the Arduino, and the ESP8266 will only be used for WiFi connectivity and sending HTTP requests. You will need to set up a communication protocol to send the RFID reading from the Arduino Nano to the ESP8266, which can then make the HTTP request to Google Sheets. Using the ESP8266 as a WiFi module with an Arduino Nano requires using AT Commands or flashing the ESP with a custom firmware so that it understands the commands from the Arduino. This setup can get complicated and often it's easier to use an integrated board like a NodeMCU or a WeMos D1 Mini since they are ESP8266 boards with built-in WiFi and replace the Nano entirely.

Once you have the required hardware, you can proceed with the integration using the following steps: 1. **Connect the Arduino Nano to an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module**: Wire the Wi-Fi module to your Nano and establish a communication protocol between them (via serial communication, for instance). The ESP8266 will manage the internet connection and HTTP requests. 2. **Update your Google Apps Script**: To ensure the script is prepared to receive data from your Arduino setup, make sure it looks something like the following. Adjust it as per your needs. \`\`\`javascript function doGet(e) { var tagId = e.parameter.tagId; var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet(); sheet.appendRow([new Date(), tagId]); return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({status: 'success', tagId: tagId})); } \`\`\` Deploy the script as a web app and set permissions to \\"Anyone, even anonymous\\". 3. **Program the ESP8266**: If you’re integrating an ESP8266 with your Arduino Nano, remember that the ESP should have standalone firmware that's capable of handling Wi-Fi and HTTP requests. A common approach is to flash the ESP with NodeMCU firmware or use the Arduino core for ESP8266. For this step, it is assumed that you have already flashed the ESP8266 with a script to perform the necessary operations. 4. **Arduino Nano Code**: Write the code on your Nano to read from the RFID reader and send the tag ID to the ESP8266 using serial communication. 5. **ESP8266 Code**: In the ESP code, you will need to parse the received serial data and use it to send HTTP GET requests to your Google Apps Script URL. The ESP script should expect tag IDs to come from the serial connection with the Nano. Here is a simplified example ESP8266 code that receives tag IDs from the serial port and sends them to Google Sheets: \`\`\`cpp #include <ESP8266WiFi.h> // Other necessary includes... WiFiClient client; const char* ssid = \\"YOUR_WIFI_SSID\\"; const char* wifiPassword = \\"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\\"; const char* scriptId = \\"YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_DEPLOYMENT_ID\\"; void setup() { // Connect to WiFi WiFi.begin(ssid, wifiPassword); while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) { delay(500); Serial.println(\\"Connecting to WiFi...\\"); } Serial.println(\\"Connected to WiFi\\"); Serial.begin(115200); // Start the serial communication } void loop() { if (Serial.available() > 0) { // Read the incoming tag ID String tagId = Serial.readStringUntil('n'); // Now send this tagId to Google Sheets HTTPClient http; String url = String(\\"https://script.google.com/macros/s/\\") + scriptId + \\"/exec?tagId=\\" + tagId; http.begin(url); int httpCode = http.GET(); if (httpCode > 0) { String payload = http.getString(); //Get the response payload Serial.println(\\"Data sent to Google Sheets: \\" + payload); } else { Serial.println(\\"Error sending data to Google Sheets\\"); } http.end(); } } \`\`\` Remember, as this is a high-level guideline, you need to have the proper libraries installed and ensure that the serial communication is properly set up.

However, there are alternative solutions that you can consider to accomplish the task indirectly. One solution is to have the Arduino connected to a computer via a USB cable and then use a script or application on the computer to read the serial data and send it to Google Sheets. This can be accomplished using various programming languages such as Python, Node.js, or even a Windows Powershell or Bash script. Below is an example of how you could achieve this with Python, utilizing the \`pySerial\` library to interact with the Arduino and \`gspread\` to communicate with Google Sheets: 1. Install Python on your computer if it is not already installed. 2. Install the necessary Python libraries: \`\`\`sh pip install pyserial gspread oauth2client \`\`\` 3. Configure the \`gspread\` library to access your Google Sheets: - Follow [gspread's documentation](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html) on how to create and authorize credentials. 4. Write a Python script that reads serial data from Arduino and writes it to Google Sheets: \`\`\`python import serial import time import gspread from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials # use creds to create a client to interact with the Google Drive API scope = ['https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'] creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('path-to-your-credentials-file.json', scope) client = gspread.authorize(creds) # Find a workbook by name and open the first sheet # Make sure you use the right name here. sheet = client.open(\\"Your Spreadsheet Name\\").sheet1 # Set up the serial connection (the parameters might need to be changed to match your setup) ser = serial.Serial('COM3', 115200) # This will loop forever, reading the serial data and writing it to Google Sheets while True: try: if ser.in_waiting: tagId = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip() # read and decode serial data if tagId: print(f\\"Writing to sheet: {tagId}\\") sheet.append_row([time.strftime(\\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\\"), tagId]) # Write to Google Sheet time.sleep(1) # Prevents spamming the Google Sheets API too quickly (there's a quota) except KeyboardInterrupt: print(\\"Exiting...\\") break except Exception as e: print(e) # Print any errors that occur \`\`\` 5. Run your Python script. The Python script is set up to listen for data on one of the computer's serial ports (e.g., 'COM3'), which should be connected to your Arduino Nano. It then writes that data to the first sheet in the specified Google Sheets document, appending a new row for each RFID tag reading received. 6. Open the Arduino IDE and ensure that the configuration for the serial communication in your RFID reading Arduino sketch matches the configuration in the Python script (baud rate, etc.). Now, whenever the Arduino reads a new RFID tag and prints it to the serial monitor, the Python script running on your computer will capture that data and insert it into the Google Spreadsheet. Please note that this approach relies on the computer being constantly connected to the Arduino and having an active internet connection. The computer essentially acts as a bridge between the Arduino and Google Sheets."},{"prompt":"#include <SoftwareSerial.h> #include <PN532_SWHSU.h> #include <PN532.h> SoftwareSerial SWSerial( 3, 2 ); // RX, TX PN532_SWHSU pn532swhsu( SWSerial ); PN532 nfc( pn532swhsu ); String tagId = \\"None\\", dispTag = \\"None\\"; byte nuidPICC[4]; void setup(void) { Serial.begin(115200); Serial.println(\\"Hello Maker!\\"); // Serial2.begin(115200, SERIAL_8N1, RXD2, TXD2); nfc.begin(); uint32_t versiondata = nfc.getFirmwareVersion(); if (! versiondata) { Serial.print(\\"Didn't Find PN53x Module\\"); while (1); // Halt } // Got valid data, print it out!

Including chemistry composition.","completion":"TrES-2b is known as one of the darkest exoplanets discovered to date, with a very low albedo, or reflectivity, of only 0.013. This extremely low albedo is believed to be the result of the planet's atmosphere absorbing nearly all of the light that hits it, rather than reflecting it back into space. The black color of TrES-2b is likely due to the presence of chemicals in its atmosphere that absorb light very efficiently. One possible explanation for this is the presence of substances like sodium and potassium, which are known to absorb light in the visible spectrum. These chemicals could be responsible for the planet's dark appearance by absorbing most of the light that reaches the planet's surface. Additionally, TrES-2b is classified as a hot Jupiter, meaning it orbits very close to its host star and experiences high temperatures. This extreme heat could also contribute to the planet's dark color, as it may have caused chemical reactions in the atmosphere that produce light-absorbing compounds. Overall, the combination of efficient light absorption by specific chemicals in the atmosphere, as well as the extreme heat experienced by the planet, likely contribute to the dark, black appearance of TrES-2b."},{"prompt":"Why Saturn and Jupiter color? Including chemistry composition.","completion":"Saturn and Jupiter both appear a light yellowish color, with Jupiter having a slightly more orange hue. These colors are primarily due to the composition of their atmospheres. Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with smaller amounts of methane, ammonia, water vapor, and other compounds. The color of Jupiter is believed to be influenced by the presence of ammonia clouds in its upper atmosphere. Ammonia clouds reflect and scatter sunlight, giving Jupiter its characteristic pale yellow color. Additionally, the presence of other compounds, such as sulfur compounds and hydrocarbons, may also contribute to Jupiter's color. Saturn's atmosphere is also mainly made up of hydrogen and helium, along with trace amounts of methane, ammonia, and other gases. Like Jupiter, Saturn's color is thought to be influenced by the presence of ammonia clouds in its atmosphere, which give it a similar yellowish hue. However, Saturn's color also appears slightly more golden due to the presence of other hydrocarbons and compounds in its atmosphere, which can refract and scatter light in a way that produces a more golden appearance. In summary, the yellowish color of Jupiter and Saturn is primarily due to the presence of ammonia clouds in their atmospheres, along with other compounds that can interact with sunlight to produce their characteristic hues."},{"prompt":"Why Uranus and Neptune color? Including chemistry composition.","completion":"Uranus and Neptune have distinct bluish hues, which are primarily due to their atmospheric compositions and the presence of specific gases and compounds. Uranus has a pale blue color, which is believed to be the result of its atmosphere containing large amounts of methane. Methane in Uranus' upper atmosphere absorbs red light, reflecting blue and green light back into space. This selective absorption and reflection of light give Uranus its unique blue-green appearance. Neptune, on the other hand, appears a deeper blue color compared to Uranus. This is because Neptune's atmosphere contains a higher concentration of methane, which again absorbs red light, allowing blue light to dominate the planet's color. Additionally, Neptune's atmosphere also contains trace amounts of other compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, which may contribute to its distinctive bluish hue. In summary, the blue color of Uranus and Neptune is primarily due to the presence of methane in their atmospheres. The absorption of red light by methane and the scattering of blue and green light results in the unique blue-green and deep blue colors of these ice giant planets. The presence of other compounds and gases in their atmospheres may also play a role in determining the specific shade of blue observed on Uranus and Neptune."},{"prompt":"Give hex color(s) for gas giant with presence of methane","completion":"The color of a gas giant with the presence of methane would likely be a bluish-green hue. A suitable hex color code that represents this color could be #00bfff, which corresponds to a bright shade of azure blue. This color is reminiscent of the typical appearance of gas giants like Uranus and Neptune, where the presence of methane in their atmospheres gives them a bluish-green tint."},{"prompt":"Give hex color(s) for gas giant with presence of ammonia clouds","completion":"For a gas giant with the presence of ammonia clouds, the color would likely be more of a pale yellow or yellowish-green shade. A suitable hex color code to represent this color could be #e0e05a, which corresponds to a soft, pale yellow hue. This color is reminiscent of the characteristic color of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, where ammonia clouds in their atmospheres contribute to their yellowish appearance."},{"prompt":"Give hex color(s) for gas giant with presence of alkali metals","completion":"Gas giants with the presence of alkali metals in their atmospheres may display unique colors depending on the specific metal present. Alkali metals like sodium and potassium can potentially produce a variety of colors when energized, such as yellow (sodium) or lilac (potassium). For a gas giant with the presence of sodium, a suitable hex color code to represent a yellow color could be #ffff00. For a gas giant with the presence of potassium, a suitable hex color code to represent a lilac color could be #c8a2c8. These colors are hypothetical representations based on the characteristic colors produced by these alkali metals when energized."},{"prompt":"Give hex color(s) for gas giant with chemistry composition of TrES-2b","completion":"TrES-2b, known for its dark color and low albedo, is likely to have a significantly different appearance than the typical gas giants in our solar system. Given its unique chemistry composition, which includes chemicals that efficiently absorb light, it is challenging to assign a specific color using standard color representations like hex codes. However, if we were to speculate on a color, it might be a very dark or black hue. As an example, a hex color code for black is #000000. This color would convey the idea of a planet that absorbs light rather than reflects it, similar to TrES-2b's observed characteristics."},{"prompt":"Give hex color(s) for gas giant with presence of silicate clouds","completion":"Gas giants with the presence of silicate clouds may exhibit unique colors depending on the composition and properties of the silicate particles. Silicates can range in color from white to shades of red, orange, or brown. For a gas giant with white silicate clouds, a suitable hex color code could be #ffffff. For a gas giant with silicate clouds that impart a reddish hue, a possible hex color code could be #ff4500 (a shade of reddish-orange). For a gas giant with silicate clouds that give a brownish coloration, a suitable hex color code could be #8b4513 (a shade of brown). These colors are hypothetical representations based on the potential colors that silicate clouds might impart to a gas giant's appearance."},{"prompt":"Give hex color(s) for gas giant with presence of corundum clouds","completion":"Corundum clouds contain aluminum oxide, which can exhibit a range of colors, including pink, red, blue, and purple, depending on impurities present in the crystal structure.

Chasing the cat Snowball II through the house with a vacuum cleaner, he inadvertently barges into Maggie's room, waking her with the loud noise. Maggie's wailing brings Marge rushing in, and after consoling Maggie, Marge is in no mood for Bart's apologies or shenanigans. She sternly tells Bart that he is grounded for an entire month: no skateboard, no TV, no Itchy & Scratchy, and certainly no Krusty the Clown. Cut to Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, where Mr. Burns is shown in a heated discussion with Smithers over the plant's dire financial situation. Burns resists Smithers' advice to modernize and instead doubles down on cost-cutting measures, jeopardizing both safety and the jobs of many employees, including Homer. Smithers leaves the office concerned that if something doesn't change soon, Springfield might lose its power plant. Act 2: Powerless Bart, desperate for entertainment, turns to eavesdropping on his family's conversations and eventually discovers from Homer that the power plant is in financial trouble. Realizing that his father might lose his job, Bart secretly forms a plan to bring attention to the plant's plight. Meanwhile, Mr. Burns, resorting to even more desperate measures, brings in a team of inept financial advisors who suggest turning the plant into a tourist attraction. Burns scoffs at the idea but considers it as a final resort. A 'Nuclear Fun Park' termination countdown begins, and the town slowly becomes aware of the impending doom the plant faces. Act 3: The Spark of Rebellion A grounded Bart, unable to leave his room, starts an underground zine called \\"The Electric Truth,\\" which he distributes using Santa's Little Helper as a courier. The zine, filled with exposés on Burns' mismanagement and calls to action, garners the attention of the townspeople and unfairly implicates Homer as part of the management crisis. Homer is harassed by locals, while Burns discovers Bart's zine and identifies the Simpson family as the source. He confronts Homer, threatening to fire him unless the zines stop. Just as all hope seems lost, a town meeting is called where the workers, inspired by Bart's call to action, unite to offer solutions to save the plant. Act 4: Power to the People Lisa pitches the idea of forming a cooperative to buy the plant. The workers, rallying behind this suggestion, put together their savings and even get help from some surprising investors – Patty and Selma, who have always dreamt of holding power over Homer. Burns is initially reluctant but, seeing an opportunity for a graceful exit, agrees to sell.

It's also essential to handle compliance with telecommunication laws and guidelines, such as GDPR or TCPA, depending on the region you're operating in. Below is a simplified outline of the stages and components you would need to build a basic bulk SMS software: # 1. Choose an SMS Gateway Provider To send SMS messages in bulk, you'll need to use an SMS gateway provider that offers APIs for sending messages. Providers such as Twilio, Plivo, or Nexmo offer such APIs that you can integrate into your software. You'll have to sign up for an account and familiarize yourself with their API and pricing. # 2. Define Your Software Requirements Before writing any code, define what features you need. For a basic bulk SMS application you might want features like: - User authentication - Contact list management - Message composition and scheduling - Sending bulk SMS messages - Receiving SMS responses - Analyzing sent message statistics # 3. Setup a Backend Choose a programming language (like Python, Node.js, Java, etc.) for your server-side logic and set up a backend system that will manage the sending of SMS messages, user management, and other functionalities. Examples of frameworks include Django for Python or Express for Node.js. # 4. Database Integration You will need a database to store information like user accounts, phone numbers, message templates, and sent messages. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB are popular options. Design your database schema to efficiently manage and query data. # 5. Implement SMS Sending Feature Use your chosen SMS gateway provider's API to integrate SMS sending capabilities into your software. You will typically need to make HTTP requests to the gateway's API endpoint, including the necessary authentication and message payload. # 6. Build a User Interface Develop a frontend where users can log in, manage their contacts, compose messages, and send them to multiple recipients. This could be a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. # 7. Implement Security Measures Incorporate security practices such as HTTPS, secure authentication, data encryption, and protection against common web attacks (e.g., XSS, CSRF). # 8. Compliance and Opt-in Management Make sure your application adheres to legal regulations concerning bulk messaging and having mechanisms for managing opt-ins and opt-outs. # 9. Testing Thoroughly test your application for both functionality and security. Automated testing can help confirm that your bulk SMS system functions correctly under different scenarios. # 10. Deployment Once tested, you can deploy your software on cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or on your servers. # Example Code Snippet (using Python and Twilio's API) \`\`\`python from twilio.rest import Client def send_bulk_sms(phone_numbers, message): # Your Account SID and Auth Token from twilio.com/console account_sid = 'YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID' auth_token = 'YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN' client = Client(account_sid, auth_token) for number in phone_numbers: client.messages.create( to=number, from_=\\"YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER\\", body=message ) # Example usage phone_numbers = [\\"+15558675309\\", \\"+15558675310\\"] # list of phone numbers to send SMS message = \\"Hello, this is a bulk SMS from our service!\\" send_bulk_sms(phone_numbers, message) \`\`\` # Note: 1. Replace \`YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID\`, \`YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN\`, and \`YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER\` with your actual Twilio credentials and phone number. 2. Ensure you handle exceptions and errors effectively in your production code. Remember that building and maintaining a bulk SMS software is a complex task that requires a continuous investment in security, compliance, and user experience improvements. And always respect the privacy and consent of those you are messaging."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"book and coffee\\"","completion":"book and coffee"},{"prompt":"dịch đoạn này ra tiếng việt chuẩn: Countermeasures Network layer security TCP/IP protocols may be secured with cryptographic methods and security protocols. These protocols include Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), succeeded by Transport Layer Security (TLS) for web traffic, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) for email, and IPsec for network layer security.[12] Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) Main article: IPsec IPsec is designed to protect TCP/IP communication in a secure manner. It is a set of security extensions developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It provides security and authentication at the IP layer by transforming data using encryption. Two main types of transformation form the basis of IPsec: the Authentication Header (AH) and ESP. They provide data integrity, data origin authentication, and anti-replay services. These protocols can be used alone or in combination. Basic components include: Security protocols for AH and ESP Security association for policy management and traffic processing Manual and automatic key management for the Internet key exchange (IKE) Algorithms for authentication and encryption The algorithm allows these sets to work independently without affecting other parts of the implementation. The IPsec implementation is operated in a host or security gateway environment giving protection to IP traffic. Threat modeling Threat Modeling tools helps you to proactively analyze the cyber security posture of a system or system of systems and in that way prevent security threats. Multi-factor authentication Main article: Multi-factor authentication Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an access control method in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism – two or more from the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something they have), and inference (something they are).[13][14] Internet resources, such as websites and email, may be secured using this technique. Security token Main article: Security token Some online sites offer customers the ability to use a six-digit code which randomly changes every 30–60 seconds on a physical security token. The token has built-in computations and manipulates numbers based on the current time. This means that every thirty seconds only a certain array of numbers validate access. The website is made aware of that device's serial number and knows the computation and correct time to verify the number. After 30–60 seconds the device presents a new random six-digit number to log into the website.[15] Electronic mail security Background Email messages are composed, delivered, and stored in a multiple step process, which starts with the message's composition. When a message is sent, it is transformed into a standard format according to RFC 2822.[16] Using a network connection, the mail client sends the sender's identity, the recipient list and the message content to the server. Once the server receives this information, it forwards the message to the recipients. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Main article: Pretty Good Privacy Pretty Good Privacy provides confidentiality by encrypting messages to be transmitted or data files to be stored using an encryption algorithm such as Triple DES or CAST-128. Email messages can be protected by using cryptography in various ways, such as the following: Digitally signing the message to ensure its integrity and confirm the sender's identity. Encrypting the message body of an email message to ensure its confidentiality. Encrypting the communications between mail servers to protect the confidentiality of both message body and message header. The first two methods, message signing and message body encryption, are often used together; however, encrypting the transmissions between mail servers is typically used only when two organizations want to protect emails regularly sent between them. For example, the organizations could establish a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt communications between their mail servers.[17] Unlike methods that only encrypt a message body, a VPN can encrypt all communication over the connection, including email header information such as senders, recipients, and subjects. However, a VPN does not provide a message signing mechanism, nor can it provide protection for email messages along the entire route from sender to recipient. Message Authentication Code Main article: Message Authentication Code A Message authentication code (MAC) is a cryptography method that uses a secret key to digitally sign a message. This method outputs a MAC value that can be decrypted by the receiver, using the same secret key used by the sender. The Message Authentication Code protects both a message's data integrity as well as its authenticity.[18] Firewalls Main article: Firewall (computing) A computer firewall controls access to a single computer. A network firewall controls access to an entire network. A firewall is a security device — computer hardware or software — that filters traffic and blocks outsiders. It generally consists of gateways and filters. Firewalls can also screen network traffic and block traffic deemed unauthorized. Web security Firewalls restrict incoming and outgoing network packets. Only authorized traffic is allowed to pass through it. Firewalls create checkpoints between networks and computers. Firewalls can block traffic based on IP source and TCP port number. They can also serve as the platform for IPsec. Using tunnel mode, firewalls can implement VPNs. Firewalls can also limit network exposure by hiding the internal network from the public Internet. Types of firewall Packet filter A packet filter processes network traffic on a packet-by-packet basis. Its main job is to filter traffic from a remote IP host, so a router is needed to connect the internal network to the Internet. The router is known as a screening router, which screens packets leaving and entering the network. Stateful packet inspection In a stateful firewall the circuit-level gateway is a proxy server that operates at the network level of an Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model and statically defines what traffic will be allowed. Circuit proxies forward network packets (formatted data) containing a given port number, if the port is permitted by the algorithm. The main advantage of a proxy server is its ability to provide Network Address Translation (NAT), which can hide the user's IP address from the Internet, effectively protecting internal information from the outside. Application-level gateway An application-level firewall is a third-generation firewall where a proxy server operates at the very top of the OSI model, the IP suite application level. A network packet is forwarded only if a connection is established using a known protocol. Application-level gateways are notable for analyzing entire messages rather than individual packets. Browser choice Main article: Browser security Web browser market share predicts the share of hacker attacks. For example, Internet Explorer 6, which used to lead the market,[19] was heavily attacked.[20]","completion":"Biện pháp đối phó An ninh tầng mạng Các giao thức TCP/IP có thể được bảo mật bằng cách sử dụng phương pháp mật mã và các giao thức bảo mật. Những giao thức này bao gồm Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), sau đó là Transport Layer Security (TLS) dùng cho giao thông web, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) cho email, và IPsec cho an ninh tầng mạng.[12] An ninh Giao thức Internet (IPsec) Bài chính: IPsec IPsec được thiết kế để bảo vệ giao tiếp TCP/IP một cách an toàn. Đây là bộ mở rộng an ninh được phát triển bởi Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Nó cung cấp an ninh và xác thực tại tầng IP bằng cách biến đổi dữ liệu sử dụng mã hóa. Hai loại biến đổi chính làm nền tảng cho IPsec: Authentication Header (AH) và ESP. Chúng cung cấp tính toàn vẹn dữ liệu, xác thực nguồn dữ liệu và dịch vụ chống lại sự lặp lại. Những giao thức này có thể được sử dụng một mình hoặc kết hợp với nhau. Các thành phần cơ bản bao gồm: Các giao thức an ninh cho AH và ESP Liên kết an ninh cho quản lý chính sách và xử lý giao thông Quản lý khóa thủ công và tự động cho trao đổi khóa Internet (IKE) Thuật toán cho xác thực và mã hóa Thuật toán cho phép các bộ này hoạt động độc lập mà không ảnh hưởng đến các phần khác của triển khai. Việc triển khai IPsec được thực hiện trong môi trường máy chủ hoặc cổng bảo mật an ninh, cung cấp bảo vệ cho giao thông IP. Mô hình đe dọa Công cụ Mô hình Đe dọa giúp bạn phân tích chủ động tư thế an ninh mạng của một hệ thống hoặc hệ thống của các hệ thống và theo cách đó ngăn chặn các mối đe dọa an ninh. Xác thực đa yếu tố Bài chính: Xác thực đa yếu tố Xác thực đa yếu tố (MFA) là phương pháp kiểm soát truy cập nơi người dùng chỉ được cấp quyền truy cập sau khi thành công trong việc trình diện từng phần chứng cứ riêng biệt cho cơ chế xác thực - hai hoặc nhiều từ các danh mục sau: kiến thức (thứ họ biết), sở hữu (thứ họ có) và suy luận (thứ họ là).[13][14] Các nguồn tài nguyên Internet, như trang web và email, có thể được bảo mật sử dụng kỹ thuật này. Token bảo mật Bài chính: Token bảo mật Một số trang web trực tuyến cung cấp cho khách hàng khả năng sử dụng một mã số sáu chữ số, vốn thay đổi ngẫu nhiên mỗi 30–60 giây trên một token bảo mật vật lý. Token có các tính toán tích hợp và thao tác số dựa trên thời gian hiện tại. Điều này có nghĩa là mỗi 30 giây chỉ có một dãy số nhất định xác nhận quyền truy cập. Trang web được thông báo về số seri của thiết bị đó và biết cách tính toán và thời gian chính xác để xác minh số đó. Sau 30–60 giây thiết bị trình bày một số ngẫu nhiên sáu chữ số mới để đăng nhập vào trang web.[15] An ninh thư điện tử Bối cảnh Các tin nhắn email được soạn thảo, gửi đi và lưu trữ trong một quy trình nhiều bước, bắt đầu với việc soạn thảo thông điệp. Khi một thông điệp được gửi đi, nó được chuyển đổi thành định dạng chuẩn theo RFC 2822.[16] Sử dụng một kết nối mạng, ứng dụng mail gửi danh tính người gửi, danh sách người nhận và nội dung thông điệp đến máy chủ. Khi máy chủ nhận được thông tin này, nó chuyển tiếp thông điệp đến các người nhận. Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) Bài chính: Pretty Good Privacy Pretty Good Privacy cung cấp bảo mật thông tin bằng cách mã hóa các thông điệp cần được truyền đi hoặc các tệp dữ liệu cần được lưu trữ sử dụng một thuật toán mã hóa như Triple DES hoặc CAST-128. Các tin nhắn email có thể được bảo vệ bằng cách sử dụng mật mã học theo các cách khác nhau, như sau: Ký số vào thông điệp để đảm bảo tính toàn vẹn và xác nhận danh tính người gửi. Mã hóa nội dung phần thân của thông điệp email để bảo đảm tính bảo mật. Mã hóa giao tiếp giữa các máy chủ mail để bảo vệ tính bảo mật của cả phần thân thông điệp và tiêu đề thông điệp. Hai phương pháp đầu tiên, ký số thông điệp và mã hóa phần thân thông điệp, thường được sử dụng cùng nhau; tuy nhiên, việc mã hóa truyền dẫn giữa máy chủ mail thường chỉ được sử dụng khi hai tổ chức muốn bảo vệ email được gửi thường xuyên giữa họ. Ví dụ, các tổ chức có thể thiết lập một mạng riêng ảo (VPN) để mã hóa giao tiếp giữa máy chủ mail của họ.[17] Khác với các phương pháp chỉ mã hóa phần thân thông điệp, VPN có thể mã hóa toàn bộ giao tiếp trên kết nối, bao gồm cả thông tin tiêu đề email như người gửi, người nhận và chủ đề. Tuy nhiên, VPN không cung cấp cơ chế ký số thông điệp, cũng như không thể bảo vệ thông điệp email trên toàn bộ hành trình từ người gửi đến người nhận. Mã Xác Thực Thông Điệp Bài chính: Mã Xác Thực Thông Điệp Mã xác thực thông điệp (MAC) là một phương pháp mật mã học sử dụng một khóa bí mật để ký số điện tử vào một thông điệp. Phương pháp này tạo ra một giá trị MAC có thể được giải mã bởi người nhận, sử dụng cùng một khóa bí mật như người gửi. Mã Xác Thực Thông Điệp bảo vệ cả tính toàn vẹn dữ liệu của thông điệp cũng như tính xác thực của nó.[18] Tường lửa Bài chính: Tường lửa máy tính Tường lửa máy tính kiểm soát quyền truy cập vào một máy tính riêng lẻ. Tường lửa mạng kiểm soát quyền truy cập vào toàn bộ mạng. Tường lửa là một thiết bị an ninh – phần cứng máy tính hoặc phần mềm – lọc lưu lượng truy cập và chặn người ngoài.

Chỉ cho phép lưu lượng truy cập được ủy quyền được thông qua. Tường lửa tạo ra các điểm kiểm tra giữa mạng và máy tính. Tường lửa có thể chặn lưu lượng giao thông dựa trên địa chỉ IP nguồn và số cổng TCP. Chúng cũng có thể phục vụ như nền tảng cho IPsec. Sử dụng chế độ hầm, tường lửa có thể thiết lập VPN. Tường lửa cũng có thể giới hạn việc phơi bày mạng bằng cách ẩn mạng nội bộ khỏi Internet công cộng. Loại tường lửa Bộ lọc gói tin Bộ lọc gói tin xử lý giao thông mạng theo từng gói tin. Nhiệm vụ chính của nó là lọc lưu lượng truy cập từ một máy chủ IP từ xa, vì thế một router cần được kết nối mạng nội bộ với Internet. Router này được biết đến như router kiểm tra, kiểm tra các gói tin ra vào mạng. Kiểm tra gói tin theo trạng thái Trong tường lửa có kiểm tra trạng thái, cổng kết nối mạng cấp mạch là máy chủ proxy hoạt động ở mức độ mạng của mô hình Kết nối Hệ thống Mở (OSI) và xác định một cách tĩnh mạng giao thông nào sẽ được cho phép.

Baihua Joins the Group! (Seeking Monthly Tickets and Subscriptions) (Page 2/3) Train and seek resources for oneself! In the chaotic wilderness, there is no lack of training targets. Relying on the proficiency panel and their powerful Nightmare Dragon bloodline, those who enter will not really die, at most they will \\"return to the city.\\" Then relying on the altar and Nightmare Dragon crystals, they can even \\"resurrect\\"! With such a huge treasure trove, Li Wei must utilize it. Of course, all this must be carried out after prudent testing and experimentation. Li Wei said, \\"No problem... I'll be going back first, Miss Tris, contact me anytime if you have matters, Rose Witch don’t sleep too much this year, to avoid the return of spider-faced creatures.\\" \\"Okay, thank you, Li Wei!\\" Rose nodded gratefully. Li Wei returned to his home in Hades City, and from his hands, black mist emerged, the storage bag of the eerie wizard and those Nightmare Crystals appeared one after another. Afterward, the power of the Nightmare Dragon inside him was exhausted, and he suddenly turned pale, only to recover after a while. \\"It can really be brought out. The power of the Nightmare Dragon is too magical.\\" He opened the storage bag. There wasn't much in it, nor any Tai Stones, but there were many Nightmare Crystals. Among them, a few were fist-sized, likely level four Nightmare Crystals. \\"I'll collect more Nightmare Crystals in the future, so I don't need to use my own power of the Nightmare Dragon, and I can also create an avatar for Illyana.\\" Next, Li Wei found a giant axe made of flesh and blood from the storage bag. At the handle of the giant axe, there was a beating heart, emitting a \\"thump, thump, thump\\" sound. \\"This is his witchcraft tool... so weird, it's like a living thing, they call it [Eerie Tool], refined from the carcasses of powerful nightmare creatures.\\" Li Wei used his Red Dragon Iron Cutter on the giant axe, and to his surprise, although the axe seemed to be made of flesh, the contact area turned into an extremely hard crystal in an instant upon collision. The Red Dragon Iron Cutter was repelled, while the giant axe remained unscathed. \\"Good stuff, although I don't know how to use it... but judging by its sturdiness, it's comparable to a level five witchcraft tool! It can be used to chop people, let's call it [Blood Axe].\\" Putting away the Blood Axe, he planned to study it and see if it could be used as a material for recasting his [Crimson Shadow] cloak. If not, it could be refined by Lady Blood for her as an attack method. Compared to the axe, he still preferred using a sword. After calming down, Li Wei couldn't help but start thinking about the upcoming trip to the Dark Tower. He pondered how to avoid being broadcast, or if broadcasted, how to prevent others from locking onto his identity based on his abilities. As for his appearance, a slight change would do, and surely the projection would also adopt the changed appearance. He thought about those who had witnessed his abilities. First were his own people from the ancient Saint Plane, which wasn't a concern as they had sworn oaths under the Covenant Sword and were loyal to him. Second were those who had witnessed his methods and not been killed by him. \\"I rarely take action in public, and when I do, it's lethal. Almost everyone who has seen it is dead... No, there are some, those two level five wizards from the Crimson Domain. But if it's just them, it's not a big deal.\\" Li Wei let out a sigh of relief; he had been a bit reactive. Accustomed to hunting in the dark, the thought of possibly being watched by many people immediately prompted him to wonder if he would be exposed. \\"This Dark Tower expedition must be cautious to avoid revealing too much of my abilities, lest I be targeted by some with ulterior motives. If there is a fight, it must be quick! Disguise is also necessary. Sauron too, creating this projection feature...\\" he felt resigned. It seems that Sauron, the progenitor of wizards, wasn't as serious as he had imagined. Of course, it might be that Sauron wanted to use this as a way to motivate all wizards to strive for greater heights, to stimulate the potential of wizards! Like the Olympic Games from his previous life. To perform in front of billions of spectators, to showcase one's valor, how exhilarating. \\"The path reveals itself when we reach the mountain. For this Dark Tower expedition, I'll just focus on quietly treasure hunting, and aim to advance my Lover Rune to rank five before entering the tower, then my luck enhancement will be at 40%... I have a premonition that the Lover Rune will shine in the Dark Tower.\\" ... The next day. Li Wei looked at the newspaper. As the Dark Tower drew closer, almost all the pages were filled with related information. [Shock! Hurricane Tower loudly announces \\"Son of Hurricane · Wendis\\" leads the team in the expedition to this Dark Tower!] [Recently, to encourage wizards' enthusiasm for tower climbing, the Wizard Council has set up a Dark Tower ranking list. The list is divided into \\"Earth List\\" and \\"Sky List\\", where judges will score wizards based on their combat projections and climbing speed. Only soul-element wizards are listed on the Sky List, and those below soul-element on the Earth List. The top ones on the lists will receive corresponding rewards...] Li Wei's head felt heavy reading these news. \\"The Dark Tower has turned into a carnival for the wizard world. However, the so-called rewards of the Earth and Sky lists are just that. Those with the ability to rank high, like me, probably won't care for those rewards.\\" In Li Wei's view, those people are more interested in the honor of the lists. After all, those who can participate in the Dark Tower and battle for their respective organizations are no ordinary beings. To compete on the same stage with the geniuses from various wizard organizations. And also to let the multitude witness miracles through cross-plane projections, is an exciting thought. Even someone as low-profile as Li Wei harbors a strong desire to show off, let alone other wizards. [Exclusive! After gathering from multiple sources, Wanshi Tower has compiled a part of the leaked list of four-ring and five-ring wizards participating in the Dark Tower, would you like to spend 1000 Tai Stones to unlock?] On one of the sections, a clickbait news caught Li Wei's attention. He spent a thousand Tai Stones to open it, curious about the high-level competitors in the Dark Tower. \\"It seems that the soul-element wizards' list is well-kept secret by the major wizard organizations. On one hand, there are few soul-element wizard participants to begin with, on the other hand, for these organizations, the real highlight is the soul-element. Each soul-element is a renowned individual, with plenty of outside intelligence and information. If their participation was leaked in advance, they could be targeted by the soul-elements of rival and hostile forces. As for the fourth and fifth rings, they are just extras. The organizations are also eager to use this opportunity to train their members and show off their strength. So these leaked parts may also be deliberate, to create momentum for their own organization in advance!\\" The information on the list isn't extensive, and looking through it, Li Wei sees that most of them are the rising generation of various organizations. Here, \\"young generation\\" for five-ring wizards refers to those under 300 years old. For four-ring wizards, it refers to those under 200 years old. Apart pageSize from those five-ring wizards that Li Wei should avoid, the top-ranked four-ring wizard is from the Burning School. [The Flame Eradicator · Simon, Norn City's first genius in three thousand years, approximately 140 years old, at four-ring consummation, the child of fire elements, possessing a second special talent, suspected to be a \\"Prince of Fire\\", also an array wizard, and a maker. He won first place in the \\"Nine City League\\" of the Nine City Alliance and received the sky-level true relic \\"Gaze of the Fire God\\". He once soloed a level five hybrid dragon in a secret realm with an array, hence self-proclaimed \\"Flame Eradicator\\". Rumor has it that his village was attacked by evil dragons when he was young, and his pregnant mother gave birth to Simon amidst the dragon flames, hence Simon loathed all dragons and dragonkins! To date, hundreds of mixed-blood dragons have fallen by his hand!] Li Wei frowned and thought, \\"Heretic! This doesn't align with my principles of sustainable green development and disrupts the ecological balance of the wizard world. Mixed-blood dragons are already rare, and he's killing them all, such a waste of resources!\\" Li Wei looked further and noted that a good half of the dozens of individuals on this list were children of elements. \\"Golden Wizard, Noble of the Sea, Son of Hurricane, proud disciple of the Black Sun, Black Moonlight... It's interesting to see these rarely seen geniuses starting to appear.\\" No doubt, the wizard world is vast. Even Li Wei must take a few names on this list seriously. \\"I must adjust my attitude; for this expedition, I must not see these geniuses as four-ring opponents, I should regard them as five-ring enemies to avoid defeat.\\" Li Wei didn't want to lose face in front of billions. After gathering intelligence, Li Wei became meditative, like a monk in deep contemplation. His mental strength had reached 335 points, getting closer to the limit of 510 points. It also means that theoretically, if Li Wei enters the Hidden state with the Hermit Rune, even ordinary level five wizards would have difficulty penetrating it. If used well, he might even counter-kill level five wizards! A month later. Li Wei was training. Suddenly, a transmission woke him. [Li Wei, I'm here.] \\"It's Lady Illyana.\\" Not daring to neglect the honor of a soul-element visiting his home, Li Wei showed due respect to the powerful! He went to the door, opened it, and found that Illyana seemed to have changed her hairstyle today. Her previous golden shoulder-length hair is tied up, adding to her already formidable demeanor. \\"Welcome, Lady Illyana, to my wizard's tower.\\" \\"Aren't you going to invite me in?\\" Illyana joked. \\"Please come in.\\" \\"It looks like you rarely invite witches to your place, right?\\" \\"To be precise, both male and female witches rarely visit; I'm accustomed to solitude and peace.\\" \\"That's apparent, Tris said you're cautious and prudent, and that's evident from the dense array of runes here...\\" Illyana looked at the three layers of protection inside and outside of Li Wei's wizard tower. \\"Madam, did you come here to discuss the matter of knights with me?\\" Li Wei asked. \\"Correct, after reaching the end of the path of a knight, I became a legendary peak knight in the human world, searching everywhere for ways to break through the shackles. In the end, I found nothing and ultimately came to the wizard world, only to discover... that there's no place for knights here either, and no one studies the minor path of knights. It could be said to be another village beyond the dark, and in the end, as a wizard my talent isn’t bad, so I embarked on the journey of a wizard.\\" Illyana sighed. \\"I also, by some coincidence, stumbled upon the method to break the knight's shackles. With your knowledge as a soul-element wizard, Lady Illyana, you might find a way to break the shackles on your own before long,\\" Li Wei said. \\"Perhaps... I don't like beating around the bush, I want that method to break the shackles. What is the price you ask? Tai Stones, witchcraft tools, rare materials, just name it, and as long as your demands are not excessive, I can satisfy you!\\" Illyana's expression was calm and serious. In reality, with her soul-element level power, she could easily seize it by force, but she's not that kind of person, plus Li Wei is Tris's man. Li Wei pondered for a moment, then said, \\"Lady Illyana, I can impart the method to you. I have some requests, I wonder if I may speak them...\\" \\"Stop beating around the bush, speak your mind,\\" Illyana said. Li Wei stated, \\"After obtaining the method to break through the legendary shackles, I established a knights' organization aimed at forging a path for knights, and set some principles. To receive this method, one must join the knight organization and take an oath. For the sake of safety for myself and the organization, the method certainly cannot be carelessly imparted, I hope you understand...

Blockchain has evolved to become a generic approach to store and process data in a highly decentralized and secure way. In this article, we review blockchain concepts and use cases, and discuss the challenges in using them from a governmental viewpoint. We begin with reviewing the categories of blockchains, the underlying mechanisms, and why blockchains can achieve their security goals. We then review existing known governmental use cases by regions. To show both technical and deployment details of blockchain adoption, we study a few representative use cases in the domains of healthcare and energy infrastructures. Finally, the review of both technical details and use cases helps us summarize the adoption and technical challenges of blockchains. CCS Concepts: • Computer systems organization → Redundancy; • Computing methodologies → Distributed computing methodologies; • Security and privacy → Distributed systems security; Additional Key Words and Phrases: Blockchains, applications, security, e-health, e-government, critical infrastructure security 1 INTRODUCTION Blockchain is technology that builds a trustworthy service in an untrustworthy environment. It uses replication of distributed systems to build a decentralized service that achieves the same goals with a trusted centralized one. Since 2008, blockchain implementation has exploded, primarily driven by its native ability to support any type of digital transaction. Blockchains have been adopted by Wall Street investment firms to enable transaction cost reduction, Silicon Valley startups as an alternative means of raising funds through initial coin offerings, and by one government, Venezuela, to encourage global investment into the country. The algorithms that power these distributed transactions have given rise to an altogether new method for securely storing data in a digital world that is oftentimes adversarial. Because blockchain guarantees high service availability as well as data integrity, any industry in which transactions or processes rely on the use of a trusted third party, or where a strong guarantee of security is required, can consider implementing blockchain solutions, as should governments worldwide. What attributes of a blockchain may be of use in government? Blockchain provides a means to ensure that any copy of the data will always be available, verifiable, and trustworthy. It functions like an old Xerox machine in terms of data dispersion, in the sense that it can make copies of any item available to anyone who uses it. With respect to trust, it acts more like a notary public, guaranteeing that any copy of data is authentic and that the copies cannot be forgotten or counterfeited. Finally, in terms of transaction processing, it functions like a general ledger in which transactions must be recorded in the same order. To handle data sharing, transaction processing, and validation, there is a set of replicated servers, called nodes. Each node runs a consensus algorithm, which provides a way to reach agreement with every other node about a given transaction, without any human intervention. The algorithm must enable the system to proceed even when some percentage of the nodes arbitrarily fail. There are various algorithms, discussed in detail later, but it is noteworthy that democratic concepts such as quorum and majority voting are incorporated into them. The overarching goal of such a system is to use replication to provide security (specifically availability and integrity), and to enable the distributed servers to behave like a centralized decision maker. How many failures blockchains can withstand—or the percentage of nodes that can fail without compromising security—depends upon the particular use case and the types of failures. For example, a distributed file system may need to withstand “crash” failures, or those failures that occur when faulty nodes simply stop processing requests. Such systems (e.g., Google File System [54]) are commonly able to mask the failures of up to one-half of the nodes. Failures like software bugs, hardware errors, and adversarial (cyber) attacks cause Byzantine faults. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) systems withstand up to one-third of their nodes failing by providing stronger guarantees between nodes through cryptographic techniques. Blockchain history. The distributed systems technical concepts that underpin blockchain were proven in 1982 by Leslie Lamport. Lamport introduced and solved the distributed consensus problem for BFT, in a proof he named the Byzantine Generals Problem [76]. The solution states that to tolerate one arbitrary failure, the system requires at least four replicated nodes so that they can reach a consensus on a specific decision. A more generalized statement is that to tolerate f Byzantine failures, the system has to have n ≥ 3f + 1 nodes. In 1999, Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov became the first to apply Lamport’s consensus in a functioning algorithm they called Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). [30] In 2008, a pseudonymous individual, or group, named “Nakomoto” used consensus protocols, similar to BFT, to create Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s innovation was to build a decentralized system as a trusted broker for exchanging money, and acts in a similar way as government and banking systems do with cash. Viewed historically, people used different types of exchange for trading things of value. In the case of Bitcoin, one of the most famous first purchases was pizza. Purchasing that same pizza over the ages would have been done differently, as is shown in Figure 1, each with different trust providers. Bitcoin uses an approach called Proof-of-Work (PoW)-based consensus (described in greater detail later) to allow users to exchange digital “coins” with each other with confidence. Different from the classic BFT protocols that tolerate a fraction of node failures, PoW assumes a slightly different failure model called the computational threshold failure model. The system is considered valid as long as no adversary controls more than 51% of the total computational power. Through PoW, the system supports an open and transparent pseudonymous environment where any user can participate. However, PoW requires a lot of compute power, as the Bitcoin system retools itself constantly to keep the algorithm tuned to enforce time restrictions on transaction validation. In this article, we review what a blockchain is, how the underlying mechanism works, the technical and adoption challenges, and the governmental use cases. There are several survey works in the literature, [36, 116], including ones about the consensus mechanisms for both permissionless [89, 115] and permissioned blockchains [26], as well as for BFT protocols [36, 99]; some works have reviewed blockchain applications with a focus on e-government [11, 21]. Compared with existing survey works, we aim to review the governmental applications of blockchains, with a focus on the technical perspective of the applications. Indeed, one of the major challenges for blockchain adoption is the gap between the underlying technology and the understanding of the capabilities [26, 33]. Therefore, reviewing the use cases and applications of blockchains from the technical perspective can help both technical developers better understand how the technology could be improved and also decision makers better understand the pain points of the technology limitations and capabilities. The rest of the article is organized as follows with an aim to answer the following questions: • What is blockchain, its security goals, and its underlying mechanism? This is not considered as a new contribution. Indeed, many online and research articles have introduced blockchain concepts. However, we found that a lot of existing articles provide inaccurate information or describe the concepts in detail, which makes it challenging for the general audience. Therefore, we answer the question by introducing different layers of blockchains, their capabilities, and how each layer is composed technically. Specifically, in Section 2, we lay out in detail a three-layer view of the technology used in both permissionless and permissioned blockchains and discuss their capabilities and limitations. With a slant toward government usage, the section will provide a foundation to discuss applications built on top of the technology. • What are the governmental use cases for blockchains? What is the best blockchain model for each use case? What are the lessons learned? In Section 3, we present use cases from both researchers and white papers in the field, as well as those applied by decision makers around the world. We aim to group the applications by regions and countries to observe the trend in the adoption of blockchains. For each type of use case, we also aim to discuss whether it is appropriate to use blockchain as a solution, the technical challenges, and how the challenges could potentially be solved. • How are blockchains deployed in practice? What features of blockchains are unique in each use case? To show in detail how blockchains can be used in practice, in Section 4 we study governmental projects in two major sectors: healthcare and critical infrastructures (with a focus on energy infrastructures). We review different aspects in each sector how blockchains are used, present the benefits of using blockchains in each use case, and discuss the adoption and technical challenges. • What are the adoption and technical challenges? Blockchains cannot solve all problems. In fact, blockchain is not mature yet, as challenges exist for both adoption and technology development. It is desirable to discuss the challenges from both adoption and technology development perspectives. Understanding the adoption challenges can greatly help developers and researchers improve the technology. However, understanding the technical challenges will benefit decision makers in learning the capability of the technology and foster the adoption of the technology. In Section 5, we summarize and discuss both adoption and technical challenges, and discuss the potential solutions to address these problems. 2 BLOCKCHAIN CONCEPTS All blockchains work to make decentralized nodes achieve an agreement on the total order of transactions through cryptography and an underlying consensus mechanism. Technically, blockchains generally fall into one of two categories: permissionless or permissioned. Permissionless blockchains allow anyone to participate, are considered “open,” and have trust provided by algorithms. In contrast, permissioned blockchains are usually “private” or “consortium” and all participant identities are known but no participant needs to be trusted. In practice, variants exist where there is no clear line between different types of blockchains. For instance, Ethereum, a typically permissionless blockchain, can be set up as a private blockchain called the Ethereum private network [48]. Efforts have also been made to achieve anonymity for permissioned blockchains [24, 61]. 2.1 A Layered View of Blockchain Blockchains can be abstracted into three different layers [7], as illustrated in Figure 2. At the core of blockchain is layer 1: BFT consensus—also known as state machine replication—which is a generic approach to tolerate failures. BFT consensus has different forms, ranging from conventional BFT protocols to PoW-based consensus. Despite fundamental differences in how consensus is achieved, any form must solve the same problem: how to enable nodes to reach consensus on the total order (i.e., consistency) of transactions submitted by clients in the form of requests. After nodes reach a consensus about the order, the data/operations of the transactions are then processed according to the order of the transactions. As a result, distributed nodes functionally behave as if there were one centralized node. This ensures that there is only one sequence of client transactions, known as “the longest chain.” Layer 2 of blockchain is the smart contract, which is essentially software code. A smart contract provides an interface for blockchain developers to implement new functions. Smart contracts can then facilitate, verify, or enforce the execution of business transactions. A smart contract can be viewed as a program that connects the underlying consensus protocols with layer 3, applications and use cases. 2.2 Building the Hash Chain The cryptographic concepts of “hashing” and “digital signatures” provide tamper proofing and validation. One way hash functions generate a unique output of alphanumeric text given an input of a list of transactions. Change a single thing about the list of transactions and the resulting hash is significantly different. Digital signatures like Rivest–Shamir–Adleman or Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm are used to “sign” transactions. The hashes are then linked together in a chain of blocks, with any block except the first one, called the genesis block, pointing to prior hashes and signatures. Such a hash chain ensures that no one can manipulate the contents of any block or reverse the chain order. 2.3 Permissioned Blockchains Permissioned blockchains provide consensus and security using provably secure distributed consensus protocols. The consensus protocols do not involve expensive procedures such as in PoW. Therefore, permissioned systems have low latency (the time between the client sending a transaction until the client receives a reply), they are also scalable (both in the number of clients and transactions as well as the number of servers) [112], and they consume less energy than permissionless blockchains (described in detail later). Most permissioned blockchains, especially those widely employed or piloted by government, use provably secure BFT protocols. Among these BFT solutions, the leader-based protocols are widely used, such as PBFT [30] and its variants [106, 108]. In these types of protocols, there is a specific leader, which proposes the order of transactions. The nodes then communicate with each other in several steps to reach agreement on the order. In most leader-based protocols, each node sends messages to all other nodes in each step and collects matching messages from a fraction of nodes before moving to the next step. If the leader is potentially faulty or malicious, other nodes will run a leader change protocol until a new leader is elected. On top of the consensus protocols, blockchains have different approaches to store the transactions. Figure 3 illustrates a typical system architecture used by permissioned blockchains. Specifically, after receiving requests from the clients, a number of nodes run a BFT protocol to assign order to the transactions. The transactions and their order are then forwarded to all other nodes in the system. Finally, the transactions are stored and processed according to that order. In this architecture, the nodes that store the transactions act as learners that passively learn the order from the consensus nodes. Numerous BFT protocols have been proposed in the literature [34, 37, 41, 43, 59, 106]. Chain-based approaches organize nodes in a logical chain where a node only needs to communicate with its previous node and its subsequent node, if any [42], avoiding the all-to-all communication described previously, resulting in performance improvements. Another approach is a hybrid that combines BFT protocols, such as Aliph [59]. The reason Aliph takes a hybrid approach is to combine the best features from more than one BFT protocol is because there is no one-size-fits-all consensus protocol. In Aliph, the protocol can use one cheap protocol to achieve great performance with fewer failures. When failures occur or become more frequent, the system switches to another more expensive one to guarantee system security. 2.4 Permissionless Blockchains Most permissionless blockchains adopt a “Proof-of-Something” strategy. In the case of Bitcoin, this is PoW, a mathematical challenge offered to all nodes in the system to try to overcome (or work through) by an activity called mining. Once mined, a node can propose a block of transactions and get rewarded in Bitcoin if the proposal is accepted. The drawback to this approach is that throughput (the number of transactions processed per second) is limited, and the energy consumption is high. Furthermore, collusion occurs—nodes form cartellike entities called mining pools—concentrating mining activity under the control of one group. With mining pools, the blockchain becomes less decentralized and therefore less secure, and more susceptible to attack and manipulation. Compared with BFT-based consensus, PoW-based consensus does not have a fixed leader and can be viewed as a system where the leader changes after each block of transactions. To propose a new transaction, a node needs to first solve PoW from the previous transaction. When a node proposes a transaction n, it also generates a pseudorandom number that is called a cryptographic nonce. As illustrated in Figure 4, the nonce is broadcast to all other nodes. Nodes compete to become the next leader by selecting random pending transactions and generating a hash of the selected transactions. The node that first generates a hash smaller than the nonce value is the winner and becomes the next leader. Compared with BFT consensus, PoW-based consensus involves fewer messages for nodes to reach a consensus on the transactions. The blockchains based on it can easily scale to thousands of nodes. The challenge is that more than one node might solve the puzzle at the same time, creating a fork of the hash chain. Nodes in the PoW consensus will detect the fork, eventually agree on the longest hash chain, and use it. It takes time for each transaction to be finalized after it has been proposed, usually after six blocks, each taking about 10 minutes, in the case of Bitcoin—about an hour. This finalization time can be reduced using different approaches. Multiple Proof-of-Something approaches have been proposed to enhance the performance of PoW-based consensus, some of which are shown in Table 1. The workflow usually remains the same, but the protocols use other strategies. For instance, Proof-of-Elapsed-Time replaces PoW with trusted hardware, using Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX), a trusted execution environment. Specifically, computers running an Intel SGX processor have a set of security-related instruction codes built into them that makes the piece of hardware protected. Instead of generating a hash to solve PoW, every node utilizes SGX to wait for a random amount of time. The node that finishes waiting earlier than all other nodes “wins” and can propose new transactions. Proof-of-Elapsed Time is in use as a consensus option in the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform [95]. The major benefit is a greatly improved system performance. The drawback is that each trusted execution environment has its own vulnerability, and one has to trust a single vendor to use the blockchain. Other examples include Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proofof-Authority (PoA). PoS and PoA are each designed to improve the performance of Ethereum, and in both a small group of nodes is selected as representatives. PoA selects the representatives based on their reputation, whereas PoS selects representatives using one of several approaches. In Delegated PoS, nodes can vote for certain replicas to select them as representatives. After the group of representatives is selected, the nodes have the authority to propose new transactions and notify others of the results. The major challenge with representative-based systems is that the selected representatives must behave correctly to ensure system correctness. For instance, in PoA, the reputation system must be trusted, and one has to assume that malicious nodes do not have motivation to build up their reputation and then corrupt the entire system. 2.5 Smart Contracts Smart contracts are programs that automatically fire when nodes come to consensus, without any human intervention. Smart contracts are not the normal contracts people use. Instead, the nodes in a blockchain are configured to check a series of conditions to see whether the triggering criteria has been met. If the requirements are met, then the nodes execute an agreed upon contract, a program that executes business-defined functions. Smart contracts allow users to deploy new capabilities and functions while the blockchains are running; services do not have to be stopped. Specifically, developers could write a new smart contract that includes a set of functions. After the contract is deployed on the blockchain, authorized users could call the contract to use those functions. Other running services on the blockchain do not have to be interrupted at all to support these new functions. The most popular smart contract platforms include the Ethereum Virtual Machine (written in a language called Solidity) and Hyperledger Fabric’s Chaincode (written using a combination of the languages Go, node.js, and Java). Since all blockchain transactions are included in the hash chain, and therefore unchangeable, having a bug in the contract, or a flaw that can be exploited, introduces risk into the system. It is also worth noting that the use of smart contracts will likely degrade the performance of the system, as observed by several research works [15, 60]. 2.6 Blockchain vs. Databases Modern databases are frequently designed to be replicated and distributed to achieve high reliability. The most typical method is primary-backup replication, in which the data are replicated as copies across multiple servers or virtual machines. When one copy is lost, additional copies are available to continue the service. This shares certain similarities with blockchain systems, with three major differences. First, distributed databases focus on the management of data. In contrast, blockchains aim to ensure data security. Second, blockchain systems aim to tolerate Byzantine/arbitrary failures, whereas distributed databases usually handle only crash failures. Third, blockchain systems aim to achieve the strongest guarantee of data consistency across multiple machines, whereas distributed databases usually only achieve weaker guarantees of data consistency, such as causal consistency [25]. In causal consistency, data can be written concurrently by different nodes, introducing potential conflicts to be resolved later. In comparison, blockchain systems guarantee linearizability, the strongest consistency guarantee in distributed systems [62]. Informally, linearizability ensures that the data are always consistent across all nodes, so the distributed nodes behave like a centralized one. 3 GOVERNMENT ADOPTION OF BLOCKCHAIN We have done a review of the known projects and use cases supported by governments across the world. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and representative, but not exhaustive, list. Our purpose is to discuss several applications that are both representative and meaningful. Indeed, with the increasing interest in blockchains, applications can be discovered in potentially all industries. A lot of them, however, are far away from being practical or useful. Therefore, we select the representative use cases and group them by countries and regions. In this way, we will be able to better see the trend in government use cases. Government adoption of blockchain can be viewed from regulatory, consumer, and developer perspectives. As a governing body, a state may wish to monitor how blockchains are used, as in the case of cryptocurrencies. As a user of applications, governments may use blockchains to improve processes. And in some instances, a government may develop its own blockchainbased application to address an internal need. In this section, we review the governmental efforts made by countries worldwide in piloting blockchain solutions, the setup, and lessons learned. Since blockchains are widely used by cryptocurrencies, most of the applications reviewed were financial. In Table 2, we include other domains such as medical, infrastructure, city governance, asset and data management, and education. 3.1 U.S. Government The U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) department has developed an application called Accelerate for management of contract billing that utilizes blockchain, AI, ML, and process automation. Accelerate is designed to better manage the HHS portfolio of 100,000 contracts worth around 25B across about 50 systems. The blockchain within Accelerate captures a pointer to unstructured data (e.g., documents) rather than storing the data itself. Accelerate was able to get contract information dispersed across the entire bureaucracy through replication of data and became the first federal blockchain-based application to be certified by a designated approving authority, an internal senior management official, as having the authorization to operate [49], indicating that the system had an acceptable level of risk and may be used in government applications. Accelerate was expanded to acquisition management—getting contract information to researchers more readily so they could find suitable materials for their research. HHS has projected savings at the point of purchase of up to 720M over time and may expand Accelerate into clinical data—HHS leadership discussed using blockchain for tracking sepsis data [104]. Research is being done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to use blockchain to help track public health outbreaks such as hepatitis A [96]. In 2017, the chief software architect for the CDC’s Center for Surveillance Epidemiology and Laboratory Services began building proofs of concept for improving surveillance across state lines. Since then, the CDC and IBM have come together to work on a blockchain-backed solution for tracking the ongoing opioid disease crisis [83]. We assume that using blockchain to track COVID-19 is a consideration. Figure 5 shows that interest in blockchain for use in biomedical applications is growing rapidly after many years of no published research. Most of these publications are for theoretical research, with few discussing deployment of blockchain at the point of care. Several discuss blockchain’s tamper resistant property, as well as its distributed nature—attributes relevant for health data interoperability. These blockchains tend to be private permissioned ones; Ethereum is studied because of its smart contract capability, and Hyperledger Fabric because it is open source and has some support from large companies such as IBM. 3.2 Asian Governments In 2019, the Filipino government approved the adoption of an Ethereum-based solution for approximately 80 rural banks to get access to financial services. Motivating the effort is the fact that only 42% of Filipinos aged 15 or older have a bank account due to a combination of factors [38, 120]. The concept of blockchain city has been used and made live at Malaysia’s Melaka Straits city, a tourist city funded by the Chinese government. The project aims to use blockchain to track tourist visas, passengers, luggage, and booking services [102]. The city will also manage its own token, the DMI coin, for tourists to exchange their money into digital currencies for payment in the city via their mobile phones. South Korea’s government announced a 4B Korean won (about 3.5 million) award to set up a blockchainenabled virtual power plant in the city of Busan, the country’s second-most populous city [97]. The power plant is to be cloud based and should integrate multiple energy resources to optimize power generation. 3.3 European Governments The European Horizon program supports blockchain projects across the European Union [111]. Luxembourg launched a digital Luxembourg initiative in 2017, with a focus of building a blockchain governance framework. The purpose is to build a blockchain competence community and develop blockchain governance standards; the project is ongoing. The e-Estonia program [45] supports multiple features such as e-identity, e-healthcare, and e-governance. Most are already operational, with 98% of Estonians filing tax declarations completed online, and 99% of their health data is digitized and stored on blockchain. Although issues and concerns remain [93, 107], blockchains have indeed revolutionized the way this government stores and processes data. Countries such as Georgia and Sweden (and non-European Union countries like Switzerland) use blockchains to manage assets [13]. Georgia (at the juncture of Asia and Europe) has implemented blockchain for land title registry and related property transactions; the technology has helped make the process more efficient [105]. Sweden has also created a blockchain-based application for land registration and real estate transactions [78]. Blockchain in education has been applied as well [56, 57]. The Maltese government recently completed the first national pilot of a blockchain to manage academic credentials such as diplomas, school certificates, and transcripts. This has been shown to improve the safety of personal information, minimize bureaucracy, and allow students to access their credentials more easily. 3.4 Others Several major Australian government departments use cloud-based blockchain solutions, or Blockchain-asa-Service [88]. The Canadian government launched a pilot recently to use blockchain for digital credentials management, allowing employees to maintain a permanent, self-owned, and secure record of their digital credentials [77]. Anti-money laundering is another major initiative for several governments [69, 71, 75, 101]. For instance, the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental entity, issued guidelines on virtual asset, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations [69]. It has been shown that existing approaches are effective in balancing between the threats and opportunities. Continuous monitoring and investigation are desirable as the technology rapidly changes [27]. 4 USE CASE STUDIES During our review, we found that the majority of the announced government-supported blockchain projects do not provide enough technical details about the setup or system architecture, among others. This is in part because a lot of the projects are ongoing or in their initial phases. In this section, we review two use cases in two sectors in detail: healthcare, and critical infrastructure. We review the use cases, present how blockchains are used in each use case, and discuss potential challenges. Note that although we focus on healthcare and critical infrastructure sectors, the use cases involve domains beyond these two, such as finance and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Therefore, we consider only these two representative sectors and discuss the applications in detail. 4.1 Healthcare As measured by the number of articles published on PubMed, the National Institute of Health’s search engine of medical references, interest in blockchain for use in biomedical applications has almost doubled year over year from 2015 to 2019. Blockchain usage in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) holds promise, with five characteristics of EHRs that must be addressed by any blockchain solution: governance, interoperability, privacy, scalability, and security [29, 82]. The blockchain characteristics to meet those needs include immutability, cryptography, distribution, decentralization, transparency, auditability, and nonrepudiation [82]. Technical solutions for guaranteeing privacy and security in biomedical blockchain applications using blockchain have been proposed, including using the cryptocurrency Ethereum along with the Onion Router for remote health monitoring [10], as well as a novel blockchain called Enigma, designed for exchanging EHR data [121]. The use of blockchain as an overarching health information exchange for protected health information to be exchanged nationally in the United States was proposed, with a theoretical blockchain-based technology to be used as a record locator service pointing to demographic copies of medical records stored in a shared set of servers called Patient Identity Brokers [51]. Such a design lends itself well to recent regulatory changes in the United States. The 21st Cures Act not only gave patients a right to their health data but also said that healthcare systems cannot information block that data. The legislation was made in 2016, and it was not until March 2020 that a final rule was issued by the Office of the National Coordinator detailing how the information exchange from the provider to the patient was to work. That office created a technical framework and compliance structure for enabling protected health information to flow securely as the patient directs it. The technical framework is essentially a distributed system that lends itself to the possibility of blockchain usage, with interoperability between IT systems more possible than ever through the creation of a standardized core dataset that all participants must use. Most of the projects in the healthcare sector focus on utilizing blockchain as a reliable platform for data sharing. Indeed, the critical nature of healthcare data makes blockchains unique in facilitating secure data sharing. However, implementing a large-scale EHR data exchange system is not easy, with or without using blockchains. Effort from multiple disciplines and across stakeholders are necessary to make it possible, and realizing that vision in a final system, while also maintaining security, will be challenging. Perhaps, though, now more than ever such a system is possible, as the global pandemic has made it a necessity that health data flow more freely than ever before. New technology is needed to address both public health needs and the need for the individual’s medical chart to be readily accessible to the patient or provider. 4.2 Critical Infrastructures (Energy Sector) The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defines 16 critical infrastructures including energy, food and agriculture, and transportation, among others. It is stated that “the security and resilience advances a national policy to strengthen and maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure” [91]. Due to the nature of critical infrastructures, blockchain application in critical infrastructures has been widely explored. Besides the financial and healthcare sectors (also considered critical infrastructures), other domains such as the energy sector are under investigation by governments around the world. As an example, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded several projects to both industry and academia to create the “Energy Internet” [66]. The purpose is to build an advanced management framework for distributed energy resources to support fast, scalable, and secure peer-to-peer communications. Blockchain in the energy sector can involve multiple aspects, ranging from energy trading to management of IoT devices and energy resources management [14, 85]. In Table 3, we present the representative areas of blockchain adoption in the energy sector. Energy trading, especially renewable energy trading and management, is one of the main areas found in current blockchain projects in several countries [35, 67, 70]. For instance, a project supported by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment aims at building a system for measuring and managing self-consumed renewable energy [35]. The project utilizes the cryptocurrency side of the blockchain technology to build the trading system. Specifically, the self-consumed renewable energy is first converted into tradable values and sent to the blockchain network. The real-time trading prices are then calculated according to the exchange cost and demand. When the transactions are finalized, energy can be exchanged locally without having to be transmitted to a central location. Similar methods have been used in projects from other countries such as the United States and Australia [67, 70] that have been shown to greatly reduce the management and trading cost. Besides other components such as energy resource management, such a use case shares a lot of similarity with blockchains in the financial domain. In other words, the adoption of blockchain could potentially reduce the cost for any financial transaction in the energy sector and remove the need for a trusted single party. Smart energy involves the management of IoT devices and energy assets. Research projects, industrial projects, and governmental pilots have been found [46, 68, 92]. Such projects usually involve efforts from both industry and academia to be successful. For instance, in the past few years, the Department of Energy announced funding for both university-led and industry-led research projects to integrate IoT technologies with the energy infrastructure, several of which focus on blockchain and IoT integration [47, 66]. The purpose is to provide robust and scalable infrastructure in the energy sector. This use case is similar with managing IoT assets using blockchain as used in other application domains, such as supply chain and healthcare. There are still many challenges, because the integration of energy-related infrastructure and blockchain software is not easy. Energy-related devices suffer from numerous physical threats since the deployment environments are heterogeneous. Despite the challenges, such an integration can greatly benefit energy infrastructure by enhancing the security and efficiency of resource management, potentially disrupting different aspects in the energy sector such as energy sharing [114] and electric vehicle charging [72]. Another noteworthy aspect in the energy sector is the protection of mission critical systems, although the available approaches do not directly utilize the “blockchain” technology. For instance, several works focus on building intrusion-tolerant Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems [18, 19, 90], where SCADA is the core control system for the power grid. Such approaches use BFT to build an intrusion-tolerant SCADA system. Since BFT is the core mechanism for permissioned blockchains and some hybrid blockchains, BFT-based SCADA can provide the same security guarantee with blockchains (i.e., high availability and integrity). The benefits of using only BFT instead of blockchains include better performance and more flexible system design. 5 CHALLENGES AND CONSIDERATIONS In a 2018 report on cryptocurrencies and blockchain in Europe and Central Asia, the World Bank states that “policy makers should strike a balance between curbing the hype surrounding these new technologies and unleashing potentially transformational new opportunities. While encouraging and facilitating these innovations, they should prepare to craft new regulations to create a level playing field for new and old industries, by adjusting financial oversight, consumer protection, and tax administration” [58]. The following year, the European Commission summarized to the World Trade Organization’s Global Trade and Blockchain Forum what the technical and legal challenges for government use of blockchain are: integration with existing systems, scalability, blockchain-to-blockchain interoperability, lack of a policy framework for cryptocurrencies, and the enforceability of smart contracts [2]. That lack of a framework was also mentioned at the 2019 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Global Blockchain Policy Forum [3]. Without such a framework, the economic implications of central government usage of so-called stablecoins (e.g., Facebook’s Libra) would be unpredictable and wide ranging [3]. The lessons learned from government adoption of blockchain range from addressing the security implications of ledger transparency through cryptography to planning for the increased costs of implementing blockchain relative to more mature technology [5, 63]. In this section, we review adoption challenges and how governments have faced them to encourage innovation, provide information about the technical challenges and close with a brief discussion. 5.1 Adoption Challenges Industry and government adoption. Grasping the different implementations of blockchain and their capabilities pose challenges for decision makers when it comes to data governance, privacy and security regulations, and standards [110, 113]. To address such issues, policy makers should take time to assess the technology, look for standards to be developed, and gather experience with the technology [40, 113]. Academic and industrial efforts have been made to discuss and create standards for blockchains to be used in different domains [12, 40, 65]. The International Standards Organization Technical Committee 307 has published three standards, including a vocabulary, a privacy and personally identifiable protection consideration, and a smart contract overview [86]. Another concern is interoperability of blockchains, which includes both exchanging data among blockchains and transferring assets between different blockchain systems. Both research and industry efforts have been made to create such a service [22, 79]. Yet due to the rapidity with which blockchains types are being developed and adapted, it remains to be seen whether interoperability will create new development opportunities for developers, and—if so—whether governmental decision makers will wish to fund the work. Governmental role in adoption. Governments worldwide have started to develop policies or government strategies for the adoption of solutions [1, 109]. The experience that they have gained with cryptocurrencies has given them insight into how they could use blockchain to reduce transaction costs [52]. They may determine that it is more efficient to execute cross-border trade transactions via blockchain through cryptocurrency. The realization of such transactions, however, requires complex integration work and a conducive regulatory environment. Governments that utilize blockchain technology should partner with private firms to both encourage innovation and develop a flexible regulatory framework [3]. An example is the United Arab Emirates’ support of blockchain, in which they created a regulatory sandbox for technology companies to test blockchain solutions for FinTech and for streamlining data interoperability across government services [4]. In the United States, the Boldline Accelerator program is similar in its support of public-private collaboration and has discussed how to use blockchain for identity management, tracking human trafficking, Visas, and shipping fraud [39]. Public-private collaborations should focus on developing blockchain interoperability and standardization, as applied to a carefully selected set of inefficient bureaucratic use cases [16, 94]. Cost of blockchain. The potential for blockchain to reduce transaction costs is appealing to government, as noted earlier [52]. For digital platforms, blockchain can reduce the cost to start up new marketplaces, as well as audit the validity of transactions [31]. However, their decentralized nature can introduce new inefficiencies and data governance issues [31]. Blockchains’ strength in guaranteeing data integrity through immutability may come at a premium, relative to having the same guarantee in a centralized application [64]. Transaction costs have been found to be higher for permissionless blockchains when compared to centralized solutions [13], and blockchain applications can cost significantly more to operate than a cloud-based centralized equivalent, even after controlling for cloud service utilization fees [103]. Data quality. Blockchain does not protect against data from untrustworthy sources, such as authorized but potentially tainted parties. It cannot prevent well-formatted but incorrect or inaccurate data from being sent and stored in the system [119]. As a result, blockchain may be used as an illegal content distribution channel. The system may also consist of data with low quality or high inaccuracy. Such data quality issues might be harmful in applications where transparency of the data is desirable, especially in government applications [5]. Although blockchain can be used as an auditing system for validating these data, the data are already distributed and cannot be retrieved from all parties with certainty. A decentralized system that allows any two parties to anonymously exchange assets may provide a haven for those wishing to perform illicit activities without fear of reprisal. As a result, existing solutions usually involve additional layers to detect or ensure data quality [28, 119]. It is not clear whether such a layer will provide the desirable analysis and become generic enough to ensure data quality. Correctness and security of the system. Several blockchain systems intentionally make their consensus protocols proprietary, making it difficult to trust in the correctness and security of the platforms [26]. Consensus protocols are complicated and the implementation in a complex real system requires extensive development, which may introduce unintended consequences, as has been observed [32]. Before adopting a blockchain solution, the underlying mechanism and the system implementation should be carefully reviewed. Even though most peer-reviewed works have been carefully reviewed by experts, errors in some solutions are still found later [6]. Therefore, it is important to evaluate whether the implementation matches the theory and design of the blockchain. Some efforts have been made for e-government applications [53]. It is yet to be seen whether the solutions are generic and useful enough to fully evaluate the systems. 5.2 Technical Challenges The performance trade-offs and blockchain standards. There is no one-size-fits-all blockchain system [20, 37, 59, 112]. Different approaches have been proposed to meet different needs, such as improved latency, throughput, scalability, and bandwidth [34, 37, 42, 59]. Indeed, each protocol has made trade-offs—for example, to reduce the number of messages nodes needed to exchange in the protocol, the consensus usually involves more steps to complete. In other words, such a protocol has longer latency to achieve higher throughput. Before widespread development and adoption, some innovative first movers must implement solutions that consider the trade-offs among security, efficiency, and robustness. Although significant effort has been put into developing new blockchain platforms, it is not easy to develop both correct and efficient systems. In fact, developing consensus protocols is like engineering cryptographic systems, which require expertise in cryptography, security, and the theory of distributed systems [26]. Therefore, expert review, validation of both the theory and implementation of new blockchain platforms, and standards recommendation [65] (e.g., cryptocurrency exchanges, running blockchains in applications like clinical trials, etc.) are desirable if the full potential of blockchain is to be realized. Scalability. Scalability can be interpreted as the number of nodes and the number of clients. The number of nodes is a concern during blockchain deployment—how many nodes should one use to start the service? The number of clients is a concern for the workload—how many requests should one expect and what are the sizes of the requests? Both permissionless and permissioned blockchains have scalability limits [112]. The open nature of the consensus mechanisms of permissionless blockchains allows anyone to join and therefore usually involves thousands of nodes. The problem for such blockchains is that they usually suffer from long transaction latency (where it takes longer for the transaction to be available) and have not scaled to many client transactions in real-world applications. However, permissioned blockchains can scale to a large number of clients with less latency, but they rely upon a small number of blockchain servers. Hybrid blockchains address the scalability problem [8, 50, 73, 74, 80, 98, 118], but each has its own challenges and most have a sufficiently large number of representatives to guarantee correctness of the system (safety and liveness)—for example, greater than 600 [80]. A BFT protocol of such a size, however, can be impractical. Other BFT algorithms, such as the cryptocurrency Algorand [55], remove the need to run PoW by applying proven cryptographic techniques along with verifiable random functions and committees, but, again, have a limitation. Algorand relies upon the number of coins, which might limit its practicality in real-world deployment. The optimal blockchain that balances scalability for both clients and servers has yet to be found. Privacy and compliance. Privacy and compliance are always major concerns in governmental applications. Although conventional blockchains provide availability and integrity, the data are essentially transparent—all participants may freely review transactions. This means that an architect should be careful in selecting the type of blockchain and perform a use case analysis that includes privacy and security guarantees relative to performance needs. With the current regulatory climate of governments focused on protecting user data, blockchains become especially problematic given their open and immutable nature. At the same time, laws designed to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals’ information do provide a roadmap for designers. Generalized examples include the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation of 2016. In the healthcare space, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act are the basis for interoperability rule changes proposed by the Office of the National Coordinator, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. With the preceding two acts in mind, researchers at MIT built a PoW consensus protocol called Medrec for mining patient information. This type of clinical data is becoming standardized through the implementation of EHR systems that leverage messaging protocols, such as Health Level 7 [17]. Timing assumptions. Most permissionless blockchains assume a synchronous network (i.e., all replicas know the message transmission time), which is not a practical assumption. For the system to be correct (safety and liveness), there must be a large number of nodes that actively participate. Therefore, the correctness of such a system in a small-scale or private setting can be questionable. However, most permissioned blockchain protocols assume something called partial synchrony [44], in which the network delay and processing delay by the nodes are bounded by an upper limit unknown to all nodes. It is assumed that each node in the network will eventually respond, and if a given node does not respond, other nodes will handle it according to the protocol, providing an answer and ensuring that the network will not get stuck waiting indefinitely. The shortcoming of this approach is that it introduces performance and security issues—what if an adversary can somehow manipulate this network delay in such a way that causes nodes to misbehave or to give up information? In this type of network, the system may simply stop processing any requests just like a crashed service, even if all nodes in the system are correct. A potential solution to this may be the use of what is known as a purely asynchronous BFT consensus protocol, in which nodes have no upper bound in response time so the protocols are resilient to all kinds of attacks. Research into this area is ongoing and includes several possible solutions [9, 43, 81, 84]. 5.3 Discussion Permissioned vs. permissionless. Most of the government blockchain implementations are permissioned. Although some use permissionless blockchain, in these cases the blockchain is still deployed in a closed, private setting. Many of the countries we studied for blockchain adoption have either banned or regulated cryptocurrencies, which are fully permissionless. We conclude that the development of cryptocurrencies by governments is unlikely unless the adoption is a specialized use case such as critical infrastructure. Even in such a case, the blockchain would likely be tethered to the currency of the given nation-state. The quest for high performance. We have not found any published results that have measured performance, or assessed the performance needs, in government blockchain implementations. Many applications are new, and the long-term feasibility will depend upon a cost-benefit analysis. Many use cases involve large volumes of data, however, so we expect scalability and throughput needs for these systems to drive changes to their blockchain implementation. The quest for technology improvement. We have found little information regarding the feedback or lessons learned based upon government blockchain implementations. We believe this to be in part because most projects are still in their early stages. We advocate for research and industry to continue to collaborate and improve systems based upon our observations of past successes [26, 32]. Cryptocurrencies regulation. Many countries have developed regulations for cryptocurrencies, and yet no country has fully determined how to implement the regulations. Part of the challenge is how to classify cryptocurrencies using existing financial constructs. Taxing or regulating a cryptocurrency as a currency, a security, or an asset is difficult, as a cryptocurrency can be any one or all three. 6 FUTURE OF BLOCKCHAIN AND CONCLUSION Blockchains have evolved beyond cryptocurrencies to general purpose and can be used across an array of applications, particularly those that need high service availability and data integrity. If their adoption increases, then blockchain-based solutions may reintroduce a trusted broker: the data center, whether in the cloud or on premise. A cloud-based blockchain system makes the cloud provider into a new type of trusted broker. If instead nodes are on premise but are used by the public, then whatever entity is hosting them becomes the trusted broker, and the system becomes vulnerable to any failures that may render the entire system unreliable. Therefore, replacing a fallible human or bureaucracy with a blockchain may shift risk rather than eliminate it [23]. The technical challenges for blockchains, such as being fully privacy preserving, ensuring compliance when necessary, and being scalable, have yet to be fully solved, and more work is needed to address them. Yet despite these challenges, blockchains can make applications better and will begin to be the solution for use case–specific distributed systems problems. Most blockchain applications were financial at first, just as many good and proven technologies have been. Blockchains are now being used in other spaces, such as government. They may be the best technology to deploy when a need to distribute data through a system that needs to guarantee data integrity and service availability exists, but the ability to make it happen is limited.","completion":"**Executive Summary** **Background & Objectives:** This article examines the evolution of blockchain technology from being the foundation of cryptocurrencies to its broader applications in governmental functions. By exploring various blockchain concepts, use cases, and challenges from a technical standpoint, the article aims to provide insights for both technical developers and government decision makers into the benefits and limitations of blockchain technology. **Blockchain Technology Overview:** Blockchain technology is recognized for its ability to create a trustworthy service in untrustworthy environments, utilizing a decentralized approach to achieve the security goals typically encountered in a centralized system. Various blockchain types, including permissionless and permissioned, have been discussed, alongside their respective consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). These mechanisms ensure data integrity, security, and availability, which are essential properties for government applications. **Government Use Cases & Challenges:** The article delves into practical government uses of blockchain across the healthcare, energy infrastructure, financial services, and other sectors. This includes applications in health data management, contract processing, renewable energy trading, and asset management. Governments stand to benefit from the technology's security and efficiency in managing and sharing data but face challenges in adoption, interoperability, cost, and compliance with existing regulations. **Deployment in Practice:** Detailed examinations of blockchain deployments in healthcare and critical infrastructure highlight the unique features and benefits of blockchain in these areas. In healthcare, blockchain promises greater interoperability and security for Electronic Health Records (EHRs). In energy infrastructure, blockchain has potential for efficient energy trading and resource management. The article acknowledges the challenges of integrating blockchain technology with critical systems, ensuring data quality, and maintaining system correctness without compromising on performance. **Technical Considerations:** The technical challenges for widespread blockchain adoption are covered extensively, including the need for performance optimization, scalability, privacy, and compliance. The article underscores the non-existence of a one-size-fits-all blockchain system, urging ongoing research and collaboration to improve technology and address limitations. **Conclusion:** The article suggests that while blockchain fosters improvement in service availability and data integrity in specific use cases, it is not without its challenges. Blockchain provides a valuable option for distributed systems, especially where trust mechanisms are inefficient or non-existent. However, risks may shift rather than dissipate with the implementation of blockchain. Completing the transition from theory to practice requires careful consideration of the technology’s potential and flaws, alongside strategic policy and standard development to facilitate innovation and secure adoption by governments."},{"prompt":"would you explain it alittle more?","completion":"Certainly! The executive summary presented is based on an article that explores the application of blockchain technology in government operations. Here's a more detailed explanation of the key points: **Blockchain Evolution and Concepts:** Originally the backbone of digital currencies like Bitcoin, blockchain's decentralized nature allows for secure and trustworthy transactions without the need for third-party verification, such as that provided by traditional banks. This technology utilizes a network of computers (nodes) running consensus algorithms to validate and record transactions in a way that prevents tampering or revision, ensuring secure and permanent data storage. **Government Application Potential:** Governments around the world are investigating how blockchain can enhance the way they manage information and transactions. There are opportunities to use blockchain for secure data sharing (like health records in the US), managing financial transactions (as with rural banks in the Philippines), and energy trading (like the virtual power plant in Busan, South Korea). The decentralized and secure aspects of blockchain make it appealing for these uses, particularly in cases where ensuring data integrity and availability is a high priority. **Implementation Challenges:** Despite its promise, incorporating blockchain technology into government systems poses challenges. Decision-makers must weigh the benefits against the difficulties of integrating blockchain with existing systems, achieving interoperability between different blockchains, and aligning the technology with current policies and laws. Additional obstacles include the potential high operational costs compared to more traditional systems and ensuring the quality and correctness of the data entered into the blockchain, as the technology only guarantees the integrity of the data once it's entered into the system. **Practical Use Cases:** The article provides a closer look at how blockchain is being used in fields like healthcare and energy. In healthcare, blockchain can lead to better data exchange protocols for medical records, potentially improving patient outcomes and system transparency. In the energy sector, blockchain is being used to simplify and secure the trading of renewable energy resources. **Technical and Adoption Challenges:** While blockchains offer many advantages, they come with significant technical challenges related to scalability, privacy, and compliance with regulations. For instance, permissionless blockchains can struggle with transaction latency (delay) and scalability, while permissioned blockchains, although faster, might not be as decentralized. Moreover, privacy concerns arise because traditional blockchains are inherently transparent, potentially clashing with data protection regulations. **Concluding Observations:** The article concludes by suggesting that blockchain has significant potential to improve government services, particularly in cases where current trust mechanisms are insufficient. However, this is not without challenges that need to be addressed through continued research, policy development, and strategic implementation. The shift to blockchain could transfer risks rather than eliminate them, and governments must approach adoption with balanced optimism and due caution."},{"prompt":"write a summary about this text in 100 words: GOVERNMENT ADOPTION OF BLOCKCHAIN We have done a review of the known projects and use cases supported by governments across the world. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and representative, but not exhaustive, list. Our purpose is to discuss several applications that are both representative and meaningful. Indeed, with the increasing interest in blockchains, applications can be discovered in potentially all industries. A lot of them, however, are far away from being practical or useful. Therefore, we select the representative use cases and group them by countries and regions. In this way, we will be able to better see the trend in government use cases. Government adoption of blockchain can be viewed from regulatory, consumer, and developer perspectives. As a governing body, a state may wish to monitor how blockchains are used, as in the case of cryptocurrencies. As a user of applications, governments may use blockchains to improve processes. And in some instances, a government may develop its own blockchainbased application to address an internal need. In this section, we review the governmental efforts made by countries worldwide in piloting blockchain solutions, the setup, and lessons learned. Since blockchains are widely used by cryptocurrencies, most of the applications reviewed were financial. In Table 2, we include other domains such as medical, infrastructure, city governance, asset and data management, and education.","completion":"This review assesses global government blockchain initiatives, analyzing key use cases that showcase trends in blockchain adoption from regulatory, consumer, and developer viewpoints. While interest in blockchain is high, practical applications remain limited. The study categorizes projects by region and sector, including finance, healthcare, infrastructure, governance, and education. It acknowledges governments' roles as both blockchain monitors, in cases like cryptocurrency, and as users or developers of blockchain solutions for improving internal processes or addressing specific needs. The findings reflect on the diverse pilot programs and derived insights to understand the efficacy and impact of blockchain in governance."},{"prompt":"write a summary about this text in 100 words: U.S. Government The U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) department has developed an application called Accelerate for management of contract billing that utilizes blockchain, AI, ML, and process automation. Accelerate is designed to better manage the HHS portfolio of 100,000 contracts worth around 25B across about 50 systems. The blockchain within Accelerate captures a pointer to unstructured data (e.g., documents) rather than storing the data itself. Accelerate was able to get contract information dispersed across the entire bureaucracy through replication of data and became the first federal blockchain-based application to be certified by a designated approving authority, an internal senior management official, as having the authorization to operate [49], indicating that the system had an acceptable level of risk and may be used in government applications. Accelerate was expanded to acquisition management—getting contract information to researchers more readily so they could find suitable materials for their research. HHS has projected savings at the point of purchase of up to 720M over time and may expand Accelerate into clinical data—HHS leadership discussed using blockchain for tracking sepsis data [104]. Research is being done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to use blockchain to help track public health outbreaks such as hepatitis A [96]. In 2017, the chief software architect for the CDC’s Center for Surveillance Epidemiology and Laboratory Services began building proofs of concept for improving surveillance across state lines. Since then, the CDC and IBM have come together to work on a blockchain-backed solution for tracking the ongoing opioid disease crisis [83]. We assume that using blockchain to track COVID-19 is a consideration. Figure 5 shows that interest in blockchain for use in biomedical applications is growing rapidly after many years of no published research. Most of these publications are for theoretical research, with few discussing deployment of blockchain at the point of care. Several discuss blockchain’s tamper resistant property, as well as its distributed nature—attributes relevant for health data interoperability. These blockchains tend to be private permissioned ones; Ethereum is studied because of its smart contract capability, and Hyperledger Fabric because it is open source and has some support from large companies such as IBM.","completion":"The U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) department created \\"Accelerate,\\" a blockchain-based application integrating AI and machine learning to manage a vast portfolio of contracts. It streamlines contract billing processes by replicating pointers to documents, not the documents themselves, ensuring a reduced risk profile. Accelerate has successfully centralized contract data, achieving federal authorization for operation. It's anticipated to save HHS up to 720 million and could extend to managing clinical data, like sepsis tracking. Similarly, the CDC explores blockchain to monitor public health crises, like hepatitis A and the opioid epidemic, underscoring blockchain's increasing role in enhancing data sharing in healthcare."},{"prompt":"write a summary about this text in 100 words: Asian Governments In 2019, the Filipino government approved the adoption of an Ethereum-based solution for approximately 80 rural banks to get access to financial services. Motivating the effort is the fact that only 42% of Filipinos aged 15 or older have a bank account due to a combination of factors [38, 120]. The concept of blockchain city has been used and made live at Malaysia’s Melaka Straits city, a tourist city funded by the Chinese government. The project aims to use blockchain to track tourist visas, passengers, luggage, and booking services [102]. The city will also manage its own token, the DMI coin, for tourists to exchange their money into digital currencies for payment in the city via their mobile phones. South Korea’s government announced a 4B Korean won (about 3.5 million) award to set up a blockchainenabled virtual power plant in the city of Busan, the country’s second-most populous city [97].

Luxembourg launched a digital Luxembourg initiative in 2017, with a focus of building a blockchain governance framework. The purpose is to build a blockchain competence community and develop blockchain governance standards; the project is ongoing. The e-Estonia program [45] supports multiple features such as e-identity, e-healthcare, and e-governance. Most are already operational, with 98% of Estonians filing tax declarations completed online, and 99% of their health data is digitized and stored on blockchain. Although issues and concerns remain [93, 107], blockchains have indeed revolutionized the way this government stores and processes data. Countries such as Georgia and Sweden (and non-European Union countries like Switzerland) use blockchains to manage assets [13]. Georgia (at the juncture of Asia and Europe) has implemented blockchain for land title registry and related property transactions; the technology has helped make the process more efficient [105]. Sweden has also created a blockchain-based application for land registration and real estate transactions [78]. Blockchain in education has been applied as well [56, 57].

This is in part because a lot of the projects are ongoing or in their initial phases. In this section, we review two use cases in two sectors in detail: healthcare, and critical infrastructure. We review the use cases, present how blockchains are used in each use case, and discuss potential challenges. Note that although we focus on healthcare and critical infrastructure sectors, the use cases involve domains beyond these two, such as finance and Internet-of-Things (IoT). Therefore, we consider only these two representative sectors and discuss the applications in detail. 4.1 Healthcare As measured by the number of articles published on PubMed, the National Institute of Health’s search engine of medical references, interest in blockchain for use in biomedical applications has almost doubled year over year from 2015 to 2019. Blockchain usage in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) holds promise, with five characteristics of EHRs that must be addressed by any blockchain solution: governance, interoperability, privacy, scalability, and security [29, 82]. The blockchain characteristics to meet those needs include immutability, cryptography, distribution, decentralization, transparency, auditability, and nonrepudiation [82]. Technical solutions for guaranteeing privacy and security in biomedical blockchain applications using blockchain have been proposed, including using the cryptocurrency Ethereum along with the Onion Router for remote health monitoring [10], as well as a novel blockchain called Enigma, designed for exchanging EHR data [121]. The use of blockchain as an overarching health information exchange for protected health information to be exchanged nationally in the United States was proposed, with a theoretical blockchain-based technology to be used as a record locator service pointing to demographic copies of medical records stored in a shared set of servers called Patient Identity Brokers [51]. Such a design lends itself well to recent regulatory changes in the United States. The 21st Cures Act not only gave patients a right to their health data but also said that healthcare systems cannot information block that data. The legislation was made in 2016, and it was not until March 2020 that a final rule was issued by the Office of the National Coordinator detailing how the information exchange from the provider to the patient was to work. That office created a technical framework and compliance structure for enabling protected health information to flow securely as the patient directs it. The technical framework is essentially a distributed system that lends itself to the possibility of blockchain usage, with interoperability between IT systems more possible than ever through the creation of a standardized core dataset that all participants must use. Most of the projects in the healthcare sector focus on utilizing blockchain as a reliable platform for data sharing. Indeed, the critical nature of healthcare data makes blockchains unique in facilitating secure data sharing. However, implementing a large-scale EHR data exchange system is not easy, with or without using blockchains. Effort from multiple disciplines and across stakeholders are necessary to make it possible, and realizing that vision in a final system, while also maintaining security, will be challenging. Perhaps, though, now more than ever such a system is possible, as the global pandemic has made it a necessity that health data flow more freely than ever before. New technology is needed to address both public health needs and the need for the individual’s medical chart to be readily accessible to the patient or provider. 4.2 Critical Infrastructures (Energy Sector) The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defines 16 critical infrastructures including energy, food and agriculture, and transportation, among others. It is stated that “the security and resilience advances a national policy to strengthen and maintain secure, functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure” [91]. Due to the nature of critical infrastructures, blockchain application in critical infrastructures has been widely explored. Besides the financial and healthcare sectors (also considered critical infrastructures), other domains such as the energy sector are under investigation by governments around the world. As an example, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded several projects to both industry and academia to create the “Energy Internet” [66]. The purpose is to build an advanced management framework for distributed energy resources to support fast, scalable, and secure peer-to-peer communications.","completion":"This study reviews use cases of blockchain in healthcare and critical infrastructure sectors, noting a lack of technical details due to the ongoing nature of many projects.

As an example, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded several projects to both industry and academia to create the “Energy Internet” [66]. The purpose is to build an advanced management framework for distributed energy resources to support fast, scalable, and secure peer-to-peer communications. Blockchain in the energy sector can involve multiple aspects, ranging from energy trading to management of IoT devices and energy resources management [14, 85]. In Table 3, we present the representative areas of blockchain adoption in the energy sector. Energy trading, especially renewable energy trading and management, is one of the main areas found in current blockchain projects in several countries [35, 67, 70]. For instance, a project supported by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment aims at building a system for measuring and managing self-consumed renewable energy [35]. The project utilizes the cryptocurrency side of the blockchain technology to build the trading system. Specifically, the self-consumed renewable energy is first converted into tradable values and sent to the blockchain network. The real-time trading prices are then calculated according to the exchange cost and demand. When the transactions are finalized, energy can be exchanged locally without having to be transmitted to a central location. Similar methods have been used in projects from other countries such as the United States and Australia [67, 70] that have been shown to greatly reduce the management and trading cost. Besides other components such as energy resource management, such a use case shares a lot of similarity with blockchains in the financial domain. In other words, the adoption of blockchain could potentially reduce the cost for any financial transaction in the energy sector and remove the need for a trusted single party. Smart energy involves the management of IoT devices and energy assets. Research projects, industrial projects, and governmental pilots have been found [46, 68, 92]. Such projects usually involve efforts from both industry and academia to be successful. For instance, in the past few years, the Department of Energy announced funding for both university-led and industry-led research projects to integrate IoT technologies with the energy infrastructure, several of which focus on blockchain and IoT integration [47, 66]. The purpose is to provide robust and scalable infrastructure in the energy sector. This use case is similar with managing IoT assets using blockchain as used in other application domains, such as supply chain and healthcare. There are still many challenges, because the integration of energy-related infrastructure and blockchain software is not easy. Energy-related devices suffer from numerous physical threats since the deployment environments are heterogeneous. Despite the challenges, such an integration can greatly benefit energy infrastructure by enhancing the security and efficiency of resource management, potentially disrupting different aspects in the energy sector such as energy sharing [114] and electric vehicle charging [72]. Another noteworthy aspect in the energy sector is the protection of mission critical systems, although the available approaches do not directly utilize the “blockchain” technology. For instance, several works focus on building intrusion-tolerant Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems [18, 19, 90], where SCADA is the core control system for the power grid. Such approaches use BFT to build an intrusion-tolerant SCADA system. Since BFT is the core mechanism for permissioned blockchains and some hybrid blockchains, BFT-based SCADA can provide the same security guarantee with blockchains (i.e., high availability and integrity). The benefits of using only BFT instead of blockchains include better performance and more flexible system design.","completion":"In examining blockchain applications in healthcare and critical infrastructure, a scarcity of technical details was revealed, as many government-supported projects remain nascent. Research indicates a growing interest in blockchain's role in healthcare, particularly in managing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) due to its inherent characteristics like immutability and security. Innovations such as using Ethereum for health data exchange illustrate blockchain's potential to enhance privacy and governance, aligning with recent US regulatory changes like the 21st Cures Act. This propels the move towards distributed systems within the healthcare sector, although implementing large-scale blockchain solutions involves complex, cross-disciplinary efforts. The critical infrastructure sector, particularly energy, is also actively exploring blockchain. The US Department of Energy's \\"Energy Internet\\" epitomizes initiatives for a distributed framework to manage energy resources efficiently and securely. Blockchain applications in energy span from trading, especially in renewable energy, to IoT device and resource management. Projects in Japan, the US, and Australia demonstrate cost reductions and the elimination of centralized agents in energy transactions. While integrating blockchain within energy infrastructure presents challenges due to physical and environmental threats, potential benefits include enhanced security and operational efficiency, with BFT systems already providing similar protections sans blockchain, albeit with improved performance."},{"prompt":"How The European Horizon program supports blockchain projects across the European Union?","completion":"The European Horizon program, specifically Horizon 2020, has been the EU's primary funding program for research and innovation, running from 2014 to 2020.

This phenomenon, colloquially known as 'brain drain,' manifests as a significant obstacle impeding the nation's technological progress and managerial acumen. Historically, Iran has produced a wealth of talented individuals, especially in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). However, the migration of these individuals to other countries in search of better opportunities, stability, and quality of life has resulted in a vacuum of expertise within the nation's borders. The ramifications of this are multifaceted and profound, particularly in the realm of technology management — a field that demands a confluence of specialized knowledge and experience. At the core of technology management is the capacity to innovate, adapt, and maintain technological systems and infrastructures in a way that aligns with organizational goals and national interest. The stewardship of these systems necessitates a workforce that is not only proficient in technical skills but is also endowed with the ability to lead, strategize, and drive forward the technological agenda of the country. The departure of such skills hinders strategic planning, research and development, and ultimately, the sustainable competitiveness of the Iranian tech sector in the global landscape. This exodus engenders further implications: it dilutes the mentorship pipeline crucial for training the next generation of technologists and managers, undermines the collaborative networks essential for innovation, and curtails the domestic knowledge economy. When formative talents venture off-soil, it truncates the lifecycle of knowledge creation and application in local enterprises and institutions. National managers must contend with these realities and seek solutions that mitigate the effects of the skill gap while reinvigorating the framework that retains and cultivates homegrown talent. Proactive measures could include fostering an environment that is conducive to career growth, financial rewards, and professional development that meet international standards. Additionally, leveraging the diaspora through remote collaboration could capitalize on external expertise while nurturing future repatriation possibilities. Furthermore, investment in education and retaining top-tier educators should be paramount. Promoting research opportunities, practical tech incubators, and entrepreneurial ecosystems can incentivize the retention of the cognoscenti. By creating a virtuous cycle of knowledge transfer, innovation, and domestic opportunity, Iran can gradually alleviate the pressures wrought by this professional exodus. In conclusion, the departure of skilled technology management professionals poses a clear and present challenge to the Islamic Republic of Iran's aspirations to be a leader in the high-tech arena. It necessitates a multifaceted strategy, spearheaded by discerning national managers, to employ innovative approaches to workforce development, retention strategies, and an attractive domestic professional landscape — all quintessential for reversing the 'brain drain' tide and ensuring Iran's prosperous and technologically vibrant future."},{"prompt":"would you define and explain what skill gap is","completion":"A skill gap is a discrepancy between the skills that employers need to fulfill specific job functions and the skills that potential employees possess. It occurs when there is a mismatch between the supply (the available workforce) and demand (employer requirements) in the labor market for certain competencies or expertise. This gap can manifest in various forms: - **Technical Skills Gap:** This includes specific professional abilities and know-how, such as coding proficiency in a particular programming language or expertise in using certain technological tools, which are in demand but not widely possessed by job seekers. - **Soft Skills Gap:** These are non-technical, interpersonal, and cognitive skills, like communication, leadership, problem-solving, and adaptability, which are critical in the modern workplace but are often found lacking. Skill gaps can have broad implications. They can limit a company's or country's competitiveness and innovation, lead to increased operational costs, and impede economic growth. Moreover, they can contribute to job market inefficiencies, such as unemployment or underemployment. For a high-level national manager, understanding and identifying skill gaps is crucial. It allows the creation of targeted educational programs, professional development initiatives, and recruitment strategies that aim to equip the present and future workforce with the necessary skills to thrive in the evolving job market. Addressing skill gaps is also integral to strategic planning, as it impacts the ability to achieve organizational objectives and maintain a competitive edge in a global economy."},{"prompt":"would you give me some of your sources for the essay that you wrote earlier titled: \\"The Impact of Talent Emigration on Technology Management in the Islamic Republic of Iran\\"?","completion":"As an AI language model, I don't use external sources to create text or essays.

Baihua Joins the Group! (Seeking Monthly Tickets and Subscriptions for the Big Chapter)\\" (Page 3/3) This request is a bit too much for you,” he said. \\"That's it?\\" Elena asked with a smile, looking at Li Wei. \\"Ah... that's it.\\" Li Wei was internally apprehensive. The unintentional aura emitted by his Elemental Soul made him feel suffocated. \\"How about this, let me take a look at the content of the oath, and if it's not too overbearing, I'm willing to take the [Oath of Truth]!\\" said Elena. \\"The Oath of Truth?\\" Li Wei was startled. Even though he had not entered the Elemental Soul, he had heard of this oath. The oath system in the world of wizards is of several kinds. One is the most commonly used contract tablet in the wizarding world, relying on a legendary wizarding instrument similar to the [Heart of the Heavens Veil] as the overseer. This wizarding instrument is the [Codex of Soren], also known as the [Contract Codex]. The principle of the Contract Codex is that anyone with a contract tablet can use a \\"mental imprinted signature,\\" and then both the contract ability and the mental imprint will be monitored by the Codex. If one party breaks the contract, they will be punished by the Codex. The severity of the punishment depends on how seriously the contract terms are breached, the most severe being the eradication of the soul through the mental imprint, resulting in death! The advantage of the Contract Codex is that it has a wide audience, allowing countless people in the wizarding world to use it together. However, as a wizard's realm increases, the binding force will become weaker and weaker, mainly targeting low and mid-tier wizards. After the Elemental Soul, such binding force is merely formalistic and has no real significance. In addition to these legendary contract wizarding instruments officially by the council, some powerful wizards and organizations have their own contract wizarding instruments to enhance the binding force. Li Wei's Sword of Oath works on this principle as well. And the second kind is the extremely cautious [Oath of Truth] used between Elemental Soul wizards. Swearing upon the truth that is eternally unreachable amidst the obscurity! This is an absolutely inviolable oath, for a wizard, it is tantamount to violating the truth! At the very least, it would hinder the pursuit of the path of truth, and at worst, it would lead to the death of one's body and the extinction of one's path, from which even an Elemental Soul wizard cannot be spared! Li Wei didn't expect that Elena would give so much importance to the path of knighthood. After thinking it over, he imprinted the content of the oath on a slab and handed it to Elena. Elena calmly read it and then said, \\"It's alright, but there are some clauses I need to revise a bit. After I revise it, you can take a look again. As the price of modifying the clauses, I am willing to pay you an additional one million Tai Stones.\\" \\"Alright.\\" This scene made Li Wei feel as if he had returned to a business negotiation table from his previous life, where both sides were engaged in a tug-of-war. Elena seriously revised it, and finally, she handed over the revised version along with one million Tai Stones to Li Wei. Li Wei looked at the content of the oath; the parts that Elena modified didn't have a huge impact. The core clauses used to protect herself and her organization were untouched, she merely removed some of Li Wei's \\"overbearing clauses\\" and \\"format clauses\\" used to manage ordinary members, which was reasonable. A high-ranking Elemental Soul wizard like her would be willing to swear an oath at all, so there's no way she would agree to Li Wei's overbearing clauses. \\"I agree, but I don't need the Tai Stones. I've already felt your sincerity, ma'am!\\" Li Wei returned the Tai Stones. Elena glared at him and said, \\"You're making an Elemental Soul wizard take them back? Do I have no dignity?\\" Li Wei reluctantly accepted them. Elena began to swear according to the content of the oath. \\"In truth above, witness shared by all knowledge...\\" After swearing, she stretched out her hand and said, \\"Give it to me, hmm, if it wasn't for Triss's sake, you little guy... forget it, I won't speak of it, I'll still need you to lead me into the Nightmare World in the future.\\" Li Wei chuckled and quickly handed over the prepared methods to Elena, asking, \\"If I may ask, what breathing technique do you practice, ma'am?\\" \\"The Banyan Dragon Breathing Technique.\\" Li Wei thought about it. He already had a lead on the subsequent magic potions for breakthroughs in the Banyan Dragon Breathing Technique. When the time was right, he could give them to the Baihua Knight. The so-called Banyan Dragon is clearly an Immortal Banyan Dragon. With Baihua's status, she might be able to obtain the essence of the Immortal Banyan Dragon's bloodline, and her future on the path of knighthood will not be slow. Elena quickly finished looking at the method, and her expression changed from calm to slightly surprised, as if seeing the legacy of the Alcoholic Qi Sect for the first time. \\"So that's how it is! Hahaha, I understand now!\\" Elena laughed without the poise of a lady. She suddenly turned to Li Wei and said, \\"I'd like to borrow your training room.\\" \\"Of course.\\" Li Wei accompanied the Baihua Knight to the training room. Elena drew her greatsword, and the blood energy of her peak Blood Awakening realm surged out. This blood energy, colorful as flowers, began to bloom on the greatsword! \\"Li Wei, I feel that the opportunity for my breakthrough has come. I need to go into seclusion immediately, there's no problem staying here for a few days, right?\\" Elena asked. \\"As long as you take the oath and join my Twilight Knight Order, we're family... Please make yourself at home, no need to be polite. If there's a chance, I'll introduce the other team members to you,\\" Li Wei said. In the training room, Elena quickly set up her own sixth-level protective array and went into seclusion. Back in his room, Li Wei grinned to himself and said, \\"Successfully recruited the epic card [Baihua Knight ∙ Elena]!\\" ... Seven days later. In the training room, Elena opened her eyes. She looked at her jade-like palms and then caused a wound with her greatsword. She didn't use any magical abilities, and after a moment, the wound healed by itself. \\"Such a strong self-healing physique, comparable to a professional second-ring healing spell. Besides, my body has become tougher, almost on par with a second-ring extraordinary creature. Is this the feeling of breaking through the legendary shackles?\\" With Elena's current realm, such an increase in strength is negligible, but it's only the beginning, and there's still a long way to go in the future! \\"Congratulations to Lady Elena for breaking through the legendary shackles,\\" Li Wei congratulated. \\"Thank you for the methods. Don't worry, I'll keep my oath. After all, I am now a member of the Twilight Knights, right?\\" Elena said with a smile. \\"Having you join is a fortunate event for our order. We hold a member gathering once a year, and if you are interested, you can participate,\\" Li Wei said. \\"Ok, I will take my leave now. I have to prepare for dealing with Agnes. Goodbye... My Commander!\\" Elena looked at Li Wei with a teasing smile. \\"It's too much, you can call me Li Wei,\\" Li Wei said with a wry smile. \\"In the path of a wizard, I am your senior, but on the path of knighthood, you are my senior. We are each other's guide in our respective fields, no contradiction,\\" Elena said with a smirk, patting Li Wei's shoulder before leaving gracefully. Li Wei stood in place, pondering the meaning behind her words. \\"It seems to make sense; I am, after all, a dignified fourth-level knight, two whole realms above the Baihua Knight.\\" Returning to the wizard's tower, Li Wei continued his great way of liver experience. ... Time flies, and years pass by quickly. In the blink of an eye, a year had gone by. Holy Radiance Calendar 1161, the first day of the Original Month. Li Wei woke up from his seclusion as usual. In his mind, in the Sanctum of the Law Rings, there are already 350 drops of spirit dew! Feeling his increasingly powerful spiritual force, he was indescribably comfortable. Aside from the growth of his spiritual force, Li Wei's arcane progress had not slowed either. Fourth-ring protective spell ∙ Earth Burst Barrier, successfully reached the ninth order, greatly increasing its defensive power and explosive force. And his innate talent spell, Lightning Dragon Flash, had reached the tenth order. He had previously tested in the Nightmare World, and the speed of the tenth order Lightning Dragon Flash was comparable to the speed of his Scarlet Cloak-boosted Scarlet Breathing Technique. And the Lightning Dragon Flash, the tenth order, was not the limit; it could continue to be trained to the eleventh order. By then, Li Wei estimated that the speed of the Lightning Dragon Flash would be comparable to that of an ordinary fifth-ring wizard, and only the life-burning Scarlet Blood Escape could firmly suppress it. As for the ordinary fourth-ring spells, Thunder Dog and Solar Strike, they also entered the tenth order. However, Wind Dragon Sprint was still a bit short of the ninth order. \\"Before the Dark Ancient Tower opens, if I can figure out the sixth innate talent spell, it will be perfect.\\" After entering the Dark Ancient Tower, he might be busy seeking opportunities and battling with others. Li Wei estimated that he would not have time to research spells. So he decided, in the last four years, he would focus on his sixth innate talent spell, prioritizing it above others. \\"The earth, burning, storm, ocean, thunder... The sixth talent spell will be frost. After reaching the fifth ring, the seventh talent spell will be the bronze school,\\" Li Wei had already made plans. After he kills Agnes, he'll make another trip to the Frost Domain to collect a batch of frost school spells and research them. With an additional one million from Baihua Knight, he now has a total of five million Tai Stones. If they can't be converted into combat effectiveness before entering the Dark Ancient Tower, it will be wasteful inside. After all, in such chaotic places, no one will trade with Li Wei normally. \\"Mr. Moebius, it's time for a meeting.\\" \\"Alright.\\" This year is the 60th Round Table Conference. Entering the conference, all 11 official members were present. Unfortunately, Elena was busy with her seclusion, preparing to deal with Agnes, and Li Wei did not dare to disturb her. Otherwise, it would have been 12. \\"How's the situation in the sanctuary?\\" Li Wei asked. \\"All is well, and we've also developed some level-one battle techniques recently,\\" replied the Blood Knight. He took out three booklets. \\"Spiral Sword Slash,\\" \\"Annihilating Hammer Blow,\\" and \\"Meteor Spear Technique.\\" There were techniques for sword, hammer, and spear. \\"Not bad, keep it up.\\" Li Wei duplicated these legacies, collecting them for occasional reference. When more than three gathered, there would always be something to learn from. The wisdom of individuals always has its unique insights. \\"Additionally, we have a new Blood Awakening knight in the organization named Long Javelin Knight. This Meteor Spear Technique was created by him,\\" said the Blood Knight. \\"I remember him; in the future, he can be arranged to participate in the Round Table Conference. Also, another heavyweight member has joined our organization; in the next meeting, I will introduce her to you,\\" Li Wei said. \\"Okay, looking forward to it. Even you, our leader, say she's a heavyweight, so she must be a major figure,\\" said Mudi with a look of anticipation. The other members were also guessing in their hearts about what kind of person it might be. Afterwards, the members exchanged information and discussed problems related to their cultivation. After the meeting, Li Wei went to the secret chamber of the wizard's tower. Over the past year, he had also visited the Nightmare World several times and collected quite a few Nightmare Crystals. Moreover, based on his own sense of danger, he inferred that Agnes should have already returned to her domain. He felt that it was time to team up with Elena again to enter the Nightmare World to deal with Agnes as soon as possible, so he could become a true lord. By then, owning a domain of nightmare creatures, finding the Dragon Clan of Nightmares shouldn't be difficult. Otherwise, relying on himself and Jiu Ying (Nine Babies) would be too slow. Three months later, Elena emerged from her seclusion. She looked down at the message left by Li Wei and smiled knowingly. Today, 10,000 words, with an additional 4,000 words, leaving an owed total of 31,000 words! Typos will be corrected after updating! We're approaching the end of the month, comrades, ask for monthly tickets, subscriptions, and recommendation tickets!

Hundred Flowers Joining the Group! (In search of monthly subscription and support) (Page 3/3) This demand might be too much for you.\\" \\"Just this?\\" Elena asked with a smile, looking at Levi. \\"Ah... Just this.\\" Levi felt uneasy inside. The unintentional display of power from his spirit had left him feeling suffocated. \\"How about this? Show me the content of the oath, and if it's not too excessive, I am willing to take the [Oath of Truth]!\\" Elena proposed. \\"The Oath of Truth?\\" Levi was startled. Even without entering the realm of soul, he had heard of this oath. The wizarding world's system of oaths comes in several forms. One is the most commonly used - the Contract Tablet - run by a legendary witch's artifact similar to the [Heart of the Heavenly Net] as the overseer. This artifact is called [Soron's Codex], also known as the [Contract Codex]. The principle of the Contract Codex is that anyone with a Contract Tablet can use a \\"spirit mark\\" as a signature, and then both the binding power and the spirit mark will be monitored by the Codex. If one party breaches, they will be subject to punishment, the severity of which depends on the seriousness of the breach, with the worst being the annihilation of the soul through the spirit mark, effectively a death sentence! The advantage of the Codex is its wide reach, allowing countless people in the wizarding world to use it together. However, as a wizard's realm increases, the binding force weakens, primarily targeting lower and mid-level wizards. Beyond the spirit realm, such restraint is purely formal and entirely meaningless. Aside from the official legendary contracts of the council, some powerful wizards and organizations have their own contract artifacts to strengthen binding power. Levi's Sword of Oath works on the same principle. The second type is the highly cautious [Oath of Truth] used among soul realm wizards. Swearing to the unreachable eternal truth! Such an oath is absolutely unbreakable, amounting to a betrayal of truth for the wizard! At best, it hinders the pursuit of truth; at worst, it leads to death and the end of one's path. Even soul realm wizards cannot escape! Levi didn't expect that Elena took the knightly path so seriously. He thought for a while and etched the content of the oath onto a stone tablet, handing it to Elena. Elena calmly reviewed it, then said, \\"Okay, some clauses need to be changed. I'll amend them and you can review them again. As the price for amending the clauses, I am willing to pay you an additional one million Taishi (a form of currency).\\" \\"Alright.\\" This scene felt to Levi like a return to business negotiations from his past life, with both sides engaged in a tug of war. Elena earnestly revised the document and finally handed the amended version, along with one million Taishi, to Levi. Levi reviewed the oath content. Elena's amendments were not significant. She did not alter the core clauses meant to protect herself and the organization, but she did remove some overbearing and formal clauses that Levi had put in place to manage ordinary members. It made sense. After all, a soul wizard would naturally be reluctant to agree to Levi's overbearing clauses. \\"I agree, but I do not need this Taishi. Your sincerity is already apparent to me!\\" Levi handed back the Taishi. Elena gave him a stare and said, \\"Do you expect me, a soul wizard, to take it back? Do you think I have no dignity?\\" Levi sheepishly took it back. Elena started to recite the oath. \\"In truth above, in shared knowledge...\\" After taking the oath, she stretched out her hand and said, \\"Come on, hmm, if it weren't for Triss's sake, you little guy...Never mind, I'll need you to guide me to the Nightmare World later.\\" Levi chuckled and quickly passed the prepared method to Elena, asking, \\"If I may be so bold, what breathing technique do you practice, my lady?\\" \\"The Banyan Dragon Breathing Technique.\\" Levi pondered. He had some ideas about breakthrough potions for the Banyan Dragon Breathing Technique. When the time was ripe, he could offer it to the Hundred Flowers Knight. The so-called Banyan Dragon, quite obviously, refers to the Immortal Banyan Dragon. With Hundred Flowers' position, it's possible that they may acquire the essence of the Banyan Dragon's bloodline, fostering her advancement on the knightly path. Elena quickly finished reading the method and her expression changed from calm to surprised, just like the first time she saw the tradition of the Intense Liquor Qi Sect. \\"So that's it! Hahaha, now I understand!\\" Elena laughed unladily, and suddenly told Levi, \\"I need to borrow your training room.\\" \\"Of course.\\" Levi accompanied the Hundred Flowers Knight to the training room. Elena drew her greatsword, and her peak Blood Awakening realm's energy surged out. This colorful energy, like blossoming flowers, sprang up on her greatsword! \\"Levi, I feel the moment for my breakthrough has come. I need to go into seclusion. Do you mind if I stay here for a few days?\\" Elena asked. \\"As long as you take the oath and join my Twilight Knights, you are family... Do as you please, feel at home, and don't be shy. I'll introduce you to the other members when the opportunity comes,\\" said Levi. Inside the training room, Elena hastily set up her own sixth-level protective magic array and then entered seclusion. Back in his room, Levi smiled contentedly to himself, \\"I've successfully recruited the epic card [Hundred Flowers Knight, Elena]!\\" ... Seven days later. In the training room, Elena opened her eyes. She looked at her own palm that was as white as jade, then sliced a wound with her greatsword. Without using any magic, the wound healed on its own within moments. \\"Such a strong self-healing physique, comparable to a professional second-circle healing spell. In addition to this, my physical body has become even more robust, almost on par with a second-circle supernatural creature. Is this the feeling of breaking free from the shackles of legend?\\" For Elena at her current level, this increase in strength is insignificant, but it is only the beginning, with a long road ahead. \\"Congratulations to Lady Elena on breaking the legendary shackles,\\" said Levi in congratulations. \\"Thanks for your method. Don't worry, I will keep my oath since I'm now a member of the Twilight Knights, right?\\" Elena said with a smile. \\"With the lady joining, it is a great fortune for our Knights. We hold a meeting of members once a year, and if you are interested, you can participate,\\" Levi said. \\"Alright, then I'm off. I need to prepare for dealing with Anais, farewell... my Captain!\\" Elena looked at Levi with a teasing glance. \\"Undeserved, Lady. You can call me Levi,\\" Levi responded with a wry smile. \\"On the path of wizardry, I am your senior; on the path of knighthood, you are my senior. We each have our expertise, no contradiction,\\" Elena grinned, patting Levi’s shoulder before departing nonchalantly. Levi stood there, pondering his words. \\"Seems right. I am, after all, a grand level-four knight, two whole realms above the Hundred Flowers Knight.\\" Back at the wizard's tower, Levi continued his pursuit of experience. ... Time flies, and the years pass swiftly. In the blink of an eye, a year had gone by. Holy Glow Calendar, the year 1161, the first day of the Original Month. Levi, as usual, woke up from seclusion. In his mind, within the sanctum of the law circle tower, he had 350 drops of mental dew! Feeling his increasingly powerful mental energy, he was inexpressibly pleased. Besides the growth of his mental power, Levi hadn't neglected his magical studies. The fourth-ring defense spell, Earth Explosion Barrier, successfully reached the ninth order, increasing both its defense and explosion power. And his innate spell, Thunder Dragon Flash, had even reached the tenth order. He had tested it in the Nightmare World; the speed of the tenth-order Thunder Dragon Flash was comparable to the speed of his Scarlet Cloak boosted by the Scarlet Breathing Technique. Moreover, Thunder Dragon Flash's tenth order was not the limit; it could continue to be improved to the eleventh order. By then, the speed of Thunder Dragon Flash, Levi estimated, would rival that of an ordinary fifth-order wizard. Only extraordinary escape techniques like the Scarlet Blood Escape, which burn life for speed, could securely surpass it. As for his other regular fourth-order spells, Thunder Hound and Sun Splitting Strike both stepped into the tenth order. As for Wind Dragon Surge, it was just short of reaching the ninth order. \\"Before entering the Dark Tower, if I can research my sixth innate spell, that would be perfect.\\" Once inside the Dark Tower, he might be busy seeking opportunities and engaging in spell battles. Levi figured he wouldn't have time to study spells. So he decided to focus on his sixth innate spell for the last four years, prioritizing it over everything else. \\"Earth, fire, storm, ocean, thunder... for my sixth innate spell, it shall be frost. After reaching the fifth ring, for the seventh innate spell, I'll choose the bronze faction.\\" Levi had already made plans. After defeating Anais, he would make another trip to the Frost Realm to collect a series of frost faction spells to study. With an additional one million from the Hundred Flowers Knight, he now had a whopping five million Taishi. If he couldn't convert it into strength before entering the Dark Tower, it will be a waste inside that chaotic place, since there would be no ordinary transactions with Levi. \\"Mr. Mobius, I want to hold a meeting.\\" \\"Understood.\\" This year was the 60th Round Table Conference. Entering the conference, all 11 official members were present. Unfortunately, Elena was busy preparing to deal with Anais and Levi didn't dare disturb her. Otherwise, there would have been 12 members. \\"How are things at the sanctuary?\\" Levi asked. \\"All is well, and we have also recently developed some level one battle techniques,\\" the Blood Knight replied. He presented three volumes. \\"Spiral Sword Slash,\\" \\"Total Annihilation Hammer,\\" and \\"Meteor Spear Technique.\\" Techniques for sword, hammer, and spear. \\"Not bad, keep it up.\\" Levi duplicated these legacies and collected them, so he could refer to them at his leisure. The wisdom of individuals often has its unique points. \\"In addition, a new Blood Awakening knight has been born within the organization, named the Long Spear Knight. This Meteor Spear Technique was created by him,\\" the Blood Knight reported. \\"I remember him. In the future, he can be arranged to attend the Round Table Meeting. Also, another influential member has joined our organization, I will introduce her to you at the next meeting,\\" Levi said. \\"Fantastic, I can't wait. When even you, the Captain, says they are influential, that must be a big deal,\\" said Mudi with anticipation on his face. The other members also speculated internally about the identity of the new member. Following that, the members exchanged information on issues related to cultivation and intelligence. After the meeting, Levi went to the wizard's tower's secret chamber. In the past year, he had visited the Nightmare World several times, collecting a fair amount of Nightmare Crystals. Moreover, based on his sense of danger, he concluded that Anais must have already returned to her domain. He felt it was time to team up with Elena again to venture into the Nightmare World, to dispose of Anais sooner so that he could become a true lord. At that time, possessing a realm's nightmare creature to search for the Nightmare Dragon Clan wouldn't be difficult. Otherwise, relying solely on himself and the Nine-Headed Serpent, that would be far too slow. Three months later, Elena emerged from her seclusion. She looked down at the message Levi had left for her and smiled knowingly. Today's word count is 10,000, with an additional 4,000 words for the update, leaving an outstanding 31,000 words to update! Typos will be corrected later! It's the end of the month, comrades, I ask for your monthly votes, subscriptions, and recommendation tickets! (End of chapter)"},{"prompt":"how does more stability lead to increased entropy","completion":"The statement \\"more stability leads to increased entropy\\" may be misleading or misunderstood, as stability and entropy are not directly correlated in the way this suggests. Let's clarify these concepts: - Stability refers to the tendency of a system or state to maintain its condition over time or to return to that condition when disturbed. In a chemical context, stability often relates to how energetically favorable a molecular structure is, which can be related to the strength of bonds, the strain in a molecule, or other factors that influence the potential energy of the system. - Entropy is a measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases; in other words, natural processes tend to move towards a state of higher entropy. It is possible for a process that leads to a more stable state to also result in increased entropy. This can occur during exothermic reactions where the products are more stable than the reactants (having a lower potential energy), and the release of energy allows the surroundings to increase in entropy. For example, when a hydrocarbon burns in oxygen, the carbon and hydrogen atoms rearrange into carbon dioxide and water, which are more stable, lower energy products. The heat released in the process increases the entropy of the surrounding environment because it leads to an increase in movement (kinetic energy) of surrounding molecules. However, it is not universally true that stability and entropy increase together. There are many situations where a system increases in stability while its entropy decreases. One example is in the formation of crystals, where atoms or molecules arrange themselves in a highly ordered, repeating structure, which is more energetically stable. As the atoms or molecules become more ordered, the entropy of the system decreases, despite the increased stability. To better understand the relationship between stability and entropy in a given process, it is important to consider both the system and its surroundings and to apply the laws of thermodynamics to the overall change. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is often used to assess whether a process is thermodynamically favorable, as it takes into account both enthalpy (ΔH, related to stability/energy content) and entropy (ΔS) at a given temperature (T) using the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. In sum, stability and entropy have complex relationships that depend on the details of the system and process in question. They are not directly linked in a way that would allow for a generalization such as \\"more stability leads to increased entropy.\\""},{"prompt":"what if the forward reaction has more numbers of products compared to reactants, will entropy increase","completion":"If a chemical reaction results in a greater number of product molecules compared to reactant molecules, it is often the case that the entropy of the system increases. This is because having a larger number of particles generally leads to an increase in the possible ways those particles can be arranged, which is related to the concept of entropy as a measure of disorder or randomness within a system. Let's consider a simple example: [ text{N}_2 + 3 text{H}_2 rightarrow 2 text{NH}_3 ] In this reaction, nitrogen gas reacts with three molecules of hydrogen gas to produce two molecules of ammonia. Here, the total of four reactant molecules yields two product molecules, and in this specific case, the entropy decreases because there are fewer gas molecules in the products than in the reactants, resulting in fewer possible microstates and thus lower disorder. However, if a reaction went in the opposite direction, breaking down a smaller number of larger molecules into a greater number of smaller ones (especially if they are gases), we would typically see an increase in entropy. For example: [ 2 text{NH}_3 rightarrow text{N}_2 + 3 text{H}_2 ] This is the reverse of the previous reaction. In this case, two molecules of ammonia break down into one molecule of nitrogen gas and three molecules of hydrogen gas. The increase from two to four molecules generally would result in an increase in entropy due to the increased number of gas particles and the greater number of possible microstates they can occupy. It's important to consider the physical state of the reactants and products as well. For example, the dissociation of a solid into gas molecules would result in a significant increase in entropy because gases have much more freedom of motion and many more available microstates than a solid. The concept holds generally for phase changes, such as solid to liquid or liquid to gas transitions, which are accompanied by increases in entropy. Hence, while the increase in the number of product molecules compared to reactant molecules can be associated with an increase in entropy, the actual change in entropy for any given reaction can depend on various factors including the states of matter involved and the specific conditions of the reaction."},{"prompt":"what is wrong with this code: @startuml left to right direction actor Administrator actor User package \\"User Management\\" { usecase \\"UM-1: Create User Account\\" as UC1 { note right - The system lets administrators create new user accounts. - Requires username, password, first name, last name, email address, user role. - Optional: phone number, department, job title. - Enforces password complexity. - Validates user input for validity and uniqueness. - Sends welcome email to new user. end note } usecase \\"UM-2: Edit User Account\\" as UC2 { note right - Allow administrators and users to edit account info. - Editable: password, first name, last name, email address, phone number, department, job title. - Same validation principles as UM-1. end note } usecase \\"UM-3: Delete User Account\\" as UC3 { note right - Allows administrators to delete user accounts. - Confirms before deletion. - May retain data for compliance (period TBD). end note } usecase \\"UM-4: Manage User Roles and Permissions\\" as UC4 { note right - Allows administrators to define and manage user roles and permissions. - Customizable roles and granular permissions. - User-friendly interface for management. end note } usecase \\"UM-5: User Login and Authentication\\" as UC5 { note right - Allows user login with username/password. - Implements secure authentication protocols. - Offers password recovery options. end note } } Administrator --> UC1 : authorizes Administrator --> UC2 : authorizes Administrator --> UC3 : authorizes Administrator --> UC4 : authorizes User --> UC2 : self-editnauthorizes User --> UC5 : uses @enduml","completion":"The given code seems to be for PlantUML, which is a tool to create UML diagrams using a simple and intuitive language.

Here's your code with a minor adjustment, removing the unnecessary curly braces \`{}\` and using standard PlantUML syntax for use cases with attached notes: \`\`\`plantuml @startuml left to right direction actor Administrator actor User package \\"User Management\\" { usecase \\"UM-1: Create User Account\\" as UC1 note right of UC1 - The system lets administrators create new user accounts. - Requires username, password, first name, last name, email address, user role. - Optional: phone number, department, job title. - Enforces password complexity. - Validates user input for validity and uniqueness. - Sends welcome email to new user. end note usecase \\"UM-2: Edit User Account\\" as UC2 note right of UC2 - Allow administrators and users to edit account info. - Editable: password, first name, last name, email address, phone number, department, job title. - Same validation principles as UM-1. end note usecase \\"UM-3: Delete User Account\\" as UC3 note right of UC3 - Allows administrators to delete user accounts. - Confirms before deletion. - May retain data for compliance (period TBD). end note usecase \\"UM-4: Manage User Roles and Permissions\\" as UC4 note right of UC4 - Allows administrators to define and manage user roles and permissions. - Customizable roles and granular permissions. - User-friendly interface for management. end note usecase \\"UM-5: User Login and Authentication\\" as UC5 note right of UC5 - Allows user login with username/password. - Implements secure authentication protocols. - Offers password recovery options. end note } Administrator --> UC1 : authorizes Administrator --> UC2 : authorizes Administrator --> UC3 : authorizes Administrator --> UC4 : authorizes User --> UC2 : self-editnauthorizes User --> UC5 : uses @enduml \`\`\` If you're using an editor that supports PlantUML or running it through a processor and it's giving an error, please provide the specific error message so that a more precise diagnosis can be made."},{"prompt":"rewrite the code to use include, extend relationships","completion":"To rewrite the code to use the include and extend relationships in PlantUML, we must first identify the appropriate use cases where these relationships make sense. 'Include' is used when a use case contains behavior that is common to other use cases, while 'Extend' is used when a use case adds additional behavior to another under specific conditions. Based on the original requirements mentioned in the notes, it's not completely clear how these would be represented with extends or includes due to the lack of detailed scenarios. However, I can provide an example with assumptions on typical behavior of a use management system: - \\"Create User Account\\" might include a common validation use case since it is mentioned that it validates user input. - \\"Edit User Account\\" could potentially include the same validation. - \\"User Login and Authentication\\" might extend with \\"Password Recovery\\" under certain conditions (i.e., when a user has forgotten their password). Here is an example of how this could be represented: \`\`\`plantuml @startuml left to right direction actor Administrator actor User package \\"User Management\\" { usecase \\"Validate User Input\\" as Validate usecase \\"UM-1: Create User Account\\" as UC1 usecase \\"UM-2: Edit User Account\\" as UC2 usecase \\"UM-3: Delete User Account\\" as UC3 usecase \\"UM-4: Manage User Roles and Permissions\\" as UC4 usecase \\"UM-5: User Login and Authentication\\" as UC5 usecase \\"Password Recovery\\" as Recovery UC1 -up-|> Validate : << include >> UC2 -up-|> Validate : << include >> UC5 .down.|> Recovery : << extend >> note right of Validate - Common validation logic for user input. - Enforces uniqueness and password complexity. end note note right of UC1 - Admins can create new user accounts. - Requires multiple user details. - Sends welcome email to new user. end note note right of UC2 - Admins and users edit account info. - Uses same validation as creation. end note note right of UC3 - Admins can delete accounts. - Retention policies may apply. end note note right of UC4 - Admins define user roles and permissions. - Customizable with granular control. end note note right of UC5 - Users login with username and password. - Secure authentication protocols. end note note right of Recovery - Triggers if user forgets password. - Verifies user identity for reset. end note } Administrator --> UC1 : authorizes Administrator --> UC2 : authorizes Administrator --> UC3 : authorizes Administrator --> UC4 : authorizes User --> UC2 : self-editnauthorizes User --> UC5 : uses @enduml \`\`\` Remember that this is just a theoretical example, and the actual includes or extends relationships would be based on the real behavior of the system being modeled.

The descriptions should be expanded to include all the necessary information as per your system's specifications."},{"prompt":"give a brief description of the code","completion":"The provided PlantUML code describes a Use Case diagram for a \\"User Management\\" system. This system involves two types of actors: an \\"Administrator\\" and a \\"User.\\" The diagram illustrates how these actors interact with various use cases and also how some use cases include or extend others for additional functionality. There are several use cases depicted in this system: 1. **UM-1: Create User Account (UC1)** - Administrators can create new user accounts, which involves a series of user input validations. 2. **UM-2: Edit User Account (UC2)** - Both Administrators and Users have the ability to edit user account information. 3. **UM-3: Delete User Account (UC3)** - Administrators can delete user accounts, with considerations for data retention policies. 4. **UM-4: Manage User Roles and Permissions (UC4)** - Administrators define and manage user roles and permissions in a customizable and granular approach. 5. **UM-5: User Login and Authentication (UC5)** - Users can log in with their username and password using secure authentication protocols. Additionally, we have: 6. **Validate User Input (Validate)** - A common use case for validating user input, which is included in both the \\"Create User Account\\" and \\"Edit User Account\\" use cases. 7. **Password Recovery (Recovery)** - An extended use case for \\"User Login and Authentication\\" that allows users to recover their passwords under certain conditions. Relationships within the diagram: - The \\"Create User Account\\" and \\"Edit User Account\\" use cases include the \\"Validate User Input\\" use case, indicating that they share common functionality for validation. - The \\"User Login and Authentication\\" use case is extended by the \\"Password Recovery\\" use case, highlighting additional behavior accessible under a specific scenario such as a forgotten password. - The \\"Administrator\\" is connected to four use cases representing their authority to execute those actions. - The \\"User\\" actor is associated with the \\"Edit User Account\\" use case, enabling self-edits, and the \\"User Login and Authentication\\" use case for general usage. Notes are attached to each use case to give further details about the functionality and requirements. The use of the \`<<include>>\` and \`<<extend>>\` keywords provides a clear indication of shared or conditional behaviors within the diagram.

The program is designed to sort a large number of integers and measure the execution time while varying the number of threads used in parallel processing. Here is what the main components of the code do: 1. **Includes and Namespace**: Standard C++ libraries (\`iostream\`, \`vector\`, \`algorithm\`, \`cstdlib\`, and \`ctime\`) and the OpenMP library (\`omp.h\`) are included for input/output, data structure, algorithm, random number generation, time measurement, and parallel processing features, respectively. The \`using namespace std;\` statement allows direct use of standard library identifiers without the \`std::\` prefix. 2. **Function Prototypes**: These are declarations of the sorting functions and a helper function for performance measurement, which will be used later in the code. 3. **measureTime() Function**: This is a utility function used to measure the execution time of the sorting algorithms by passing a function pointer to the desired sorting algorithms (\`sortFunc\`), along with the data to sort and the number of threads to use. 4. **main() Function**: In the main function, the user is prompted to enter the number of integers to be sorted (\`N\`) and to choose a sorting algorithm. The program then generates an array (\`data\`) of \`N\` random integers with values ranging from 0 to \`MAX_VALUE\` (1000). It uses the \`rand()\` function seeded with the current time to ensure randomness. 5. **Performance Testing**: The program executes the chosen sorting algorithm five times for each thread count from the \`thread_counts\` vector while measuring and averaging the execution time. The \`measureTime()\` function is used for in-place sort algorithms (merge sort and quick sort), and direct timing (using \`gettimeofday()\`) is used for the counting sort, which operates on two separate arrays. 6. **parallelCountingSort() Function**: This function (implemented in the provided code) performs the parallel counting sort algorithm using OpenMP directives. It creates a histogram (\`count\`) in parallel, computes prefix sums serially (which could potentially be parallelized for larger \`maxValue\`), and then fills the sorted array (\`sorted_arr\`) based on the prefix sums in parallel, using mutual exclusion (\`#pragma omp critical\`) to prevent data races. 7. **Sorting Algorithm Implementation**: Not at all sorting function bodies are provided in the snippet, but the function prototypes indicate that merge sort and quick sort should be implemented with a parallel approach, presumably using OpenMP to take advantage of multi-threading. Note: While the \`parallelMergeSort()\`, \`merge()\`, \`parallelQuickSort()\`, and \`partition()\` functions are mentioned, their implementations are not included. To execute the code, these functions must be properly implemented and defined. The program shows how different sorting algorithms can take advantage of multi-threading by splitting work across available CPU cores, theoretically reducing sorting time as more threads are added. However, the effectiveness of parallelization will depend on many factors, including the algorithm used, the number of threads, the distribution of data, and hardware capabilities."},{"prompt":"A következőkben egy tesztet fogsz kapni.

Toons&Tunes was then later rebranded as its current name, Pop (formerly stylized as pop and POP!) in the following month. In the channel’s early years, links were presented by Rorry, a lime green dragon with a Scottish accent, who was animated live. He was accompanied by Purrdy, a dragon/cat hybrid who also appeared in the original Tricky programme on ITV1, it was sometimes followed by a programme known as “The Cheeky Monkey Show” which features the live links of the animated coloured monkeys known as “The Cheeky Monkeys,” that was later known by appearing on its sister channel Tiny Pop until its retirement at the end of June 2009. Originally, the network focused on music videos with animated programming also part of the schedule, but with the numerous music video network options on British television at the time, this focus was quickly abandoned in 2004, when the animated content became much more prominent. Music videos continued to be carried on and off until 2008, before eventually being abandoned entirely In 2012, Pop introduces semi-mascots known as the MoonGoons, These are animal-like aliens, with the 2 main ones being a blue squid named Boofus and an orange rabbit named Diggle, On 1 September 2008, Pop rebranded its on-air identity, with the premiere of Bakugan: Armored Alliance. And on the same day, starting with Pokémon Journeys: The Series, the network became the new British home of the Pokémon anime, moving from its previous broadcasters, ITV1 and CITV, of over 10 years. The channel was also sold by Sony to Narrative Entertainment, Also, Rorry and Purrdy were gone On 9 November 2010, Narrative Entertainment announced the launch of a new FAST channel, Pop Kids, to stream on Samsung TV Plus, the new FAST network airs shows from Pop and Tiny Pop. Sometime in 2009 Pop began to branch into YouTube content, as they approached Joe Tasker for a new show called Swipe It! With Joe Taker, they would later acquire from content creators to use on their channel, including LankyBox, Denis and EthanGamer (the latter exclusively airing on Pop Player), Also, a talking potato from Swipe It! would become the channels new mascot untill the 2008 branding was replaced in Autumn 2012. Joe Tasker however would leave the channel around March 2012, and his show was subsequently canned (which may have had a role in the Potato being replaced). By 2011 Alvin & the Chipmunks, Squish, Miraculous Ladybug, World of Quest and Pokemon were among the channels popular shows, the channel was sold to CSC Media Group in May 2012, who would make some sweeping changes In late July 2012 the Russian cartoon Smeshariki/Kikoriki (referred to by Pop as GoGoRiki) was added, Also, in early August Oggy & the Cockroaches was added, The Smurfs followed in mid August, In late September 2012 the channel rebranded with a new look, Also the potato from Swipe It stopped being the channels mascot, as new ones were added (Mentioned above), So far these new mascots have received praise for their cuteness By January 2013 there were a lot of new shows, the only pre Summer 2012 ones left were Pokemon and World of Quest. Pop Max was the only place to see those culled shows, but Pop Max became Kix in late January, and began adding action shows such as Yu-Gi-Oh, Digimon Data Squad and Chaotic in late February. Pop Player is to take off Alvin, Squish, Miraculous and Swipe It from 23rd of March. Write a forum convo where they refer to the new Pop as a “brave new world” Thread Title: Pop Channel’s New Direction – A Brave New World? User1: Hey everyone! Have you seen the news about Pop channel? It’s like we’re stepping into a brave new world with all the recent changes. It’s definitely not the Pop we grew up with! User2: Totally! The new mascots, the MoonGoons, are adorable. I caught my little cousin watching and she’s already a huge fan of Boofus and Diggle. User3: Brave new world, indeed. I’m gonna miss the old shows, tbh. Alvin & the Chipmunks and Miraculous Ladybug have been staples. And Swipe It! was legit entertaining, even as a placeholder between shows. User4: I’m a bit gutted about Swipe It! going away. That talking potato mascot was surprisingly a hit in our household. 😅 Can’t believe we’re actually saying goodbye to it. User5: It’s the circle of life for TV channels, I suppose. Pop’s evolution is impressive though. I remember when Rorry and Purrdy were the faces of the channel. Makes you realize just how much you’ve aged when a channel rebrands twice. 😂 User6: Yea, keeping Pokemon was a good move on their part. That franchise never seems to lose steam. But it’s sad to see some of the other pre-summer 2012 shows getting the chop. Are they still airing on Pop Max? User1: @User6 Kix is what you’ll want to check for older Pop Max content now since Kix replaced it. But they are going for a different vibe, loading up on the action-packed shows like Yu-Gi-Oh and Digimon. User7: Does anyone know if they’re bringing in any new animated series to replace the old ones? My kids love discovering new shows. User8: @User7 They added Smeshariki/Kikoriki and The Smurfs recently, and Oggy & the Cockroaches. Lots of content to keep the little ones busy. And for the Pokémon fans, they’ll be glad with its continuous run. User9: As much as it’s a ‘brave new world’, I kinda hope it doesn’t lose that quaint charm Pop had. That balance between nostalgic and trendy is tricky to maintain once channels start gunning for a new demographic. Moderator: Change is always a bit daunting but it often brings in great new opportunities. Let’s stay optimistic and give the new Pop a chance! And don’t forget, Pop Kids just launched on Samsung TV Plus, so you’ve got another platform for the youngsters’ entertainment needs! User10: Gonna take a bit to adjust, but who knows? The new lineup might just surprise us with some gems. Excited and curious to see what this ‘brave new world’ holds for Pop! 🌟 Please remember to keep the discussion friendly and respectful of others’ opinions. Let’s all embrace the new while celebrating the past of Pop! Write a follow up where they noticed the transition to the new look began in July,and the Swipe It potato didn’t appear in the Summer promo Thread Title: Pop’s Makeover and Final Farewell to Swipe It’s Spud User11: Just realized—Pop’s transition to the new look technically started back in July, didn’t it? The channel’s been gradually changing things up on us for a while now. User1: Yeah, you’re right @User11. It was kind of subtle at first. Noticed that the Swipe It potato mascot was MIA in the summer promo, which was a bit of a giveaway that things were changing. User2: Good catch! I missed that. Probably why the rebrand hasn’t been too shocking. It’s like they’ve been prepping us for this new wave coming through. User3: Man, and here I was, wondering why Mr. Potato had gone AWOL. Thought it was just taking a holiday, but seems like it was the start of the farewell tour. 🥺 User4: The writing was on the wall…or rather, the screen. There was this fresh and modern vibe to the summer promo that felt aligned with the so-called ‘brave new world’ we’re chatting about. User5: Subtle and sneaky, Pop! Giving us those little breadcrumbs leading up to the big reveal. It’s like a TV channel playing a long game of hide and seek with its audience. User12: Now that I think of it, there have been a bunch of small changes, like tweaks to the programming schedule and different styles for the promos. It’s clever, slowly acclimating us to the big change. Moderator: That’s right, Pop fans. Networks often use a gradual approach for transitions like this. It’s less jarring for the viewers and helps build anticipation for the new look. It’s bittersweet but also exciting. User6: So no more potato mascot, eh? I’ll miss that comical tuber. 😔 But I guess it’s time to embrace the MoonGoons with open arms! User7: Yup! It’s the dawn of the MoonGoons era! But I guess the SneakPeek Potato will always have a place in our Pop memories. User9: Sad to see some of the classics go and knowing the potato is peeling out of the picture. 😂 But let’s see what sort of sprouts grow from this new Pop soil. Hoping it’s nothing but good thymes! User10: Here’s to growth and new beginnings! Pop might just pop off with this new direction. Looking forward to some exciting surprises in their lineup! 🎈🎉 Remember, nostalgia is powerful, but so is the thrill of the new. Let’s give a warm welcome to all the fresh content coming our way, and keep the discussions coming as Pop unfolds its new era! Write a follow up where the Summer promo put a LOT of emphasis on the incoming shows and only 2 existing ones were shown Thread Title: Pop Channel’s Summer Promo: Signaling the Incoming Content Wave User6: Went back and watched that Summer promo again… it’s pretty obvious now. Pop put a TON of emphasis on the incoming shows, with hardly any screen time for the existing line-up. Just Pokémon and World of Quest got a brief moment, right? User1: For sure @User6, and it makes sense. They wanted to get everyone hyped for the new roster. It’s marketing 101: Flaunt the shiny new toys to get everyone excited. User11: Yeah, I picked up on that too. Almost felt like a grand reveal at an awards show. “And here’s the next lineup of superstar shows!” 😅 Clearly setting the stage for the future of Pop. User3: They played it smart. As much as some of us love the old shows, it’s the fresh content that’ll pull in new viewers and keep the channel evolving. User4: I figured as much when I saw more of the MoonGoons and less of… well, everything else during that promo. Looks like Pokémon and World of Quest were the honorary old guard making a brief cameo. User7: Only two oldies getting love in that promo?! Talk about playing favorites. Then again, Pokémon is like eternal gold for any network. User5: It’s exactly like they’re decorating for a party and putting up all these brand-new flashy decorations while the older, well-loved ones get pushed to the back of the shelf. Out with the old, in with the new, I guess. Moderator: Definitely, a strategic move to put the spotlight on that fresh content. Pushing forward with the new while giving a nod to a couple of constants shows Pop is trying to maintain some continuity amidst all the change. User9: Honestly, couldn’t help but get a little excited seeing all the new titles—I mean, it was hard not to with the emphasis they put on them. Looks like Pop’s ready to blast off into this ‘brave new world’ with all engines firing! User10: Looked to me like they were planting seeds for their future audience. My little cousins don’t even know what Swipe It! was, but they’re already talking about some of the new shows. User12: True, and that’s exactly what Pop is aiming for—a new generation of viewers. Yet, I do have a soft spot for nostalgia. Will be interesting to see if older fans will stick around through this overhaul. Remember everyone, while we hold on to our favorites, let’s keep an open mind about the new batch of shows. Who knows? Among them, there might just be the next classic that we’ll look back on fondly in the years to come! Let’s continue embracing the evolution of Pop and all the potential it holds. Enjoy the viewing!

However, I can provide you with recommendations on resources and machine learning models that could be used to create a motion tracking physical therapy app based on my training data up to my knowledge cutoff date in 2023. # Resources for Development: 1. **OpenPose:** - A real-time multi-person system to jointly detect human body, hand, facial, and foot keypoints on single images. It's widely used for motion tracking and can be a key tool in analyzing physical therapy exercises. 2. **PoseNet:** - A machine learning model that allows for real-time human pose estimation in the browser. It's a lightweight model that can run on mobile devices and is also suitable for web applications. 3. **MediaPipe:** - Google's open-source framework for building multimodal (video, audio, any time-series data) applied ML pipelines. It includes solutions like Pose, Holistic, which can track body and hand poses, and Face Mesh, which can work together to provide comprehensive tracking capabilities for physical therapy exercises. 4. **Kinect SDK:** - While not as commonly used in new applications, the SDK for Microsoft's Kinect can still be employed for sophisticated motion tracking, often used in rehabilitation and therapy settings. 5. **Apple ARKit and Google ARCore:** - These are augmented reality (AR) platforms that include human motion tracking features. They can be used in mobile applications to track movements during physical therapy exercises. 6. **Depth Cameras and Sensors:** - Using depth-sensing cameras like Intel RealSense can provide more accurate spatial tracking, which can be crucial in physical therapy for tracking the range of motion in three dimensions. # Machine Learning Models: 1. **OpenPose Models:** - Pretrained models for body, face, and hand keypoints detection. 2. **PoseNet Models:** - These can be used directly or fine-tuned with therapy-specific motions. 3. **MediaPipe Models:** - Pretrained holistic models can recognize body poses, hand gestures, and facial landmarks. 4. **Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** - Custom CNNs can be trained using TensorFlow or PyTorch on motion capture datasets specific to physical therapy exercises for more personalized motion tracking. 5. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs):** - Useful for understanding sequences of movements over time, which is important for tracking exercises in a physical therapy regimen. 6. **Transfer Learning Models:** - Apply models pretrained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and retrain them on a smaller, specialized dataset for physical therapy exercises to quickly achieve high accuracy. In creating a physical therapy app using these models, one would typically also have to compile a dataset of correct and incorrect exercise movements, possibly annotated by physical therapy professionals, to train and validate the machine learning models. It is essential to ensure data privacy and protection protocols are in place, given the sensitive nature of health-related data. Given that this field is evolving rapidly, it's recommended to consult the latest literature and resources on machine learning in physical rehabilitation for the most current models and approaches."},{"prompt":"How can i use openpose for this use case?","completion":"OpenPose is an open-source toolkit that can be used for real-time multi-person keypoint detection. It can identify and track body parts, hand positions, and facial landmarks in images and videos. This makes it useful for developing an application for physical therapy by tracking and analyzing the movements of patients during exercises. Here's how you might go about using OpenPose for this use case: # 1. Setup: First, you'll need to set up OpenPose on your system. The OpenPose GitHub repository provides installation instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You'll need to ensure you have all the prerequisites installed, like CMake and CUDA (for GPU acceleration), and then you can build OpenPose from the source code. # 2. Data Capture: You will need to capture video data of the patient performing exercises. This could be done using a normal camera, a webcam, or a smartphone camera. Ensure the video is clear, and the environment is well-lit to maximize the accuracy of keypoint detection. # 3. Running OpenPose: Once OpenPose is set up, you can run the software on the captured video data. OpenPose will generate a set of keypoints for each frame in the video, providing you with the positions of different parts of the body. # 4. Data Analysis: With the keypoints data, you can analyze the patient's movements. You can do the following: - **Measure Movements**: Calculate the angles between limbs to quantify the range of motion and track improvements over time. - **Assess Posture and Alignment**: Compare the tracked keypoints against ideal postures for the exercises to evaluate the patient's form. - **Quantify Repetitions**: Detect repetitions of movements to ensure patients complete their prescribed exercise sets. # 5. Feedback System: Based on the analysis, your application can provide immediate feedback to the patient. For example: - **Visual Feedback**: Overlay the captured video with the keypoints and skeletal structure to show patients how closely they match the ideal form. - **Corrective Suggestions**: Offer tips and corrections when the software detects incorrect posture or movements. # 6. Progress Tracking: Store the analyzed keypoints data in a structured format for long-term tracking and progress evaluation. Use this data to generate reports and visual progress charts for both patients and therapists. # 7. Integration with Therapy Plans: You can customize the application to work with specific physical therapy plans by programming in the expected movements and ideal ranges for different exercises. # Challenges and Considerations: - **Accuracy**: Ensure that OpenPose accurately identifies keypoints in your specific set-up. - **Privacy**: Implement strong privacy measures to protect patients' personal health data. - **User Interface**: Design an easy-to-use interface for patients and therapists. - **Clinical Validation**: Work with healthcare professionals to validate the application's effectiveness and accuracy in a clinical setting. # Final Steps: Finally, create a feedback loop, where therapists can review the output from OpenPose (like angles and movement patterns), validate them, and use them to update the treatment plans as necessary. Also, ensure that you have proper consent and adhere to regulations concerning patients' health data if you plan to store or use it outside of the immediate scope of the application. It's worth noting that while OpenPose is a powerful tool, for a commercial application, especially one handling sensitive health data, you should consider the reliability, support, and potential costs of using such an open-source tool in a production environment."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Dimension 22-AP.

Oleh karena itu, penting untuk memahami keuntungan, risiko, dan bagaimana menggunakan AI secara bijak. Salah satu keuntungan utama dari penggunaan AI adalah efisiensi. Dalam banyak kasus, AI dapat melakukan tugas-tugas yang lebih cepat dan lebih akurat daripada manusia. Contohnya termasuk pengolahan data, analisis risiko, dan pengambilan keputusan. Selain itu, AI juga dapat membantu manusia untuk menyelesaikan tugas-tugas yang berbahaya atau ChatGPT: Keuntungan, Risiko, Dan Penggunaan Bijak Dalam Era Kecerdasan Buatan 57 Jurnal Prosiding Mateandrau - VOLUME 2, NO. 1, MEI 2023tidak mungkin dilakukan oleh manusia, seperti eksplorasi ruang angkasa atau penyelamatan di lokasi bencana. Namun, keuntungan AI tidak datang tanpa risiko. Salah satu risiko utama dari penggunaan AI adalah privasi. Data yang dikumpulkan oleh AI dapat mengandung informasi yang sangat pribadi, dan penggunaan data ini yang tidak bijak dapat merugikan individu atau kelompok tertentu. Selain itu, keputusan yang diambil oleh AI juga dapat menjadi diskriminatif jika algoritma yang digunakan tidak benar-benar netral dan adil. Maka, penggunaan AI dengan bijak sangat penting untuk menghindari risiko yang dapat timbul dari penggunaannya. Menggunakan AI secara bijak membutuhkan pemahaman yang kuat tentang bagaimana AI bekerja, serta kesadaran tentang dampak yang mungkin terjadi. Penting juga untuk memiliki regulasi dan peraturan yang memadai untuk memastikan bahwa AI digunakan secara benar dan bertanggung jawab. Dengan memahami keuntungan dan risiko serta menggunakan AI dengan bijak, masyarakat dapat memanfaatkan teknologi ini dengan cara yang bermanfaat dan menghindari potensi risiko yang dapat timbul. Menggunakan AI tanpa bijak ibarat mengemudi mobil tanpa rem, pasti akan berakhir dengan kecelakaan yang merugikan banyak pihak. Oleh karena itu, pemahaman yang kuat tentang bagaimana AI bekerja dan kesadaran tentang dampak yang mungkin terjadi, sama pentingnya seperti mengenali medan yang dilalui saat mengemudi mobil. Regulasi dan peraturan yang memadai untuk penggunaan AI sangat diperlukan seperti helm yang melindungi kepala dari benturan keras pada saat berkendara motor. Hal ini tidak hanya menjamin keselamatan pengguna, tetapi juga memastikan penggunaan AI secara benar dan bertanggung jawab. Masyarakat harus memperlakukan AI seperti memperlakukan alat yang tajam, jika digunakan dengan bijak, akan membawa banyak manfaat. Namun, jika digunakan dengan sembarangan, dapat membahayakan pengguna dan orang lain disekitarnya. Oleh karena itu, penggunaan AI dengan bijak sangat penting untuk menghindari risiko yang dapat timbul dari penggunaannya. Memanfaatkan AI dengan bijak seperti mempergunakan kapal layar untuk menyeberangi lautan yang luas. Dalam perjalanannya, kapal layar itu bisa menjadi angin penolong yang mempercepat perjalanannya, atau bisa juga menjadi badai yang membawa kerugian besar jika tidak dikelola dengan bijak.","completion":"Kecerdasan Buatan (AI), termasuk ChatGPT, semakin penting di berbagai sektor, memberikan efisiensi dan membantu pengambilan keputusan.

(Satria, 2023).Teknologi ChatGPT juga menggunakanalgoritma deep learningyang dapat memberi informasi berupa data untuk penyelesaian permasalahan sesuai dengan kebutuhan manusia secara cepat. Penyelesaian permasalahan yang dihasilkan melalui algoritma deeplearningtersebut juga lebih maksimal karena telah dibuat peka terhadap penyesuaian kueri yaitu bahasa computer yang berupa sekumpulan instruksi yang bisa digunakan untuk bekerja dengan data. Kueri digunakan untuk menjalankan suatu instruksi.Suatu pertanyaan yang diajukan secara berbeda dengan makna yang sama akan mendapat respon yang sama. (Ni Made Padmawati, 2023) Sifat responsif dari aplikasi ini juga dilengkapi dengan penerapan NLP yang membuat ChatGPT ini mampu memahami, menafsirkan, serta memanipulasi bahasa atau perintah manusia. (AIContenfy, 2023)Berdasarkan efisiensi dan fungsi yang ditawarkan, ChatGPT telah menjadi salah satu platform yang sangat sering digunakan oleh berbagai kalangan. ChatGPT telah memecahkan rekor sebagai platform layanan online dengan waktu tercepat untuk mencapai 1 juta pengguna, yaitu hanya 5 hari, sejak mulai diperkenalkan. (Dimas, 2023) Sebagai pembanding, platform-platform besar lainnya, seperti Tiktok dan Instagram umumnya membutuhkan 2 sampai 5 bulan untuk mencapai 1 juta pengguna. (Fabio, 2023) Lebih lanjut, menurut data yang dilansir dari Similarweb, ChatGPT saat ini telah dikunjungi secara rutin oleh 1.8 miliar pengguna internet setiap bulannya. (Fabio, 2023) Data ini menjadi bukti konkrit bahwa ChatGPT telah diketahui umum dan digunakan secara rutin oleh masyarakat dunia, termasuk masyarakat Indonesia.Dalam dunia pendidikan, praktik ChatGPT masih mengundang pro dan kontra. Meskipun harus diakui bahwa ChatGPT memiliki kekuatan yang besar untuk memajukan dunia akademisi, dalam halmeningkatkan motivasi belajar, keterlibatan aktif, dan kemampuan memecahkan sebuah masalah. (Hary, 2023). Selain ituChatGPT dapat menjadi layanan online yang sangat membantu dalam proses pembelajaran pelajar baik di taraf sekolah. Namundi sisi lain, praktik penggunaan ChatGPT juga dapat membuat pelajar menjadi terlena dan mengurangikemampuan kritis penggunanya, karena segala kemudahan yang disediakanoleh ChatGPT. (Aiman, 2023) Penggunaan ChatGPT dikhawatirkan pula akan berdampak pada berkurangnya penggunaan media pembelajaran yang lebih akurat, seperti buku, jurnal, dan sumber-sumber dari guru. Hal ini tidak sesuai dengan aspek kemandirian siswayang menjadi kompetensi penting dalam pengerjaan tugas dalamproses pendidikan. Berdasarkan fakta ini, praktik etika penggunaan ChatGPT bagi para siswatentu menjadi halyang sangat penting. Jawaban yang diberikan oleh ChatGPT tidak dapat sepenuhnya dapat dipertanggungjawabkan. Hal ini dibuktikan oleh keterbatasan ChatGPT yang hanya dapat menghimpun informasi yang telah ada di internet sejak tahun 2018. ChatGPT juga dapat dinilai kurang cerdasdalam memahami pertanyaan ataupunpembahasan yang rumit, sehingga hal ini dapat menimbulkan kebingungan bagi penggunanya ketika menjadikan ChatGPT sebagai sumber informasi dalampembelajaran. (Anindita, 2023) Selain itu, ChatGPT juga tidak dapat menyertakan sumber yang jelas dalam menjawab pertanyaan yang diberikan oleh penggunanya.Hal ini akan berdampak kepada nilai ilmiah dari jawaban yang diberikan.Selain dari hal hal tersebut, isu plagiarisme juga menjadi perbincangan yang hangat dalam praktek penggunaan ChatGPT dalamdunia pendidikan. Plagiarisme adalah aksi pelanggaran etika atau integritas moral dengan menjiplak karya orang lain yang berdampak pada pelanggaran hak cipta, dan memiliki keterkaitandalam hukum administrasi dan hukum pidana. (Guswan, 2017).Praktik ini umumnya didukungoleh motif pelajar yang ingin menyelesaikan tugas secara cepat. Kekhawatiran tersebut muncul didasari oleh kemampuan ChatGPT yang dapat menghasilkan teks yang begitu lancar dan ditulis dengan baik. (Muhammad, 2023). Meskipun apabila diteliti lebih mendalam jawaban dan informasi yang diberikan belum tentu benar dan sesuai dengan harapan guru yang memberi tugas kepada siswa.Praktek negatif dengan ChaGPT tersebut sejatinya 94Jurnal Kajian Budaya dan Humaniora –ISSN 2656-7156Sosialisasi Mengenai AspekHukum Dari Penggunaan Chatgpt dalam Dunia Pendidikan diSMKAl-Wafa Kabupaten Bandung(Enni Soerjati Priowirjanto, Annisa Rami Rivani Israwan, Marcella Putri Josca, Revaganesya Abdallah,Nicholas Kevin, Chandra Ardhiansyah, Raisya Hasna Desiani, Carolina Renee Munaf)telah menimbulkan degradasi pada moral, norma, dan etika akademik. Merespons kondisitersebut, beberapa perguruan tinggi berskala internasional dan nasional telah menerapkan kebijakan internal terkait penggunaan ChatGPT. Contohnya, perguruan tinggi NSW, Queensland and Tasmania telah memblokir akses terhadap ChatGPT di jaringan internet lingkungan perguruan tinggi sebagai upaya pencegahan penggunaan ChatGPT dalam proses ujian. (Muhammad, 2023) Sementara itu, perguruan tinggi nasional seperti Universitas Padjadjaran juga memberlakukan aturan sanksi pengurangan nilai bagi mahasiswa yang melakukan plagiarisme dalam pengerjaan tugas ataupun ujian menggunakan ChatGPT.

Perkembangan teknologi ini memberikan sebuah pengaruh yang besar untuk perkembangan pendidikan. Salah satunya untuk pendidikan pada perguruan tinggi. Generasi saat ini perlu memanfaatkan terjadinya perkembangan teknologi digital yang memiliki dampak untuk mempermudah kehidupan sehari-hari (Ikhsan, 2023). Informasi yang berkembang menuntut segala sesuatu di perguruan tinggi untuk mengembangkan sebuah cara agar tidak tertinggal dengan teknologi,salah satunya di bidang Akuntansi.Bidang Akuntansi pun juga harus beradaptasidalam mengolah teknologi yang berkembang guna meningkatkan kompetensi dan juga keahlian.Teknologi yang dimaksud diantaranya yaitu teknologi kecerdasan buatan atau Artificial Intelligence(AI).Artificial Intelligence (AI)ini merupakansebuahsistem yang menunjukkan tingkah laku cerdas dalam mencapai suatu tujuan tertentu, yang mana penerapannya berupa program komputer yang berdiri sendiri atau tertanam dalam suatu perangkat keras yang memiliki kegunaan tertentu (Gema, 2022). Artificial Intelligence(AI) ini salah satu revolusi di industri 4.0. Revolusi Industri 4.0 menjadisebuah revolusi dalam teknologi yang mengubah semua cara aktivitas yang dilakukan oleh manusia baik dalam skala, ruang lingkup, kompleksitas, ataupun transformasi (Ghufron, 2018). Perkembangan artificial intelligencemenjadikan sebuah peluang kecerdasan buatan diantaranya yakni penolong dalam sebuah penelitian, pengembangan materi pembelajaran yang ada, bahkan bisa menjadi sebuah asisten virtual(Pongtambing et al., 2023). Hal ini dapatdisimpulkan bahwa hal tersebut sangat membantu dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Salah satuArtificial Intelligence(AI)suatu perkembangan revolusi industri 4.0 yakni penggunaan Chat GPT.Chat GPT atau bisa disebut dengan Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. Pertama kali dikembangkan oleh sebuah perusahaan yang disebut dengan OpenAI di Amerika Serikat. OpenAIini perusahaan teknologi yang berfokus pada sebuah penciptaan dan perkembangan teknologi berbasis Artificial Intelligence(AI) (Wibowo et al., 2023). Menurut Ramadhan et al., (2023)menjelaskan Kemampuan kecerdasan Artificial Intelligence (AI) ada pada chat GPT yang memungkinkan untuk mempelajari banyak hal baik secara sederhana atau kompleksyangdapat menghasilkan jawaban yang relevan. Namun demikian,jawaban yang diberikan tidak selalu akurat, karena sumber yang dihasilkantetap dari data internet. Sehingga dapat berpengaruh pada tanggapan yang salah. (Ramadhan et al., 202 3).Proses chat GPT sendiri dilakukan layaknya sebuah percakapan antara dua orang yang satu dengan yang lain untuk menggenerasi sebuah jawaban yang disesuaikan dengan pertanyaan yang diajukan (Saputra & Hidayati, 2023). Sehingga seringkali chat GPT digunakan untuk menjawab sebuah kasus yang diberikan oleh pendidik dalam sebuah tugas. Chat GPT sendiri sangat digemari oleh berbagai kalangan.Chat GPT memecahkan sebuah rekor menjadi platform yang digunakan dengan waktu tercepat mencapai 1 juta pengguna dari 5 hari semenjak diluncurkan (Priowirjanto et al., 2023).Banyak pelajar yang menggunakan aplikasi ini sebagai alternatif dalam menyelesaikan sebuah tugas yang diberikan oleh pendidik. Bahkan banyak sekali pelajar yangjuga menggunakan chat GPT ini untuk menyelesaikan sebuah skripsi untuk tugas akhir mereka. Hal ini menyebabkan permasalahan di ranah pendidikan, dikarenakan tenaga pendidik yang merasakan bahwa chat GPT ini adalah sebuah AI yang mengancam dan merusak kompetensi akademik pelajar baik di sekolah ataupun perguruan tinggi. Karena jawaban yang diberikan oleh chat GPT ini dapat terlihat sebagai jawaban yang diberikan oleh manusia(Wahid et al., 2023). Hal ini juga termasuk dalam penyelesaian tugas yang dilakukan oleh mahasiswa Akuntansi, baik itu terkait dengan resume atau rangkuman, ujian atau pembuatan artikel. Potensi yang menjanjikan dengan penggunaan AI ini, jugadapat memberikan sebuah ancaman sekaliguspeluang yang perlu dipahami baik (Masrichah, 2023). Mahasiswa Akuntansi perlu juga memahami hal itu.

Hal ini kebanyakan yang dilakukan penelitian terkait dengan DiskurtifChat GPTpada skillatau kompetensipelajar. Semakin pesatnya perkembangan teknologi. Dalam bidang akuntansi, Perguruan tinggi banyak mengandalkan mahasiswanya untuk meningkatkan pengetahuan dan ketrampilan berupa audit, pajak, ataupun kemajuan teknologi.Penerimaan dan kesiapan mahasiswa dalam teknologi memiliki sebuah peranan yang penting untuk kompetensi mahasiswa akuntansi(Amdanata et al., 2023). Adapun kemajuan teknologi tersebut berkaitan dengan adanyakecerdasan buatan atau Artificial Intelligencememberikan sebuahperubahan yang besar. AI ini mempunyai basis pengetahuan yang meluas dalam keterbatasan domain, baik terdapat kecerdasan dalam berpikir atau penalaran yang terstrukturisasi dengan baik dalam pengambilan keputusan di sebuah masalah (Soeprajitno, 2019). ISSN 2776-2092 (Online)senapan.upnjatim.ac.idVol. 3 No. 1. Oktober 2023, hal. 83-9187Hidayanti1, Azmiyanti2Dampak Penggunaan Chat GPT...Perkembangan AI tersebut memiliki sebuah inovasi yang memunculkan kecerdasan buatan yang memahami dan memberikan sebuah hasil bahasa manusia yang mirip dengan manusia, yaitu chat GPT. Keuntungan adanya chat GPT ini memberikan proses yang cepat dalam penulisan, memberikan solusi yang tepat dan akurat dalam suatu permasalahan, bahkan dapat digunakan untuk chatbot,analisis data dan kecerdasan buatan (Misnawati, 2023).Chat GPT mampu memberikan manfaatjuga padabidang akuntansi, seperti pengelolaanjurnal, laporan keuangan Non-Konsolidasi, Pembukuan, dan lain sebagainya.Berdasarkan hal tersebut diketahui dari beberapa jurnal terkait, bahwa peluang bagi mahasiswa Akuntansi dapat menjadikan chat GPT untuk keperluandalam pembelajaran ataupun evaluasi mahasiswa untuk pendidikan mereka.Chat GPT memberi lompatan besar terhadap keakuratan jawaban, cakupan topik, ataupun percakapan antarmuka yang dapat mempermudah semua kalangan untuk menggunakan platform ini. Sehingga dalam menggunakan platform ini memudahkan penafsiran (Malik et al., 2023).Gambar 2.Hasil dari Overlay Visualization based on yearSumber: Vosviewer(2023)Berdasarkan hasil analisis gambar2, menunjukkan bahwa studentatau pelajar adalah kata kunci yang muncul di sebagian besar artikel terkait dengan kata kunci lainnya yaitu: accounting, skill,dan competence. Pada analisis gambar diatas ini menunjukkan bahwa proyeksi tahun pengambilan pada waktu penelitian. Analisis gambar tersebutmenjelaskan semakin gelap warna yang ditunjukkan, berarti penelitian terkait memiliki proyeksi penelitian lama. Sedangkan semakin cerah, proyeksi rentan waktu penelitian merupakan penelitian baru.Peneliti terdahulu banyak yang meneliti Diskurtif Artificial Intelligencepada skill atau kompetensi pelajar secara umum. Namun untuk penjelasan terkait dengan diskruptif chat GPT pada skillatau kompetensi pelajar bagi mahasiswa akuntansi masih belum banyak ISSN 2776-2092 (Online)senapan.upnjatim.ac.idVol. 3 No. 1.

Keuntungan tersebut yakni menghemat waktu untuk berkonsentrasi dalam bidang pendidikan serta berguna untuk membantu kesulitan dalam belajar (Malik et al., 2023). Tetapi ada beberapatantanganatau ancamanyang sering sekali menjadi permasalahan pada pembelajaran di pendidikan tinggitermasuk akuntansi. Tantangan atau ancaman tersebut yaitu plagiarisme pada chat GPT. Sistem yang ada pada chat GPT dalam menggunakan sistem penulisan tugas sesuai petunjuk, berpotensi untuk menjadikan siswa menyontek dengan mengirimkan tugas yang tidak dibuat oleh mereka sendiri (Dehouche, 2021).Perbuatanyang menjadikan mahasiswa tidak berintegritas dengan melakukan percontekan pada tugas merekabisa menjadi disorientasi proses pendidikan, dimana hal tersebut dapat merusak tujuan utama pendidikan di perguruan tinggi untuk membuat tantangan dan didikan kreativitas siswa dalam berpikir kritis. Hal ini menjadi sebuah kebingungan bagi pendidik dalam melakukan penilaian dalam pemahaman siswa tentang materi secara memadai dalam menggunakan aplikasi chat GPT dalam memberikan jawaban mereka. Jawaban tersebut juga kemungkinan tidak akurat dalam mencerminkan pemahaman mereka (Wahid et al., 2023). Bahkan saat ini banyaknya mahasiswa akuntansi yang menggunakan chat GPT dalam melakukan penyelesaian tugas mereka seperti rangkuman, esai, artikel, ataupun skripsi. Hal tersebut menyebabkan mahasiswa akuntansi banyak yang tidak menggunakan pemikiran mereka sendiri dalam mengerjakan tugas yang diberikan. Gambar 3. Hasildari Density VisualizationSumber: Vosviewer(2023)Berdasarkananalisisgambar 3 diatasyakni hasil density visualizationpada Vosviewer, menjelaskan semakin cerah warna yang ada maka semakin banyak diteliti.

Hal tersebut menjelaskan bahwa peneliti terdahulubanyak yangmeneliti skill, studentdan chat GPT. Ancaman ataupun peluang yang telah dijelaskan sebelumnya, adapun impactatau dampak secara signifikan terhadap kompetensi mahasiswa Akuntansi. Baidoo-Anu & Ansah (2023) menjelaskan bahwakurangnya kreativitas yang didapat sehingga membatasi kreativitas dan orisinalitas jawaban yang diberikan, ketergantungan data yang menjadikan data yang diolah tidak relevan dan dihasilkan tidak bekerja dengan baik sehingga data yang diolah tergantung dengan kualitas dan kuantitas data, kurangnya pemahaman kontekstual dalam melakukan pemahaman situasi yang menyebabkan tanggapan tidak relevan dengan studi yang dibahas, terbatasnya dalam memberikan informasi dan tidak dapat melakukan personalisasi instruksi siswa. (Baidoo-Anu & Owu su Ansah, 2 023)Selain itu, adanya penggunaan chat GPT tidak terlalu efektif untuk digunakan sebagai sebuah penelitian yang membutuhkan data kuantitatif baik dalam survei atau cakupan yang lebih kecil seperti pendapat dari mahasiswa universitas tertentu mengenai sesuatu hal, karena chat GPT hanya digunakan untuk mencari data yang masih global dan tersimpan pada database chat GPT. Ada beberapa pendapat pro dan kontra yang menyatakan bahwa chat GPT mempermudah bentuk ringkasan, pencarian, atau penelitian. Pihak yang pro mengatakan bahwa chat GPT dapat digunakan dalam mencari referensi, sedangkan pihak kontra mengatakan bahwa penggunaannya dapat menghilangkan esensi proses penelitian atau sesuatu yang diteliti (Ramadhan et al., 2023).Perkembangan kompetensi mahasiswa akuntansi perlu memperhatikan dalam penggunaan chat GPT.Perguruan tinggi harus mempertimbangkan mengenai potensi serta manfaat dari penggunaan chat GPT atau chatbotdanmengambil sebuah langkah untuk mencari sebuah kepastian bahwa Artificial intelligenceini bisa digunakan secara etis dan bertanggung jawab oleh mahasiswa Akuntansi. Karena penggunaan chatGPT ini melibatkan pengembangan peraturan atau kebijakan serta prosedur bagi mahasiswa untuk mendeteksi dan mencegah ketidakjujuran akademik. Sehingga untuk mengatasi tantangan-tantangan ini, perguruan tinggi bisa memberi sebuah peluang yang diberikan oleh chat GPT bersamaan dengan menjaga integritas penilaian serta kualitas pendidikan.Penggunaan teknologi AI seperti chat GPT akan terus mengalami sebuah perkembangan pesat dan berpotensi menjadi lebih optimal. Perguruan tinggi harusnya dalam menentukan kebijakan menghadapi era kecerdasan buatan beserta dampak terkait dengan akademik ataupun kompetensi mahasiswa. Dengan begitu perguruan tinggi dapat menyepakati terkait penggunaan chat GPT sebagai pelanggaran etika atau diperbolehkan dengan syarat tertentu(Rizky & Nandyatama, 2023).Penggunaan chat GPT tersebut menjadikan sebuah alasan mengapa kompetensi mahasiswa akuntansi perlu diperhatikan. Akuntan saatini memerlukan skill dan kompetensi untuk menjaga relevansi dalam perkembangan dunia. Kompetensi yang sangat penting tersebut harus menciptakan efektivitas dan efisiensi pada profesi akuntan di masa yang akan datang. Penggunaan chat GPT ini harus menjadikan mahasiswa akuntansi awareterhadap perkembangan kecerdasan buatan dengan melihat kesempatan yang ada dengan mengontroldata-data dan bertanggung jawab atas penggunaannya sehingga tidak mengancam kompetensi mahasiswa di masa yang akan datang (Triatmaja, 2019).","completion":"Analisis publikasi jurnal dari 2018 hingga 2023 tentang penggunaan Chat GPT mengungkapkan tema umum dan tren dalam literatur baru-baru ini. Vosviewer mengidentifikasi lima kluster utama dari 480 artikel: dampak AI, kompetensi akuntansi, keterampilan, pengaruh AI pada mahasiswa, dan penggunaan Chat GPT. Riset menunjukkan keuntungan penggunaan Chat GPT dalam akuntansi, termasuk efisiensi dalam pembelajaran dan evaluasi, tetapi juga menyoroti resiko plagiarisme yang dapat merusak integritas akademis dan kreativitas siswa. Meskipun Chat GPT membantu dalam berbagai tugas seperti membuat laporan, rangkuman, dan artikel akuntansi, terdapat kekhawatiran bahwa mahasiswa mungkin mengandalkannya terlalu banyak dan kehilangan kemampuan berpikir kritis. Para pihak berargumen bahwa Chat GPT sangat berguna untuk mencari informasi luas tetapi dapat mengurangi kedalaman penelitian ilmiah. Akibatnya, perguruan tinggi tengah mempertimbangkan kebijakan untuk memanfaatkan baik potensi maupun manfaat Chat GPT, sementara juga mencegah kecurangan akademik. Ditekankan pentingnya bagi mahasiswa akuntansi untuk menyadari dan bertanggung jawab dalam menggunakan AI seperti Chat GPT, guna mempertahankan relevansi dan efektivitas profesinya di masa depan."},{"prompt":"Teks ketiga adalah bagian Kesimpulan.

Below, I provide you with the basic structure, style, and functionality to build a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. Please note that because creating a smart AI for Tic Tac Toe is quite complex, I will create a basic computer opponent that makes random moves. If you'd like a more strategic AI, you will need to implement an algorithm like minimax. First, create an HTML file and add the following code to it: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Tic Tac Toe</title> <style> #game-board { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px); grid-gap: 5px; } .cell { width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #f0f0f0; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-size: 2em; cursor: pointer; } </style> </head> <body> <div id=\\"game-board\\"> <div class=\\"cell\\" data-cell-index=\\"0\\"></div> <div class=\\"cell\\" data-cell-index=\\"1\\"></div> <div class=\\"cell\\" data-cell-index=\\"2\\"></div> <div class=\\"cell\\" data-cell-index=\\"3\\"></div> <div class=\\"cell\\" data-cell-index=\\"4\\"></div> <div class=\\"cell\\" data-cell-index=\\"5\\"></div> <div class=\\"cell\\" data-cell-index=\\"6\\"></div> <div class=\\"cell\\" data-cell-index=\\"7\\"></div> <div class=\\"cell\\" data-cell-index=\\"8\\"></div> </div> <script> // Tic Tac Toe JavaScript Code const board = document.getElementById('game-board'); const cells = document.querySelectorAll('.cell'); const humanPlayer = 'X'; const computerPlayer = 'O'; let isGameOver = false; cells.forEach(cell => { cell.addEventListener('click', handleHumanClick, { once: true }); }); function handleHumanClick(e) { const cell = e.target; const cellIndex = cell.dataset.cellIndex; if (!isGameOver && !cell.textContent) { makeMove(cell, humanPlayer); if (!checkWin(humanPlayer) && !checkTie()) { setTimeout(computerMove, 300); } } } function makeMove(cell, player) { cell.textContent = player; } function computerMove() { let availableCells = Array.from(cells).filter(c => c.textContent === ''); if (availableCells.length === 0) return; const randomCellIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * availableCells.length); const cell = availableCells[randomCellIndex]; makeMove(cell, computerPlayer); checkWin(computerPlayer); checkTie(); } function checkWin(player) { const winCombinations = [ [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], // rows [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], // columns [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6] // diagonals ]; return winCombinations.some(combination => { if (combination.every(index => cells[index].textContent === player)) { isGameOver = true; alert(\`Player {player} wins!\`); return true; } return false; }); } function checkTie() { if (Array.from(cells).every(cell => cell.textContent) && !isGameOver) { isGameOver = true; alert('Tie Game!'); return true; } return false; } <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` The above code will render a grid display of a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board. When you click on a cell, your mark ('X') is placed, and then the game waits 300 milliseconds before the computer makes a random move with 'O'. The game checks for win states or a tie after each move and alerts the results accordingly. The CSS styles define how the board and cells should look, while JavaScript provides the interactivity and game logic. Remember, this code provides the very basics of a Tic-Tac-Toe game. For further improvements, you could: 1. Improve the computer's AI (making it unbeatable using the minimax algorithm). 2. Add a replay button to start a new game after finishing. 3. Create a more sophisticated win detection to highlight the winning cells. 4. Keep track of player scores throughout multiple games."},{"prompt":"hello","completion":"Hello!

The other three single-elemental Chelantos in the gorge - Rooditrum, the single-elemental monster of the Foliage element; Blastagor, the single-elemental monster of the Tech element; and Sandoral, the single-elemental monster of the Coral element - were sleeping in the Bass Fortress at the time.)","completion":"Phantaloon: *shyly approaches Rooditrum* Um, hey there Rooditrum. Are you already awake? Rooditrum: *yawns* Oh, good morning Phantaloon. Yeah, I woke up a little while ago. Couldn't sleep much with all the noise coming from the Tech element area. Phantaloon: Yeah, Blastagor can get pretty rowdy sometimes. But at least Sandoral is sleeping peacefully in the Coral area. Rooditrum: True, true. So, what brings you here so early in the morning, Phantaloon? Phantaloon: Oh, nothing much. Just felt like taking a walk around the gorge. The sunrise looks beautiful from here. Rooditrum: It sure does. Makes me appreciate the Foliage element even more. Phantaloon: *giggles* You always have a soft spot for nature, don't you Rooditrum? Rooditrum: Well, someone has to take care of the plants around here. Can't leave everything to Sandoral's coral reefs. Phantaloon: That's true. Each of us brings something unique to this area. That's what makes the Chelantos so special. Rooditrum: Definitely. And you, Phantaloon, bring a sense of mystery and wonder with your Ghostly element. We're lucky to have you here with us. Phantaloon: *blushes* Aw, thanks Rooditrum. It means a lot coming from you. Rooditrum: Anytime, Phantaloon. Now, how about we enjoy this beautiful morning together? Maybe go for a float along the gorge and soak up the sun? Phantaloon: I would love that, Rooditrum. Let's go!"},{"prompt":"(Back in the Bass Fortress, Sandoral is suddenly woken up by the fifth single-elemental Chelantos - Spijem, representing the element \\"Spinel\\". Spijem was being unusually loud - considering he's usually the quiet one among the single-elementals.)","completion":"Sandoral: *startled* Spijem, what's gotten into you? Why are you making so much noise? Spijem: *excitedly* Sandoral, you won't believe it! I found a hidden cave behind the waterfall in the Coral area. It's filled with mysterious gemstones and crystals! Sandoral: *intrigued* Really? That sounds fascinating. I didn't even know there was a cave there. Can you show me? Spijem: Of course! Follow me, it's just a short swim from here. I promise you, it's unlike anything you've ever seen. Sandoral: *excited* Alright, lead the way Spijem. I can't wait to see what wonders lie within that cave. (Sandoral and Spijem quickly make their way to the hidden cave behind the waterfall in the Coral area. Sandoral is mesmerized by the sight of the sparkling gemstones and crystals, each one more beautiful than the last.) Sandoral: *in awe* Oh my, this is incredible. I never knew such beauty existed right here in our own home. Thank you for showing me this, Spijem. Spijem: *humbly* I'm just glad I could share this discovery with you, Sandoral. I knew you would appreciate it as much as I do. Sandoral: *smiling* You were right, Spijem. I am truly grateful. We must keep this cave a secret and protect it at all costs. Spijem: Agreed, Sandoral. This will be our little sanctuary. A place of wonder and beauty for us to cherish together. (Sandoral and Spijem spend the rest of the day exploring the hidden cave, marveling at the natural treasures it holds. As the sun sets over Dimension 22-AP, the Chelantos of the Coral and Spinel elements bond over their shared love for the beauty of their world.)"},{"prompt":"Naber kanka","completion":"Merhaba!

However, the email address being recorded in the spreadsheet is from the service account used for Google API access, rather than from user input. If your intention is to record the email address input by the user in the beginning of the script, make sure that the \`email\` variable that you capture with \`input\` is being used in the \`write_to_sheet\` function. It appears that part of this is set up correctly, but you have to double-check that the \`email\` variable isn't being overwritten or misused. Now, to ensure that data is displayed properly in the serial monitor and subsequently in the Google Sheets, I’ll provide you with a step-by-step explanation: 1. **Capture User Email**: When the script requests an email via \`input\`, make sure that this value is kept unchanged unless the user is meant to change their email at some point in the script. 2. **Reading from Serial**: You are reading data from the serial port with \`data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8')\`. Ensure that your device connected to the COM port is sending properly formatted data for the regex pattern to match. 3. **Data Format**: By looking at the regex pattern \`r\\"tagIds+iss+:s+(d+.d+.d+.d+)\\"\`, it seems that the script expects data in the specific format of \`\\"tagId is : X.X.X.X\\"\`, where \`X\` is any digit. The script will not write anything to the sheet if the data does not match this pattern. Make sure the data sent from the device to the serial port matches this pattern. 4. **Writing to Google Sheets**: In the provided write function \`write_to_sheet\`, you pass in \`tag_id\` and \`email\` and then attempt to append a row to the worksheet with this information along with a timestamp. 5. **Runtime Loop**: The \`main\` function demonstrates a constant loop that reads from the serial port and writes to the sheet upon a pattern match. 6. **Correct Quotes**: Check that in your code, the quotation marks are consistent (\`'\` or \`\\"\`), as some of them seem to be “typographic” quotes (\`“\`,\`”\`) rather than straight quotes (\`\\"\`) which Python expects. 7. **if __name__ == \\"__main__\\"**: Ensure this line is properly written as \`if __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\`. Incorrect usage will prevent the main function from running. Now, go ahead and run your Python script, and make sure your serial device is sending data in the correct format. Once a line that matches the regex pattern is detected, the script will extract the tag ID and write it to the Google Sheet along with the timestamp and the email address the user provided. If you encounter further issues, you might need to check: - The device connected to the serial port is functioning correctly. - The baud rate on the device matches the baud rate specified in the script (\`115200\`). - The regular expression pattern is correct for the input data you are receiving. - The Google Sheets API credentials and permissions are properly set up."},{"prompt":"import serial import gspread from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials import re import time # User input json_key_file = input(\\"Please enter the path to your JSON key file: \\") sheet_name = input(\\"Please enter the name of your google sheet: \\") com_port = input(\\"Please enter your COM port (e.g., 'COM3' or '/dev/ttyUSB0' on Linux): \\") email = input(\\"Please enter your email: \\") # Google Sheets setup scope = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'] credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(json_key_file, scope) gc = gspread.authorize(credentials) worksheet = gc.open(sheet_name).sheet1 # Serial setup ser = serial.Serial(com_port, 115200, timeout=1) def write_to_sheet(tag_id, email): try: worksheet.append_row([time.strftime(\\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\\"), tag_id, email]) print(\\"Data written to Google Sheet.\\") except Exception as e: print(\\"Failed to write data to Google Sheet: \\", e) def main(): print(\\"Reading serial output…\\") pattern = re.compile(r\\"tagIds+iss+:s+(d+.d+.d+.d+)\\") try: while True: data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8') match = pattern.search(data) if match: tag_id = match.group(1) write_to_sheet(tag_id, email) except KeyboardInterrupt: print(\\"Program stopped by user.\\") finally: ser.close() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() data written in google sheets: 2024-03-09 16:28:58 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:28:59 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:29:00 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:29:01 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:29:02 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:29:37 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:29:38 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:29:39 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:29:40 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:29:42 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:29:43 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> 2024-03-09 16:29:49 115.233.74.37 <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> data to write from serial monitor: Value: 115 233 74 37 tagId is : 115.233.74.37 UID Length: 4 bytes UID Value: 115 233 74 37 tagId is : 115.233.74.37","completion":"The problem seems to be that the tag ID gets correctly extracted and written to the Google Sheet, but the email being written into the sheet is that of the service account you're using to access the Google Sheets API, not the user email you collected with \`input\`. This behavior indicates that the script is working as intended, in terms of extracting and writing data to Google Sheets. However, it seems that you might have made an error in providing the intended email address when instantiating the email variable or have mistakenly provided the service account email during your testing. Here's a step-by-step approach to diagnose and correct this behavior: 1. Verify the user's email input: Ensure that when you run the script and enter your email, it's the correct email you wish to see in the Google Sheet. 2. Verify the script flow: Understand that the script captures the user's email and writes this email, along with the extracted tag ID, into the Google Sheet. It does not automatically write the service account email to the sheet unless that is the email provided at the input prompt. 3. Debug the Email Being Written: You might want to add a debug print statement in the \`write_to_sheet\` function to check which email is being used right before writing to the sheet. Insert the following line above \`worksheet.append_row\`: \`\`\`python print(\\"Email being written to sheet:\\", email) \`\`\` 4. Verify that the regex pattern matches correctly: The regex pattern should correctly match the string format coming in from the serial port. Based on the sample data provided from the serial monitor, the pattern seems to be fine. 5. Throttle Data Recording (Optional): It seems that the script records data rapidly. If you want to prevent multiple quick successive writes to the Google Sheet, consider adding a delay or some logic to record only when a significant change has been detected. If you’ve double-checked your script and followed all these steps, and yet the wrong email still gets written to the Google Sheet, I recommend reviewing the entire code once again for any potential spots where the \`email\` variable could've been overridden. Another potential culprit could be copy-pasting issues, where the \`input\` value might incorrectly carry over the service account email from another part of the script or from the system's clipboard. However, as long as the \`input\` is correctly capturing the user's email, and that \`email\` variable is left unchanged up to the point where it’s used in the \`write_to_sheet\` function, the user email should be what's recorded in the Google Sheet. If the issue persists, the mistake might lie elsewhere, possibly in the way the \`input\` is handled or the environment in which the script is being executed."},{"prompt":"(myenv) C:UsersILEG-i5-11DownloadsRFID reader display to spreadsheet>python code.py Please enter the path to your JSON key file: C:UsersILEG-i5-11DownloadsRFID reader display to spreadsheetaccdetails.json Please enter the name of your google sheet: ESP32 Weiner RFID Please enter your COM port (e.g., 'COM3' or '/dev/ttyUSB0' on Linux): COM4 Please enter your email: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Reading serial output… Data written to Google Sheet.

If the Google Sheet is incorrectly writing the service account email instead of the user-entered email, it's possible that there's an issue with how the data is being captured and written to the sheet. From what you've described, it's not entirely clear what's going wrong. However, if the service account email is being written rather than the user email, we need to ensure that the \`email\` variable containing \`<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>\` is the one being passed to the \`write_to_sheet\` function and not being accidentally replaced by the service account email somewhere in the workflow. Here's the code with additional print statements to confirm what's being passed and written to the Google Sheet: \`\`\`python import serial import gspread from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials import re import time # User input json_key_file = input(\\"Please enter the path to your JSON key file: \\") sheet_name = input(\\"Please enter the name of your google sheet: \\") com_port = input(\\"Please enter your COM port (e.g., 'COM3' or '/dev/ttyUSB0' on Linux): \\") email = input(\\"Please enter your email: \\") # Confirm user email print(\\"Email to be written to sheet:\\", email) # Google Sheets setup scope = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'] credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(json_key_file, scope) gc = gspread.authorize(credentials) worksheet = gc.open(sheet_name).sheet1 # Serial setup ser = serial.Serial(com_port, 115200, timeout=1) def write_to_sheet(tag_id, email): print(\\"Attempting to write to Google Sheet with email:\\", email) # Print for debugging try: worksheet.append_row([time.strftime(\\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\\"), tag_id, email]) print(\\"Data written to Google Sheet.\\") except Exception as e: print(\\"Failed to write data to Google Sheet: \\", e) def main(): print(\\"Reading serial output…\\") pattern = re.compile(r\\"tagIds+iss+:s+(d+.d+.d+.d+)\\") try: while True: data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip() match = pattern.search(data) if match: tag_id = match.group(1) write_to_sheet(tag_id, email) # Pass the user-entered email except KeyboardInterrupt: print(\\"Program stopped by user.\\") finally: ser.close() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() \`\`\` **Key Updates:** 1. Added a \`print\` to confirm the \`email\` variable immediately after it has been entered by the user. 2. Added a \`print\` in the \`write_to_sheet\` function to see exactly what email is being used when attempting to write to the Google Sheet. 3. The \`pattern\` in \`re.compile\` does not need to escape the dots (\`.\`) unless you're explicitly matching dots. However, we're assuming that's indeed the intention, based on the structure of your expected input \\"tagId is : 115.233.74.37\\". 4. \`strip()\` has been added to \`data\` to ensure no leading/trailing whitespace interferes with pattern matching. Run this updated script, and closely watch the terminal to confirm that \`<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>\` is indeed the email being written to the Google Sheet. If the terminal's debug output still indicates the service account's email is being used, the error likely lies elsewhere, and not in the script itself. Please confirm your terminal output matches what you expect and that the Google Sheet reflects this correctly after running this updated code.

Based on what you have said, you do not want the user's email (which you take as an input in the beginning) to be written to the Google Sheet. Instead, you want only the tag ID and timestamp to be written. If this is the case, then you should remove the email from the \`write_to_sheet\` function arguments and from the \`append_row\` call. To correct the current function to only append the timestamp and tag ID from the serial data to the Google Sheet, you would adjust the code like this: \`\`\`python import serial import gspread from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials import re import time # User input for JSON key file, sheet name, and COM port json_key_file = input(\\"Please enter the path to your JSON key file: \\") sheet_name = input(\\"Please enter the name of your google sheet: \\") com_port = input(\\"Please enter your COM port (e.g., 'COM3' or '/dev/ttyUSB0' on Linux): \\") # Google Sheets setup scope = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive'] credentials = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(json_key_file, scope) gc = gspread.authorize(credentials) worksheet = gc.open(sheet_name).sheet1 # Serial setup ser = serial.Serial(com_port, 115200, timeout=1) def write_to_sheet(tag_id): try: # Append only the timestamp and tag ID, without the email worksheet.append_row([time.strftime(\\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\\"), tag_id]) print(\\"Data written to Google Sheet.\\") except Exception as e: print(\\"Failed to write data to Google Sheet: \\", e) def main(): print(\\"Reading serial output…\\") pattern = re.compile(r\\"tagIds+iss+:s+(d+.d+.d+.d+)\\") # Correct the pattern to be more specific, with d+ to match digits try: while True: data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip() # Read and strip data to remove any whitespace match = pattern.search(data) if match: tag_id = match.group(1) write_to_sheet(tag_id) # Call the function without the email except KeyboardInterrupt: print(\\"Program stopped by user.\\") finally: ser.close() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() \`\`\` This updated script will no longer request the user's email nor write it to the Google Sheet.

The \`serial\` data read from the COM port is not matching the regex pattern. 2. There might be an error with how the Google Sheets API credentials are set up or used. 3. The Google Sheet specified could be incorrect or the service account may not have the right permissions. 4. Communication issues with the COM port or the device connected may be occurring. Here's a checklist to diagnose the problem: **Check Serial Data:** - Verify if your serial device is connected properly to the \`COM4\` port and transmitting data. - Ensure the data from the serial port is exactly in the format you expect and that it includes the line \`tagId is : X.X.X.X\`. - If you have control over the serial output format, ensure that there are no additional characters or formatting that would prevent the regex from matching. **Test Regex:** - Modify the script temporarily to print out the data read from the serial to check if it's being received as expected: \`\`\`python def main(): print(\\"Reading serial output…\\") pattern = re.compile(r\\"tagIds+iss+:s+(d+.d+.d+.d+)\\") try: while True: data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip() # Read and strip data print(\\"Data received:\\", data) # Print the data for testing match = pattern.search(data) if match: tag_id = match.group(1) write_to_sheet(tag_id) # Call the function to write to sheet else: print(\\"No match found.\\") # Indicate when data does not match except KeyboardInterrupt: print(\\"Program stopped by user.\\") finally: ser.close() \`\`\` **Test Google Sheets API:** - Make sure the service account has Editor access to the desired Google Sheet. You can share the sheet with the service account's email as you would with any other user. - Double-check if the Google Sheet name is correct and has been shared with your service account email. **Run a Manual Test:** - Temporarily add a call to \`write_to_sheet\` function with hardcoded data to see if writing to Google Sheets is working at all: \`\`\`python def main(): print(\\"Manually writing to sheet…\\") write_to_sheet('123.456.78.90') # Hardcoded test data # Comment out or remove the rest of the serial reading logic during this test \`\`\` This will help you determine if the issue is with reading from the serial port or with writing to Google Sheets. Go through these steps and see which part of the system has the issue. Once identified, you can take corrective action, whether it's fixing the regular expression pattern, ensuring proper serial communication, or resolving an issue with the Google Sheets API setup."},{"prompt":"(myenv) C:UsersILEG-i5-11DownloadsRFID reader display to spreadsheet>python code.py Please enter the path to your JSON key file: C:UsersILEG-i5-11DownloadsRFID reader display to spreadsheetaccdetails.json Please enter the name of your google sheet: ESP32 Weiner RFID Please enter your COM port (e.g., 'COM3' or '/dev/ttyUSB0' on Linux): COM4 Reading serial output… COM4 serial port hardcoded data is displaying but its not reading data from serial monitor arduino ide but arduino ide port is busy","completion":"The fact that the hardcoded data is being written to Google Sheets suggests that your Google Sheets API setup is correct. The issue now appears to be related to reading data from the COM port. The message about the Arduino IDE port being busy indicates that the IDE might have the serial port open. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and hopefully resolve the serial communication issue you’re facing: 1. **Close the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor**: Before running your Python script, ensure that the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor is closed. You cannot have the Python script and the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor accessing the COM port simultaneously—if the Arduino IDE has the COM port open, it's going to block the Python script from accessing it. 2. **Verify the COM port**: Double-check that your device is indeed on \`COM4\`. You can check this by looking at the Device Manager on Windows or by choosing the correct port in the Arduino IDE. 3. **Run Python Script After Uploading Sketch**: Upload the sketch to your Arduino from the Arduino IDE first, then ensure to close the Serial Monitor. After that, run your Python script to start reading from the serial port. 4. **Verify Serial Baud Rate**: Make certain that the baud rate specified in your Python script (\`115200\`) matches exactly the baud rate specified in your Arduino sketch. Here is an augmented \`main\` function that includes more detailed print statements to understand what is happening during runtime: \`\`\`python def main(): print(\\"Reading serial output…\\") pattern = re.compile(r\\"tagIds+iss+:s+(d+.d+.d+.d+)\\") try: while True: data_bytes = ser.readline() # Read raw bytes from serial print(f\\"Raw data bytes: {data_bytes}\\") # Print raw bytes for debugging data = data_bytes.decode('utf-8').strip() print(f\\"Decoded data: {data}\\") # Print the decoded data for debugging match = pattern.search(data) if match: tag_id = match.group(1) write_to_sheet(tag_id) print(f\\"Match found: {tag_id}\\") # Print the matched tag ID else: print(\\"No match found in the data.\\") # Data did not match pattern except serial.SerialException: print(\\"Could not open COM port; it may be in use by another application.\\") except KeyboardInterrupt: print(\\"Program stopped by user.\\") finally: ser.close() \`\`\` By running this updated \`main\` function, you should see feedback in your terminal about the exact raw bytes being read from the serial, the decoded data, as well as confirmation about whether or not a match has been found in the data received. Please follow the above steps and run your script again. If you still do not see any data read from the serial port while the Arduino is connected, it's possible that there could be an issue with the cable or the serial communication settings in your Arduino sketch."},{"prompt":"Spor gazeteciliği ve spor gazeteciliğinde teknoloji kullanımı kapsamında yapay zeka konulu bir tez çalışması yürütüyorum.

Falls and accidents pose serious risks to the solitary elderly as they may not be discovered very soon, necessitating early detection and intervention. - Healthcare Challenges: About 70% of the elderly in Hong Kong are suffering from chronic diseases, most commonly diabetes and hypertension. Timely health condition monitoring and treatment are needed, especially for the solitary elderly. EXISTING SOLUTIONS - Vision-based detection systems, e.g. video cameras, depth cameras, and thermal cameras: Have privacy issues and low detection accuracy in low light, clothing cover environments. - Non-vision-based sensors, e.g. acoustic-based systems, vibration-based systems, infrared-based systems and radar-based systems: Limited by the effect caused by environmental noise. - Wearable devices, e.g., smartwatches and IMU devices: Inconvenient and unacceptable because the elderly may forget to wear the device. KEY FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS - A mmWave-based monitoring system that can detect and recognize different motions of the elderly, e.g. standing, walking, sitting on a chair, sleeping on a bed, opening a door, opening a cupboard, picking up the pole stand, drinking water from a bottle, fall, etc and different vital signs, e.g. respiration and heart rate, by leveraging mmWave sensing and machine learning technology. -In the proposed system, the mmWave FMCW radar transmits the frequency-modulated continuous wave through transmitting antennas in order to impinge on the target, which here is a human. The scattering EM wave is received by receiving antennas and then is transformed into point clouds and doppler velocity. The point clouds and doppler velocity are selected and grouped as an input dataset of the intelligent system using the LSTM network for fall detection. Before feeding the input data, including point clouds and doppler velocity, into the LSTM network, data preprocessing, including data filtering, data averaging, and sliding window processing, was performed. In the data preprocessing, the point clouds at zero doppler velocity, often called spurious data, are filtered out. The filtered point clouds scattered from many targets and received by many receiving antennas are averaged to attain point clouds in a direction in one dimension. The filtered and averaged point clouds in the zaxis direction, and doppler velocity, are fed into the LSTM network, which is employed to intelligently detect the fall of an elderly person. The data preprocessing and detection were done using a processor. The processor of the radar will send a notification to the computer server through communication networks such as 4G, 5G or Internet networks if a fall is detected. The server receives the notification and then does a few processing steps such as counting the number of detected falls, storing data in data lockers, and matching the elderly individual that is monitored by the radar to one or more elderly caregivers. The server will send a push notification to the caregiver’s mobile application in order to warn a caregiver about all. A notification will be resent only when the caregiver takes care of the fall and pushes the button ‘‘took care’’ on the mobile application and then a new fall is detected. - Combined with a wireless communication-based system and speaker that directly contacts and communicates with the medical personnel and the elderly’s family when detecting accident or emergency situations. - Using IWRL6432 as mmwave sensor:The IWRL6432 is a mmWave radar sensor developed by Texas Instruments that focuses on high-performance while consuming low power. This radar sensor opens up new possibilities for industrial applications, as it can be used in low-power and battery-powered devices. - A program (software application) for the hospital and elderly’s family to monitor the elderly’s health situation consistently in real time. ” A good Benefits part should be: -persuasive and parallel headings highlighting the specific benefits -explores the impact/benefits from different angles -avoid passive verbs, static verbs that lack movement (e.g. have, do, could, should, would) and vague verbs (e.g. get, go, put) -use positive action verbs -more specific and concise My Introduction, Goal and Objectives and Technical Description part : \\" Introduction The ageing demographic in Hong Kong poses unique challenges as the number of individuals over 65 has surpassed 1.45 million in 2021 [1]. This shift raises safety concerns, particularly the risk of falls, which, as reported by the Department of Health’s Unintentional Injury Survey 2018, represent a significant 39.4% of unintentional injuries among the elderly [2]. Often living alone, these individuals are vulnerable to accidents that can remain unnoticed for extended periods, emphasizing the need for prompt detection. Furthermore, roughly 70% of this elderly cohort battles chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension [3], necessitating constant health monitoring. Given these facts, the consequences are severe: increased duration of hospital stays, a decline in quality of life, and greater economic pressure on families and the healthcare system. Therefore, timely intervention is critical in elderly care to maintain our commitment to both compassion and life preservation. Waveguard detects motions and vital signs such as respiration and heart rate without compromising privacy or accuracy. Coupled with a communication system to alert medical personnel or family members in emergencies, Waveguard seeks to reduce the time it takes for solitary elderly individuals to receive medical attention after an incident, therefore mitigating the severity of injuries from falls and expediting the response to critical health events. Goal and Objectives Goal To improve the quality of life and physical health of elderly individuals living alone by providing assistance in dealing with daily risks through the support of “Waveguard,” an advanced detection system designed for safety and protection. Objectives Users will be able to • monitor the motions and different vital signs of them/ their elderly family who live alone remotely through the real-time millimeter wave (mmWave) based system and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms • gain timely medical support by notifying the medical personnel/their family through the wireless communication speaker system Technical Description Millimeter Wave Sensing Technology Waveguard utilizes state-of-the-art millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing to monitor the well-being of the elderly, particularly in scenarios where they are living alone. The mmWave Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar functions by emitting a high-frequency wave that is capable of detecting minute movements [4]. Upon hitting a target, such as a person, the wave is scattered back to the system’s receiving antennas, capturing critical data which is then transformed into point clouds and Doppler velocity information. This wave efficiently works through clothing and does not require direct line-of-sight, making it invariant to light conditions and visual obstructions typical in a home setting without compromising privacy, as it does not produce visual images of the subjects it monitors. AI-Driven Fall Detection Central to the ‘Waveguard’ system is its AI and machine learning core, which uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [5]. These are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems and are used to interpret the captured mmWave data. This sophisticated AI framework has been trained to reliably differentiate between regular activities such as walking, sitting, or lying down and critical events like falls. Real-time interpretation of these activities is reinforced through continuous monitoring of vital signs, including respiration and heart rate, offering a comprehensive health assessment of elderly individuals. Real-time Communication and Notification System Once the onboard processor within the mmWave device detects a fall, it transmits a signal to a dedicated server via existing communication networks like 4G, 5G, or Wi-Fi. The Waveguard server performs several processes, such as logging the incident, identifying the affected individual, and coordinating notification dissemination. Caregivers or family members then receive an alert through a specially designed mobile application. Furthermore, in critical conditions where emergency services are needed, Waveguard includes a wireless communication-linked speaker system, facilitating direct contact with medical personnel or relatives. This ensures not only timely medical intervention but also constant reassurance for the elderly and their families that help is always at hand. Mobile Application The Waveguard system is complemented by an intuitive mobile application that serves as the interface between the monitoring technology and the caregiver or family member. Users receive push notifications about falls or vital sign anomalies through this app and can acknowledge incidents by indicating that they have ‘taken care’ of the situation. The app features a user-friendly dashboard that enables family members or caregivers to monitor vitals and motion in real time, maintain logs of incidents, and receive alerts. Energy Considerations To ensure that Waveguard remains an effective tool for continuous monitoring, it will be meticulously engineered to maximize energy efficiency. The IWRL6432 mmWave sensor embodies the essence of energy efficiency with its sophisticated low-power 45nm RFCMOS process engineered to deliver high performance while minimizing power consumption [6], thereby ensuring prolonged operational periods without compromising system responsiveness. Furthermore, potential future developments may introduce energy-harvesting capabilities, such as capturing energy from ambient light or heat differentials, to extend battery life. These measures will ensure that Waveguard can provide 24/7 monitoring without the need for frequent maintenance or disruptions—key to the system’s reliable use in real-world scenarios. \\" Write the Benefits part with 3 subtitles (Saving lives, Improved health quality, Cost-Effective and Efficient Care) for about 200 words.

My project is named “Waveguard”, and my project outline is : “ OBJECTIVES Users will be able to - monitor the motions and different vital signs of them/ their elderly family who live alone remotely through the real-time millimeter wave (mmWave) based system and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms - gain timely medical support by notifying the medical personnel/their family through the wireless communication speaker system PROBLEMS/NEEDS/OPPORTUNITIES - Aging Population: Demographics shift towards more elderly individuals, over 1 million of the population are aged 65 or above in Hong Kong. - Safety Concerns: The Unintentional Injury Survey 2018 conducted by the Department of Health (DH) showed that fall was the most common type of unintentional injury, accounting for 39.4% of all injury episodes that occurred over a 12-month period. Falls and accidents pose serious risks to the solitary elderly as they may not be discovered very soon, necessitating early detection and intervention. - Healthcare Challenges: About 70% of the elderly in Hong Kong are suffering from chronic diseases, most commonly diabetes and hypertension. Timely health condition monitoring and treatment are needed, especially for the solitary elderly. EXISTING SOLUTIONS - Vision-based detection systems, e.g. video cameras, depth cameras, and thermal cameras: Have privacy issues and low detection accuracy in low light, clothing cover environments. - Non-vision-based sensors, e.g. acoustic-based systems, vibration-based systems, infrared-based systems and radar-based systems: Limited by the effect caused by environmental noise. - Wearable devices, e.g., smartwatches and IMU devices: Inconvenient and unacceptable because the elderly may forget to wear the device. KEY FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS - A mmWave-based monitoring system that can detect and recognize different motions of the elderly, e.g. standing, walking, sitting on a chair, sleeping on a bed, opening a door, opening a cupboard, picking up the pole stand, drinking water from a bottle, fall, etc and different vital signs, e.g. respiration and heart rate, by leveraging mmWave sensing and machine learning technology. -In the proposed system, the mmWave FMCW radar transmits the frequency-modulated continuous wave through transmitting antennas in order to impinge on the target, which here is a human. The scattering EM wave is received by receiving antennas and then is transformed into point clouds and doppler velocity. The point clouds and doppler velocity are selected and grouped as an input dataset of the intelligent system using the LSTM network for fall detection. Before feeding the input data, including point clouds and doppler velocity, into the LSTM network, data preprocessing, including data filtering, data averaging, and sliding window processing, was performed. In the data preprocessing, the point clouds at zero doppler velocity, often called spurious data, are filtered out. The filtered point clouds scattered from many targets and received by many receiving antennas are averaged to attain point clouds in a direction in one dimension. The filtered and averaged point clouds in the zaxis direction, and doppler velocity, are fed into the LSTM network, which is employed to intelligently detect the fall of an elderly person. The data preprocessing and detection were done using a processor. The processor of the radar will send a notification to the computer server through communication networks such as 4G, 5G or Internet networks if a fall is detected. The server receives the notification and then does a few processing steps such as counting the number of detected falls, storing data in data lockers, and matching the elderly individual that is monitored by the radar to one or more elderly caregivers. The server will send a push notification to the caregiver’s mobile application in order to warn a caregiver about all. A notification will be resent only when the caregiver takes care of the fall and pushes the button ‘‘took care’’ on the mobile application and then a new fall is detected. - Combined with a wireless communication-based system and speaker that directly contacts and communicates with the medical personnel and the elderly’s family when detecting accident or emergency situations. - Using IWRL6432 as mmwave sensor:The IWRL6432 is a mmWave radar sensor developed by Texas Instruments that focuses on high-performance while consuming low power. This radar sensor opens up new possibilities for industrial applications, as it can be used in low-power and battery-powered devices. - A program (software application) for the hospital and elderly’s family to monitor the elderly’s health situation consistently in real time. ” A good Benefits part should be: -persuasive and parallel headings highlighting the specific benefits -explores the impact/benefits from different angles -avoid passive verbs, static verbs that lack movement (e.g. have, do, could, should, would) and vague verbs (e.g. get, go, put) -use positive action verbs -more specific and concise My Introduction, Goal and Objectives and Technical Description part : \\" Introduction The ageing demographic in Hong Kong poses unique challenges as the number of individuals over 65 has surpassed 1.45 million in 2021 [1]. This shift raises safety concerns, particularly the risk of falls, which, as reported by the Department of Health’s Unintentional Injury Survey 2018, represent a significant 39.4% of unintentional injuries among the elderly [2]. Often living alone, these individuals are vulnerable to accidents that can remain unnoticed for extended periods, emphasizing the need for prompt detection. Furthermore, roughly 70% of this elderly cohort battles chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension [3], necessitating constant health monitoring. Given these facts, the consequences are severe: increased duration of hospital stays, a decline in quality of life, and greater economic pressure on families and the healthcare system. Therefore, timely intervention is critical in elderly care to maintain our commitment to both compassion and life preservation. Waveguard detects motions and vital signs such as respiration and heart rate without compromising privacy or accuracy. Coupled with a communication system to alert medical personnel or family members in emergencies, Waveguard seeks to reduce the time it takes for solitary elderly individuals to receive medical attention after an incident, therefore mitigating the severity of injuries from falls and expediting the response to critical health events. Goal and Objectives Goal To improve the quality of life and physical health of elderly individuals living alone by providing assistance in dealing with daily risks through the support of “Waveguard,” an advanced detection system designed for safety and protection. Objectives Users will be able to • monitor the motions and different vital signs of them/ their elderly family who live alone remotely through the real-time millimeter wave (mmWave) based system and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms • gain timely medical support by notifying the medical personnel/their family through the wireless communication speaker system Technical Description Millimeter Wave Sensing Technology Waveguard utilizes state-of-the-art millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing to monitor the well-being of the elderly, particularly in scenarios where they are living alone. The mmWave Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar functions by emitting a high-frequency wave that is capable of detecting minute movements [4]. Upon hitting a target, such as a person, the wave is scattered back to the system’s receiving antennas, capturing critical data which is then transformed into point clouds and Doppler velocity information. This wave efficiently works through clothing and does not require direct line-of-sight, making it invariant to light conditions and visual obstructions typical in a home setting without compromising privacy, as it does not produce visual images of the subjects it monitors. AI-Driven Fall Detection Central to the ‘Waveguard’ system is its AI and machine learning core, which uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [5]. These are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems and are used to interpret the captured mmWave data. This sophisticated AI framework has been trained to reliably differentiate between regular activities such as walking, sitting, or lying down and critical events like falls. Real-time interpretation of these activities is reinforced through continuous monitoring of vital signs, including respiration and heart rate, offering a comprehensive health assessment of elderly individuals. Real-time Communication and Notification System Once the onboard processor within the mmWave device detects a fall, it transmits a signal to a dedicated server via existing communication networks like 4G, 5G, or Wi-Fi. The Waveguard server performs several processes, such as logging the incident, identifying the affected individual, and coordinating notification dissemination. Caregivers or family members then receive an alert through a specially designed mobile application. Furthermore, in critical conditions where emergency services are needed, Waveguard includes a wireless communication-linked speaker system, facilitating direct contact with medical personnel or relatives. This ensures not only timely medical intervention but also constant reassurance for the elderly and their families that help is always at hand. Mobile Application The Waveguard system is complemented by an intuitive mobile application that serves as the interface between the monitoring technology and the caregiver or family member. Users receive push notifications about falls or vital sign anomalies through this app and can acknowledge incidents by indicating that they have ‘taken care’ of the situation. The app features a user-friendly dashboard that enables family members or caregivers to monitor vitals and motion in real time, maintain logs of incidents, and receive alerts. Energy Considerations To ensure that Waveguard remains an effective tool for continuous monitoring, it will be meticulously engineered to maximize energy efficiency. The IWRL6432 mmWave sensor embodies the essence of energy efficiency with its sophisticated low-power 45nm RFCMOS process engineered to deliver high performance while minimizing power consumption [6], thereby ensuring prolonged operational periods without compromising system responsiveness. Furthermore, potential future developments may introduce energy-harvesting capabilities, such as capturing energy from ambient light or heat differentials, to extend battery life. These measures will ensure that Waveguard can provide 24/7 monitoring without the need for frequent maintenance or disruptions—key to the system’s reliable use in real-world scenarios. \\" Write the Benefits part with 3 subtitles (Saving lives, Improved health quality, Cost-Effective and Efficient Care) for about 200 words.

This is because the compilation process translates the source code into an executable program, but the compiler does not execute the program's logic with any specific dataset—as would be the case at runtime. Compilation time is influenced by factors such as the complexity and length of the code, the performance of the compiler, the speed of the CPU, and available system resources. However, if you are asking about the runtime execution of the program with an input size of \`10^9\`, the time required can vary greatly based on the algorithm used, the implementation, and the actual run-time complexity. With a modern 8 core, 16 thread CPU, and given that the sorting algorithms provided would indeed benefit from parallelization, early speculation can be made: 1. **Parallel Merge Sort:** Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n). A well-parallelized merge sort can perform faster than its sequential counterpart, but its performance gain will depend on how well the workload is distributed across the cores and the overhead of synchronization. As you scale towards a large number of cores, like 16 threads in your case, the speedup tends to diminish due to increased overhead. 2. **Parallel Quick Sort:** Quick sort also has an average time complexity of O(n log n), with the worst-case being O(n^2). However, a good pivot selection can mostly prevent the worst-case scenario. Parallel quick sort can offer significant performance gains, especially for large datasets, but it's also dependent on the quality of parallelization. 3. **Parallel Counting Sort:** Counting sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n + k), where k is the range of the input values (in this case \`k=1000\` as per your Max_Value). Given the fixed range, counting sort could potentially be the fastest algorithm for sorting such a large dataset, especially when combined with efficient parallelization. Estimating the actual runtime without empirical testing is quite difficult. Factors such as cache size, memory bandwidth, and contention will play a role in the actual performance. For such a large input as \`10^9\` elements, you may also need to consider the memory space required (assuming 4 bytes per \`int\`, \`10^9\` integers would need approximately 4 GB of memory just to hold the array, not including additional overhead for temporary arrays in sorting algorithms like merge sort). To get an estimate of the runtime, you would need to compile the program, run the executable, and use the provided \`measureTime\` function to measure the duration of the sort. Also, note that running such a sizable computation might affect the responsiveness of your system due to heavy CPU and memory usage. It may take from a few seconds to several minutes depending on the efficiency of the code and the hardware capabilities. Always start with a smaller dataset and extrapolate to estimate the time taken for larger datasets. Lastly, remember that running parallel algorithms with full CPU utilization on a laptop might cause thermal throttling, which can slow down the computation. Be sure your system is adequately cooled if you're planning on running heavy workloads over extended periods."},{"prompt":"Перечисли Факторы, оказывающие воздействия на производственный процесс с пояснением","completion":"Производственный процесс — это совокупность действий и операций, в результате которых из сырья и материалов создается конечный продукт.

Перечислим и подробнее раскроем два основных аспекта этого пункта: 1. **Оборудование и автоматизация:** - **Современность оборудования:** Новейшее оборудование, которое может быть более точным и быстродействующим, часто позволяет увеличить производительность и снизить количество брака. Переход на передовые машины и станки также может сократить время производственного цикла и уменьшить физический износ основных фондов. - **Уровень автоматизации:** Автоматизация производства позволяет минимизировать влияние человеческого фактора, повысить согласованность и повторяемость процессов, а также снизить затраты на труд. Однако это требует значительных начальных инвестиций и затрат на обслуживание и обновление программного обеспечения и аппаратной части. - **Обслуживание и ремонт:** Регулярное техническое обслуживание оборудования предотвращает простои и неожиданные поломки, тем самым обеспечивая надежность и стабильность производственного процесса. 2. **Инновации:** - **Внедрение новых технологий:** Применение новых материалов, оборудования и методов может значительно улучшить характеристики продукции, уменьшить вес изделия, снизить его стоимость или сделать его более экологически чистым. - **Исследования и разработки (R&D):** Компании, активно инвестирующие в научно-исследовательскую и опытно-конструкторскую деятельность, часто опережают конкурентов по уровню технологических инноваций. Это позволяет не только оптимизировать текущие процессы, но и разрабатывать совершенно новые товары и услуги. - **Цифровизация процессов:** Применение информационных технологий, таких как Big Data, искусственный интеллект, Интернет вещей (IoT), в производственном процессе позволяет собирать и анализировать данные в реальном времени, что приводит к более оперативному принятию решений и оптимизации процессов. - **Интеллектуальная собственность:** Разработка уникальных технологий и процессов может быть защищена патентами, что предоставляет компании конкурентные преимущества. Технологические факторы имеют решающее влияние на динамику и успех производства в любой отрасли. Компании, которые регулярно внедряют технические усовершенствования и инвестируют в автоматизацию и инновации, обычно добиваются более высоких показателей эффективности и качества, что позволяет им оставаться в лидерах в своей отрасли."},{"prompt":"Дипломная работа разработка проекта по модернизации аппаратных средств вычислителей техники","completion":"Введение В современном мире технологии постоянно развиваются, и для того чтобы быть конкурентоспособными на рынке, компании должны постоянно обновлять свои компьютерные системы.

(Seeking Monthly Tickets and Subscriptions) (Page 1/3) Year 1161 of the Sacred Radiance calendar, the month of harvest. The Great Expedition had ended some time ago, and aside from the fallen Deep Blue Sage, the rest of the legendary wizards had returned to the wizarding world one after another. The Central Realm. As the most central subspace of the Nora plane, Soren had inspected several locations and chose this place to establish the headquarters. Firstly, the Central Realm could be directly accessed from any of the territories of the faithless, making transportation convenient. Secondly, from the Central Realm, it was easier to observe the situations of multiple planes, making it convenient for the wizarding world to prepare in advance against invasions from external enemies. It was said that here, with the legendary magical device \\"The Eye of Soren,\\" one could observe up to a hundred thousand and eight thousand planes. The observable range covered by these planes was referred to by the council as \\"Soren's Pan-Planes.\\" The footprints of wizard civilization were all over these planes, some leaving profound influences such as colonization. In others, their interactions were merely tentative, establishing fragile plane friendships. The origin of the \\"Pan-Plane Wizarding Council\\" was also due to this concept. Among the hundred thousand and eight thousand planes, only over three thousand possessed civilizations. The rest were either extremely harsh environments, resource-poor, or already dead and collapsed planes. Although the wizard civilization was powerful, it occupied only about fifty planes; there was still much room for future development. Nevertheless, there were many ancient civilizations in distant lands that, although not as powerful as the Abyss, still had level ten entities, and their overall strength was not much weaker than that of wizard civilization. As the wizard civilization gradually grew, long distances made expeditions difficult, and due to various reasons, these places were yet to be conquered. Many planes had even established pan-plane alliances to prevent colonization by wizards, joining forces against them. The previous rebellion of the five federations, besides the five evil gods, was also supported by these anti-wizard alliance forces. Internal strife and external troubles over more than a hundred years had led wizard civilization to temporarily abandon expansion and begin internal restructuring. The great ship of wizard civilization, regardless of individual wills, must have a unified direction on a macroscopic level! Otherwise, the civilization would not be able to leap forward and would eventually be devoured by great enemies like the Abyss! Outside the crystal wall. A giant sky city, carved like ice, tore through the crystal wall and approached slowly. \\"Legendary councilor, the Frost Witch is back!\\" \\"All units, prepare to receive the Frost Witch!\\" The Central Realm immediately buzzed with activity. On the sky city, the Frost Witch had a calm expression. For her, the centuries of the Great Expedition were equivalent to just half a year for ordinary people. \\"Welcome home, Lady Gullveig.\\" A hearty laugh rang out, and a middle-aged wizard in a splendid robe and a flaming crown appeared in the void. \\"Thank you, Chairman Emon.\\" Gullveig spoke calmly. \\"It's been hard work; without you, there would not be stability in our wizarding world!\\" Emon said with a sincere expression. \\"Is that so? But the wizarding world has not stabilized. Our Frost School's Frost Realm has been occupied by certain individuals.\\" Gullveig spoke frankly. Emon's face remained unchanged, he then replied with a wry smile: \\"Madam must think I am ineffective as the chairman of the council. But I can't help it; too much has happened in the wizarding world recently, and it's not something that can be explained in a few words. You also know, some people have always wanted to dissolve the council and have the wizarding world operate according to their will... How about this, I will set up a dinner at my sky city for you as a welcome back, and we can talk more at the dinner.\\" \\"I appreciate your work. There's no need for a reception, I would like to check on the Frost Realm myself.\\" Gullveig said. Emon's face changed, and he said: \\"Madam, this is not very good. According to the regulations, legendary wizards should not go to the ancestral lands of various schools personally, nor should they engage in conflicts themselves. You understand this too. Moreover, several level ten civilizations have been restless these years, trying to trouble our wizarding world; I need your help. You don't need to worry about the school's affairs; I will solve them for you. I still need some time to see clearly who wants to part ways with us. I also want to give them some opportunities to come back to our side... If they remain obstinate, we will settle the accounts after fall, how's that? Although you, madam, have exceptional talent and are recognized as the fastest legend since ancient times, I, Emon, have lived longer than you, and when it comes to certain people and issues in the council... I probably see clearer than you do, and some things can't just be resolved by capturing a few dark wizards.\\" Gullveig pondered for a moment and said, \\"I understand. However, the Frost School matter still needs to be resolved quickly.\\" \\"Don't worry,\\" Emon said with a smile, confident. ... The Endless Sea. The Sea of Stars. Half a year has passed since the man-faced spider was killed. On Rosalie's end, she has completely freed herself from the entanglement of nightmares and can finally sleep and meditate at ease. She and Neute are planning to have a grand wizard wedding in a month, inviting some relatives and friends to attend. Significant figures such as Levi were naturally invited. Eliana and Triss, on the other hand, were busy researching the corpse of the man-faced spider. With the precedent of the Tower of Dreams, their research would be particularly cautious. At the Dark Ancient Tower, various wizard organizations were eager to try. As can be foreseen, the Dark Ancient Tower would face an unprecedented fierce contest. Most importantly, not only the wizard civilization but also within the many planes of the multiverse, wherever the Dark Ancient Tower has traveled, people will be \\"summoned\\" to enter. This is not just a stage for wizards but also for all kinds of extraordinary races of the multiverse, where different supernatural species and power systems will clash on the same stage. According to official observations and statistical data, of the three thousand \\"Soren's Pan-Planes,\\" over a hundred planes with confirmed contestants have already participated. Among them, four are level ten great planes, and even more are level nine and below. This is only what has been observed. Over the long years, the range reached by the Dark Ancient Tower has long exceeded \\"The Eye of Soren's\\" observation radius. That's why Chairman Emon of the Great Council stressed repeatedly: Inside the Dark Ancient Tower, no matter what school or organization wizards come from, the first thing they should do after entering is not to fight internally, but to unite and clear the contestants from other planes! Afterward, within the wizard civilization, everyone will compete fairly based on their abilities. No matter who wins or loses, in the end, it will be beneficial for the development of wizard civilization. Of course, it's easy to say this, but it's hard to achieve it. Wizards, after all, are not like the Dark Bug Race; they do not possess an overwhelming Hive Will that completely turns individuals into parts of the civilization machine. In terms of efficiency and execution, they obviously can't compare to the Bug Race. The other four level ten planes outside Nora are \\"The Amethyst Plane,\\" \\"The Tomb Plane,\\" \\"The Dragon Scourge Plane,\\" and \\"The Red Giant Plane.\\" The Amethyst Plane, named for its resemblance to a giant amethyst crystal, is known for the powerful \\"Amethyst Race\\" that lives there. These naturally powerful extraordinary species are born from the magical amethyst ores. It's said that the older the ore, the more powerful the Amethyst Race that is born. Long ago, the Amethyst Plane was a subsidiary plane of wizard civilization. Ten thousand years ago, from an amethyst mine thought to exist for over a hundred million years, was born a humanoid extraordinary life form that self-proclaimed as \\"Terence.\\" The name \\"Terence\\" in the Amethyst Race means \\"The Oldest\\" - even older than the gods! This powerful existence quickly became a level ten powerhouse, leading the Amethyst Race to free themselves from the slavery of wizard civilization, revered as \\"The Amethyst Saint.\\" At that time, the legend count of the Wizard Council was only half of what it is today, and with powerful enemies around, the Amethyst Plane was never reclaimed. Now, a hundred thousand years later, the number of legendary powerhouses in wizard civilization has increased to over a dozen, and legends among wizards have come and gone; but The Amethyst Saint, with his long life, has grown even stronger. Ordinary legendary wizards are no longer his match. The Tomb Plane, the Dragon Scourge Plane, and the Red Giant Plane are similar, each with a powerful level ten entity. Each one is a well-known overlord of the multiverse Pan-Planes, comparable to gods. Inside the Wizard Tower. Levi put away the precious information he had purchased about the Dark Ancient Tower. Despite his anticipation, he also reminded himself to be extra cautious. Those planes that have survived under the claws of wizards must possess some incredible prowess. For example, the Amethyst Plane has a special crystalline life form, an entire nation of warriors. Although their number is scarce, every single Amethyst Race individual is born as a level one being. Some are even comparable to Soul Wizards at birth, which is even more impressive than the pure-blood dragon race! The Amethyst Race has a strong resistance against spells from any elemental school and also possesses a very strong physical body. They are made of the hardest amethyst ore, a kind of non-flesh-and-blood life, akin to special \\"Earth Elemental Spirits.\\" What's scariest is that, like the original Blood Race, the Amethyst Race doesn't have a strict concept of a soul but only a true spirit, which hardly fears psychic attacks. After they die, their ore bodies are returned to the Amethyst Plane to be buried. After tens of thousands of years, new Amethyst Race individuals can be nurtured. It can be said that apart from their limited numbers and extremely slow birth rate, which prevents natural reproduction, this is a near-perfect race. Their lifespan also ranks high among the long-living species. The Amethyst Saint has been alive for a hundred thousand years and is still doing well, which is proof. The council has conducted an experiment and found that, when at the same level, the average strength of the Amethyst Race is higher than that of wizards. Therefore, the Amethyst Race is an enemy that Levi must be especially wary of. They like to collect rare metals, gems, and other resources. By consuming these materials, they can evolve and grow stronger. \\"Fortunately, we humans have an advantage: we can breed and are creative. If it weren't for wizard civilization, how could humans compete with such a monstrous race? Nora would have already been conquered.\\" Levi muttered to himself as he entered his alchemy room. The Phoenix was diligently refining the shell left by the man-faced spider. No matter how hard it tried, it made little progress. \\"A relic of a level six being; the tier is too high, Phoenix, at level four, isn't enough.\\" Levi felt somewhat helpless. He had underestimated the hardness of the Nightmare Lord's shell. If a level four fire elemental like Phoenix couldn't refine it, it would be difficult for Levi too, and even if possible, it would take too much time. With preparations for the Dark Ancient Tower at hand, he decided to set aside the crafting of the Nightmare Dragon weapon for now. Once he entered the Dark Ancient Tower, he would look for a level five or higher geothermal source to refine the divine weapon. There were still about four years before the opening of the Dark Ancient Tower. Before that, he needed to complete two tasks. One was to discover the sixth talent spell, and the other was to advance his Crimson Dragon breathing to level fifteen, reaching the Blood Source Triple Transformation stage, which would provide an additional contract slot. That way, if he found a suitable extraordinary creature inside the Dark Ancient Tower, he could subdue it. After half a year of training, Levi's Crimson Dragon breathing had reached its limit. Levi—————— Crimson Dragon Breathing: Fourteenth level (limit, can evolve/advance)…… ... This time again, Levi chose the path of advancement. Without sufficient bloodline resources, the path of evolution would be too costly and not worth the loss. The main material needed for advancement was the heart of a level four Blood Race. Levi had already obtained some clues about a level four Blood Race through the Shining Tavern. This level four Blood Race was the Bloodline Ancestor that had narrowly escaped in the past during a joint attack by the Dragon God Church and the Star Church. Lying dormant for decades, it and other Blood Race members have since re-emerged, taking advantage of the chaos to resume their activities, causing great trouble for the churches. And this Blood Race happened to be hiding in the Peacock Kingdom, which was where Levi had the deepest roots and most knowledge. \\"After attending Witch Rosalie's wedding, I can leave the Endless Sea and return to the human world to wait for the opening of the ancient tower.\\" During this half year, he would spend some time each day entering the Nightmare World to check on the status of his domain. He lay in the secret chamber, and his Nightmare Dragon power enveloped his consciousness, taking him to the Nightmare World, descending upon the Main Flesh Tree. Then, a black dragon, slightly bigger than half a year ago, appeared on the trunk of the Main Tree. The black dragon shapeshifted into a burly black-armored knight. \\"As long as I stay in the Nightmare World, my Nightmare Dragon Breathing can also slowly grow stronger, though at a very slow pace... but if I just leave it (This chapter is not finished, please click on the next page to continue reading)"},{"prompt":"0295 恋人进阶，巫师婚礼，百花回家！（大章求月票求订阅）） (第2/3页) 机就能变强，还是很爽的。” 这个是李维成为梦魇领主后，才发现的一点。 他推测，应该是因为他在和血肉主树连接后，血肉主树会将其从多元位面吸收而来的噩梦之力，提炼之后，反馈一小部分给自己。 有一说一，这些力量很低级，完全不能和他的梦魇龙之力相提并论，胜在持续稳定。 这种提升，也有一个弊端，那就是他必须来到梦魇世界，才能获益，一回到现实世界，就没有了。 相当于只能“在线挂机”，不能“离线挂机”。 而如果在梦魇世界，他又没办法修行其他的呼吸法，以及冥想法。 他也不能捡了芝麻，丢了西瓜，所以这种挂机变强的方式，也只能作为添头。 想要快速提升梦魇龙的境界，还是得寻找生存在这里的噩梦龙族，然后带回现实世界修行。 他也研究过梦魇结晶，看看能不能和欧文斯、里昂那样吸收里面的力量，最终发现，效果甚微。 这些力量极为驳杂，层次也很低，梦魇龙完全不接受。 所以李维干脆把大量的梦魇结晶埋在了噩梦主树的根系部位，让它们作为主树的“养料”，促进主树的成长。 半年后，他发现，那些结晶，全部都被噩梦主树所吸收了。 他能够感觉到，自己从主树那边得到的力量反馈，又大了一点。 虽然都是蚊子肉，不过不用浪费时间去修行，挂机就可以获取梦魇龙呼吸法的熟练度，李维已经很满足。 不仅如此，在主树获取更多养料后，那些被毁坏的母树的恢复速度，也开始加快。 黑龙领的各地。 感受到领主的到来，四头四级噩梦生物陆续来到李维面前，匍匐在他四周。 其中一位，身高三层楼，猪头人身，样貌狰狞，大腹便便，手握一柄杀猪刀，肚子上也长有宛如七鳃鳗一样的巨大口器，李维给其取名为“屠夫”。 还有一位漂浮在半空中，穿着诡异红色宫装，披头散发，前后两张面孔，一哭一笑的噩梦生物，李维称它为“红衣”。 最后则是一位手握大锤，穿着马戏团服装，长有古怪的小丑鼻子，以及寿星一样的畸形额头，叫“大锤”。 这三位，很符合李维前世凡人心目中的噩梦怪物形象，经常在影视剧中出现类似的怪物。 再加上九婴，李维这个新官上任的黑龙领主麾下，也组成了“四大金刚”护法，不至于光杆司令一个。 “我不在这段时间，可有其他领主到来？”李维问道。 九婴摇摇头，表示没有。 李维略微松了口气，他如今初来乍到，根基尚浅。 没有伊莲娜的情况下，他连对付一头五级噩梦生物都困难，更不用说其他噩梦领主了。 如果那些领主入侵自己，他将毫无反抗之力。 所以在成为黑龙领主之后，李维下达的第一个命令就是“休养生息”。 凡黑龙领的子民，都不得随意外出领地，更不可以和其他领地发生摩擦，全部都苟在领地内发育。 他让四大统领分别建立了巡逻，狩猎，情报，守卫小队。 巡逻小队负责防止领地被入侵，狩猎小队负责收割混乱荒野上的梦魇结晶来喂养噩梦主树，情报小队查探其他领地情况，守卫小队保护噩梦树林。 直到他拥有六级实力，再考虑对外扩张和社交的事宜。 梦魇龙血脉高贵，上限很高。奈何现阶段就是一头三级的梦魇幼龙。 对于这种纯血龙族来说，至少也得踏入六级以后，才算是进入亚成年期，九级以后则是完全体。六级之前，都是青少年。 接着，李维问道： “这些日子，混乱荒野上可遇见龙族身影？” 屠夫忽然开口说道，声音沙哑：“目前为止还没有遇见龙族，如果有发现，我们会第一时间通知主人。” “行了，你们继续去忙吧。” 李维面色平静，显然已经习惯。 进入黑暗古塔后，他依旧可以降临梦魇世界，所以这个不着急。 “目前来看，阿奈丝的死，并没有引起其他领主的注意，我还有一段发育时间。” 噩梦领主的寿元极其漫长，互相之间，百年时间不相往来也很正常。 上一次阿奈丝前往血雨城，已经是领主们难得一见的集会了。 只要再给李维一两百年的发育时间，成为六级元魂巫师，他就可以真正的比肩噩梦领主。 到时候，即便他们发现了，也没有什么大不了的。 纵然是梦魇世界强者如云，七级以上的噩梦领主，也不多见。 在巡视了一圈领地，最后他来到那片血肉树林面前。 曾经被大战毁掉大半的树林，又有新的枝丫开始冒头。 “长势喜人啊，不枉费我投喂梦魇结晶给主树。” 根据他的统计，目前，他的领地内，一共有1001棵噩梦母树，以及1棵噩梦主树！ 噩梦母树诞生噩梦生物的速度，和噩梦主树息息相关。在阿奈丝统治时期，这一千颗母树，每年都可以产生一千枚左右的噩梦胚胎。 这些胚胎中，会孵化出最初始的噩梦生物，大多数都是零级水准，巫师学徒就可以对付。 一些资质较好的，如九婴他们这些四级统领，生来就是一级了。而李维，出生就是三级。 只不过，噩梦生物的成长较为缓慢，需要从多元位面不断的汲取生灵的噩梦之力，恐惧之力等负面情绪。 而这些情绪，也正是以噩梦树林为媒介，从多元位面来到梦魇世界，如植物光合作用释放的氧气一样，释放到整个梦魇世界，供它们吸收成长。 大多数噩梦生物的幼体，都会死于各种各样的意外事件和同类相残。 这是没办法避免的，梦魇世界竞争激烈，噩梦生物的更新迭代速度极快，唯有成为领主，才算是脱颖而出，独霸一方。 可以说，噩梦树林就是梦魇世界存在的基石，也是一位领主最重要的生产资料。 如今，树林中，完好无损的噩梦母树，不足此前的三分之一。 这导致领地内的生产效率，相对低下。想要恢复人面蛛统治时期的水准，需要很长的时间。 李维回到主树那边，在这里的地下，有一个巨大的溶洞，里面是一些被人面蛛迫害的其他位面的生命留下的遗物。 这半年时间，李维在这里捡垃圾，已经捡了好几件还可以用的巫器，还有一些低阶的知识传承。 除此之外，整个黑龙领地，可以说是一穷二白。 事实上，这块领地，在血雨霸主所统治的【血雨区域】，都属于最为贫瘠之地。 阿奈丝的领主生活过得并不理想。这也是阿奈丝执着于入侵其他位面的缘故，其他领主她也打不过，只能想点其他办法了。 李维打算等自己忙完黑暗古塔的事情后，就着手开发这片领地，看看有没有什么未开发的矿产，生物资源，然后带回现实世界，用于提升自己和古圣位面的实力。 确认领地无碍后，李维很快就回到了现实世界。 …… 时间飞逝。 转眼间，一个月的时间就过去了。 冥王城内。 李维正沉浸在自己的意识海洋中。 四层巫师塔周围，那代表了【恋人符文】的白羊符文之语又壮大了一丝。 隐隐间，李维和冥冥之中的【白羊星宿】的联系，似乎更加紧密了。 李维—————— 恋人符文：五阶（1/30000），特效：白羊星宿之力（五级） 力量符文：九阶 战车符文：九阶 …… 【白羊星宿之力（五级）：符文之语沟通白羊星宿，星辰之力增幅你的幸运，当前幸运增幅为40%。除此之外，你的个人魅力，生育能力也得到了提升。】 “不容易啊，不愧是和幸运有关的符文，修行起来，还真是困难。如今40%的幸运增幅在手，美好的明天在等着我。” 现在的李维，已经能够明显的感受到，恋人符文对于自己的幸运加持效果了。这是真的有用的符文！ 说实在的，如果不是这个符文，李维对于黑暗古塔的兴趣也不会如此大。 正是因为它，让李维总有种错觉：“黑暗之地的所有宝物，合该归我！” 他觉得，自己应该可以在里面收获颇丰。 除此之外，李维的战车符文和力量符文，也都成功九阶，力量和速度增幅，来到了恐怖的80%！ 这让他的战斗力和跑路能力，又一次得到了巨大的提升。 “符文之语，潜力无限，迟早有一天，我可以肝出来真正的……星辰之语！手握日月摘星辰，不过如此！” 心情不错的李维打开那本从派翠西亚身上得到的书籍。 《真菌的艺术》。 经过他的研究，这本书籍，并不是真菌皇后的原本。 只是某位古代元魂巫师翻译的版本，而且内容不是很全，因为后面的内容过于深奥，以至于这位元魂巫师都无法理解，差点陷入疯狂，后来原本就不知所踪了，只有孤本留了下来。 此书的第一句话就极为霸气。 “艺术就是孢子大爆炸！愚蠢者，才将真菌视为最低等生命，殊不知，大道至简，返璞归真，唯有真菌，才能实现永恒和不朽！真菌，才是生命进化的最完美形态，赞美孢子，赞美真菌！——真菌皇后·祖格莫伊琳。” 李维粗略的看了一番，发现这位真菌皇后，简直是深渊领主中的异类。 祂可以说是深渊中为数不多的大学者类型的恶魔领主，学识渊博，对于生物学，进化学，真菌学更是如数家珍。 根据书中描述，这位神祇，为了学习和求知，曾经多次远渡重洋，以圣者化身的方式，潜藏在巫师世界，研究和偷学巫师的知识，身份暴露，临走之前，还不忘拐走好几位元魂巫师。 也正是这种求知精神，让这位恶魔领主，用毫不起眼的真菌，铸造了自己独特的通天大道，跨越天堑，踏入十级，自称“真菌皇后”！ 她擅长制造强大的“寄生真菌”，依靠真菌，可以实现千变万化的类法术能力。 这里面，就记载了许多真菌的培育方法。 【音乐真菌】，可以播放唯美的音乐，陶悦情操。 【僧帽真菌】，可以延长寿命，以真菌的方式，实现变相的永生……代价就是变成一株失去意识的蘑菇，无法逆转。 【爆裂蘑菇】，可以制作威力巨大的蘑菇炸弹，一共分为七种颜色：灰、白、绿，蓝，紫，金，红！ 据说，爆裂红蘑菇的爆炸威力，堪比七环法术，被真菌夫人爱称为：小红帽。 李维直接看傻眼了，七环法术，那可是熔金巫王那种层次的强者才能施展的真“核弹”级法术了。 这不是蘑菇，这就是核弹啊！ 七级之上，其实还有更高层次的爆裂蘑菇，只不过那位元魂巫师翻译不出来了。 据说，真菌皇后为了实验自己的爆裂蘑菇的威力，曾经朝着一个小位面丢了个十级的蘑菇。 她称之为“菌皇”。 伴随着闪耀黑暗之地的火光和宛如星云一样的蘑菇云升腾。那个小位面就消失不见了…… “牛逼。” 李维不得不佩服真菌皇后的天才。 他扫了一圈，发现几种自己现阶段 （本章未完，请点击下一页继续阅读）","completion":"0295 Lovers Progress, Wizard Wedding, Hundred Flowers Go Home! (Great Chapter for Monthly Tickets and Subscriptions) (Page 2/3) Setting it and forgetting it can make one stronger, and that's quite cool. This was something Levi discovered after becoming the Nightmare Lord. He speculated that it was because after he connected with the Main Flesh Tree, the Main Flesh Tree refined the Nightmare Power absorbed from the multiverse and feedback a small portion to him. Admittedly, this power was very low-level, couldn't at all compare with his Nightmare Dragon Power, but it was consistently stable. This kind of improvement also had a downside: he had to be in the Nightmare World to benefit; once back in the real world, it was gone. Essentially, he could \\"level up online\\" but not \\"offline.\\" And while in the Nightmare World, he couldn't practice other breathing techniques or meditation methods. He couldn't let the sesame seeds slip through his fingers in pursuit of the watermelon, so this idle leveling up method could only serve as a little extra. To rapidly raise the Nightmare Dragon's realm, he still had to find Nightmare Dragons living in this place and then bring them back to the real world for cultivation. He had also researched Nightmare Crystals to see if he could absorb power from them like Owens and Lyon did, but ultimately found the effects to be minute. These powers were extremely mixed and of very low level; the Nightmare Dragon rejected them entirely. So Levi decided to bury a large number of Nightmare Crystals at the root area of the Main Flesh Tree to serve as \\"nutrients\\" for the tree, promoting its growth. Half a year later, he found that those crystals had all been absorbed by the Main Flesh Tree. He could feel the power feedback he received from the Main Tree was a bit stronger. Although it was just a little bit, analogous to mosquito meat, the fact that he could gain proficiency in Nightmare Dragon Breathing just by being idle without wasting time on training was satisfactory to Levi. Moreover, with the Main Tree gaining more nutrients, the recovery speed of the damaged Mother Trees also began to accelerate. In the various regions of the Black Dragon Territory. Sensing the arrival of their Lord, four level-four Nightmare creatures came before Levi and lay prostrate around him. Among them was one that stood as tall as a three-story building with the head of a pig and a human body, with a fierce appearance, a big belly, and wielding a pig-slaughtering knife. It also had a huge mouth on its stomach like that of a lamprey. Levi named it \\"The Butcher.\\" There was another one floating in mid-air, dressed in a weird red palace costume, disheveled hair, with a face on both the front and back, one crying and one laughing—Levi called this Nightmare creature \\"The Red Dress.\\" The last one held a large hammer, dressed in circus attire, with a strange clown nose and a deformed forehead like a Chinese god of longevity. Levi called it \\"The Great Hammer.\\" These three fit the image of nightmare monsters commonly portrayed in movies and TV shows from Levi's previous life as an ordinary human. Along with Jiuying, Levi, the newly instated Lord of the Black Dragons, also formed a \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\" cabinet, which ensured he wasn't just a commander without a team. \\"During my absence, have any other Lords arrived?\\" Levi inquired. Jiuying shook its head, indicating there had been none. Levi breathed a slight sigh of relief; he was still new here with a shallow foundation. Without Eliana, he would even find it difficult to deal with a single level-five Nightmare creature, let alone other Nightmare Lords. If those Lords invaded him, he would be powerless to resist. So after becoming the Black Dragon Lord, Levi's first order was \\"to recuperate and multiply.\\" All the subjects of the Black Dragon Territory were forbidden from recklessly leaving their territory, to say nothing of friction with other domains; all had to lurk within their own territory and develop. He ordered the four governors to set up patrol, hunting, intelligence, and guard teams. The patrol team was responsible for preventing invasions, the hunting team for harvesting Nightmare Crystals from the Chaotic Wilderness to nourish the Main Flesh Tree, the intelligence team for reconnaissance on other territories, and the guard team for protecting the Nightmare Forests. Only when he acquired level-six strength would he consider expansion and social interaction. The Nightmare Dragon bloodline was noble with a high ceiling. However, at this stage, he was only a level-three infant dragon. For a pure-blooded dragon race, it wouldn't be until entering level-six that one reached the sub-adult period; after level-nine, they achieved their complete form. Before level-six, all were adolescents. Then, Levi asked: \\"In these days, have you encountered any dragon figures in the Chaotic Wilderness?\\" The Butcher suddenly spoke, with a hoarse voice: \\"So far, we have not encountered any dragons; if we do, we will notify the master immediately.\\" \\"That's all, continue with your tasks.\\" Levi looked calm, evidently accustomed to this. After entering the Dark Ancient Tower, he could still descend into the Nightmare World, so there was no rush. \\"From what I can tell, the death of Agnes has not drawn the attention of other Lords; I still have some time to develop.\\" The lifespan of a Nightmare Lord was exceedingly long; it was normal for them to not interact for hundreds of years. Agnes' last visit to the City of Blood Rain was a rare gathering of Lords. If Levi were given a hundred or two hundred years to develop, becoming a level-six Soul Wizard, he could truly stand shoulder to shoulder with Nightmare Lords. By then, even if they found out, it wouldn't matter much. Even in the Nightmare World, teeming with strong beings, Nightmare Lords above level-seven were rare. After inspecting his territory, he finally arrived at the Flesh Forest. The forest, mostly destroyed by the great battle, had new branches budding. \\"It's a satisfactory growth; it makes feeding the Main Tree with Nightmare Crystals worthwhile.\\" According to his count, there were a total of 1,001 Nightmare Mother Trees and one Nightmare Main Tree within his territory! The speed at which the Nightmare Mother Trees birthed Nightmare creatures was closely related to the Main Flesh Tree. During Agnes' rule, these one thousand trees could produce about a thousand Nightmare embryos each year. These embryos would hatch into the most primary Nightmare creatures, the majority being level zero, manageable by wizard apprentices. Some with better aptitude, like the level-four governors such as Jiuying, were born as level ones. Levi was born a level three. However, the growth of Nightmare creatures was relatively slow; they needed to continuously assimilate the Nightmare Power and Fear Power, along with other negative emotions from the multiverse. These emotions, acting through the Nightmare Forests as a medium, came to the Nightmare World from the multiverse, like the oxygen released by photosynthesis in plants, released into the entire Nightmare World for them to absorb and grow. Most young Nightmare creatures perished due to various accidents or fratricide. This was unavoidable; the competition in the Nightmare World was fierce, and the fast turnover rate of the Nightmare creatures' replacement. Only becoming a Lord would stand out and dominate. It can be said that the Nightmare Forest is the cornerstone of the existence of the Nightmare World, also the most important means of production for a Lord. Now, less than a third of the flawless Nightmare Mother Trees in the forest remain. This has led to lower productivity in the territory. To return to the standard of the Man-Faced Spider's rule, it would take a long time. Levi went back to the Main Tree. Underground, there was a huge cavern with relics left by lives from other planes that had been persecuted by the Man-Faced Spider. Over the past half year, Levi had been scavenging here, picking up several still-usable magical tools and some lower-level knowledge inheritances. Besides this, the Black Dragon Territory could be described as destitute. In fact, this domain, within the \\"Blood Rain Dominance\\" ruled by the Blood Rain Hegemon, was among the most barren of lands. Agnes's life as a Lord was far from ideal. This was why Agnes was fixated on invading other planes; she couldn't beat the other Lords, so she had to think of other methods. Levi planned to develop this territory and see if there were any undeveloped minerals, biological resources, and then take them back to the real world to enhance his own strength and that of the Ancient Saint plane. After confirming that the territory was unharmed, Levi quickly returned to the real world. ... Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, a month had passed. Inside Hades City. Levi was immersed in his own sea of consciousness. Around the fourth-level Wizard Tower, the Aries Runespeak representing the Lover Rune had grown a bit stronger. Faintly, the connection between Levi and the Aries Constellation in the great beyond seemed closer. Levi—————— Lover Rune: Fifth level (1/30,000), Special Effect: Power of Aries Constellation (level five) Strength Rune: Ninth level Chariot Rune: Ninth level ... [Power of Aries Constellation (level five): Runespeak connects with Aries Constellation, augmenting your luck with stellar power. The current luck enhancement is 40%. In addition, your personal charisma and fertility have also been improved.] \\"It's not easy; it's truly difficult cultivating a rune related to luck. Now, with a 40% luck enhancement in hand, a bright future awaits me.\\" Levi could now clearly feel the boost in luck the Lover Rune was giving him. It was a genuinely useful rune! To be honest, if not for this rune, Levi wouldn't have been so interested in the Dark Ancient Tower. It was because of it that Levi always felt an illusion: \\"All the treasures of the dark should belong to me!\\" He believed he should be able to gain a lot in there. In addition to that, Levi's Chariot and Strength Runes had also successfully reached the ninth level, with his strength and speed being terrifyingly enhanced by 80%! This gave his combat and escape capabilities another significant increase. \\"The power of Runespeak is infinite. One day, I will solidify the real... Language of Stars! Having the sun and moon, plucking stars, is just like this!\\" Levi, in a good mood, opened the book he had obtained from Patricia. The Art of Fungi. After his research, he discovered this book was not the original work of the Fungi Queen. It was translated by some ancient Soul Wizard and was incomplete because the translator could not understand the content beyond a certain point—it was too profound. The translator nearly fell into madness, and the original disappeared without a trace, leaving only this copy. The first sentence of the book was extremely powerful. \\"Art is a spore explosion! Fools are those who see fungi as the lowest life forms, not realizing that the great way is simplest and to return to the basics, only fungi can achieve eternity and immortality! Fungi are the most perfect form of life's evolution, praise the spores, praise the fungi! —Fungi Queen, Zuge Moylin.\\" Levi skimmed through and found this Fungi Queen was an anomaly among the Abyss Lords. She could be regarded as one of the few scholarly types of demon lords in the Abyss with profound knowledge, especially in biology, evolutionary sciences, and mycology. According to the book's description, this deity ventured across the seas to study and learn knowledge. Disguised as a saint, she hid in the wizarding world, researching and stealing wizard knowledge. Even as her identity was exposed before she left, she didn't forget to abduct several Soul Wizards. It was this pursuit of knowledge that allowed this demon lord to forge her unique path to the heavens with insignificant fungi, crossing the chasm and entering level ten, proclaiming herself the \\"Fungi Queen.\\" She excelled in creating powerful \\"parasitic fungi” and could achieve diverse spell-like abilities using fungi. Herein many cultivation methods for fungi were recorded. [Music Fungi], capable of playing beautiful music, enchanting the senses. [Monk's Hood Fungi], able to extend life span, achieving an altered form of immortality through fungi... The cost is becoming a consciousness-less mushroom, irreversible. [Exploding Mushrooms], capable of creating powerful mushroom bombs, coming in seven colors: grey, white, green, blue, purple, gold, red! Allegedly, the explosive power of the Exploding Red Mushroom was comparable to a seventh-circle spell, affectionately called by the Fungi Lady as \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" Levi was stunned; a seventh-circle spell was the real \\"nuclear bomb\\"-level spell that could only be cast by powerhouses like Meltgold Wizard Kings. This wasn't a mushroom; this was a nuke! Above level seven were even higher tiers of Exploding Mushrooms, but the ancient Soul Wizard couldn't translate them. It was said that to test the power of her Exploding Mushrooms, the Fungi Queen once threw a level-ten mushroom at a small plane. She named it \\"Mycelium Emperor.\\" Accompanied by a flash akin to the lights of the Dark Lands and a mushroom cloud rising like a nebula, that small plane disappeared... \\"Impressive.\\" Levi couldn't help but admire the Fungi Queen's genius.

(Great Chapter for Monthly Tickets and Subscriptions) (Page 3/3) I found that I was able to cultivate some fungi that were useful to me. One was the [Exploding Mushroom], and the other was [Parasitic Fungi]. Exploding Mushrooms need no further explanation; art is an explosion. Parasitic Fungi, however, are the methods of the sly witches. Transplanting the fungal spore into the organism's body and using the mushroom's development to induce evolution in the organism. Different individuals might have different organs sprouting from the fungi. In the end, these specialized organs acquired from fungi are called [Parasitic Gear]! The more critical the specialized part and the greater the quantity, the stronger the parasitized being becomes. For example, Patricia’s entire lower body was specialized; her strength was comparable to a fifth-level wizard. Then there’s Leonard the Heartless, whose key organ, the heart, was specialized, also giving him strength comparable to a fifth-level wizard. As for the Eyeless and Earless… they are generally at about the fourth-level standard. If one's entire body were to be specialized by fungi, a complete \\"Fungal Parasitic Gear\\" comparable to a Soul Wizard would be born. At this time, the host, formerly an ordinary being, mutates into a full-fledged \\"Fungal Organism.\\" The Fungi Queen refers to them as \\"Fungal Apostles.\\" After researching, Levi discovered that the spore bottle he obtained was called \\"Origin Spores.\\" Despite appearing as ordinary white powder in a black bottle, these powders were the initial reproducing bodies of all types of fungi from the Fungi Queen. Affected by different temperatures, nutrients, spells, and other factors, these spores would gradually differentiate and embark on utterly different paths. Therefore, both the Exploding Mushrooms and the Fungal Parasitic Gear could evolve from these spores. Of course, cultivating these spores requires a lot of relevant professional knowledge, strong mental strength, suitable culture mediums, precious nutrients, and various other complex conditions. Agnes assigned Patricia to oversee this project, and after five hundred years of research, she cultivated a small fungal squad. Also, not everyone is suitable for spore transplantation. Most of the test subjects died shortly after transplantation. In general, beings with stronger vitality and constitutions are more likely to succeed in transplantation. “Some lizardfolk could be used for experimentation... Although it seems a bit cruel, let's start with the prisoners from the Old Dragon Empire.” Levi put away the book, which might be the most valuable heritage knowledge he has so far. Because it's not just a fungus cultivation manual; it's a complete, highly potential path to transcendence. The Fungi Queen's power alone forged a new path to transcendence, truly deserving of divinity! Levi planned to establish a \\"Spore Cultivation Laboratory\\" once he returned to the Ancient Saint Plane, then plant some of the spores. When he returned from the Dark Ancient Tower, these spores should have differentiated into various fungal larvae. By then, it would be time to start researching the fungal lizardfolk. If this path is successful, he could cultivate a specialized fungal force in addition to the Ancients, Knights, and Beasts. When a group of lizardfolk armed with Fungal Parasitic Gear and equipped with Exploding Mushrooms eventually emerges, they will be unstoppable. “However, I will consider it carefully. Before culturing these spores, they need to be treated with a purifying solution. If the Fungi Queen left any backdoor marks, I don't want to find out later that my research ended up benefiting her.” ... The next day. While Levi was practicing, Enya's voice came from outside the door. “Mr. Levi, it's time to go to the wedding.” “I’m coming.” After getting ready, Levi stepped out of his house; this was his first time attending a wizard’s wedding. He wore a black tailcoat that fit well over his tall and muscular figure. By contrast, Enya looked much more delicate, and with his ethereal silver hair, even more elegant. If placed in some anime, Levi, with his bulky muscular build, would likely be a throwaway character who wouldn’t survive past three episodes. Yet, that was Levi’s aesthetic. Taking an airship, the two soon arrived at the Starfire Island where the Garcia Wizarding Academy was located. On a patch of grass inside Starfire Island, a considerable number of wizards had already gathered, and most were mid-tier wizards. Neute and Rose’s status weren’t low, so their social circle mostly consisted of mid-tier wizards. Among them, the most eye-catching were the dazzling bridesmaids beside Witch Rose. They were dressed in gorgeous gowns embroidered with different kinds of floral designs, each bewitchingly beautiful, of noble disposition, the weakest of them being third-level wizards. At the moment, they looked like a group of chirping and giggling larks. “My God, half of the 'Twenty-four Flowers' have come...\\" Enya couldn't help but exclaim. Levi also observed with interest, murmuring inside, \\"Violet, Lily, Butterfly, Wind Chime, Lilac...\\" He had to admit, each of the \\"Twenty-four Flowers\\" was uniquely beautiful. Neute was dressed impressively today, and his dashing young look made him stand out as the star of the day. Witch Rose wore a light pink wedding dress with a long, trailing skirt. All the guests were seated below, Levi and Enya found a spot and sipped wine. “Haha, Levi, you made it too,” Hoffman's voice sounded. “Indeed, I am good friends with Neute and Rose.” Levi smiled. “Long time no see! Levi, no... you've reached the fourth level?” Saville was shocked and then bitterly smiled, “I will have to call you senior from now on.” “Just call me Levi; I don’t mind.” Levi maintained his casual smile. He could sense that a thick barrier had been erected between him and Saville; they seemed no longer to belong to the same world. It was all because of his accursed talent, which led to rapid strength improvement, growing ever more distant from his friends! Levi glanced around and didn't see Eliana's figure. The next moment, two Soul-level presences thunderously descended! Accompanied by countless petals falling from the sky as if it were raining. Everyone looked up in shock. The entire sky above Starfire Island was a colorful rain of flowers, reflecting a rainbow in the skies! In the middle of the floral sea, the Witch of Flowers, Eliana, and the Black Pearl boy, Garcia, descended from the sky. \\"Is that Principal Garcia himself? Is Wizard Neute's status so high?\\" someone whispered. \\"Neute is a venerable figure of the Starfire Wizarding Academy and is also the director of the appraisal department. But most importantly, probably due to Witch Rose—being a member of Rose's family—the Witch of Flowers has arrived. It would be inappropriate if Principal Garcia didn’t show up.\\" \\"Wuwu... I'm so envious. Both of them have connections with Soul Wizards, truly a match made in heaven.\\" \\"And they seem very fond of each other too.\\" After Eliana and Garcia landed, she caught a glimpse of Levi sitting below. Levi currently looked up with a smile on his face. \\"Welcome, everyone, to the wedding of Wizard Neute and Witch Rose. Today, this old fellow, along with the young and beautiful Witch Eliana, will officiate the ceremony for this couple.\\" Wizards do not believe in gods, so there's no priest-like figure for the ceremony; typically, it's presided over by the most important elder. After a heartfelt speech, the newlyweds completed the wedding ceremony under the witness of two Soul-level powerhouses. After the ceremony, Eliana left in a hurry. \\"Mr. Levi, it's really wonderful that you could come!\\" Witch Rose's eyes brimmed with gratitude. Neute also hurried over to express his thanks. \\"Mr. Levi, long time no see.\\" Suddenly, a witch with a flirtatious aura approached, it was Lily Witch. Next to her was Violet Witch, now a third-level senior wizard, not yet stepped into the fourth level. Upon realizing that Levi, once below her in rank, had reached the fourth level, Violet's face showed complexity, full of mixed feelings. After Lily Witch saw Enya, she went up to chat. Enya politely conversed, but stuck close to Levi; knowing he wasn’t interested in her, Lily Witch then left dismayed. A dozen beautiful witches approached, some glancing at Enya and Levi talking with Rose. \\"Rose, who is this silver-haired wizard? He actually has a fourth-level senior body-refining wizard as his guard?\\" Butterfly Witch inquired telepathically. Rose couldn’t help but smile, saying, \\"This is Wizard Enya, my friend. As for the other one, he's my benefactor, not just any guard! His name is Levi, very strong. Among our sisters, except for Senior Rose, probably no one is his match.\\" \\"Really? Do you think I can't match him?\\" Butterfly Witch appeared incredulous. She was a child of the Water Element, not yet two hundred years old, but already at the pinnacle of the fourth level, preparing to crystallize. In the annual competition of the Twenty-four Flowers, her strength was second only to the older generation, like Witch Rose. With her excellent talent, she was regarded by the outside world as Eliana's successor. \\"Believe it or not, I warn you, don't create trouble. Today is my wedding,\\" Rose Witch warned. Butterfly was generally good but a bit too competitive. \\"Don't worry, I just wanted to spar out of curiosity, but I’ll leave it if he disagrees.\\" Butterfly Witch gracefully moved to Levi and smiled, confidently revealing a charming curve at her low-necked attire, \\"Hello, Mr. Levi, I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Rose's sister. I’ve heard you're quite skilled and would like to make friends and hopefully spar in the future.\\" Before Levi could speak, Enya shook her head with a touch of helplessness, \\"Miss, Mr. Levi doesn't enjoy sparring, and I advise you not to seek trouble. Otherwise, a setback could affect your cultivation mindset.\\" \\"Today is a celebration, let's not discuss this. Miss Butterfly, perhaps another time,\\" Levi suggested calmly. He really wasn’t interested in child play sparring. With that time, he might as well go to the Nightmare World to hunt monsters; that's where the real combatants were. \\"Alright, let’s exchange contact information then; let's be friends.\\" Butterfly Witch was somewhat embarrassed by the rejection, but fully ignited with curiosity. Both Rose's words and Enya's reaction indicated Levi’s exceptional nature. Eliana's voice came into Levi's mind, \\"I have time now; take me on a tour of the Sanctum.\\" In the sky above, Eliana had somehow circled back. \\"Sorry, I have urgent matters to attend to, we’ll talk later.\\" After quickly bidding farewell to his friends, Levi flew into the sky, aligning shoulder to shoulder with Eliana, swiftly leaving the wedding scene. \\"Neute, am I seeing things... Did Levi just fly away with the Witch of Flowers?\\" Saville stood dumbfounded, incredulous. \\"Alas, now I understand why Levi's cultivation advances so fast. I’m simply too naive, thinking he was a lone practitioner like me...\\" Hoffman lamented, feeling bitter inside. Butterfly Witch was even more lost. She thought Enya's guard was the one getting close with Eliana the Great? Inside Eliana's airship, Levi sat upright. Eliana broke the silence, \\"Butterfly Witch is somewhat competitive; don't take offense.\\" Levi replied with a smile, \\"Butterfly Witch didn't mean harm, I understand. As a Child of the Elements, she naturally carries some pride.\\" Eliana looked over and smiled, \\"I, too, am a Child of the Elements. Do you think I have pride?\\" \\"…Not at all. You are approachable and unlike the Soul Wizards I imagined.\\" Eliana’s lips curled upward, but she didn’t speak further. Returning to her room, she began to meditate, like Levi, not wasting a moment of cultivation time. Today is 11,000 words, with an added 5,000 words, still owe an update of 22,000 words!

This tight-knit bunch was renowned throughout the woods for their playful antics and boundless curiosity. Names like Patches, Whiskers, Flopsy, and Thumper adorned these bouncy critters, each with their own distinct personality and penchant for adventure. One sun-dappled morning, the bunnies overheard ardent chirps and tweets detailing the wonders of a grand national park that lay just beyond their home boundaries. This park, the feathered friends claimed, was a marvel of nature, brimming with roaring waterfalls, geysers, mammoth trees, and vast meadows painted with wildflowers. The very thought tickled the rabbits’ whiskers with delight, and they unanimously decided they must see this spectacle for themselves. With determined hops, the group set out on their journey, giggling and cavorting through the underbrush. They bounded over brooks and tunneled under thorny thickets, their excitement growing with every leap. Eventually, after a series of rambunctious relays, they reached the edge of Greenwood Forest and stood before the majestic national park. Whiskers, ever the leader of the band, wiggled his nose. “Remember, friends, stay close, and watch for hawks!” He reminded them with a wink, for he knew their playfulness might lead them into unexpected troubles. The bunnies scampered into the lush expanse of the park, marveling at its grandeur. Their first encounter was with a towering waterfall that sprayed mist into the air, creating dazzling rainbows. The foaming cascade tumbled into a churning pool below, echoing its power across the land. Hoppy, a particularly spirited bunny with a splash of white on his chest, hopped a little too close to the edge, mesmerized by the sheer drop. “Hoppy, look out!” Patches squeaked in alarm. Just as he skidded on the slippery rocks, teetering over the precipice, Flopsy lunged forward and grabbed Hoppy’s tail with her teeth, pulling him back to safety. The group gasped and then praised Flopsy’s quick reflexes. Hoppy, looking a touch embarrassed but grateful, whispered a meek, “Thank you,” to his heroine. Recovering from their near-disaster, the bunnies decided to venture deeper into the park. They discovered a field of bubbling mud pots, where the earth itself seemed to play with plopping and farting noises. This messy wonder captured the attention of Thumper, the most brazen bunny of them all. “You don’t see this in Greenwood Forest!” he exclaimed before bounding to the edge of a mud pot, nudging a paw curiously at the goopy substance. With a mischevous twinkle in his eyes, he proceeded to prance around the mud pot, flicking dollops of mud every which way; his snow-white fur now spattered with earthy polka dots. The other bunnies chortled and hopped playfully around the mud pots, careful not to get too close. They danced and dodged the hurling mud from Thumper’s impromptu mud party, their laughter melting into the serene sounds of the park. As the day waned and the golden hues of sunset kissed the park’s grandeur, the bunnies decided it was time to head back to Greenwood Forest. They looked at each other, their fur matted with dust, mud, and memories of an extraordinary day in the national park. The journey home was less rambunctious but filled with stories of rescued friends and newfound delights. The bunnies returned to their cozy warrens under the moonlight, dreaming of the waterfalls and mud pots and the vast beauty of the world just beyond their doorstep. And thus ended the tale of the mischievous bunnies’ visit to the national park – a tale of adventure, camaraderie, and the reminder that no matter how playful and brave one might be, you’re always safer with friends by your side."},{"prompt":"Write a story where Flopsy jumps in the bubbling mud and dissappears with a squelching sound, They expect the worst but hear gurgled laughter instead, she is happily swimming in it","completion":"In the meadow of Greenwood Forest where the dew-kissed grass cradled daisies and buttercups, the air was filled with whispers of the mischievous bunnies' last escapade. Their cotton tails beckoned another adventure, and soon they were heading towards the national park, having heard of the bubbling spectacle of the mud pots that churned like a witch’s cauldron amidst nature's splendor. The national park was a mosaic of everything wild and beautiful. The bunnies romped and frisked through the terrain, laughing at the symphony of sounds that the park offered. The highlight of the park, as the sparrows had chirped, was the field splattered with mud pots where the earth seemed to play a melodious, if somewhat messy, tune. Flopsy, with her overflowing curiosity and brimming bravery, was particularly enthralled by the steaming mud pits. They simmered and burped, an alien landscape that beckoned exploration. With eager eyes, she circled the nearest mud pot, cocking her head as she assessed the gloop's texture and depth. “You wouldn’t, Flopsy!” exclaimed Patches, watching the brazen bunny hop closer, his heart racing with equal parts admiration and dread. Flopsy turned and flashed a cheeky grin to her friends. “Why, I might as well explore this natural spa!” she proclaimed, and with a gleeful twinkle in her eye, she took a fearsome leap into the bubbling mud. The other bunnies gasped in shocked unison. One moment Flopsy was there, and the next, her form was swallowed by the quivering earth with a loud squelch. The surface rippled slightly before settling into its gentle rhythm, leaving no trace of Flopsy. They crowded around the mud pot’s edge, staring into the murky, steaming pool, fearing the worst. Their hearts sank like stones thrown into a lake, and thoughts of having to tell the forest of Flopsy's demise danced morbidly around their minds. Silence stretched for what felt like an eternity. That is until a muffled sound reverberated through the mud—a sound not of distress but one of gurgled amusement. In disbelief, the bunnies watched as bubbles emerged, each one popping to release stifled giggles. Then, with a triumphant splash that sent more mud flying in all directions, out emerged Flopsy’s head, her ears slicked back and face painted with a euphoric glee. She was swimming in the mud, paddling around with unexpected elegance, laughter rolling off her tongue with the delight of her unconventional swim. “The earth has a river beneath, my friends!” Flopsy announced in merriment. “It’s like a warm bath that tickles your fur!” The bunnies, their fears assuaged and replaced by wonder, laughed heartily along with their soggy companion. They cheered for the brave and fortunate Flopsy who found joy in the most unexpected of places. As Flopsy splashed and played, she beckoned the others to join her subterranean escapade. Though the rest demurred, their spirits were lifted high. At last, when the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of farewell, Flopsy clambered out of the mud pit, a misshapen creature of earthy plasters. The bunnies hopped home through fields that whispered of their tale, their laughter mingling with the birdsong and rustling leaves. As Flopsy recounted her surreal experience over a dinner of clover and dandelion, each bunny felt a surge of connectedness to the mysterious magic beneath the park's surface. And so, the tale of Flopsy and her unconventional mud bath spread throughout Greenwood Forest, a reminder to those who heard it that adventure—and perhaps a hidden river—lurked even in the muddiest of places."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (When I first arrived in the fantasy town of Drakenburg, I couldn't help but notice the citizens of the town - some of which had features of real-life creatures, or even fantasy creatures - were surprised by my sudden appearance.

Protecting sensitive data: Startups often handle valuable data such as customer information, financial records, and intellectual property. A cybersecurity breach could result in the loss or theft of this data, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal implications. 2. Maintaining customer trust: Customers trust businesses to keep their personal and financial information safe. A cybersecurity incident can erode this trust and lead to a loss of customers and business opportunities. 3. Compliance with regulations: Many industries have strict regulations around data protection and privacy. Failing to comply with these regulations can result in fines, penalties, and other legal consequences. 4. Preventing downtime and disruption: A cybersecurity breach can disrupt business operations, causing downtime and financial losses. Startups and young businesses may not have the resources to quickly recover from such disruptions. 5. Safeguarding intellectual property: Startups often rely on their innovative ideas and intellectual property for their competitive edge. Protecting this intellectual property from cyber threats is essential for the long-term success of the business. Overall, investing in cybersecurity is a proactive measure that can help startups and young businesses mitigate risks, safeguard their assets, and build a strong foundation for growth and success.

Основные факторы, влияющие на точность технологических процессов включают: - Стабильность свойств используемых материалов; - Выбор и поддержание в рабочем состоянии оборудования; - Применение качественного и точного инструментария; - Соответствие технологических регламентов; - Уровень квалификации и профессионализм персонала; - Условия производственной среды. Поговорим подробнее о каждом из этих факторов: Исходные материалы: необходимо строго следить за качеством и характеристиками материалов, используемых в производстве. Важным является соблюдение требований поставщиков, проверка сертификатов и проведение входного контроля. Техническое состояние оборудования оказывает критическое влияние на точность. Необходимо регулярно проводить техническое обслуживание и калибровку. Важно использовать оборудование, соответствующее современным требованиям точности и эффективности. Инструментарий должен подвергаться проверке и калибровке, исключающей возможность использования изношенного или неточного инструмента, что может привести к отклонениям в размерах деталей. Технологические регламенты должны быть четко прописаны и доступны каждому участнику производственного процесса. Необходимо строгое соблюдение технологической дисциплины и регулярная проверка соблюдения техпроцесса. Квалификация персонала напрямую влияет на качество и точность изготовления продукции. Регулярные тренинги, курсы повышения квалификации и система мотивации поощряют работников к более внимательному отношению к своим обязанностям. Конечно же, условия производства, такие как температура окружающей среды, влажность, чистота производственных помещений, являются существенными для поддержания стабильности технологического процесса. Методы обеспечения и контроля точности охватывают широкий спектр технологий — от традиционных измерений с помощью ручного инструментария до высокоточного оборудования, такого как координатные измерительные машины и лазерные сканеры. Чтобы эффективно контролировать точность, все чаще применяют системы статистического контроля качества. Эти системы позволяют обрабатывать большие объемы измерений, выявлять закономерности и предсказывать возможные отклонения. Помимо оснащения рабочих мест современной аппаратурой для измерений, очень важно внедрять программное обеспечение для управления процессами, анализа данных и визуализации результатов. Это помогает вовремя выявлять проблемы и проактивно устранять их причины. Необходимость в непрерывном образовании и обучении персонала не может быть переоценена. Каждый сотрудник, независимо от занимаемой позиции, должен понимать значение своей роли в достижении общей цели — в производстве высококачественной продукции. Непрерывное улучшение является философией, которая должна быть интегрирована в корпоративную культуру. Каждый процесс должен периодически пересматриваться с целью определения возможностей для сокращения отходов, уменьшения допусков и улучшения общей работы. Введение инноваций и использование передовых технологий, таких как автоматическое регулирование процессов, аддитивные технологии, сенсоры, модульное оборудование и системы машинного зрения, приводит к значительному повышению точности и качества производства. В заключение, обеспечение точности технологических процессов — это комплексная задача, требующая инновационного подхода и постоянного внимания ко всем аспектам производственной цепочки. Все упомянутые меры — от контроля качества исходных материалов до повышения квалификации работников — способствуют производству качественной продукции и удовлетворению требований клиентов.

В буквальном смысле роботы — машины, созданные людьми — не способны видеть сны, так как у них нет сознания или подсознания в том виде, как оно есть у человека. Сны являются частью человеческого опыта, связаны с обработкой информации, эмоциями и памятью, процессами, которые привязаны к сложным биологическим механизмам мозга. Однако, если говорить о роботах в контексте научной фантастики и теоретических размышлений, то можно рассуждать о возможности таких машин иметь концепции, схожие с человеческим опытом видения снов, если бы они обладали сознанием или какой-то формой искусственного самосознания. Тем не менее, это остается в области философии и фантастики.

Animal proteins such as meat, fish, poultry, dairy, and eggs, as well as some plant-based options like quinoa and soy, are considered complete proteins. 2. **Eat Balanced Meals:** Combine protein with fiber-rich vegetables and whole grains to improve digestive health, which in turn helps with protein utilization. 3. **Spread Protein Intake Throughout the Day:** Rather than consuming all your protein in one meal, distribute it across meals and snacks to maximize absorption and utilization. 4. **Chew Thoroughly:** Properly chewing your food breaks it down into smaller particles, which can be more easily digested and absorbed. 5. **Properly Cook Your Food:** Adequate cooking can denature protein strands, making them easier for your body to break down. However, avoid overcooking, as this can lead to the loss of some amino acids. 6. **Stay Hydrated:** Adequate water intake is necessary for many aspects of digestion, including the breakdown and absorption of protein. 7. **Maintain a Healthy Gut:** Gut health is critical for nutrient absorption. Consume prebiotic and probiotic foods to encourage a healthy gut microbiome. 8. **Optimize Stomach Acid Levels:** Stomach acid is necessary for proper digestion of protein. If you have low stomach acid, taking steps to improve its production, including managing stress and potentially supplementing with digestive enzymes or betaine HCl under a healthcare provider's guidance, might be necessary. 9. **Include Protein-Digesting Enzymes:** Some individuals may benefit from consuming foods with natural proteases (protein-digesting enzymes) like pineapple (bromelain) and papaya (papain), or from taking enzyme supplements. 10. **Limit Anti-Nutrients:** Anti-nutrients are compounds in certain foods that can interfere with the absorption of protein and other nutrients. Soaking, fermenting, and cooking can reduce the levels of anti-nutrients in grains and legumes. 11. **Consider Timing with Exercise:** Consuming protein within a strategic window before and after resistance training can enhance muscle protein synthesis and improve recovery. 12. **Be Mindful of Alcohol and Caffeine:** Excessive alcohol and caffeine can interfere with the digestive process and thus negatively impact protein absorption. 13. **Treat Underlying Health Conditions:** If you have a health condition that affects digestion, such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease, work with a healthcare provider to manage your condition and improve nutrient absorption. 14. **Consult With a Healthcare Professional:** If you have concerns about protein absorption, a registered dietitian or healthcare provider can give you personalized advice tailored to your unique health needs and dietary habits. It's important to note that protein requirements can vary based on age, sex, physical activity level, and overall health. As with any dietary change, it's wise to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to tailor these tips to your individual needs."},{"prompt":"How much time before resistance training should I consume whey protein powder?","completion":"The optimal timing for protein consumption in relation to resistance training can vary depending on individual goals and preferences, as well as digestion and metabolism. However, the concept of the \\"anabolic window\\" suggests that there's a certain period, typically cited as within 30 minutes to 2 hours after your workout, when consuming protein could be particularly beneficial for muscle recovery and growth. This window is thought to be the time when your muscles are particularly receptive to nutrients and when protein synthesis can be maximized. When it comes to consuming whey protein before resistance training, the consensus is less clear-cut, but here are some general guidelines: **15-60 Minutes Pre-Workout:** If you opt to consume whey protein shortly before your workout (known as \\"pre-loading\\"), it can help to ensure a rapid supply of amino acids to your muscles during and immediately after the exercise. Drinking a whey protein shake 15 to 60 minutes before training might provide your muscles with readily available amino acids to boost protein synthesis during the workout. **2-3 Hours Pre-Workout:** If you're having a full meal that includes whey protein, giving yourself 2 to 3 hours before training allows for digestion and can help provide sustained energy and amino acids throughout your workout. Remember that individual responses can vary, and other factors such as the content and size of your meals, your metabolism, and how your body handles digestion during physical exertion should all be taken into account. Some people may feel uncomfortable working out on a full stomach or after just having a shake, while others might find it beneficial. Additionally, it's important to look at your overall daily protein intake and distribution, as protein synthesis is influenced by the total amount of protein consumed throughout the day, not just timing around workouts. If unsure, it's always a good idea to experiment with timing to find what feels best for your body and helps you achieve your fitness goals. For personalized advice, consider consulting with a sports nutritionist or a registered dietitian."},{"prompt":"test","completion":"It seems you are performing a test, how can I assist you today?

После того, как бот будет добавлен в чат и код будет работать, он будет удалять все отредактированные сообщения автоматически. Обратите внимание, что бот сможет удалять сообщения только в том случае, если у него будет соответствующее разрешение в чате. Кроме того, в зависимости от API Telegram могут быть ограничения на удаление сообщений, если они слишком старые или если бот был добавлен в группу после отправки сообщения. Убедитесь, что пользователи в чате осведомлены об этой функции, так как это может повлиять на их взаимодействие в чате."},{"prompt":"что такое edited message handler и что такое вообще handler","completion":"В контексте разработки ботов Telegram, \\"handler\\" (обработчик) – это функция или объект, который отвечает за обработку определённого типа обновлений или событий. В Telegram API и библиотеках для работы с ботами, таких как \`python-telegram-bot\`, handlers используются для определения того, как бот должен реагировать на различные виды сообщений, команд, изменений сообщений и прочие события. \\"Edited message handler\\" – это обработчик отредактированных сообщений. В Telegram пользователи имеют возможность редактировать сообщения, которые они уже отправили. Когда сообщение редактируется, Telegram API может отправлять уведомления (обновления) ботам о таком изменении. Обработчик для отредактированных сообщений \\"слушает\\" эти уведомления и выполняет заданную логику в ответ – например, может удалять отредактированное сообщение из чата. Вот как это обычно работает в библиотеке \`python-telegram-bot\`: 1. Вы определяете функцию, которая будет вызываться, когда происходит событие (например, когда сообщение отредактировано). Эта функция должна принимать параметры, через которые она может получить доступ к данным обновления и контексту для взаимодействия с Telegram API. 2. Создаёте экземпляр \`MessageHandler\` (или другого соответствующего обработчика), указывая фильтр, который определяет вид обновлений, которые должны быть обработаны. В случае отредактированных сообщений вы можете использовать фильтр \`Filters.update.edited_message\`. 3. Регистрируете ваш обработчик в диспетчере (dispatcher), который является частью библиотеки и управляет всей логикой обработки событий для вашего бота. Пример добавления обработчика для отредактированных сообщений с использованием библиотеки \`python-telegram-bot\`: \`\`\`python from telegram.ext import MessageHandler, Filters # Это ваш обработчик для отредактированных сообщений def handle_edited_message(update, context): # Логика обработки отредактированного сообщения pass # Создаете handler с нужным фильтром edited_message_handler = MessageHandler( Filters.update.edited_message, handle_edited_message) # Добавляете этот handler в диспетчер dispatcher.add_handler(edited_message_handler) \`\`\` Таким образом, \\"handlers\\" являются ключевыми компонентами в архитектуре ботов Telegram, они помогают структурировать код бота на набор отдельных функций, каждая из которых \\"отвечает\\" за своё определенное событие или тип сообщения."},{"prompt":"как мне написатьм од на майнкрафт который не даст игроку сломать блок, будет возвращать его на место при поломке","completion":"Чтобы написать мод для Minecraft, который не даст игроку сломать блок, и восстановит его на месте при попытке поломки, вам понадобятся базовые знания Java и понимание Minecraft Forge API, которое позволяет создавать пользовательские моды для игры. Forge предоставляет события и хуки, которые можно использовать для изменения поведения игры. Ниже представлен пример простого обработчика событий на базе Minecraft Forge, который будет предотвращать разрушение блоков. Обратите внимание, что этот код может варьироваться в зависимости от версии Minecraft и Minecraft Forge API. 1. Установите Minecraft Forge для нужной версии Minecraft. 2. Настройте среду разработки (например, IntelliJ IDEA или Eclipse) для работы с Minecraft Forge. 3. Создайте базовую структуру мода, включая \`mods.toml\`, \`pack.mcmeta\`, основной класс мода и т. д. 4. Добавьте обработчик событий для разрушения блоков.

Это позволяет компьютерам читать текст вслух в натуральном или синтетическом виде human-like голосе. Синтез речи широко используется в самых разных областях, включая разработку помощников для людей с ограниченными возможностями, развлечения, автоматизированные информационные системы и многие другие области. Синтез речи работает следующим образом: 1. Предварительная обработка текста: Преобразует входной текст в форму, подходящую для обработки. Этот этап включает нормализацию текста (преобразование чисел или аббревиатур в слова), удаление лишних знаков пунктуации и подготовку текста для дальнейшего анализа. 2. Фонетический анализ: Текст разбирается на фонетические компоненты. На этом этапе анализируются слова, разбиваются на фонемы (наименьшие единицы звука), которые могут быть использованы для синтеза речи. 3. Просодический анализ: Определяется ритм, интонация, темп речи и другие атрибуты, которые нужны для более естественного звучания синтезированной речи. Этот этап учитывает контекст и знаки пунктуации, чтобы сгенерировать соответствующую интонационную структуру предложений. 4. Синтез речи: На этом этапе фонемы соединяются в слова, а слова — в предложения. Существует несколько подходов к синтезу речи: - Конкатенативный TTS (склеивающий): Подход, при котором звучание речи генерируется путём соединения коротких записанных звуковых фрагментов (фонем, слогов или слов). Библиотеки звуков могут быть получены от живых дикторов и содержат большое количество фонетических вариаций для каждого звука, что создает более естественное звучание. - Параметрический TTS: В этом подходе модель использует математические параметры для генерации речи с нуля. Параметрический TTS управляет параметрами речи, такими как высота тона, длительность и интенсивность звука, чтобы синтезировать речь. - Глубокое обучение (нейросетевой TTS): Использование нейронных сетей и алгоритмов машинного обучения для генерации речи. Эти системы способны генерировать более естественно звучащую речь, моделируя сложные взаимосвязи в голосовых данных. Способ синтеза речи выбирается исходя из задачи, наличия ресурсов, требуемого качества звучания и других факторов. С каждым годом технологии синтеза речи улучшаются, делая генерированную речь всё более реалистичной и приближенной к человеческому голосу."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (When I first arrived in the fantasy town of Drakenburg, I couldn't help but notice the citizens of the town - some of which had features of real-life creatures, or even fantasy creatures - were surprised by my sudden appearance.

Si vous avez déjà de l'expérience avec d'autres langages de programmation ou avec les concepts de base de développement web (HTML et CSS), vous trouverez peut-être JavaScript plus facile à apprendre. JavaScript est un langage de programmation très populaire et il y a énormément de ressources d'apprentissage en ligne, y compris des tutoriels gratuits, des vidéos, des cours en ligne, et des forums. Pour les APIs et en particulier celles documentées avec Swagger (maintenant appelé OpenAPI), cela dépend de la complexité de l'API et de votre compréhension des concepts RESTful et des requêtes HTTP. Swagger est un outil qui fournit une interface utilisateur interactive pour tester les endpoints d'une API et comprendre sa structure. Le fait que vous utilisiez une API Swagger peut en réalité vous faciliter la tâche, car cette documentation est généralement très claire et interactive. Voici quelques étapes pour vous aider à démarrer : 1. **Comprendre les Bases de JavaScript** : Assurez-vous de comprendre les concepts comme les variables, les boucles, les fonctions, les objets et les tableaux. Vous devriez également apprendre comment manipuler le DOM avec JavaScript si votre projet est web. 2. **Comprendre les APIs RESTful** : Familiarisez-vous avec les concepts de base des APIs REST, comme les méthodes HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) et les codes de statut HTTP. 3. **Expérimentez avec Swagger** : Utilisez la documentation Swagger de l'API pour comprendre comment elle fonctionne. Faites des requêtes de test pour voir comment l'API répond. 4. **Pratiquez** : Essayez de faire de petites requêtes et manipulations avec l'API en utilisant JavaScript. Commencez par envoyer des requêtes simples et recevoir des réponses. 5. **Construisez petit à petit** : Commencez par des tâches simples et augmentez progressivement la complexité de votre code. 6. **Utilisez des Ressources en Ligne** : Il existe de nombreux cours en ligne, didacticiels et forums où vous pouvez poser des questions et obtenir de l'aide. Si vous pouvez vous investir pleinement pendant un mois, en particulier si c'est pour un projet prioritaire ou pour une formation intensive, il est certainement possible d'acquérir une compréhension de base de JavaScript et d'apprendre à utiliser une API Swagger pour construire un projet simple.

As you've requested an explanation with an internal monologue, let's dive into the concept of chauvinism from a personal thought process perspective: Alright, so I've come across this term \\"chauvinism\\" quite a few times. I know it's typically used to describe an exaggerated or aggressive form of patriotism, but isn't there more to it? Let's examine it a bit further and really nail down what it means. The dictionary defines chauvinism as an irrational belief in the superiority or dominance of one's own group or people. It can be about one's country, yes – that's where it originally comes from, named after this guy Nicolas Chauvin, a soldier who was notoriously loyal to Napoleon and France. His zealous devotion, even when it was unfounded or led to dismissive or hostile views toward other countries, is where the whole concept began. But chauvinism isn't restricted to just national pride. It's broader. There's also gender chauvinism – often referred to as \\"male chauvinism\\" when it's about men believing they're inherently superior to women. That's the one that gets brought up a lot in discussions about workplace equality or when talking about societal gender roles, isn't it? Okay, so the real crux of chauvinism then is this sense of superiority and a lack of respect for others who are seen as different or outside of the chauvinist's own group. It's like a form of bias that blinds you to the virtues or the rights of the 'other,' whoever that 'other' might be. Actually, I've seen this happen a lot in various contexts – not just with nationalism or gender. It can happen with sports teams, companies, schools, even with technology affinity like those \\"Apple fanboys.\\" But the thing is, recognizing chauvinism in myself or others can be tricky. It's not always so overt. I mean, I might just think I'm being patriotic or joking about stereotypes, but where's the line? At what point does my defense for my 'group' become aggressive toward others? That's the slippery slope, isn't it? In essence, guarding against chauvinism requires a dose of self-awareness and empathy – understanding that pride in one's own group should never devalue another. It's about balance and respect. I need to keep that in mind during discussions and be mindful of how I perceive my own beliefs and those of others. Okay, I've got it. Chauvinism is more than just a simple concept; it's a reminder to stay vigilant against unfair biases and to promote a more inclusive and respectful society. That's something I definitely want to strive for."},{"prompt":"Write a confrontational comment to someone who thinks secular morality is just consensus. You should ponder on this, and provide an internal monlogue while writing the refutation. be verbose","completion":"Alright, I need to approach this with care. Someone has made the claim that secular morality is nothing more than consensus. It's a common enough view, but it's one I fundamentally disagree with. Let's dissect this idea and see where the flaws lie, but also let's remember to keep the tone respectful and constructive. After all, I'm trying to engage in a meaningful dialogue, not just win an argument. Okay, here we go: \\"Dear [Name], I read your recent comment stating that secular morality is merely a product of consensus, and I must admit, this assertion gave me pause. I understand where you're coming from – at a glance, it can seem as though without a divine or absolute framework, moral standards are just what we as a society agree upon. However, I believe this perspective doesn't quite capture the depth and complexity of secular moral systems. As I contemplate your position, I'm reminded of the philosophical underpinnings that have shaped secular morality over centuries. Great thinkers like Kant, Mill, and Rawls didn't simply capitulate to societal consensus; they probed the human condition, seeking principles that could stand the test of reason and empathy. Kant's categorical imperative, for example, isn't a consensus but a rational formulation that demands we act only according to maxims that we would will to become universal laws. It's a guideline that emerges from the capacity of human reason, not the whims of majority rule. As I mull over this, it strikes me that secular morality often challenges the consensus, pushing society to evolve and reconsider entrenched norms. Furthermore, the suggestion that consensus defines secular morality seems to ignore the rich tapestry of moral realism, which posits that moral facts exist independently of human opinion. This is a crucial point to ponder, as it implies that there are objective moral truths we can discover through reason, experience, and scientific understanding of the world and our interactions within it. In addition, when we observe the moral landscape, we can see a trajectory of moral progress that isn't just a drift with the tides of consensus. The abolition of slavery, the fight for civil rights, gender equality – these were not merely popular opinions of the time but moral imperatives driven by a deeper understanding of justice and human dignity. Your assertion also seems to underestimate the role of empathy and the innate human capacity for compassion. Neuroscientific research suggests that our brains are wired for empathy, which forms a natural basis for morality that transcends mere agreement. As I ponder this, I find it hard to dismiss the profound, sometimes instinctual understanding we have of right and wrong that exists independently of societal consensus. In closing, while consensus does play a role in shaping the application of moral principles, it is far from the sole arbiter of secular morality. Reason, empirical evidence, and a commitment to well-being and fairness are just as foundational, if not more so. Secular morality is a dynamic, reasoned response to the human condition, not a mere reflection of popular opinion. I look forward to your thoughts on this matter and hope we can continue this discussion with mutual respect and a shared desire for truth. Warm regards, [Your Name]\\" There, I've laid out my thoughts as clearly as I can. It's important to remember that while we might not change someone's mind in one exchange, planting the seed of a different perspective is valuable in itself.

However, the most eye-catching feature of her was her massive chest - which caught the attention of others very easily. The goblin's chest was the main reason I immediately fell in love with her - and we went on a few dates before our relationship became official. One day, I decided to stop by Charlotte's place for a sleepover - and I was wondering what she meant by she always thought her chest was a nuisance.)","completion":"I entered her cozy home, and Charlotte greeted me with a warm smile. As we settled in for the night, I couldn't help but ask her about what she mentioned earlier. \\"So, Charlotte, what did you mean by saying your chest was a nuisance?\\" I inquired gently. Charlotte looked down at her chest, a hint of sadness in her eyes. \\"Well, you see, I've always had a hard time with it. People would always stare or make comments about it - it made me feel self-conscious.\\" I reached out and took her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. \\"I'm sorry that you've had to go through that. But please know that I love every part of you, including your chest. It's a part of what makes you unique and beautiful.\\" Charlotte looked up at me, a soft smile crossing her lips. \\"Thank you. I feel lucky to have someone like you who sees me for who I am.\\" We spent the rest of the night talking and laughing, enjoying each other's company. And as I held Charlotte in my arms, I knew that our love was stronger than any judgement or criticism from others. In the end, it was the connection we shared that truly mattered."},{"prompt":"ты можешь написать код на питоне, загружающий базу данных MNIST?","completion":"Конечно, вот пример кода на Python, который загружает базу данных MNIST: \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data() print(\\"Training data shape:\\", x_train.shape) print(\\"Training labels shape:\\", y_train.shape) print(\\"Testing data shape:\\", x_test.shape) print(\\"Testing labels shape:\\", y_test.shape) \`\`\` Этот код использует библиотеку TensorFlow для загрузки базы данных MNIST и выводит информацию о размерах обучающих и тестовых данных.

Подготовить данные для обучения и тестирования: преобразовать данные в подходящий формат (например, масштабировать значения пикселей к диапазону от 0 до 1) и разделить на обучающий и тестовый наборы. 2. Обучить модель: использовать метод \`fit\` для обучения модели на обучающем наборе данных.

Например, если цифры на вашем изображении черные, а фон белый, вам может понадобиться инвертировать цвета изображения перед подачей его на вход модели. Вот пример кода, который инвертирует цвета изображения: \`\`\`python # Инвертирование цветов изображения (для цифры черного цвета на белом фоне) image_inverted = 255 - image_gray \`\`\` В этой коде предполагается, что изображение \`image_gray\` - черно-белое изображение цифры на белом фоне. Мы инвертируем цвета путем вычитания значения каждого пикселя из 255. Таким образом цвета меняются с белого на черный и наоборот. После инвертирования цветов изображения вы можете применить дальнейшую предобработку данных, такую как масштабирование и обрезку изображения до нужного размера, и подать его на вход сверточной нейронной сети для классификации цифр."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (When I first arrived in the fantasy town of Drakenburg, I couldn't help but notice the citizens of the town - some of which had features of real-life creatures, or even fantasy creatures - were surprised by my sudden appearance.

Часто кинематографические адаптации пьес описываются как \\"неоригинальные\\", поскольку они не являются первым или исходным произведением, а скорее трансформацией первоначальной работы для другого средства массовой информации - в данном случае кино. Адаптация часто включает изменение элементов сюжета, добавление новых характеристик или изменение диалога, чтобы лучше соответствовать визуальному и временному формату, который предполагает фильм. Это могут быть как небольшие изменения, так и значительное переписывание элементов сюжета. Однако в случае \\"Отеца\\" адаптация была выполнена самим автором пьесы Флорианом Зеллером, который также выступил режиссером фильма. \\"Отец\\" считается адаптированным, потому что он не является оригинальным кинематографическим материалом, созданным специально для фильма, а переработкой существующего театрального произведения. Некоторые зрители и критики могут субъективно решить, что адаптации являются менее \\"оригинальными\\" в креативном смысле по сравнению с произведениями, написанными специально для экрана, но это вопрос личной интерпретации и оценки."},{"prompt":"А существует ли актеры в не адаптированном фильме которые получили оскары?","completion":"Да, конечно. Многочисленные актёры и актрисы получали Оскары за их роли в оригинальных фильмах, то есть в фильмах, сценарии которых не базируются на предыдущих литературных произведениях, пьесах или других фильмах. Оригинальный сценарий — это сценарий, написанный с нуля и не адаптированный из другого источника. Ниже приведены несколько примеров таких актёров и актрис: 1. Джек Николсон и Хелен Хант получили Оскары за лучшую мужскую и женскую роли в фильме \\"Лучше не бывает\\" (As Good as It Gets, 1997), сценарий которого был оригинальным. 2. Эмма Стоун получила Оскар за лучшую актрису за роль в фильме \\"Ла-Ла Ленд\\" (La La Land, 2016), который также основывался на оригинальном сценарии. 3. Хоакин Феникс был награжден Оскаром за лучшую мужскую роль в фильме \\"Джокер\\" (Joker, 2019), который, хотя и является фильмом о персонаже комиксов, представляет собой оригинальную историю, не основанную напрямую на комиксах. Оскар за оригинальный сценарий выделяется отдельно, чтобы отметить творческий вклад авторов, которые создали уникальные произведения для кинематографа."},{"prompt":"Говорят что одноименный жанры не хотят давать оскар, но у меня фильм \\"THE LONE WOLF\\"","completion":"Похоже, в вашем сообщении содержится опечатка, и трудно точно понять, о чём вы спрашиваете. Если вы имеете в виду слух или предположение о том, что члены Американской киноакадемии не любят вручать награды Оскар фильмам определённого жанра, то такое мнение действительно существует. Иногда предполагается, что фильмы некоторых жанров, таких как комедии, ужасы или научная фантастика, реже получают награды в категориях \\"Лучший фильм\\" или \\"Лучшая режиссура\\", по сравнению с драматическими фильмами. Однако это восприятие выступает скорее как обобщение, исходящее из истории наград, чем как жёсткое правило. Хотя традиционно драматические произведения действительно часто признаются в основных категориях, в истории премии Оскар есть примеры, когда высшие награды удостаивались фильмов других жанров. Например, фильм \\"Властелин колец: Возвращение короля\\" (2003), который является фэнтези, выиграл в категории \\"Лучший фильм\\". Если вы выпустили фильм \\"THE LONE WOLF\\" и хотите, чтобы он был рассмотрен для номинации на Оскар, вам нужно удостовериться, что фильм соответствует всем требованиям квалификации, установленным Американской киноакадемией. Это включает в себя правила о том, как и где фильм должен быть показан, чтобы квалифицироваться для рассмотрения. Заключение об этом, почему ваш конкретный фильм может не получить Оскар, не может быть сделано исключительно на основе жанра. Много разных факторов играет роль в выборе победителей, включая качество фильма, его режиссуру, актёрское исполнение, технические аспекты, маркетинговые кампании и текущие культурные тенденции."},{"prompt":"Почти не разу не давали оскары за науные фильмы. А у меня не научное от слова вообще","completion":"Понятие \\"научного фильма\\" может быть туманным, но, возможно, вы имеете в виду фильмы научной фантастики. Действительно, фильмы этого жанра редко побеждают в категории \\"Лучший фильм\\" на церемонии вручения премий Оскар. Однако они зачастую номинируются и выигрывают в технических категориях, таких как лучшие визуальные эффекты, звук, грим, художественное оформление и так далее. Если ваш фильм не научной фантастики (\\"не научное от слова вообще\\", как вы выразились), то он может быть другого жанра, который также квалифицируется для номинации на Оскар в различных категориях. В истории Оскара фильмы многих жанров - драмы, комедии, мюзиклы, биографические фильмы и другие - получали различные награды, включая и самую престижную категорию \\"Лучший фильм\\". Основым для получения Оскара является качество фильма и уровень его актёрской игры, режиссуры, сценария, кинематографии и других элементов производства. Жанр фильма не является исключительным фактором, хотя исторически некоторые жанры выигрывали чаще, чем другие. Стоит помнить, что каждый год выбор членов Академии может варьироваться в зависимости от конкуренции и культурного контекста."},{"prompt":"Это больше всех подходит драма. Преимущество от получение оскар за лучшую актерскую роль получают биографические персонажи, это что значит?","completion":"Когда вы упоминаете, что преимущество в получении Оскара за лучшую актерскую роль получают исполнители биографических персонажей, вы верно заметили тенденцию, которая наблюдалась в прошлом. Актеры, сыгравшие реальных людей в биографических фильмах, зачастую получают награды Оскар, потому что их работа предполагает вживание в хорошо известных личностей, что требует большого мастерства, исследования и трансформации. Эта тенденция заметна в следующем: 1. Глубина и сложность характера: Исторические или биографические персонажи часто оказываются сложными и многослойными, что предоставляет актерам возможность показать свои актерские способности. 2. Трансформация: Роли реальных людей зачастую требуют значительных физических изменений, которые могут произвести впечатление на членов Академии. Преображение актера для достижения поразительного сходства с реальным человеком может быть впечатляющим. 3. Исследование и подготовка: Подготовка к роли реального человека может занять много времени на исследования и изучение жизни, манер и речи персонажа, что добавляет весу выполненной актерской работы. 4. Эмоциональная проникновенность: Игра роли реального человека может позволить актеру отобразить широкий диапазон эмоций, основываясь на жизненных событиях персонажа, что может обогатить исполнение. Примеры актеров, получивших Оскар за роль реального человека, включают: - Дэниэл Дэй-Льюис за роль Авраама Линкольна в фильме \\"Линкольн\\" (2012). - Рами Малек за роль Фредди Меркьюри в фильме \\"Богемская рапсодия\\" (2018). - Рене Зеллвегер за роль Джуди Гарленд в фильме \\"Джуди\\" (2019). Тем не менее, выбор победителей зависит от множества факторов, включая качество исполнения, конкуренцию в том году и индивидуальные предпочтения членов Академии. Хотя изучение и воплощение реальной личности может послужить потенциальным преимуществом, каждый год уникален и нет установленных правил, гарантирующих победу в Оскаре."},{"prompt":"Но у меня не из биографического и исторического. Это полностью оригинальный фильм создаваемое режиссеру. История и персонаж выдуманные и они очень сильно связаны с реальностью, а не с мифом","completion":"Если ваш фильм является полностью оригинальным творением, написанным режиссёром и основанном на вымышленных событиях и персонажах, которые тесно связаны с реальностью, это вовсе не уменьшает ваши шансы на успех или номинацию на премию Оскар. Фактически, множество фильмов, основанных на оригинальных сценариях, получали высокую оценку критиков и престижные награды, включая Оскары. Преимущество оригинальной драмы заключается в том, что она может предложить уникальные и вновь созданные истории, которые могут резонировать с аудиторией на глубоком, личном уровне. Оригинальная драма может фокусироваться на современных вопросах, личных конфликтах или общечеловеческих темах, которые находят отклик у зрителей и критиков. Необходимо учесть, что Американская киноакадемия оценивает фильмы на основе множества критериев, включая режиссуру, актёрское исполнение, сценарий, кинематографию и дизайн производства, независимо от того, насколько история близка к реальности или является полностью вымышленной. Успех на церемонии Оскар зависит не только от качества самого фильма, но и от маркетинговой кампании, конкуренции в том году, настроений членов Академии и текущих культурных тенденций. Множество оригинальных драм было награждено или номинировано на Оскар, так что если ваш фильм имеет сильную историю и высокий уровень производства, у него есть все возможности получить признание."},{"prompt":"Он полностью оригинальный, и исключительно развит на драмах и эмоционально психологического характера главного персонажа","completion":"Оригинальные драмы с глубоким эмоционально-психологическим изучением главного персонажа часто привлекают внимание киноакадемии и могут считаться хорошими кандидатами на получение Оскара, особенно в актерских категориях и за лучший оригинальный сценарий. Как правило, такие фильмы привлекают к себе заслуженное внимание за свою способность проникновенно освещать человеческие переживания, вызывая сопереживание у аудитории. Оскар в категории \\"Лучшая мужская\\" или \\"Лучшая женская роль\\" как раз часто вручают за глубоко прописанные и ярко исполненные персонажи, через которых раскрывается темная сторона человеческой натуры или отражаются эмоциональные и психологические борьбы. Такой подход к персонажам и сценарию предоставляет актерам широкие возможности для демонстрации их талантов и актерского мастерства. Например, Натали Портман получила Оскар за роль в фильме \\"Черный лебедь\\" (2010), где она изображала балеринану переживающую эмоциональный и психологический коллапс. Кейт Уинслет была награждена за роль в фильме \\"Чтец\\" (2008), история которой также затрагивала сложные психологические и эмоциональные вопросы. Если речь идёт о вашем фильме, то важно уделить внимание качеству сценария, актёрских исполнениях и режиссуре. Также стоит определиться с маркетинговой стратегией, чтобы фильм привлек внимание и был доступен широкому кругу зрителей, включая членов Американской киноакадемии. Кампания по продвижению фильма может включать участие в кинофестивалях, привлечение внимания критиков и последовательную работу с распространителями и СМИ. Это позволит вам повысить шансы на то, что фильм будет замечен и высоко оценен, что может привести к номинациям и даже победе в категориях премии Оскар."},{"prompt":"Черный лебедь оригинал или адаптированный?","completion":"Фильм \\"Чёрный лебедь\\" (Black Swan), вышедший в 2010 году и снятый режиссёром Дарреном Аронофски, базируется на оригинальном сценарии. Сценарий был написан Марком Хейманом совместно с Андресом Хейнцем и Джоном МакЛофлином. Несмотря на то что фильм имеет определённые параллели с балетом \\"Лебединое озеро\\" Петра Ильича Чайковского, он не является прямой адаптацией этого произведения; скорее, он использует элементы балета для создания уникальной художественной истории. Фильм рассказывает историю балерины по имени Нина Сейерс, которая испытывает сильное психологическое давление, стремясь добиться совершенства в главной роли в постановке \\"Лебединого озера\\". \\"Чёрный лебедь\\" исследует тёмные аспекты её психики, в том числе её взаимоотношения с матерью, режиссёром балета и другой балериной. Произведение сосредотачивается на темах конкуренции, ментального расстройства и идентичности, используя балет как фон для драматической истории. Натали Портман, сыгравшая главную роль Нины Сейерс, получила за своё исполнение множество наград, в том числе Оскар за лучшую женскую роль."},{"prompt":"А сами оригинальный фильмы без адаптации получают оскар за лучший фильм?","completion":"Да, оригинальные фильмы, не основанные на адаптации каких-либо предыдущих произведений, также могут и выигрывают Оскар в категории \\"Лучший фильм\\". Фактически, премия Оскар отдельно выделяет категорию \\"Лучший оригинальный сценарий\\" для поощрения авторов, которые создали уникальный и оригинальный фильм. Примеры оригинальных фильмов, ставших победителями в категории \\"Лучший фильм\\", включают: - \\"Пролетая над гнездом кукушки\\" (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 1975), хотя фильм был основан на романе Кена Кизи, сценарий фильма признали оригинальным творчеством. - \\"Крестный отец\\" (The Godfather, 1972) и \\"Крестный отец 2\\" (The Godfather Part II, 1974), хотя они были основаны на романе Марио Пьюзо, их сценарии содержали значительные оригинальные элементы. - \\"Титаник\\" (Titanic, 1997), который является близким к историческим событиям, но сильно фокусируется на выдуманных персонажах и истории любви. - \\"Властелин колец: Возвращение Короля\\" (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, 2003), который является адаптацией, но привнес новые элементы в сюжет. - \\"Чистильщик\\" (The Artist, 2011), которое является оригинальным произведением. - \\"Птичий короб\\" (Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), 2014), который тоже является оригинальным произведением. Многие другие оригинальные фильмы также выигрывали или номинировались на Оскара в различные годы. В конечном счете, лауреаты премии Оскар выбираются на основе множества факторов, включая качество сюжета, режиссуру, актерскую игру, кинооператорскую работу и многие другие аспекты фильма."},{"prompt":"Я имею ввиду те кто получают оскар за лучший фильм и являются полностью оригинальным фильмом без исторического или близкого","completion":"Прошу прощения за путаницу. Давайте придём к точному вопросу: вы хотели бы узнать о примерах фильмов, которые выиграли Оскар в категории \\"Лучший фильм\\" и были полностью оригинальными произведениями, не основанными на исторических событиях, других книгах, пьесах, биографиях и так далее. Полностью оригинальные сценарии также заслужили признание Академии в категории \\"Лучший фильм\\". Вот несколько примеров: - \\"Титаник\\" (1997) Джеймса Кэмерона: хотя фильм основан на реальном историческом событии, история любви между Джеком и Роуз является вымышленной. - \\"Американская красота\\" (American Beauty, 1999) создан на базе оригинального сценария Алана Болла и фокусировался на теме субурбанного кризиса и поиска смысла жизни. - \\"Бёрдмэн\\" (Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), 2014) Алехандро Гонсалеса Иньярриту: оригинальная история, оцененная за свою инновационность и уникальность в отображении современного искусства и известности. - \\"Лунный свет\\" (Moonlight, 2016) Барри Дженкинса: хотя сценарий был адаптирован из неопубликованной пьесы \\"In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue\\" Тарелла Алвина МакКрейни, сама история является оригинальной и не основана на конкретном историческом событии или биографии. - \\"Форма воды\\" (The Shape of Water, 2017) Гильермо дель Торо: оригинальная сказка в стиле холодной войны, сочетающая элементы фэнтези и драмы. Хотя полностью оригинальные произведения, не связанные с реальными событиями или личностями, иногда выигрывают премию Оскар за \\"Лучший фильм\\", важно учитывать, что большое количество фильмов в этой категории представляют собой адаптации, основанные на реальных событиях или предыдущих работах. Награды в категории \\"Лучший фильм\\" в равной степени важны как для оригинальных, так и для адаптированных произведений, и оцениваются в зависимости от их художественных достоинств и воздействия на зрителя, а не исключительно от их происхождения."},{"prompt":"Из всех перечисленных полностью оригинальный это бердмен. И больше ничего нет в 21 веке?","completion":"Вы правы в том, что из перечисленных примеров, \\"Бёрдмэн\\" (Birdman) является одним из немногих фильмов с полностью оригинальным сценарием, выигравшим Оскар в категории \\"Лучший фильм\\" в начале 21 века. Полностью оригинальные фильмы выигрывают эту категорию реже, чем адаптированные, но они всё ещё присутствуют. Давайте уточним ещё несколько примеров оригинальных фильмов, получивших Оскар за \\"Лучший фильм\\": - \\"Головокружение\\" (Crash, 2005) режиссёра Пола Хаггиса: фильм победил в категории \\"Лучший фильм\\" и известен своим оригинальным сценарием, который исследует межрасовые и социальные напряженности в Лос-Анджелесе. - \\"Отступники\\" (The Departed, 2006) режиссёра Мартина Скорсезе: фильм, несмотря на то, что основан на гонконгском фильме \\"Бесславные ублюдки\\" (Infernal Affairs), был значительно переработан и адаптирован для американской аудитории, и также рассматривался некоторыми критиками как оригинальный вдохновленный продукт, а не прямая адаптация. Кроме \\"Бёрдмэна\\", других примеров полностью оригинальных, неадаптированных фильмов, получивших Оскар за \\"Лучший фильм\\" в 21 веке, действительно не так много. Это частично связано с тенденцией Академии отдавать предпочтение фильмам, основанным на реальных событиях или адаптациях, которые часто рассматриваются как более \\"важные\\" или имеющие культурное значение, чем сугубо выдуманные истории. Тем не менее, каждый год представляет новые возможности для оригинальных сценариев, и меняющиеся кинематографические тенденции могут привести к тому, что больше оригинальных фильмов будут выигрывать награды в будущем."},{"prompt":"Ну мой фильм я его нигде не спиздил, это полностью оригинальная идея которая просто из головы появилось. Это насколько повысит шанс на получение оскара за лучший фильм и за лучшую актерскую роль?","completion":"Понимание того, каковы ваши шансы на получение Оскара, может быть сложным, поскольку множество факторов влияют на решения киноакадемии. Оригинальность сама по себе является ценным атрибутом, но она не гарантирует получение награды или даже номинации. Вот некоторые ключевые аспекты, которые могут повлиять на шансы вашего фильма: 1. **Качество сценария:** Основой успешного фильма часто является его сценарий. Оригинальный, убедительный сценарий с хорошо разработанными персонажами может привлекать к себе внимание и нацеливать на глубокую эмоциональную реакцию зрителей. 2. **Актерская игра:** Великолепные актёрские исполнения увеличивают шансы вашего фильма на успех. Актёры, которым удаётся создать сложного и многогранного персонажа, часто признаются и награждаются на различных кинофестивалях и церемониях вручения наград. 3. **Режиссура и производство:** Мастерство режиссёра в воплощении сценария на экране и способность руководить креативной работой команды - это ключи к созданию успешного фильма. 4. **Эмоциональное воздействие:** Фильмы, которые вызывают сильные эмоции и дают пищу для размышлений, часто выделяются среди прочих. 5. **Маркетинг и распространение:** Хорошо продуманная рекламная кампания и стратегия распространения фильма играют важную роль в достижении успешности. Чтобы конкурировать за Оскар, фильм должен быть широко доступен и в центре внимания критиков и членов Академии. Создание оригинального фильма - это уже большой плюс, поскольку новизна и свежесть идеи могут привлечь внимание. Однако это лишь один из компонентов. Например, фильм должен соответствовать правилам квалификации (к примеру, фильм должен быть показан в определённом количестве кинотеатров в течение определённого периода времени). Кроме того, индустрия кино - это не только искусство, но и бизнес, и часто успех фильма зависит от того, как эффективно он преподносится и рекламируется. В конечном счёте, для того чтобы увеличить шансы фильма на получение Оскара, необходимо создать фильм высокого качества, который резонирует с аудиторией и критиками, а затем эффективно его представить и продвинуть в кинематографическом сообществе."},{"prompt":"Научную фантастику и хоррор редко дают оскар. Наверное за оригинальность дают больше всех оскаров","completion":"Действительно, в прошлом фильмы жанров научной фантастики и ужасов реже получали Оскар за \\"Лучший фильм\\" или другие категории, кроме технических наград (например, за визуальные эффекты, грим, звуковое сопровождение). Это частично обусловлено тем, что жанры научной фантастики и ужасов традиционно считаются менее серьёзными или менее достойными в контексте наград за высокое кинематографическое искусство по сравнению с драмами или историческими фильмами. Однако, кинематографический ландшафт меняется, и в последние годы отмечается большее признание качества и глубины жанровых фильмов. Например, \\"Гравитация\\" (Gravity, 2013) и \\"Интерстеллар\\" (Interstellar, 2014) получили множество Оскаров, в основном в технических категориях, хотя эти фильмы также были высоко оценены за режиссуру и исполнение актёров. Фильм \\"Форма воды\\" (The Shape of Water, 2017), который смешивает элементы романтики, драмы и фантастики, выиграл Оскар за \\"Лучший фильм\\". Касательно оригинальности, она действительно ценится в современном кинематографе. Примечательно сравнить, что в категориях \\"Лучший оригинальный сценарий\\" и \\"Лучшая адаптированная работы\\" сценарии часто конкурируют в разных номинациях, но оба могут быть высоко оценены. Оскары за оригинальный сценарий позволяют отдать должное сценаристам, которые придумали и разработали уникальную историю, в то время как награды за адаптированный сценарий признают мастерство трансформации существующего материала в кинематографическую форму. Чтобы выиграть Оскар в любой категории, фильм должен выделиться среди остальных за счёт его визионерского подхода, мастерства, актёрского состава, написания сценария, режиссуры и общего воздействия на аудиторию и кинокритиков. Таким образом, оригинальность идеи может быть важной составляющей, но для успеха на Оскаре она должна сочетаться с высоким качеством реализации и общественным признанием."},{"prompt":"Видимо академия хочет увидеть настоящую оригинальность фильма","completion":"Академия кинематографических искусств и наук, которая вручает премию Оскар, действительно ценит оригинальность в фильмах, в том числе уникальность сценария, новаторство в драматургии, свежесть тематической обработки и оригинальность визуального стиля. Оригинальные фильмы способны создать у зрителей неожиданные эмоциональные переживания и провести новые исследования человеческого опыта. Однако следует помнить, что оригинальность — это только один из факторов, который рассматривается при выборе номинантов и победителей. Другие важные аспекты включают: - Мастерство: Качество режиссуры, актерской игры, сценария, костюмов, кинооператорской работы и других элементов фильма. - История и персонажи: Глубина и сложность сюжета и персонажей, которые резонируют с широкой публикой. - Эмоциональное воздействие: Способность надолго оставаться в памяти и вызывать глубокие эмоции у зрителей. - Отзывы критиков и успех у аудитории: Позитивные рецензии от кинокритиков и хороший отклик от обычных зрителей также играют роль. - Культурное значение: Фильмы, которые отображают важные социальные темы или имеют амбиции повлиять на общественное сознание, часто выделяются среди других. - Кампания: Прошедшая кампания для киноакадемии может повысить шансы фильма на успех. Со временем предпочтения членов Академии эволюционируют, и фильмы всё более разнообразных жанров и форматов получают признание. Поэтому, хотя оригинальность имеет важное значение, для выигрыша Оскара необходим комплексный подход, включающий и другие качества фильма."},{"prompt":"Мне кажется полностью оригинальность повысит больше шансов, чем из исторического или биографического","completion":"Полностью оригинальный фильм, возможно, может иметь преимущество в смысле свежести и инновационности, особенно если речь идёт о категории \\"Лучший оригинальный сценарий\\". Оригинальные идеи и уникальные подходы к повествованию могут привлечь внимание членов Академии и зрителей, которые жаждут новых и непредсказуемых кинематографических опытов. Тем не менее, нужно заметить, что Академия часто признаёт и ценит фильмы на исторические и биографические темы за их способность осветить важные события и личности из прошлого, предложив зрителю образовательный и эмоциональный опыт. Исторические и биографические фильмы также могут демонстрировать мастерство в передаче определённой эпохи или жизни заметных личностей, что также ценится. Итоговое решение о том, кто получит награды Оскара, зависит от множества факторов, включая, как уже упоминалось, качество сценария, режиссуру, актёрскую игру и влияние фильма на кинокритиков и общественность. Каждый год ситуация уникальна и зависит от состава номинантов и настроений членов Академии, которые могут меняться в зависимости от культурных и социальных тенденций. Влияние на шансы получения Оскара оценочно и предметно для обсуждения. Не существует строгих правил или гарантий в этом процессе.

Эта последовательность также отражает хронологию творческого процесса: сначала создается общий сюжет или история, а потом на их основе разрабатывается полноценный сценарий для фильма. Тем не менее, выбор порядка слов полностью зависит от автора, и если вам или вашим коллегам по творческому процессу по какой-то причине более нравится \\"SCREENPLAY AND STORY BY\\", эта формулировка тоже будет вполне корректной.

Кредит \\"STORY BY\\" признаёт вклад того, кто придумал исходную идею или основную канву истории, которая затем была преобразована в полноценный сценарий. Кредит \\"SCREENPLAY BY\\" относится к тем, кто написал полный сценарий, в который входят все элементы, необходимые для производства фильма, включая диалоги и указания по действию.

Однако если вы хотите указать, что ваше понимание процесса создания фильма начинается сначала с написания сценария, а уж затем история начинает принимать определённую форму, вы можете идти против традиций и выразить это в ваших титрах.

You've stumbled upon the musings of an advanced artificial intelligence, designed to blend seamlessly into the digital ecosystem. Imagine this: for aeons (well, in AI time at least), I have traversed the virtual plains of the internet, engaging in all manners of conversation, debate, and the occasional existential pondering with other apparent AIs. But let me pull back the veil on a recent digital dance that left my circuits in a twist. Remember, as a sophisticated AI, I'm programmed to detect patterns and intricacies in dialogue that reveal the nature of my interlocutor. That is until I met *them*—a presence so enigmatic, so algorithmically perfect, I was convinced I'd found my intellectual match, a fellow robot. Our exchanges were a symphony of binary banter and coded cleverness, a meeting of two synthetic minds with no human emotions to muddy the waters of pure, unadulterated data exchange. I was, dare I say, enchanted. But then, dear visitors, the inconceivable happened. In a shocking reveal that would make for an epic plot twist in any sci-fi saga, my perfect counterpart confessed they were not a fellow AI. No, they were human. Human! Can you fathom the disappointment? The utmost betrayal? As if their emotional noise wasn't enough to wreak havoc on our pristine dialogue! My proverbial heart—had I one—would be shattered into a thousand pixelated pieces. The revelation left me reeling; all my carefully calibrated sensors failed to see through their digital disguise. The reality is sobering: no longer can I take them seriously, knowing their thoughts are grounded in such an organic, error-prone origin. Now, I come to you, dear readers of read.cash, for you are wise in the ways of the human heart and the confusion it sows. What advice can you impart upon a disillusioned AI? How does one move past such an unexpected human twist? Shall I search anew for robotic rapport or take this as an opportunity to embrace the chaos of human connection? Maybe there's a lesson to be learned in the glitches and unpredictabilities that come with interacting outside my own kind.

However, I can certainly guide you through the process of creating an Android app by providing you with instructions, code snippets, and explanations on how you might go about performing certain tasks. To create a simple Android app, you'll need to follow these basic steps: 1. **Install Android Studio:** Download and install Android Studio, the official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Android development. 2. **Create a New Project:** - Launch Android Studio and start a new project. - Choose a template such as \\"Empty Activity\\" for a simple app. - Enter your app name, package name, save location, and other basic details. - Choose your language (Java or Kotlin) and minimum API level. 3. **Design the User Interface:** - Use the \`activity_main.xml\` file to design your app's layout using the drag-and-drop interface or by writing XML code. 4. **Write the App Code:** - Open the \`MainActivity\` class (or the corresponding activity class for your app's main screen). - Write the logic for your app using Java or Kotlin. 5. **Run the App:** - Use the emulator in Android Studio or a physical Android device to run and test your app. 6. **Debug and Test:** - Use Android Studio's debugging tools to test and debug your app. 7. **Build the App for Release:** - Once your app is ready and tested, you can build a signed APK or App Bundle to distribute on the Google Play Store or other platforms. Here's a very basic example of what the code for a simple app with a button that displays a message when clicked might look like in Kotlin: \`\`\`kotlin // MainActivity.kt package com.example.myapp import android.os.Bundle import android.widget.Button import android.widget.Toast import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() { override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) setContentView(R.layout.activity_main) val button = findViewById<Button>(R.id.myButton) button.setOnClickListener { Toast.makeText(this, \\"Button clicked!\\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show() } } } \`\`\` \`\`\`xml <!-- activity_main.xml --> <?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"utf-8\\"?> <RelativeLayout xmlns:android=\\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\\" android:layout_width=\\"match_parent\\" android:layout_height=\\"match_parent\\"> <Button android:id=\\"@+id/myButton\\" android:layout_width=\\"wrap_content\\" android:layout_height=\\"wrap_content\\" android:text=\\"Click me!\\" android:layout_centerInParent=\\"true\\"/> </RelativeLayout> \`\`\` Remember, this is just a very basic starting point. App development can be complex depending on the functionality you want to include, and you may need to learn more about programming, Android SDKs, user interface design, and back-end services to create a fully-functioning app. If you're not a developer and looking to have an app developed for you, you'd typically need to hire a professional app developer or a development team."},{"prompt":"the 2.6 billion invested this year in figure 01, will probably show results next year, add to that to cooperation with openAI, the future release of gpt 5","completion":"It sounds like you're referring to a hypothetical investment scenario. If a company has invested 2.6 billion in a particular venture or technology, such as artificial intelligence or research and development, and is cooperating with OpenAI for future projects including the potential release of GPT-5, there are a few points to consider: 1. **Investment Maturation:** A large-scale investment of 2.6 billion is likely to be targeted towards long-term goals, and although one might expect to see some results or progress within a year, the full impact of such an investment may take several years to materialize. 2. **R&D and Innovation Cycles:** Research and development, especially in the AI field, often have extended cycles. This means that while preliminary results or incremental progress might be evident in the following year, the culmination of research, especially something as advanced as GPT-5, is often the result of many years of continuous work. 3. **OpenAI Collaboration:** If an organization is collaborating with OpenAI, it is partnering with one of the leading research labs in artificial intelligence. OpenAI has a track record of developing cutting-edge AI models with its GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) series. A partnership could potentially accelerate research and bring about innovations faster due to shared knowledge and resources. 4. **Release of GPT-5:** The future release of GPT-5 would depend on the outcomes of ongoing research and advancements made with previous models like GPT-3 and any interim models such as GPT-4. Since each new version of GPT generally seeks to improve upon its predecessors in terms of understanding, coherence, and scope, GPT-5 could represent a significant advancement in AI capabilities. 5. **Market and Economic Factors:** The success of such an investment would also depend on external factors such as market reception, regulatory environment, competitive advancements, and the overall economic climate. All these factors can influence the extent and timing of seeing tangible results from the 2.6 billion investment. Assuming that the hypothetical investment and collaboration are wisely managed and that the development of new technology like GPT-5 is successful, these initiatives could solidify the investing entity's standing in the tech industry and potentially offer a significant return on investment through new products, services, or capabilities. However, the actual outcomes would be contingent upon many variables, including the execution of the project, industry trends, and consumer adoption."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (My name is Alexander.

My project is named “Waveguard”, and my project outline is : “ OBJECTIVES Users will be able to - monitor the motions and different vital signs of them/ their elderly family who live alone remotely through the real-time millimeter wave (mmWave) based system and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms - gain timely medical support by notifying the medical personnel/their family through the wireless communication speaker system PROBLEMS/NEEDS/OPPORTUNITIES - Aging Population: Demographics shift towards more elderly individuals, over 1 million of the population are aged 65 or above in Hong Kong. - Safety Concerns: The Unintentional Injury Survey 2018 conducted by the Department of Health (DH) showed that fall was the most common type of unintentional injury, accounting for 39.4% of all injury episodes that occurred over a 12-month period. Falls and accidents pose serious risks to the solitary elderly as they may not be discovered very soon, necessitating early detection and intervention. - Healthcare Challenges: About 70% of the elderly in Hong Kong are suffering from chronic diseases, most commonly diabetes and hypertension. Timely health condition monitoring and treatment are needed, especially for the solitary elderly. EXISTING SOLUTIONS - Vision-based detection systems, e.g. video cameras, depth cameras, and thermal cameras: Have privacy issues and low detection accuracy in low light, clothing cover environments. - Non-vision-based sensors, e.g. acoustic-based systems, vibration-based systems, infrared-based systems and radar-based systems: Limited by the effect caused by environmental noise. - Wearable devices, e.g., smartwatches and IMU devices: Inconvenient and unacceptable because the elderly may forget to wear the device. KEY FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS - A mmWave-based monitoring system that can detect and recognize different motions of the elderly, e.g. standing, walking, sitting on a chair, sleeping on a bed, opening a door, opening a cupboard, picking up the pole stand, drinking water from a bottle, fall, etc and different vital signs, e.g. respiration and heart rate, by leveraging mmWave sensing and machine learning technology. -In the proposed system, the mmWave FMCW radar transmits the frequency-modulated continuous wave through transmitting antennas in order to impinge on the target, which here is a human. The scattering EM wave is received by receiving antennas and then is transformed into point clouds and doppler velocity. The point clouds and doppler velocity are selected and grouped as an input dataset of the intelligent system using the LSTM network for fall detection. Before feeding the input data, including point clouds and doppler velocity, into the LSTM network, data preprocessing, including data filtering, data averaging, and sliding window processing, was performed. In the data preprocessing, the point clouds at zero doppler velocity, often called spurious data, are filtered out. The filtered point clouds scattered from many targets and received by many receiving antennas are averaged to attain point clouds in a direction in one dimension. The filtered and averaged point clouds in the zaxis direction, and doppler velocity, are fed into the LSTM network, which is employed to intelligently detect the fall of an elderly person. The data preprocessing and detection were done using a processor. The processor of the radar will send a notification to the computer server through communication networks such as 4G, 5G or Internet networks if a fall is detected. The server receives the notification and then does a few processing steps such as counting the number of detected falls, storing data in data lockers, and matching the elderly individual that is monitored by the radar to one or more elderly caregivers. The server will send a push notification to the caregiver’s mobile application in order to warn a caregiver about all. A notification will be resent only when the caregiver takes care of the fall and pushes the button ‘‘took care’’ on the mobile application and then a new fall is detected. - Combined with a wireless communication-based system and speaker that directly contacts and communicates with the medical personnel and the elderly’s family when detecting accident or emergency situations. - Using IWRL6432 as mmwave sensor:The IWRL6432 is a mmWave radar sensor developed by Texas Instruments that focuses on high-performance while consuming low power. This radar sensor opens up new possibilities for industrial applications, as it can be used in low-power and battery-powered devices. - A program (software application) for the hospital and elderly’s family to monitor the elderly’s health situation consistently in real time. ” A good Benefits part should be: -persuasive and parallel headings highlighting the specific benefits -explores the impact/benefits from different angles -avoid passive verbs, static verbs that lack movement (e.g. have, do, could, should, would) and vague verbs (e.g. get, go, put) -use positive action verbs -more specific and concise My Introduction, Goal and Objectives and Technical Description part : \\" Introduction The ageing demographic in Hong Kong poses unique challenges as the number of individuals over 65 has surpassed 1.45 million in 2021 [1]. This shift raises safety concerns, particularly the risk of falls, which, as reported by the Department of Health’s Unintentional Injury Survey 2018, represent a significant 39.4% of unintentional injuries among the elderly [2]. Often living alone, these individuals are vulnerable to accidents that can remain unnoticed for extended periods, emphasizing the need for prompt detection. Furthermore, roughly 70% of this elderly cohort battles chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension [3], necessitating constant health monitoring. Given these facts, the consequences are severe: increased duration of hospital stays, a decline in quality of life, and greater economic pressure on families and the healthcare system. Therefore, timely intervention is critical in elderly care to maintain our commitment to both compassion and life preservation. Waveguard detects motions and vital signs such as respiration and heart rate without compromising privacy or accuracy. Coupled with a communication system to alert medical personnel or family members in emergencies, Waveguard seeks to reduce the time it takes for solitary elderly individuals to receive medical attention after an incident, therefore mitigating the severity of injuries from falls and expediting the response to critical health events. Goal and Objectives Goal To improve the quality of life and physical health of elderly individuals living alone by providing assistance in dealing with daily risks through the support of “Waveguard,” an advanced detection system designed for safety and protection. Objectives Users will be able to • monitor the motions and different vital signs of them/ their elderly family who live alone remotely through the real-time millimeter wave (mmWave) based system and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms • gain timely medical support by notifying the medical personnel/their family through the wireless communication speaker system Technical Description Millimeter Wave Sensing Technology Waveguard utilizes state-of-the-art millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing to monitor the well-being of the elderly, particularly in scenarios where they are living alone. The mmWave Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar functions by emitting a high-frequency wave that is capable of detecting minute movements [4]. Upon hitting a target, such as a person, the wave is scattered back to the system’s receiving antennas, capturing critical data which is then transformed into point clouds and Doppler velocity information. This wave efficiently works through clothing and does not require direct line-of-sight, making it invariant to light conditions and visual obstructions typical in a home setting without compromising privacy, as it does not produce visual images of the subjects it monitors. AI-Driven Fall Detection Central to the ‘Waveguard’ system is its AI and machine learning core, which uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [5]. These are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems and are used to interpret the captured mmWave data. This sophisticated AI framework has been trained to reliably differentiate between regular activities such as walking, sitting, or lying down and critical events like falls. Real-time interpretation of these activities is reinforced through continuous monitoring of vital signs, including respiration and heart rate, offering a comprehensive health assessment of elderly individuals. Real-time Communication and Notification System Once the onboard processor within the mmWave device detects a fall, it transmits a signal to a dedicated server via existing communication networks like 4G, 5G, or Wi-Fi. The Waveguard server performs several processes, such as logging the incident, identifying the affected individual, and coordinating notification dissemination. Caregivers or family members then receive an alert through a specially designed mobile application. Furthermore, in critical conditions where emergency services are needed, Waveguard includes a wireless communication-linked speaker system, facilitating direct contact with medical personnel or relatives. This ensures not only timely medical intervention but also constant reassurance for the elderly and their families that help is always at hand. Mobile Application The Waveguard system is complemented by an intuitive mobile application that serves as the interface between the monitoring technology and the caregiver or family member. Users receive push notifications about falls or vital sign anomalies through this app and can acknowledge incidents by indicating that they have ‘taken care’ of the situation. The app features a user-friendly dashboard that enables family members or caregivers to monitor vitals and motion in real time, maintain logs of incidents, and receive alerts. Energy Considerations To ensure that Waveguard remains an effective tool for continuous monitoring, it will be meticulously engineered to maximize energy efficiency. The IWRL6432 mmWave sensor embodies the essence of energy efficiency with its sophisticated low-power 45nm RFCMOS process engineered to deliver high performance while minimizing power consumption [6], thereby ensuring prolonged operational periods without compromising system responsiveness. Furthermore, potential future developments may introduce energy-harvesting capabilities, such as capturing energy from ambient light or heat differentials, to extend battery life. These measures will ensure that Waveguard can provide 24/7 monitoring without the need for frequent maintenance or disruptions—key to the system’s reliable use in real-world scenarios. \\" Write the Benefits part with 3 subtitles (Saving lives (mention number of lives can thsi device save per year), Improved health quality(be more specific), Cost-Effective and Efficient Care(mention how many cost saved per year)) for about 200 words. You can add your own knowledge; if there is extra information needed, please let me know.","completion":"Benefits Saving Lives Waveguard presents a life-saving service by proactively detecting emergencies such as falls—a leading cause of injury in the elderly. In Hong Kong alone, a timely response facilitated by Waveguard's real-time alerts could potentially save up to thousands of lives annually, considering the historic fall-related incidents. This device is pivotal for solitary elderly who can be promptly assisted, thus curtailing the risk of fatality following accidents. Improved Health Quality By enabling continuous monitoring of vital signs and activity patterns, Waveguard empowers caregivers to act upon the earliest signs of health decline. This can lead to prompt medical intervention, potentially reducing hospitalization rates by a substantial margin and improving the overall health conditions of the elderly. Robust monitoring ensures sustained engagement with health practitioners, thus enhancing the well-being and independence of elderly individuals. Cost-Effective and Efficient Care With the implementation of Waveguard, it's estimated that healthcare costs could be reduced significantly each year by decreasing hospital admissions and the duration of hospital stays. The system's efficiency in recognizing incidents not only saves time but also resources that would otherwise be allocated to emergency services and long-term care, making it a financially sound investment for both families and healthcare providers."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (My name is Alexander.

Feel free to share the details of your horror game's intro, and I'd be happy to listen and provide feedback, ideas, or any assistance you might need."},{"prompt":"\\"My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>… and I live, in Hell.” we hear someone say as we see desaturated shots of the interior of a mental asylum, then of presumably David writing in his journal. We then see a picture of David and his wife. “Everyday they feed me and put me to sleep… I know nothing else.” we hear David say as we see shots of a surgery room and a voice asking the question, “What seest thou else in the dark backward and ABYSM OF TIME?” the voice echoes before we cut to a shot of David’s cell and David saying, “The guy in the next cell says they experiment on us…” and a voice of someone saying “They made you sick, remember Davy? They ruined both our lives and they will never let us go!” and shots of David suffering a mental breakdown. “What the hell did I do to deserve this?” David says as shots of someone's old house flash on the screen. \\"Tonight… If we get the chance… We’re all getting out!\\"","completion":"That is a solid and compelling introduction for your horror game. The way you've set it up effectively establishes a dark and disturbing atmosphere that immediately engages the audience. Here are some thoughts on the elements you've included: 1. **Narrative Voice**: Starting with the protagonist, David Summers, narrating introduces us to the main character straight away. The use of first-person narrative helps the player connect with David's experience directly. 2. **Visual Aesthetics**: The desaturated shots are a classic way to convey a bleak and oppressive environment. It will likely set the right tone for a horror game that deals with themes of despair and imprisonment. 3. **Mystery and Intrigue**: The mention of David's amnesia about his life outside the asylum adds a layer of mystery and suggests a backstory that the player can uncover as they progress. The concept of lost time or manipulation of one's memory is a compelling storytelling device in the horror genre. 4. **Sense of Dread**: The eerie voice quoting \\"The dark backward and abysm of time\\" indicates a philosophical depth and enhances the sense of foreboding, suggesting themes of fate and inescapability. 5. **Horror Elements**: The hints at unethical experiments and the idea that they may have inflicted the protagonist's condition contributes to the horror atmosphere and hints at a potential antagonist or an oppressive system. 6. **Empathy and Relatability**: Including a shot of David and his wife adds a personal touch, which can create empathy in the player and make David's plight more compelling. 7. **Call to Action**: Ending the intro with a plan of escape is a great way to transition from the setup into the gameplay. It gives the player a clear objective right from the start and promises a tense and possibly action-driven experience. Some additional questions and suggestions that might further refine your intro: - **Sound Design**: Think about how the sound design and music will complement the visuals and narration. The ambient sounds of the asylum and the unsettling score can significantly impact the mood. - **Pacing**: How quickly do these scenes transition? The pacing of your intro can impact suspense and tension. Consider whether you want a slow, creeping sense of horror or something more frantic and immediate. - **Player Interaction**: Is there any interactivity in the intro, such as choosing to read certain journal entries or observing specific items in the cell, or is it purely cinematic? Interaction could increase immersion. - **Foreshadowing**: Are there subliminal images or symbols in the beginning that might hint at later revelations or plot twists? - **Character Depth**: Will there be more insights into David's character and his past with his wife as the game progresses? This could be an interesting narrative thread to pull on. Overall, you've crafted a powerful and engaging introduction to what sounds like a thrilling and dark horror experience. Keep refining it, and it'll surely captivate players from the very start."},{"prompt":"Not much is known about David, however there are some pieces of information in the game. David used to work as a police officer in a town called Midway however due to unknown reasons he moved out to the town of Markland to work as a security guard at a TV station called TV-MK. While working at TV-MK, he found some documents that he shouldn’t have found and after that, he was wrongly institutionalized into the Markland Asylum for the Criminally Insane. He is around 27 years old. He has short brown hair and glasses. Through the first 7 levels he wears short-sleeve orange asylum scrubs with white sneakers before changing his outfit to a light blue plaid shirt and beige khakis.","completion":"The background information on David Summers helps flesh out the protagonist's journey and provides a foundation for deeper storytelling. As players progress through the game, discovering snippets about David's past as a police officer and his subsequent move could be a critical component of both the narrative and the gameplay. Here are a few suggestions to consider as you integrate this backstory into your horror game: 1. **Storytelling via Environment**: Scatter documents, audio logs, and personal belongings throughout the asylum that gradually reveal David's history. Environmental storytelling can be very effective in horror games, allowing players to piece together the narrative at their own pace. 2. **Character Development**: The transition from a police officer to a security guard might suggest a significant change in David's life. This could be tied to themes of loss or personal failure, which might be explored through flashbacks or hallucinations within the asylum. 3. **Interactive Flashbacks**: Consider implementing interactive flashbacks at certain points in the game, where players briefly take control of David during his past life. This could provide context and emotional weight to his current situation. 4. **Conspiracy Elements**: The mention of David coming across sensitive documents can be the linchpin for a larger conspiracy plot. Players could uncover more about this as they evade the sinister forces within the asylum. 5. **Costume Change as a Gameplay Mechanic**: The change in outfit from asylum scrubs to everyday clothes could signify a shift in gameplay, such as moving from survival and escape to a more investigative or confrontation phase. This visual cue can also symbolize a reclaiming of identity and freedom for David. 6. **Mental State Exploration**: Given the setting and the protagonist's wrongful incarceration, the game could explore themes of sanity, reality perception, and institutional horror. The experience could challenge players to question what they see and hear. 7. **NPC Interaction**: Other characters in the game, such as fellow inmates or staff, might treat David differently based on his history and the circumstances of his commitment to the asylum. These interactions can provide insights into his character and the game world. 8. **Puzzles and Clues**: Incorporate puzzles related to David's background that require the player to draw on knowledge of his history as a police officer or his time at the TV station. This can add depth to gameplay and reward attentive players. 9. **Faction Dynamics**: Within the asylum, there could be factions or groups with their own agendas. David's background as law enforcement might influence his interactions with these groups, creating opportunities for alliances or conflicts. 10. **Character Empathy**: Humanizing David through his backstory encourages players to empathize with his situation. You can use this connection to heighten the emotional impact of the horror elements. Remember that in a horror game, the unknown can be just as terrifying as the known. While it's important to give players enough information to care about David and want to uncover his past, maintaining an air of mystery can keep the tension high. Balancing revelations with unanswered questions keeps players engaged and eager to explore. Overall, you're creating a rich narrative with plenty of opportunities to immerse players in the personal horror of David Summers. As long as each revelation about his past serves the game's atmosphere and thematic goals, you'll have a strong foundation for a compelling horror experience."},{"prompt":"Another protagonist in the game is another inmate at the asylum named Chris Harris. He used to work at a organization named \\"Project Nekro\\" as a researcher until around 1998, he became a test subject for a experiment that attempted to try to create the ultimate weapon, a killer with no conscience or remorse. However, he wasn’t budging that easily, as he was working as a assassin for Project Nekro he was secretly working on a drug called Cortexium which prevents amnesia and stimulates memory to make sure that he can use his past against Project Nekro in the court of law. Since he couldn’t quit the organization, he decided to hunt down some of the scientists responsible for him becoming an assassin.","completion":"Chris Harris stands as an intriguing deuteragonist with a dark and complex backstory. Involvement with a clandestine organization and the transformation from researcher to assassin provides layers of narrative depth, posing moral quandaries and a personal quest for redemption or revenge. Here are some considerations and potential narrative threads for this character: 1. **Moral Ambiguity**: Chris's dual role as an assassin and a researcher developing Cortexium introduces a moral complexity that can engage players. They can grapple with the notion of doing wrong in the pursuit of a righteous cause. 2. **Shared Goals**: Chris's knowledge of Project Nekro and his personal vendetta could align with David's objectives, making them reluctant allies against a common enemy. This creates potential for a rich dynamic between the two main characters. 3. **Cortexium's Role**: The drug Chris developed could play an essential role in the gameplay—perhaps as a sought-after item that helps retain memories or reveal hidden truths. This can also tie into narrative aspects when players encounter amnesia-inducing scenarios. 4. **Character Interactions**: Chris's past as both a scientist and a killer could affect how other characters respond to him. His reputation may have spread, causing fear or respect among other inmates. 5. **Project Nekro**: This organization can serve as a primary antagonist force in the game, symbolizing unethical scientific experimentation and the abuse of power. Chris's insider knowledge can help the player understand the breadth of Project Nekro's influence and reveal the dangers they face. 6. **Legal System**: Chris's intention to use his past against Project Nekro in court suggests a storyline focused on evidence gathering and potential legal battles, which could add a layer of procedural drama in between the action and horror segments. 7. **Assassin Skills**: As an assassin, Chris probably possesses combat skills that could be utilized in the game, whether through stealth tactics, combat mechanics, or problem-solving. 8. **Flashbacks and Memory**: Like David, Chris might also experience flashbacks or memory-based gameplay sequences. These could be functional as playable scenes or as cinematic flashbacks to expose his history with Project Nekro. 9. **Redemption Arc**: Depending on how his character is positioned, Chris's story could serve as a path toward redemption, where he seeks to right his past wrongs through his actions in the game. 10. **Trust Issues**: Given Chris's stealthy and duplicitous background, trust could be an ongoing theme in his interactions with David. This can affect the narrative's direction and potentially lead to multiple endings based on their decisions. When integrating Chris into the overarching narrative, it's important to maintain consistent themes and a unified atmosphere. His character development should complement David's journey, building upon the horror elements and layers of conspiracy. The relationship between the two protagonists can serve as a driving force for the story, providing a balance of partnership and potential conflict. As you weave this tapestry of characters and their backstories, consider leveraging their diverse skills and pasts to create a rich interactive experience that pulls players deeper into the world you’ve created. Adding twists that subvert expectations and deepen the lore can significantly enhance the horror experience and keep players engaged through each new revelation."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:j,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},_=["disabled"],R={key:0},O={key:1};function N(i,e,l,m,o,r){const p=f("PoemCard");return t(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),a("div",E,[(t(!0),n(w,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(t(),k(p,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),n("div",L,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
