Joe's 6-year-old twin brothers are both under the age of 18, so for both of them, the entrance fee would be ( 2F ). Since Joe is older, her entrance fee would be ( F + 0.20F = 1.20F ). The total cost for the entrance fees for all three of them would be ( 2F + 1.20F = 3.20F ). Each ride costs 0.50, and since they each took 3 rides, the total cost for the rides would be ( 3 times 3 times 0.50 = 9 times 0.50 = 4.50 ). The total amount Joe spent is the sum of the entrance fees and the ride costs, which is ( 3.20F + 4.50 = 20.50 ).

We now combine like terms: [ f(x) = 4 cos^3 x + 8 cos^2 x + (8 - 3) cos x - 4. ] Simplifying further: [ f(x) = 4 cos^3 x + 8 cos^2 x + 5 cos x - 4. ] 5.

We need to prove that the length of this polyline does not exceed 200. 2. **Observation**: The polyline intersects the diagonal. Let A be a vertex of the polyline lying on the diagonal. We traverse the polyline until we first hit another vertex B that also lies on the diagonal. Due to the symmetry of the polyline with respect to the diagonal, if we move along the polyline from A in the opposite direction, B will be the first vertex on the diagonal we encounter. Therefore, the polyline forms a loop, and it cannot pass through any of the remaining 13 centers of cells on the diagonal. 3. **Coloring Argument**: Let us color the board in a checkerboard pattern such that the diagonal is black. On the polyline, the black and white cells alternate, so there are equal numbers of black and white cells on the polyline. 4. **Counting Cells**: The 15 times 15 board has 15^2 = 225 cells in total. Given the alternating coloring, there are left(frac{15^2 + 1}{2}right) = 113 black cells (since the diagonal is black). Since the polyline does not pass through 13 of these black diagonal cells, it passes through at most 113 - 13 = 100 black cells. 5. **Calculating the Length**: Each cell center on the polyline corresponds to a black cell and a symmetric pair of cells. Therefore, the polyline intersects both black and white cells creating a pairwise relation. Hence, the total number of cells the polyline passes through is at most twice the black cells it passes through: [ text{Total Length} leq 2 times 100 = 200 ] # Conclusion: The length of the polyline is at most 200.

Since the line of symmetry is x = 1, the symmetric point across this line will have the same vertical component y_0 but the horizontal component such that the distance to the line x = 1 is the same on the other side.

Using the formula for the radius of a circumscribed circle: [ R = frac{a}{2 sin gamma} ] where (a) is the side opposite to the angle (gamma). 3.

Part (a) Prove that it is possible to choose a type of transport so that any city can be reached from any other city using only that type of transport. **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. Let’s consider two cities, A and B, such that it is impossible to travel from A to B by railway. 2. Let M be the set of all cities that can be reached from city A by railway. 3. Let N be the set of all cities that are not in M; clearly B is in N. 4. Notice that no city in M can reach a city in N by railway since otherwise this would contradict the definition of M and N. Now, let's show that it is possible to get from any city to any other city using only airplanes: 5. Consider any two cities. If one belongs to M and the other to N, they are directly connected by an airplane (since they cannot be connected by a railway). 6. If both cities belong to M, they can reach each other through a city in N by airplane since every city in M can fly to at least one city in N (otherwise, M would contain all cities which is a direct path). 7. Likewise, if both cities belong to N, they can reach each other through a city in M by airplane. Therefore, it is always possible to reach from any city to any other city using only airplanes. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Solution to part (a) is proven.}} ] Part (b) Prove that from any city, choosing one specific type of transport, it is possible to reach any other city with at most one transfer. **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. Assume that there is a city X from which it is not possible to reach some city A within one transfer by airplane and some other city B within one transfer by train (thus X and B must be connected by an airplane, given X cannot reach B by train with one transfer). 2. Let’s consider whether A and B are connected by an airplane: - If A and B are connected by an airplane, then: * From X to A is possible via B by airplane. * From X to B is possible directly by airplane. This is a contradiction, hence city X should be connected such that A and B are reachable within one transfer. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Solution to part (b) is proven.}} ] Part (c) Prove that each city possesses the property from part (b). **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. Let's assume for contradiction there is a city X from which the conditions of part (b) do not hold. 2. Hence, there are cities A and B which cannot be reached from city X with at most one transfer using only one specific means of transport. 3. By part (a), we can always choose a type of transport such that all cities are reachable. 4. This contradicts our assumption for city X; hence, the conditions must hold for all cities implicitly. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Solution to part (c) is proven.}} ] Part (d) Prove that it is possible to choose a transport type so that it is possible to reach any city from any other city with at most two transfers. **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. Let’s assume for the sake of contradiction that there are cities A and C which cannot be reached within three “steps” by airplane from any city A and city D which cannot be reached with three “steps” by train. 2. Let’s denote the connections such that: - A cannot reach B within three steps by airplane. - C cannot reach D within three steps by train. This implies: - A and B must be connected by train. - C and D must be connected by airplane. We analyze a few possibilities: 3. If A and C are connected by train: - B and D should then be connected by airplane. - Therefore, remaining connections such as D should overlap, leading to direct airplane connections within three steps. This results in a contradiction as cities can still be reachable by the assumed transports, hence disproving the initial assumption. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Solution to part (d) is proven.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let mathrm {P} be the product of the roots of z^6+z^4+z^3+z^2+1=0 that have a positive imaginary part, and suppose that mathrm {P}=r(cos{theta^{circ}}+isin{theta^{circ}}), where 0<r and 0leq theta <360.

This can be shown using the fact that convex functions are locally Lipschitz continuous. Specifically, for any ( x_0 in mathbb{R} ), there exists a constant ( L ) such that for all ( x ) close to ( x_0 ), [ |f(x) - f(x_0)| leq L |x - x_0|. ] This implies that ( f ) is continuous at ( x_0 ). 4. **Conclusion**: Since ( x_0 ) was arbitrary, ( f ) is continuous on ( mathbb{R} ). # Part (b): Prove the existence and uniqueness of ( g ) 1. **Given Equation**: We need to find a function ( g: [0, infty) to mathbb{R} ) such that for all ( x geq 0 ), [ f(x + g(x)) = f(g(x)) - g(x). ] 2. **Rewriting the Equation**: Let ( y = g(x) ).

Given that ( BC ) is parallel to ( KM ), the corresponding angles formed are congruent. Specifically: [ angle BKM = angle MCN ] In an equilateral triangle, each internal angle is ( 60^circ ). Since ( BC parallel KM ), the alternate interior angles imply: [ angle BKM = angle MCN = 120^circ ] 4.

To reach the 40-point mark by the end of the tournament, the team needs to score an additional ( 40 - 8 = 32 ) points in the remaining ( 20 - 5 = 15 ) matches. If the team has to win at least 9 of the remaining matches to reach the 40-point mark, then the points from these 9 victories would be ( 9V ). The remaining ( 15 - 9 = 6 ) matches can either be draws or defeats. Since a draw is worth 1 point and a defeat is worth 0 points, the maximum number of points the team can get from these 6 matches is ( 6 times 1 = 6 ) points (if all are draws).

So, his weekly income is: 25/hour * 30 hours/week = 750/week Since he works four weeks per month, his monthly income is: 750/week * 4 weeks/month = 3000/month Now, let's calculate his annual income: 3000/month * 12 months/year = 36,000/year Based on his income, the government will contribute 50% of the cost of his healthcare plan because he makes between 25,001 and 40,000. Next, we consider his age. Since Bill is 38, he does not get any additional contribution percentage for his age. Finally, we consider his family size. Bill has a family size of three, which means he has two or more dependents. Therefore, he gets an additional 10% contribution.

Since the initial solution is 5% alcohol, the amount of alcohol in the initial solution is 0.05V liters. When 5.5 liters of alcohol and 4.5 liters of water are added, the total volume of the solution becomes V + 5.5 + 4.5 = V + 10 liters. The amount of alcohol in the new solution is the alcohol from the initial solution (0.05V liters) plus the 5.5 liters of alcohol added, which gives us a total of 0.05V + 5.5 liters of alcohol. The new solution is 15% alcohol, so the amount of alcohol in the new solution should be 15% of the total volume of the new solution. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 0.15 * (V + 10) = 0.05V + 5.5 Now, let's solve for V: 0.15V + 1.5 = 0.05V + 5.5 Subtract 0.05V from both sides: 0.15V - 0.05V + 1.5 = 5.5 0.10V + 1.5 = 5.5 Subtract 1.5 from both sides: 0.10V = 5.5 - 1.5 0.10V = 4 Divide both sides by 0.10: V = 4 / 0.10 V = 40 So, the initial volume of the solution is boxed{40} liters."},{"prompt":"f x^{2}=4, |y|=3 and x+y < 0, find the value of xy.","completion":"Given that x^{2}=4, |y|=3 and x+y < 0, We have two possibilities for x which are 2 and -2.

We start by transforming the function: f(x) = 1 - 2a - 2acos x - 2sin^2 x Since sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x , we can rewrite f(x) as: f(x) = 1 - 2a - 2acos x - 2(1 - cos^2 x) f(x) = 2cos^2 x - 2acos x - 2a - 1 Now, applying the completing-square technique to cos x term in the equation, we get: f(x) = 2left(cos x - frac{a}{2}right)^2 - frac{a^2}{2} - 2a - 1 Depending on the value of a , the minimum value of f(x) varies: - If frac{a}{2} < -1 (i.e., a < -2 ), the minimum occurs when cos x = -1 : g(a) = 2left(-1 - frac{a}{2}right)^2 - frac{a^2}{2} - 2a - 1 = 1 - If -1 leq frac{a}{2} leq 1 (i.e., -2 leq a leq 2 ), the minimum occurs when cos x = frac{a}{2} : g(a) = -frac{a^2}{2} - 2a - 1 - If frac{a}{2} > 1 (i.e., a > 2 ), the minimum occurs when cos x = 1 : g(a) = 2left(1 - frac{a}{2}right)^2 - frac{a^2}{2} - 2a - 1 = 1 - 4a Therefore the function g(a) can be defined in piecewise form as: g(a) = begin{cases} 1, & a < -2 -frac{a^2}{2} - 2a - 1, & -2 leq a leq 2 1 - 4a, & a > 2 end{cases} 2. If g(a) = frac{1}{2} , we consider the cases from g(a) : For the case when a leq 2 : -frac{a^2}{2} - 2a - 1 = frac{1}{2} Solving this quadratic equation yields two solutions, a = -1 and a = -3 . However, because -2 leq a leq 2 , a = -3 is not within the interval and is discarded. Therefore, a = -1 . For the case when a > 2 : 1 - 4a = frac{1}{2} Solving for a gives a = frac{1}{8} , but since frac{1}{8} is not greater than 2 , we discard this solution. For a = -1 , the function becomes: f(x) = 2left(cos x + frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{1}{2} To find the maximum value of f(x) , look for the maximum value of left(cos x + frac{1}{2}right)^2 , which is attained when cos x = -1 . Hence: f(x)_{text{max}} = 2left(-1 + frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{1}{2} = 2left(frac{-1}{2}right)^2 + frac{1}{2} = 2left(frac{1}{4}right) + frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 1 However, the function attains a value greater than this when cos x = 1 because the term left(cos x + frac{1}{2}right)^2 becomes larger. Hence, when cos x = 1 , we have: f(x)_{text{max}} = 2left(1 + frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{1}{2} = 2left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 + frac{1}{2} = 2 cdot frac{9}{4} + frac{1}{2} = frac{9}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 5 Therefore, if g(a) = frac{1}{2} , then a = -1 and the maximum value of f(x) is boxed{5} ."},{"prompt":"For homework Amy had 18 math problems and some spelling problems.

Thus, we can write (a^r, b^r,) and (c^r) in terms of these new variables: a^r = frac{y + z - x}{2}, quad b^r = frac{z + x - y}{2}, quad c^r = frac{x + y - z}{2}. 3. **Construct the function ( f(r) ):** We define the function (f(r)) as follows: f(r) = frac{a^r}{b^r + c^r} + frac{b^r}{c^r + a^r} + frac{c^r}{a^r + b^r}. Substituting the relationships, this becomes: f(r) = frac{a^r}{x} + frac{b^r}{y} + frac{c^r}{z}. Using the previous expressions for (a^r, b^r), and (c^r), we rewrite (f(r)): f(r) = frac{frac{y+z-x}{2}}{x} + frac{frac{z+x-y}{2}}{y} + frac{frac{x+y-z}{2}}{z}. Simplifying further, we get: f(r) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{y+z-x}{x} + frac{z+x-y}{y} + frac{x+y-z}{z} right) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{y}{x} + frac{z}{x} - 1 + frac{z}{y} + frac{x}{y} - 1 + frac{x}{z} + frac{y}{z} - 1 right). = frac{1}{2} left( frac{y}{x} + frac{z}{x} + frac{z}{y} + frac{x}{y} + frac{x}{z} + frac{y}{z} - 3 right). 4. **Analyze function (g(x)):** Consider the general function (g(x) = lambda^x + left(frac{1}{lambda}right)^x) for (lambda > 0) and (x > 1). Its derivative is: g'(x) = lambda^x ln (lambda) + left(frac{1}{lambda}right)^x lnleft(frac{1}{lambda}right). Simplifying the derivative: g'(x) = lambda^x ln (lambda) - frac{ln (lambda)}{lambda^x} = ln (lambda) left( lambda^x - frac{1}{lambda^x} right). For (lambda > 0) and (x > 1), (lambda^x - frac{1}{lambda^x} geq 0), implying (g'(x) geq 0). Therefore, (g(x)) is a non-decreasing function for (x > 1). 5. **Apply the conclusion to ( f(r) ):** Since (g(x)) is non-decreasing, we have (g(x) geq g(1)). This gives: f(r) geq f(1). 6. **Evaluate (f(1)):** When (r = 1), we have: f(1) = frac{a}{b+c} + frac{b}{c+a} + frac{c}{a+b}. Therefore, we have shown that: f(r) = frac{a^r}{b^r+c^r} + frac{b^r}{c^r+a^r} + frac{c^r}{a^r+b^r} geq f(1) = frac{a}{b+c} + frac{b}{c+a} + frac{c}{a+b}. 7. **Conclude and verify equality:** The equality holds if and only if (a = b = c).

Prove that among these 3k points, there must be two points that are diametrically opposite (i.e., the line segment joining them is a diameter of the circle).","completion":"1. **Initial Statement and Conversion**: Let's clarify what the problem says: - We have ( 3k ) points on the circumference of a circle. - These points divide the circumference into ( 3k ) arcs where the length of these arcs can be 1, 2, or 3. - There are exactly ( k ) arcs of each length: 1, 2, and 3. We need to prove that among these ( 3k ) points, there must be at least two points that are diametrically opposite (i.e., they form a diameter). 2. **Coloring and Adding Points**: We color the existing ( 3k ) points red. Then, we add more points around the circumference so that the entire circumference is composed of arcs of length 1. These added points are colored blue. Obviously, there will also be ( 3k ) blue points. The problem can now be transformed into proving that there is at least one pair of red points that are diametrically opposite. To do this, we only need to show that there are at least two points of the same color that are diametrically opposite. 3. **Assumption for Contradiction**: Assume for contradiction that there is no pair of red points that are diametrically opposite. This means that for every red point, its diametrically opposite point must be blue. 4. **Intermediate Steps**: Consider an arc of length 2, denoted as ( overparen{AC} ), which was originally a red arc. Since every red point's diametrically opposite point is blue, point ( A ) and point ( C ) must be red, and the midpoint of this arc, denoted as ( B' ), must be blue. By the problem's setup, blue points’ diametrically opposite points must also be red. So the diametrically opposite point of ( B' ), denoted as ( B ), must be red. 5. **Analyzing Segments and Contradiction**: Now, let's focus on the arc ( overparen{AB} ) which has length ( 3k-1 ). Assume the number of arcs of length 1, 2, and 3 in ( overparen{AB} ) are ( n_1 ), ( n_2 ), and ( n_3 ) respectively. Since an arc of length 1 consists of two red endpoints, their diametric opposites must all be blue, which means any pair of adjacent blue points must lie on an arc of length 3. Thus, there is a bijection between segments of length 1 in ( overparen{AB} ) and segments of length 3 in ( overparen{BC} ). 6. **Equations and Parity Argument**: Therefore, for segments of length 1 and segments of length 3 in total on the circle: - ( n_1 = k - n_3 ) - ( n_1 + n_3 = k ) These follow from the conservation of segment types. Also, we have: [ n_1 + 2n_2 + 3n_3 = 3k - 1 ] Substituting the first equation into the second: [ 2n_2 + 2n_3 = 2k - 1 ] However, the left-hand side of the equation is even (sum of even numbers) and the right-hand side is odd, creating a contradiction. # Conclusion: Thus, the assumption that no two red points are diametrically opposite is false.

To begin with, consider the subset: [ A_0 = {1, 2^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, cdots, 41^2, 43^2} ] Each number in ( A_0 ) is a square of a prime number within the range ( {1, 2, cdots, 2005} ), except for 1. - The set ( A_0 ) has 15 elements, i.e. [ |A_0| = 15 ] - Any two distinct numbers in ( A_0 ) are coprime because the squares of distinct prime numbers are mutually coprime. - None of the elements in ( A_0 ) are prime themselves since they are all squares of prime numbers or 1. This demonstrates that with ( n = 15 ), there can be a subset of ( S ) with ( n ) mutually coprime elements that do not contain a prime number. Hence: [ n geq 16 ] 2. **Proof that ( n = 16 ) is Sufficient:** We now show that any subset ( A subseteq S ) with ( |A| = 16 ) must contain at least one prime number. Using proof by contradiction, assume the opposite: that there exists a subset ( A ) of size 16 with no prime numbers. Let: [ A = {a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{16}} ] where ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_{16} ). We consider two cases: **Case 1: ( 1 notin A )** - Since no ( a_i ) are prime, each ( a_i ) must be a composite number. - Each composite number must have a smallest prime factor. Denote the smallest prime factor of ( a_i ) by ( p_i ). - Because the numbers are mutually coprime, the prime factors ( p_i ) must be distinct. - Therefore, for ( i = 1, 2, cdots, 16 ), the smallest prime factors are distinct and must include at least the first 16 primes. Given the first 16 primes are ( 2, 3, 5, cdots, 47 ), we compare: [ begin{aligned} a_1 &geq p_1^2 geq 2^2 = 4 a_2 &geq p_2^2 geq 3^2 = 9 &vdots a_{16} &geq p_{16}^2 geq 47^2 = 2209 end{aligned} ] However, since ( a_{16} ) must be at most 2005 (as all elements are within ( S )), this leads to a contradiction (2209 > 2005). **Case 2: ( 1 in A )** - Let’s assume ( a_{16} = 1 ). - For the remaining 15 numbers ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_{15} ), the same argument holds as above. - Again, we find using the same logic as case 1: [ a_1 geq 4, a_2 geq 9, cdots, a_{15} geq 2209 ] This gives a contradiction since ( a_{15} ) must be at most 2005. 3. **Conclusion:** As both cases lead to a contradiction, our assumption that ( A ) contains no primes must be false.

The given problem is: A B C C = (D D - E) cdot 100 + D D cdot E where A, B, C, D, and E are distinct digits. 1. **Rewrite Multi-digit Numbers into Algebraic Form**: - The number A B C C can be expressed as: A B C C = 1000 cdot A + 100 cdot B + 10 cdot C + C = 1000 cdot A + 100 cdot B + 11 cdot C - The number D D can be expressed as: D D = 10 cdot D + D = 11 cdot D 2. **Substitute These Expressions into the Problem's Equation**: After substitution, the equation becomes: 1000 cdot A + 100 cdot B + 11 cdot C = (11 cdot D - E) cdot 100 + 11 cdot D cdot E 3. **Simplify and Group the Terms**: We re-write the equation to isolate terms involving 100 and separate constants: 1000 cdot A + 100 cdot B + 11 cdot C = (11 D - E) cdot 100 + 11 cdot D cdot E 4. **Factor Out Common Terms**: Rearrange terms to bring common factors together: 100 cdot (10 cdot A + B - 11 cdot D + E) = 11 cdot (C - D cdot E) 5. **Identify Multiples and Constraints**: Since the right-hand side must be divisible by 100, and D cdot E - C can be at most 72 and at least -9, the only possibility is for this term to be 0.

The sketch corresponds to this step. **Step 2: Identify similar triangles** - Note that triangle ACC^prime sim triangle BCP by angle-angle similarity: - angle A = angle B (both subtended by the same arc). - angle P = angle C^prime = 45^circ (in triangle ACC^prime, this is because it's an isosceles right triangle). **Step 3: Set up proportional relationships** - In similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional. - Given triangle ACC^prime sim triangle BCP and considering the side of the square as a unit, [ frac{AC^prime}{sqrt{2}} = frac{BP}{1} ] **Step 4: Solve for AC^prime** - Given A C^prime = AP + PC^prime = AP + CP, substitute back: [ AC^prime = sqrt{2} cdot BP ] Thus, we have shown: [ AP + CP = sqrt{2} cdot BP ] That concludes the first solution. --- Second Solution **Step 1: Rotate triangle BCP** - Rotate triangle BCP around point B by 90^circ counterclockwise: - Point C maps to point A. - Point P maps to point P^prime. **Step 2: Use right-angled properties** - After rotation, AP^prime is aligned with the original AP. - Consider triangle PB AP^prime as an isosceles right triangle with: - Hypotenuse P P^prime = P A + A P^prime - angle B = 90^circ. **Step 3: Apply Pythagorean Theorem** - According to Pythagoras Theorem: [ PA + AP^prime = PA + CP = sqrt{2} cdot BP ] Thus, we have: [ AP + CP = sqrt{2} cdot BP ] This verifies the given relationship. --- Third Solution **Step 1: Apply Ptolemy's Theorem** - Use Ptolemy’s theorem on cyclic quadrilateral ABCP: - For any cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the products of its two pairs of opposite sides equals the product of the diagonals: [ AC cdot BP = AB cdot CP + BC cdot AP ] **Step 2: Substitute the values** - In triangle ABCP: - Side lengths are unitary. - Identify the diagonal in the square sqrt{2}: [ sqrt{2} cdot BP = AP cdot 1 + CP cdot 1 ] This reduces to: [ AP + CP = sqrt{2} cdot BP ] Thus, the relationship holds: [ boxed{AP + CP = sqrt{2} cdot BP} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=x frac {2}{x}a(lnx frac {1}{x^{2}}) (a＞0). 1.

Now, we need to check if we can get three squares of 20 cm by 20 cm from the length of the paper, which is 54 cm. To do this, we multiply the side length of the square by 3 (since we want three squares): 20 cm * 3 = 60 cm However, 60 cm is greater than the length of the paper, which is 54 cm. This means we cannot make three squares of 20 cm by 20 cm from the paper.

For ship B (going upstream), the effective speed = (50 - a) km/h. Distance covered by ship A in 2 hours = 2 times (50 + a) = 100 + 2a km.

Since the remainders are 4, 6, and 2, we can adjust them to be the same by finding a number that is 2 less than the required remainders. This means we are looking for a number that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 34, 4 when divided by 48, and 0 when divided by 5.

Let the line segment (MN parallel BC) divide the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids (MBCL) and (AMD L), each of which can inscribe a circle with radii (r_1) and (r_2), respectively. 2. **Extend the legs to meet at a point:** Extend the non-parallel sides (AD) and (BC) until they meet at point (O). 3. **Notation:** Let (BC = x), (MN = y), and (AD = z). 4. **Similarity of triangles:** Note that (triangle MOL sim triangle AOD) because (triangle MOL) is similar to (triangle AOD). Therefore, we have: [ frac{y}{z} = frac{r_1}{r_2} = frac{OM}{OA} ] (In similar triangles, the radii of the inscribed circles are proportional to the corresponding sides). 5. **Proportion of segments:** Also, since in similar triangles (frac{OM}{OA} = frac{MB}{AM}), we can write: [ frac{y}{z} = frac{OM}{OA} implies frac{y}{z} = frac{OM - BM}{OA - AM} ] 6. **Relating segment ratios:** From the figure: [ frac{y}{z} = frac{OB}{OM} ] Since (triangle BOC sim triangle MOL), we have: [ frac{OB}{OM} = frac{x}{y} ] Thus, [ frac{y}{z} = frac{x}{y} implies y^2 = xz ] 7. **Bases of trapezoid:** For (triangle BM + CL = x + y) and (triangle AM + DL = y + z), we get: [ c + d = x + 2y + z = x + 2 sqrt{xz} + z = (sqrt{x} + sqrt{z})^2 ] Therefore, [ sqrt{x} + sqrt{z} = sqrt{c + d} ] 8. **Height considerations:** Let (CK) be the height of the trapezoid.

To solve this, follow the steps below: 1. **Denote the Points**: Let the points be (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6). 2. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition is that any triangle formed by any three points out of six must be congruent to the triangle formed by any other three points out of the remaining six. 3. **Applying Basic Triangle Congruence**: - For any three points, say (A_1, A_2, A_3), forming a triangle, it must be congruent to the triangle formed by any other selection of three points, say (A_4, A_5, A_6). 4. **Checking Equal Triangles**: - This means that the lengths of the sides of these triangles must be the same. Thus, the following lengths must be equal: [ begin{align*} &AB = AC = AD = AE = AF &BC = BD = BE = BF = CD &CE = CF = DE = DF = EF end{align*} ] 5. **Using Equal Sides Argument**: - For equal side lengths, analyze the simplest arrangement that can maintain such properties. This usually leads to either regular polygons or symmetry configurations. 6. **Exploring Regular Polygon**: - Since we need the points to be in general position and maintain congruent triangles, consider placing these points such that the above length conditions are naturally true. 7. **Aligning Points on a Circle**: - An effective strategy is to place these points on the circumference of a circle. Specifically, to maintain equal distances which translate to congruent triangles, placing points on a circle is advantageous. 8. **Equilateral Triangle Insights**: - Achieving this condition with pairs of equilateral triangles inscribed within a circle maintains these triangle properties. An equilateral triangle on a circle satisfies the requirement of equal side lengths, forming inherent symmetry. 9. **Constructing Equilateral Triangles**: - Therefore, imagine constructing two equilateral triangles within a circle. This configuration naturally satisfies that any triangle formed by choosing any three points will be congruent to the triangles formed by any other selection of three points due to the symmetry and equal side length properties. 10. **Verification**: - Such a configuration can be verified mathematically/geometrically to ensure that it holds the congruence condition strictly for any combination of points. The vertices of two such equilateral triangles meet the necessary condition, confirming the requirement that any three points form a congruent triangle to any other set of three points. # Conclusion: The constructions are essentially two equilateral triangles inscribed in the same circle.

A subset is defined as \\"good\\" if there exist integers (a) and (c) in the subset and an integer (b) not in the subset such that (a < b < c). 3. To find the number of \\"good\\" subsets, we first need to determine how many subsets do *not* satisfy the conditions of a \\"good\\" subset. 1. Clearly, the empty set and all single-element subsets are not \\"good\\" subsets, since they do not contain at least two elements. The number of such subsets is (1 + 2019 = 2020). 2.

Since each ( a_i ) is chosen independently and uniformly from ( {1, 2, ldots, 2013} ), the probability that a single ( a_i ) is not equal to ( n ) is ( frac{2012}{2013} ). 4. The probability that none of the ( a_i ) are equal to ( n ) (meaning ( n ) does not appear at all in the set) is: [ left( frac{2012}{2013} right)^{2013} ] 5.

In more detail, the solution can be elaborated as follows: The function f(x) = x^3 + sin(x) being an odd function means that for any real number x, f(-x) = -f(x). Therefore, if a_i and a_{11-i} are such that a_{11-i} = -a_i, then f(a_i) + f(a_{11-i}) = f(a_i) + f(-a_i) = f(a_i) - f(a_i) = 0. Now, considering a_n as an element of an arithmetic sequence, we have a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term and d is the common difference. We want a_i + a_{11-i} = 0 for each i from 1 to 5. Substituting a_{11-i} with a_1 + (10-i)d, we get: a_i + a_{11-i} = (a_1 + (i-1)d) + (a_1 + (10-i)d) = 2a_1 + (10-1)d = 0. Given that this must hold for any i from 1 to 5, we have a_i = -a_{11-i} by definition. By solving this for a_1 or d, we can find numerous solutions. As suggested, if we set a_1 = -5 and d = 1, then a_n = -5 + (n-1) cdot 1 = n - 6, this satisfies a_n + a_{11-n} = (n-6) - (5-(n-1)) = n-6 -5 + n - 1 = 2n - 12, which is 0 when n = 6 satisfying the condition for all 1 leq i leq 5. One possible general formula for {a_n} would be: boxed{a_n = n - 6}. Alternatively, we could also set a_1 = -5.5 and d = 1, leading to the sequence: boxed{a_n = n - 5.5}. Both are valid general formulas for {a_n} that fulfill the conditions of the problem."},{"prompt":"The length of a rectangular garden is 2 feet longer than some times its width.

We are given that the length of the garden is ( 38 ) feet. So we can set up the equation: [ mw + 2 = 38 ] We are also given that the perimeter of the garden is ( 100 ) feet. The perimeter ( P ) of a rectangle is given by the formula: [ P = 2l + 2w ] where ( l ) is the length and ( w ) is the width. Substituting the given perimeter and the expression for the length, we get: [ 100 = 2(mw + 2) + 2w ] Now we can solve for ( w ) using the equation for the length: [ mw + 2 = 38 ] [ mw = 38 - 2 ] [ mw = 36 ] Since the length is ( 38 ) feet, we can substitute ( 38 ) for ( mw + 2 ) in the perimeter equation: [ 100 = 2(38) + 2w ] [ 100 = 76 + 2w ] [ 2w = 100 - 76 ] [ 2w = 24 ] [ w = 12 ] Now that we have the width, we can find the multiplier ( m ) by substituting ( w ) back into the equation for the length: [ mw = 36 ] [ m(12) = 36 ] [ m = 36 / 12 ] [ m = 3 ] So the multiplier for the width to find the length is ( boxed{3} )."},{"prompt":"A 260 meters long train running at a certain speed crosses another train running in opposite direction at the speed of 80 kmph in 9 seconds.

The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is ( 260 ) meters + ( 240.04 ) meters = ( 500.04 ) meters. We need to convert the distance to kilometers because the speeds are given in km/h. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so the distance in kilometers is ( 500.04 ) meters / ( 1000 ) = ( 0.50004 ) km. The time taken to cross each other is given as 9 seconds. To convert this time to hours, we divide by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour): Time in hours = ( 9 ) seconds / ( 3600 ) = ( 0.0025 ) hours. The relative speed (( V_{rel} )) is the distance divided by the time: ( V_{rel} = frac{Distance}{Time} = frac{0.50004 text{ km}}{0.0025 text{ hours}} ) ( V_{rel} = 200.016 text{ km/h} ) Now, we know that the relative speed is the sum of the individual speeds of the two trains: ( V_{rel} = V_1 + V_2 ) ( 200.016 text{ km/h} = V_1 + 80 text{ km/h} ) To find ( V_1 ), we subtract ( V_2 ) from ( V_{rel} ): ( V_1 = 200.016 text{ km/h} - 80 text{ km/h} ) ( V_1 = 120.016 text{ km/h} ) Therefore, the speed of the first train is approximately ( boxed{120.016} ) km/h."},{"prompt":"Given that the power function y=(a^22a2)x^a is monotonic on the real number set mathbb{R}, then the real number a= （ ） A: All real numbers B: 3 or 1 C: 1 D: 3","completion":"From the definition of the power function and its monotonicity, we can get: a^2-2a-2=1, a>0, solving this gives a=3.

This choice is straightforward since there are exactly 3 options. 2. **Select Representatives from the Host School**: After choosing the host school, we need to select 2 representatives from this school to attend the meeting. Since each school has 5 members, the number of ways to choose 2 representatives from 5 members is calculated using the combination formula dbinom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}. For our case, n=5 and r=2, giving us dbinom{5}{2} = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = frac{5times4}{2times1} = 10 ways. 3. **Select Representatives from the Other Two Schools**: For each of the other two schools, we need to select 1 representative. Again, using the combination formula dbinom{n}{r} where n=5 and r=1, we find dbinom{5}{1} = frac{5!}{1!(5-1)!} = 5 ways for each school.

Tiger must label at least one of the top two points and one of the bottom two points with a non-zero digit. - If Tiger labeled both relevant points with the digit 1, it would result in a win for Donkey because those points are connected by a segment labeled with 1. Thus, one of these points must be labeled with 2. - The same reasoning applies to the bottom four points. 4. **Generalizing to a Larger Set of Points:** We now generalize this strategy for 2005 points by exponentially increasing the number of labels accordingly. For an arbitrary larger number of points, select 1024 points (since (1024=2^{10})) and use labels from 0 to 9. 5. **Donkey's Strategy for Larger Point Sets:** - Divide the 1024 points into 512 pairs and label the connecting segments with 0. - Combine these pairs further into 256 sets of four points and label the new segments with 1. - Continue this process, reducing the number of groups and introducing a new digit for each merging step. - After 10 steps, you will have labeled the final segments with digit 9 among the combined group of all points. 6. **Tiger's Response and Inescapable Result:** - Suppose Tiger attempts to avoid creating any point pairs connected by a segment labeled with a common digit also labeled by Donkey. - Since each grouping step ensures that within smaller sets at least one point must be labeled non-zero, in the final step, we ensure that a pair of points within 512-point groups must share a non-zero label. - Continue this process backward verifying each step: Each group must contain a point labeled uniquely leading to Tiger's inevitable loss. 7. **Conclusion:** No matter how Tiger labels the points, there will always be a pair of points connected by a segment labeled identically by Tiger, matching the segment label by Donkey, ensuring Donkey’s victory. Thus, through consistent labeling by Donkey starting from small sets and combining, Donkey wins.

Is it possible to do the same with two circles?","completion":"Given problem: Can we draw three non-overlapping (and non-touching) circles and a point outside these circles such that the circles cover the entire horizon for that point (every ray originating from the point hits one of the circles)? Also, is it possible to achieve the same with two circles? To address the problem, let’s break it down into two parts: 1. Examining if three non-overlapping circles can cover the entire horizon from a point. 2. Examining if two non-overlapping circles can achieve the same. First, let us consider the case of **three circles**. Case 1: Three Circles 1. Let each circle be placed in such a way that it covers an angle of view. Each circle covers the angle of view between two tangents drawn from the external point. 2. The angle subtended by a circle at an external point is less than 180^{circ} (a semicircle would cover 180^{circ} but circles are greater than a semicircle). Hence, each circle covers less than 180^{circ}. 3. If we divide the entire horizon of 360^{circ} equally into three sectors, each sector would be frac{360^{circ}}{3} = 120^{circ}. 4. Place each circle such that each sector of 120^{circ} is covered by one circle. Adjusting the radius ensures each circle covers its designated sector without overlapping or touching the others. 5. Adjusting the positions and sizes of the circles (within the constraints of not overlapping or touching) ensures that each circle can cover its respective sector. Thus, **three circles** can indeed cover the entire horizon from a point given proper placement and radius adjustments. Case 2: Two Circles 1. Consider two circles covering the horizon. For two circles to cover the entire horizon of 360^{circ}, each would need to cover an angle of 180^{circ}. 2. Each circle already covers an angle of less than 180^{circ} due to the nature of the problem (circle tangent from an external point). Therefore, with two circles, the combined coverage would still be less than 360^{circ}. 3. Consequently, no matter how we adjust the radii and distances, two circles cannot cover the entire 360^{circ} horizon without exceeding the coverage capabilities of less than 180^{circ} for each circle given the tangents and external point constraints. # Conclusion From the observations and adjustments possible with three circles, we can conclude that: - It is possible to cover the entire horizon with three non-overlapping (and non-touching) circles. - It is **not** possible to cover the entire horizon with just two non-overlapping (and non-touching) circles.

What is the minimum number of turns it could have possibly made? 1. A rook on a chessboard moves either horizontally or vertically. To cover all squares, it must make moves in both directions. 2. The chessboard is an 8x8 grid, meaning the rook must enter each row and each column at least once. 3. Without loss of generality, let's suppose the rook makes at least one move in each horizontal row. 4. That necessitates entering each of the 8 columns. Let us denote a \\"turn\\" as a change in the rook's direction from horizontal to vertical movement or vice versa. 5. After making a move in a column, the rook must make a turn to move into the next column. # Key Insight: If the rook makes one move in each of the 8 columns, it needs to turn twice for each transition between columns (once to exit the current column and another to enter the next column). # Counting Turns: 6.

So, the smallest factorial that has at least five factors of 5 is 25!. Since (25!)^2 will have more than enough factors of 2 and 5 to be divisible by 10^5, the unknown factorial x! must be 25!.

Since she earns an extra 10 for every point above the threshold, the average score must be 10 points above the threshold to earn the additional 100: 100 / 10 per point = 10 points above T So, the average score Karen needs to achieve for the 600 bonus is T + 10. Karen needs the last two tests to have a combined score of 290 to reach this average. The total points from all 10 tests to achieve this average would be: 560 points (from the first 8 tests) + 290 points (from the last 2 tests) = 850 points The average score with all 10 tests would then be: 850 points / 10 tests = 85 points/test Since this average score of 85 points/test is the one that gives Karen a 600 bonus, it is 10 points above the threshold T: 85 points/test = T + 10 points/test Therefore, the threshold average score T is: T = 85 points/test - 10 points/test T = 75 points/test So, the threshold average score for Karen to get the initial 500 bonus is boxed{75} ."},{"prompt":"The number of extreme points of the function f(x) = x^3 3x^2 + 3x is ( ) A: 0 B: 1 C: 2 D: 3","completion":"Given the function f(x), its derivative is f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 3 = 3(x-1)^2 which is always greater than or equal to zero.

We need to prove that the points ( A_1, B_1, C_1, A_2, B_2, C_2 ) lie on two mutually perpendicular lines in equal numbers. 1. **Analyze the Right-angle Quadrilaterals:** Each right-angle quadrilateral (like ( AA_1A'A_2 )) is constructed such that its sides are parallel to the segments ( AB perp A'B' ). 2. **Coordinate Considerations:** Consider the line segments ( AB, BC, CA ) in the coordinate plane: - Place ( A ) at the origin ((0, 0)). - Let ( B ) be at some point ((x_1, y_1)). - Since ( AB perp A'B' ), let ( A'B' ) be a horizontal or vertical line (depending on the orientation chosen). 3. **Parallel and Perpendicular Relationships:** Since ( AB perp A'B' ), the quadrilateral ( AA_1A'A_2 ) has: - ( AA_1 parallel AB ) - ( AA_2 parallel A'B' ) Analogous quadrilaterals can be drawn for ( BB_1B'B_2 ) and ( CC_1C'C_2 ). 4. **Distribution on Two Perpendicular Lines:** Observe the distribution of these points (( A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, C_2 )) in two sets: - Points ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) lie on one line. - Points ( A_2, B_2, C_2 ) lie on another line perpendicular to the first. 5. **Geometric Verification:** Given ( AB perp B'C' ) and parallel sides considerations, these two sets of points must necessarily align along perpendicular axes in the coordinate system. Thus, by construction and geometric configuration, the points ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) and ( A_2, B_2, C_2 ) lie on two mutually perpendicular lines.

The set mathbf{Z}_{+} setminus { f(n) mid n in mathbf{Z}_{+} } is a finite set. We need to prove that the sequence { f(n) - n } is a periodic sequence. Let's proceed step by step: 1. **Property Analysis: Eliminating Unreachable Values** Since the set of positive integers not in the image of f is finite, denote this finite set as {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k}. This implies that for sufficiently large n, f(n) must be in the set {1, 2, 3, ldots} setminus {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k} which means that beyond a certain threshold, f(n) behaves regularly. 2. **Analyzing Expression frac{f^n(m) - m}{n}:** Given frac{f^n(m) - m}{n} is a positive integer, denote: [ a_n = frac{f^n(m) - m}{n} ] Since a_n in mathbf{Z}_{+} for all m and n, this implies that f^n(m) = m + n cdot a_n for some a_n in mathbf{Z}_{+}. 3. **Property Implication on a_n:** Let’s consider the behavior of our expression as n increases. Since f maps positive integers to positive integers, and based on the first property, a_n is likely to stabilize to some integer value for large n. Suppose there exists an integer a such that f(m) = m + a for all sufficiently large m. This would simplify the recurrence: [ f^{n}(m) = m + na implies a_n = a ] This fits our given condition well. 4. **Verifying the Periodicity:** If f(n) = n + a, we note that for sufficiently large n, the behavior translates to f^k(m) = m + ka suggesting periodic shifts linked to a. Specifically: [ f(n) - n = a ] Given that this holds true generally, we argue that the differences f(n) - n, which stabilize to a for large n, imply that f(n) = n + a is periodic. Conclusively, since both properties enforce conditions that drive f towards regular behavior for large n, the sequence f(n) - n = a ultimately exhibits periodic attributes, hence fulfilling the hypothesis.

This means that: [ 2B = k. ] Furthermore, letting V'', E'', and F'' denote the number of vertices, edges, and faces of T, we see that: [ 2A = F''. ] 6. **Calculating V'', E'', and F'':** Note that: [ V'' = 2V' + k ] because T contains the vertices of S, the vertices of S', and new vertices formed by intersections of edges from S with edges from S'. Furthermore: [ E'' = 2(E' + k) ] because each intersection increases E'' by 2 (it splits two edges in half).

According to the problem, the perimeter of the triangle is given by: [ a + b + c = 4 ] 2. We aim to prove that the sum of the squares of the side lengths is greater than 5. Hence, we need to show: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 > 5 ] 3. First, let's consider a special case where the triangle is equilateral with each side of length ( frac{4}{3} ). The calculation for the sum of squares in this specific case is: [ a = b = c = frac{4}{3} ] [ 3a^2 = 3 left( frac{4}{3} right)^2 = 3 cdot frac{16}{9} = frac{48}{9} = frac{16}{3} ] We need to compare this value with 5: [ frac{16}{3} approx 5.33 > 5 ] Therefore, the inequality holds for the equilateral triangle. 4. Next, consider a general triangle with side lengths (a + x, a + y, a + z), and assume (x, y, z) satisfy (x + y + z = 0). This assumption does not restrict generality because it implies that any deviation from the average length (a) sums to zero. 5. By expanding the sum of squares for these generalized side lengths: [ (a + x)^2 + (a + y)^2 + (a + z)^2 ] 6. Expanding each term and summarizing, we get: [ (a + x)^2 + (a + y)^2 + (a + z)^2 = a^2 + 2ax + x^2 + a^2 + 2ay + y^2 + a^2 + 2az + z^2 ] Combining like terms: [ = 3a^2 + 2a(x + y + z) + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 ] 7.

The problem statement gives us that: |PM| - |PN| = 4 quad text{(1)} Notice that the distance between M and N is |MN| = |N - M| = |2 - (-2)| = 4. Since the fixed distance difference between |PM| and |PN| equals |MN|, this implies point P lies on a line perpendicular to MN passing through the midpoint of MN. However, to be more specific about the trajectory, we can consider the geometric definition of a hyperbola, which is the locus of points for which the difference in the distances to the two fixed points (foci) is a constant. In this case, points M and N could be the foci of such a hyperbola. Comparing this with equation (1), we notice that the difference in distances from P to M and N is a constant (4), which is the same as the length of the segment MN. Therefore, the trajectory of P must be one of the lines that compose the asymptotes of the hyperbola defined by points M and N. Since point M is to the left of N and the distance |PM| is greater than |PN| by (1), point P must lie on the line that starts at the midpoint of MN and moves away from point M – specifically on the ray opposite to M in the direction of increasing x-values.

Since the bus is traveling 30 mph slower than the taxi, the speed of the bus is ( v - 30 ) mph. When the taxi overtakes the bus, both vehicles have traveled the same distance. We can set up an equation to represent this situation. The distance traveled by each vehicle is equal to the product of its speed and the time it has been traveling. The taxi has been traveling for 3 hours when it overtakes the bus, so the distance it has covered is ( 3v ). The bus has been traveling for 3 hours longer than the taxi, so it has been traveling for a total of ( 3 + 3 = 6 ) hours. The distance the bus has covered is ( 6(v - 30) ).

There are exactly 9000 (9^{4}=2439) numbers of this type, that is, numbers with at least one zero among their digits.

Betty picked 15 oranges and Bill picked 12 oranges, so together they picked 15 + 12 = 27 oranges. Frank picked three times the number that Betty and Bill picked combined, so Frank picked 3 * 27 = 81 oranges. Frank planted 4 seeds from each of his oranges, so he planted 81 * 4 = 324 seeds. 75% of the seeds turned into beautiful orange trees, so the number of successful orange trees is 75% of 324. To find 75% of a number, you multiply the number by 0.75. So, the number of successful orange trees is 324 * 0.75 = 243 trees. Now, let's find out how many oranges are there for Philip to pick. The ratio of the number of trees with 8, 10, and 14 oranges is 2:3:5. This means that for every 2 trees with 8 oranges, there are 3 trees with 10 oranges and 5 trees with 14 oranges. The total ratio parts are 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts. Since there are 243 trees, we can find out how many trees correspond to each part of the ratio by dividing the total number of trees by the total number of parts in the ratio: 243 trees / 10 parts = 24.3 trees per part. Now we can find the number of trees for each type of orange yield: - Trees with 8 oranges: 2 parts * 24.3 trees/part = 48.6 trees, but since we can't have a fraction of a tree, we'll round down to 48 trees. - Trees with 10 oranges: 3 parts * 24.3 trees/part = 72.9 trees, rounding down to 72 trees. - Trees with 14 oranges: 5 parts * 24.3 trees/part = 121.5 trees, rounding down to 121 trees. Now we'll calculate the total number of oranges: - Oranges from trees with 8 oranges: 48 trees * 8 oranges/tree = 384 oranges. - Oranges from trees with 10 oranges: 72 trees * 10 oranges/tree = 720 oranges. - Oranges from trees with 14 oranges: 121 trees * 14 oranges/tree = 1694 oranges.

Find the maximal length of a non constant arithmetic progression whose terms do not contain the digit k in their p adic representation.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the maximal length of a non-constant arithmetic progression whose terms do not contain a specific digit ( k ) in their ( p )-adic representation, where ( p ) is a prime number and ( p geq 5 ). 2. **Common Difference and Units Digit:** Let ( d ) be the common difference of the arithmetic progression. If ( p mid d ), the units' digit of the terms in the sequence never changes. This is because adding a multiple of ( p ) does not affect the units digit in base ( p ). Therefore, we can consider the sequence with common difference ( frac{d}{p} ) instead, which still maintains the property of not containing the digit ( k ). 3. **Assumption on ( d ):** We can assume ( gcd(d, p) = 1 ). This is because if ( d ) is not coprime with ( p ), we can reduce the problem to a smaller common difference as explained above. 4. **Invertibility of ( d ) modulo ( p ):** Since ( gcd(d, p) = 1 ), ( d ) is invertible modulo ( p ). Let ( c ) be the modular inverse of ( d ) modulo ( p ), i.e., ( cd equiv 1 mod p ). 5. **Form of the Sequence:** Consider the arithmetic progression ( dn + e ). We need to ensure that none of the terms in this sequence contain the digit ( k ) in their ( p )-adic representation. 6. **Modulo Condition:** For any term ( dn + e ) in the sequence, we have: [ dn + e equiv k mod p ] This implies: [ n equiv c(k - e) mod p ] where ( c ) is the inverse of ( d ) modulo ( p ). 7. **Range of ( n ):** Since ( n ) ranges over all integers, ( n equiv c(k - e) mod p ) will eventually cover all residues modulo ( p ). Therefore, one of the first ( p ) terms of the sequence ( dn + e ) will contain the digit ( k ). 8. **Maximal Length:** This shows that the length of the arithmetic progression without the digit ( k ) in their ( p )-adic representation is at most ( p - 1 ). This length is achieved by the sequence ( 1, 2, ldots, p - 1 ) itself, as none of these terms contain the digit ( k ) in their ( p )-adic representation. 9. **Special Cases for ( p = 2 ) and ( p = 3 ):** For ( p = 2 ) and ( p = 3 ), the problem is trivial because the ( p )-adic representation has very limited digits (0 and 1 for ( p = 2 ), and 0, 1, and 2 for ( p = 3 )).

The fourth term then becomes: [ a + 3d = a + 3 cdot (12 - a) = a + 36 - 3a = 36 - 2a. ] Thus, to maximize this expression, we should minimize a.

Geoff has a finite set of windmills such that no two windmills intersect, and any two pivots are more than (sqrt{2}) units apart. In one operation, Geoff can choose a windmill and rotate it about its pivot, either clockwise or counterclockwise, by any amount, as long as no two windmills intersect during or after the rotation. Show that Geoff can, in finitely many operations, rotate the windmills so that they all point in the same direction.","completion":"Throughout the solution, we will generally denote pivots by (P, Q, R, ldots) and non-pivots by (A, B, C, ldots). 1. **Define Configuration and Objective:** - We say that a **configuration of windmills** around (S) is **admissible** if no two windmills intersect. - The problem is equivalent to showing that one can reach any admissible configuration from any other (and the final position with the windmills pointing in the same direction is just one example of a clearly admissible configuration). 2. **Graph Construction:** - Draw a red line segment between any two pivots that are at a distance at most (2) (thus these windmills could intersect). This naturally gives us a graph (mathcal{G}). 3. **Lemma (Planarity of Graph (mathcal{G})):** - **Statement:** For (c geq sqrt{2}), the graph (mathcal{G}) is planar. - **Proof:** Suppose (overline{PA}) and (overline{QB}) intersect. Consider the convex quadrilateral (PQAB). Since it is a convex quadrilateral, one of its angles must be at least (90^circ). Without loss of generality, assume (angle PQA geq 90^circ). Therefore, by the Pythagorean Theorem in (triangle PQA): [ PA^2 geq PQ^2 + QA^2 > 2 + 2 = 4. ] Thus, (overline{PA}) should not be red, and (mathcal{G}) must be planar. 4. **Simplification:** - Ignore any isolated vertices in (mathcal{G}). - Ignore any leaves (vertices with degree 1) in (mathcal{G}). Indeed, if (P) is a pivot with (overline{PQ}) being the only red edge, we can rotate the windmill at (P) to point away from (Q) without obstructing other windmills. Therefore, we can delete (P) from consideration and use induction on the number of pivots. 5. **Faces of Planar Graph:** - Assume (mathcal{G}) is a finite planar graph with no leaves. Thus, it makes sense to speak of the faces of the planar graph (mathcal{G}), consisting of several polygons. 6. **Non-Intersection Lemma:** - **Statement:** A windmill (overline{PA}) can never intersect a red edge other than those touching (P). - **Proof:** Suppose (overline{PA}) intersects the red edge (overline{QR}). Then the altitude from (P) to (overline{QR}) has length at most 1. Without loss of generality, assume (PH < frac{1}{2} QR = 1). Thus: [ PQ^2 < PH^2 + HQ^2 < 1 + 1 = 2, ] which is a contradiction. Hence, (overline{PA}) can only intersect edges incident to (P). 7. **Cuddly Configuration Definition and Claim:** - A windmill (overline{PA}) is said to **hug** a red edge (overline{PQ}) if the angle (angle QPA < varepsilon) for some sufficiently small (varepsilon). - Each red edge (overline{PQ}) can have at most two windmills hugging it (one with pivot (P) and one with pivot (Q)). - Call a windmill configuration **cuddly** if every windmill is hugging an edge. - **Claim:** We can reach some cuddly configuration from any admissible one. - **Proof:** Consider a windmill (overline{PA}) not hugging any edge, and an edge (overline{PQ}), such that (angle APQ = theta) is minimal among all such pairs. Let (angle RPQ) be the corresponding angle of the face containing (overline{PA}), and let (overline{QB}) and (overline{RC}) be windmills. If (overline{QB}) is hugging (overline{PQ}), we perturb it slightly to ensure that (A) and (B) are on opposite sides of (overline{PQ}); thus (overline{QB}) is no longer in the way. Rotate (overline{PA}) towards (overline{PQ}). Due to the minimal choice of (theta), it is impossible for the body of (overline{PA}) to collide with points (B) or (C). The only way it can be blocked is if point (A) collides with the interior of (overline{QB}) or (overline{RC}). Suppose (A) collided with (overline{QB}). At the moment of collision, (angle PAQ leq 90^circ). Before the collision, (overline{PA}) was disjoint from (overline{QB}), and if (angle PAQ geq 90^circ), it would remain disjoint as (overline{PA}) rotated. Thus: [ PQ^2 leq PA^2 + AQ^2 leq 2, ] which is a contradiction. Similarly, the proof works for (overline{RC}). Thus we can rotate the windmills one by one so they hug the edges, as desired. 8. **Interchanging Windmills:** - **Observation 1:** Suppose (overline{PA}) and (overline{QB}) both hug (overline{PQ}). We show we can interchange the two. Assume (angle RPQ) is the angle of a face containing (A), and (angle TPQ), (angle PQS) are the angles of the face containing (B). Rotate (overline{PA}) so it hugs (overline{PR}) (possibly perturbing the windmill at (R)), and then rotate (overline{QB}) so it hugs (overline{QS}) (possibly perturbing the windmill at (S)). Then rotate (overline{PA}) so it hugs (overline{PT}), then move (overline{QB}) back so it hugs (overline{PQ}) from the other side, and rotate (overline{PA}) back. - **Observation 2:** Suppose (overline{PA}) hugs (overline{PQ}), and (angle RPQ) is the angle of a face containing (A). Then we can rotate it so that (overline{PA}) hugs (overline{PR}) (here (overline{PA}) could initially be blocked by (overline{QB}), but then we perform the switching operation above). 9. **Conclusion:** - Together, these two observations complete the proof, showing that any admissible configuration can be transformed into any other, thus allowing all windmills to be pointed in the same direction.

Hence, each insertion can be translated into adding two (0)'s, two (1)'s, or two (-1)'s. - Removing two adjacent same-color chips from the line similarly does not change the color-to-number translation but translates into removing two (0)'s, two (1)'s, or two (-1)'s. 3. **Step 3: Sum invariance** - The initial line consists of a red chip (0) and a blue chip. Since the positions for blue chips are given in the problem, let’s assume the blue chip is at position 2 (even position). Thus, the blue chip can be translated to (1). - Initially, the sum of the numbers is (0 + 1 = 1). 4. **Step 4: Proof of sum invariance** - Each operation, whether insertion or deletion of two chips of the same color, does not change the numerical sum. This is because (a + a = 0) (considering the fact we either add or subtract pairs). - For example, inserting two (1)'s adds (1 + 1 = 2), and removing them subtracts (2), maintaining the sum at 1. The same applies for 0's and -1's. 5. **Step 5: Desired final state** - The problem queries whether it is possible to leave exactly two chips on the line: one red on the right and one blue on the left. Translated into numbers, this would be having one (0) on the right and one (-1) on the left. - The sum in this desired state would be (0 + (-1) = -1). 6. **Step 6: Conclusion based on sum invariance** - Given we've established the sum starts at 1 and operations do not alter the sum, the sum remains 1 throughout. - Therefore, it is impossible to reach a state where the sum changes to (-1). # Conclusion: Since the sum invariance prevents achieving a final sum of (-1), it is impossible to reduce the line to the two desired chips (red on the right and blue on the left).

By the pigeonhole principle, given k+1 steps (a_{0} = 1, a_{k+1} = n^2 for i=0,1,ldots,k), there must be at least one pair of numbers such that the absolute difference is no less than: [ leftlfloor frac{n^2 - 1}{k+1} rightrfloor + 1 ] And since k + 1 leq 2n - 2, we have: [ leftlfloor frac{n^2 - 1}{2n-2} rightrfloor + 1 ] 5.

Given that z = overline{z}, we can set the expressions equal to each other and solve for the components of z: begin{align*} a + bi &= a - bi Rightarrow bi &= -bi end{align*} Solving this equation for b, we find that b = 0 because the only way for bi to equal -bi is if b itself is zero.

Using the tangent addition formula for the sum of angles in a triangle, we have: [ tan(A + B + C) = tan(pi) = 0 ] Using the tangent addition formula: [ tan(A + B + C) = frac{tan A + tan B + tan C - tan A tan B tan C}{1 - (tan A tan B + tan B tan C + tan C tan A)} ] Since tan(pi) = 0, the numerator must be zero: [ tan A + tan B + tan C - tan A tan B tan C = 0 ] Therefore: [ tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C ] 4.

The probability of selecting a red or white marble is the sum of the probabilities of selecting a red marble and selecting a white marble. Since we are looking at the combined probability of selecting either a red or white marble, we can express this as: (R + W) / 30 = 5/6 We know that R + W = 25, so we can substitute this into the equation: 25 / 30 = 5/6 To confirm that this fraction is equivalent to 5/6, we can simplify 25/30 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5: (25 ÷ 5) / (30 ÷ 5) = 5 / 6 So, the equation holds true.

Using the formula for speed (speed = distance/time), we can express their speeds as: [ S_e = frac{540}{T} ] [ S_f = frac{300}{4} ] Now we can substitute ( S_f ) into the speed ratio equation: [ frac{540/T}{300/4} = 2.4 ] Solving for ( T ): [ frac{540}{T} = 2.4 times frac{300}{4} ] [ frac{540}{T} = 2.4 times 75 ] [ frac{540}{T} = 180 ] [ T = frac{540}{180} ] [ T = 3 ] So, Eddy takes boxed{3} hours to complete his journey."},{"prompt":"The temperature of a certain freezer is 5^{circ}mathrm{C}.

According to the farmer's plan, he intended to plough 120 hectares a day for ( D ) days. So, the total area of the farm field according to his plan would be: [ A = 120D ] (Equation 1) However, due to technical problems, he had to work 3 more days than planned, and due to weather issues, he had to work an additional 2 days. So, the total number of days he actually worked is ( D + 3 + 2 = D + 5 ). During these actual working days, he managed to plough 85 hectares a day. So, the total area he ploughed in ( D + 5 ) days is: [ 85(D + 5) ] (Equation 2) But after working ( D + 5 ) days, he still had 40 hectares left to plough. So, the actual total area of the farm field is: [ 85(D + 5) + 40 ] (Equation 3) Since the actual total area of the farm field is the same as the planned total area, we can set Equation 1 equal to Equation 3: [ 120D = 85(D + 5) + 40 ] Now, let's solve for ( D ): [ 120D = 85D + 425 + 40 ] [ 120D - 85D = 425 + 40 ] [ 35D = 465 ] [ D = frac{465}{35} ] [ D = 13.2857 ] Since the number of days must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole day, which gives us ( D = 13 ) days as the initial planned number of days to work.

According to the problem, we have: -6 * a^2 = 3 * (E(a) + 2) Since one possible value of a is 1, we can substitute a with 1 to find E(1): -6 * 1^2 = 3 * (E(1) + 2) -6 = 3 * (E(1) + 2) Now, we can solve for E(1): -6 = 3E(1) + 6 3E(1) = -6 - 6 3E(1) = -12 E(1) = -12 / 3 E(1) = -4 Since E(1) = -4 when a = 1, the expression E(a) must be such that when a = 1, it equals -4. A simple expression that satisfies this is E(a) = -4a, because E(1) = -4 * 1 = -4. However, we need to verify that this expression works for all values of a, not just when a = 1. Let's substitute E(a) = -4a back into the original equation: -6 * a^2 = 3 * (-4a + 2) Now, let's simplify the right side: -6 * a^2 = -12a + 6 This equation must hold true for all values of a. To check if our expression is correct, we can divide both sides by -6: a^2 = 2a - 1 This is a quadratic equation, and it does not hold true for all values of a. Therefore, our initial guess for E(a) was incorrect. We need to find an expression that, when multiplied by 3 and added to 6 (3 times 2), equals -6 times a squared. Let's rearrange the original equation to solve for E(a): -6 * a^2 = 3 * (E(a) + 2) -2 * a^2 = E(a) + 2 E(a) = -2 * a^2 - 2 Now we have an expression E(a) that should satisfy the original equation for all values of a.

We know that this total amount is 55, so we can set up the equation: ( 4D + frac{3}{2}D = 55 ). To solve for ( D ), we first need to combine the terms on the left side of the equation.

The total number of divisors of 360, including 1 and 360 itself, is calculated by adding 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization and then multiplying: (3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 = 24. However, since each box must contain an even number of marbles, n must be an even divisor. We only consider even divisors of 360: - The even divisors come from factors that include at least one factor of 2.

Consider a group of six children that includes (Vasya), four children unfamiliar to (Vasya), and one additional child. In this case, it's impossible to place these six children into two rooms such that those sharing a room all know each other, because (Vasya) knows at most one other child in this group of five (including himself). 2. **Exploring possible friendship scenarios:** Consider two cases: - **Every schoolchild is unfamiliar with no more than two others.** If each schoolchild is unfamiliar with at most two other children, then each child must be familiar with at least (172) children. The total number of pairs of familiar schoolchildren, in this case, is calculated as follows: [ text{Total pairs of familiar schoolchildren} = frac{175 times 172}{2} = 15050 ] 3. **Verification with a minimal number of unfamiliar acquaintances:** - **Existence of a schoolchild unfamiliar with three others:** Let's denote this child as (A), and the three unfamiliar children as (B_1), (B_2), and (B_3).

Next, let’s show that any tetrahedron can be decomposed into smaller tetrahedrons, each with a plane of symmetry. - Consider any given tetrahedron (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4). There exists a point (O) inside this tetrahedron which is equidistant from its faces (this point (O) is the center of the inscribed sphere; see problem 31). - Within this tetrahedron, drop perpendiculars from (O) to the corresponding faces. - These perpendiculars, by their nature, initiate new tetrahedrons which have their planes of symmetry (refer to the volume tapered along symmetrical planes, see the similar problem setup given in the solution). 3. Given this decomposition, we have determined that each smaller part retains symmetry properties. - The original tetrahedron hence can be thought of as composed of smaller tetrahedrons with symmetry properties. 4. Now, refer back to the definition established: - Two polyhedrons are said to be equivalent if each can be decomposed into a finite number of tetrahedrons mirrored across planes. - By showing each tetrahedron has parts with symmetry planes, we have indeed shown that two mirrored tetrahedrons maintain this equivalence structurally via their decomposable parts, each aligned by planes of symmetry. 5.

The woman can complete the work alone in 18 days, so her rate is W/18. The boy can complete the work alone in 9 days, so his rate is W/9. We can write the combined rate of the man, woman, and boy as the sum of their individual rates: M + Wm + B = W/3 We know that Wm = W/18 and B = W/9, so we can substitute these values into the equation: M + (W/18) + (W/9) = W/3 To find the rate at which the man works alone (M), we need to isolate M in the equation. First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 18: M + (1/18)W + (2/18)W = (6/18)W Now, combine the fractions: M + (3/18)W = (6/18)W Subtract (3/18)W from both sides to isolate M: M = (6/18)W - (3/18)W M = (3/18)W Now, we have the rate at which the man works alone. To find the number of days it takes for the man to complete the work alone, we take the total work W and divide it by the man's rate: Days = W / M Substitute M with (3/18)W: Days = W / ((3/18)W) The W's cancel out: Days = 18 / 3 Days = 6 Therefore, the man will take boxed{6} days to complete the work alone."},{"prompt":"Max loves to play video games.

The total time Max played over the three days is the sum of the hours he played on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, which is 2 + T + 5. We also know that Max spent on average 3 hours playing video games during these three days. Since there are three days, the total time he played over the three days should be 3 hours/day * 3 days = 9 hours.

The cost for the first hour is 25, and the cost for each additional hour is 10. So, the total cost before tax for renting the tool for \\"h+1\\" hours would be: 25 (for the first hour) + 10 * h (for the additional hours) The sales tax is 8%, so the total cost including tax would be: Total cost = (Cost before tax) * (1 + Sales tax rate) Total cost = (25 + 10 * h) * (1 + 0.08) We know that the total cost including tax is 125, so we can set up the equation: (25 + 10 * h) * (1 + 0.08) = 125 Now, let's solve for \\"h\\": (25 + 10 * h) * 1.08 = 125 25 * 1.08 + 10 * h * 1.08 = 125 27 + 10.8 * h = 125 Now, subtract 27 from both sides to solve for 10.8 * h: 10.8 * h = 125 - 27 10.8 * h = 98 Now, divide both sides by 10.8 to solve for h: h = 98 / 10.8 h ≈ 9.07 Since Ashwin cannot rent the tool for a fraction of an hour, we round down to the nearest whole number.

A student erases some of these 136 numbers in such a way that the sum of any two erased numbers is not zero. This student gains one point if from any one pair, at least one number is erased. We need to determine the maximum points the student can get. Let's breakdown the solution step by step: 1. **Initial Hypothesis**: - The pairs ((k, k)) and ((-k, -k)) are considered. Suppose ((k, k)) appears, then ( k > 0 ). If the same pair appears as ((-k, -k)), then alternatively use ( j ) instead of ( -j ). - For each positive integer ( k ), either ( k ) or ( -k ) (but not both) can be erased. 2. **Probability Approach**: - With a probability ( p ), we erase ( k ) where ( frac{1}{2} < p < 1 ). - With a probability ( 1-p ), we erase ( -k ). 3. **Considering Different Pair Types**: - **Type 1: Pair ((k, k))**: - Probability ( (p) ) of erasing ( k ). Thus, the student gains a point with probability ( p ) for this pair. - **Type 2: Pair ((k, -k))**: - Since ( k ) and ( -k ) are not zero and at least one will be erased, the student certainly gains a point. - **Type 3: Pair ((a, b)) where ( b neq pm a )**: - Probability of both ( a ) and ( b ) not being erased is ( (1-p) ). Given ( (1 - p) geq p ), the probability of either ( a ) or ( b ) being erased is at least ( 1 - p^2 ). From the above observations, the minimum probability of gaining a point for any pair is ( min {p, 1-p^2} ). 4. **Expected Score Calculation**: The expected score for 68 pairs is: [ 68 min {p, 1-p^2} ] 5. **Solving for Optimal ( p )**: [ p = 1 - p^2 ] Solving the equation, we get, [ p = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} ] Therefore, the expected minimum score: [ 68 p = 68 times frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} > 42 ] This confirms that it's possible to score at least 43 points. 6. **Proof of Impossibility of 44 points**: Considering numbers ( 1 ) to ( 8 ): - Each pair ((i, i)) appears 5 times, totaling ( 40 ) pairs. - Each unique pair ((i, j)) for ( 1 leq i neq j leq 8 ) appears once, totaling ( 28 ) pairs. - Total specific pairs = ( 40 + 28 = 68 ).

The problem statement asserts that the theorem which relates the square of the side opposite to an acute angle in any triangle cannot be used to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle, and it questions whether the Pythagorean Theorem can be considered a corollary of this theorem. 2. To address this question, let's first state the theorem mentioned in the problem: - E.g., \\"In any triangle, the square of the side opposite to an acute angle is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides by twice the product of one of those sides and the projection of the opposite side onto that side.\\" 3. Now, let's recall the statement of the Pythagorean Theorem: - \\"In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\\" 4. We need to analyze whether the Pythagorean Theorem can be derived as a specific case of the mentioned theorem for an obtuse angle or another configuration. Let's proceed by seeing how the theorems are interrelated. 5. Start by recalling the extended statement of the mentioned theorem for any triangle (ABC) with sides (a, b, c) and the angle (gamma) opposite side (c): c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(gamma) 6. When applied to a right triangle scenario with (gamma = 90^circ), the cosine of (90^circ) is zero: cos(90^circ) = 0 7. Substituting this into the equation, we get: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(90^circ) c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cdot 0 c^2 = a^2 + b^2 8. So, in the specific case where (gamma = 90^circ), this theorem reduces to the Pythagorean Theorem: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 9. Conclusion: Hence, it is apparent that the Pythagorean Theorem emerges directly when the broader theorem is applied to the special case of a right triangle. 10. Therefore, the relationship demonstrates that the Pythagorean Theorem can indeed be considered a specific corollary derived from the general theorem regarding the squares of the sides of a triangle. Given these steps, it is concluded that the correctness of the Pythagorean Theorem in the context of the general theorem about triangles with an acute angle implies that they can be seen as interconnected, and indeed the Pythagorean Theorem is a particular case logical to the broader theorem.

Determine the efficiency of this cycle, knowing that it is 8 times less than the maximum possible efficiency for the same minimum and maximum gas temperatures as in the given cycle.","completion":"1. First, we need to analyze the given thermodynamic cycle. We know it consists of three stages: - Isochoric (constant volume) pressure reduction from ( 3P_0 ) to ( P_0 ) - Isobaric (constant pressure) density increase from ( rho_0 ) to ( 3rho_0 ) - A return path back to the original state, forming a quarter circle in the ( frac{P}{P_0} ) vs ( frac{rho}{rho_0} ) plot centered at ( (1,1) ). 2. Next, we need to consider the temperature changes during these stages. The state variables for an ideal gas follows the equation of state: [ PV = nRT ] where ( P ) is the pressure, ( V ) is the volume, ( n ) is the number of moles, ( R ) is the universal gas constant, and ( T ) is the temperature. 3. Let's define the initial volume ( V_0 ) and density ( rho_0 ). The initial state is given as: [ T_0 = frac{P_0 V_0}{R} ] 4. At the end of the isochoric process, we have: [ T_1 = frac{P_0 V_0}{R} ] This is derived because volume ( V_0 ) remains constant, and pressure drops to ( P_0 ). 5. At the end of the isobaric process, with volume tripling to ( 3V_0 ), the new pressure ( P_1 ) is ( P_0 ). Thus: [ T_2 = frac{P_0 (3V_0)}{R} = 3 frac{P_0 V_0}{R} ] 6. Now, the return process completes the cycle, with conditions leading back to ( T = frac{3P_0 V_0}{R} ) since it completes a quarter circle in the ( P )-( rho ) plane. 7.

This means the total amount saved by the three girls is 40 (to pay off the debt) + 2 * 3 (the remaining money divided equally) = 40 + 6 = 46. We already know that Lulu saved 6 and Nora saved 30, so the total amount saved by Lulu and Nora is 6 + 30 = 36. To find out how much Tamara saved, we subtract the total savings of Lulu and Nora from the total amount saved by all three girls: 46 (total savings) - 36 (Lulu and Nora's savings) = 10.

By the triangle inequality, EF + DE > DF, i.e., EF + y > 3y or EF > 2y. The minimum value of EF is slightly more than 2y, which would make h = 9.

Define that a, b, c form a Pythagorean triple, which means they satisfy the equation (a^2 + b^2 = c^2). 2. By Problem 4.42, it’s known that the remainder when the square of an integer is divided by 3 or by 4 is either 0 or 1, and the remainder when the square of an integer is divided by 5 is either 0, 1, or 4. 3. Consider the possible remainders when (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) modulo 3: - If all three numbers (a, b, c) have remainders 1 or 2 when divided by 3, the sum (a^2 + b^2) would never result in another perfect square (c^2), as: [ 1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{3} ] [ 2 + 2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] which does not match the modulo values of perfect square (c^2), which should be 0 or 1. 4. Thus, at least one of (a, b, c) must have a remainder 0, implying that it is divisible by 3. 5. Similarly, when considering modulo 4: - If all three numbers (a, b, c) have remainders 1 or 3, it again can’t result in them forming a perfect square relationship: [ 1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] [ 3 + 3 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] - At least one of (a, b, c) must have remainder 0 when divided by 4, which implies it is also divisible by 4. 6.

At least one of (a, b, c) has to be divisible by 5 as well. 8. Consider the case for even numbers: - A Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) can either have all three numbers even or one even/two odd. - For primitive Pythagorean triples where not all numbers are even, the parity relationship ensures that analyzing modulo 4 will cover the condition of divisibility by 4. 9. We see this by rewriting the proof equation to show even number relationship: [ left(2a_1right)^2 + left(2b_1 + 1right)^2 = left(2c_1 + 1right)^2 ] Demonstrating how even numbers when distributed in these forms create and respect typical Pythagorean properties. 10.

For example, the headphones may arrive at the warehouse earlier than the laptop. 2. **Different Suppliers Located in Various Geographical Areas**: The suppliers of the headphones and the laptop might be located in different cities or regions. Hence, the items are received at different times. 3. **Warehouses Located in Different Areas**: The online store's warehouses, where different items are stored, may be situated in various parts of the city or region. Consequently, consolidating all items to a single location before delivery may not be efficient. Additionally, the costs associated with storing each product in warehouses and the logistics involved in combining all items from a customer's order into a single delivery can be significant. It might be more cost-effective to deliver the items on different days. Large items like office equipment may occupy a lot of space and may require special transportation conditions. Hence, bulky items may be inconvenient to deliver alongside smaller items, and smaller items might be cheaper to deliver separately. **(b)** The company selling office equipment can adopt a mechanism to prevent the customer from keeping the free headphones and returning the laptop. Here is an example mechanism and its principle of operation: 1. **Price Segmentation**: The company can split the price of the items into two parts on the invoice. For example, list the price of the headphones as 15,000 RUB and the price of the laptop as 115,000 RUB. When delivering these items on separate days, the purchaser will receive a receipt for the corresponding amount split - as specified in the invoice for the delivered item. If the payment was not completed before the delivery of the headphones, then the customer will need to pay the specified amount upon receiving the headphones. Thus, if the headphones are delivered first and the customer chooses to return the laptop, they will have already paid 15,000 RUB for the headphones. This mechanism disincentivizes the customer from returning the laptop once the headphones are received, as the discount associated with the combined purchase becomes more apparent. In conclusion, by billing the customer distinctly for each part of the order, the company ensures that the customer has little financial incentive to return part of the order.

It takes 8.64 seconds for them to pass each other completely. What is the length of each train?","completion":"To find the length of each train, we first need to determine the relative speed at which the two trains pass each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together. The relative speed = speed of the first train + speed of the second train = 90 km/h + 85 km/h = 175 km/h To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/h to m/s. We use the conversion factor that 1 km/h is equal to 1000 m / 3600 s. Relative speed in m/s = 175 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 175 * 1000 / 3600 = 175000 / 3600 = 48.6111 m/s (approximately) Now, we know the time it takes for the trains to pass each other is 8.64 seconds. The distance covered during this time is the combined length of the two trains. Distance = Relative speed * Time = 48.6111 m/s * 8.64 s = 419.92 m (approximately) Since the two trains are of equal length, we divide the total distance by 2 to find the length of each train. Length of each train = Distance / 2 = 419.92 m / 2 = 209.96 m (approximately) Therefore, the length of each train is approximately boxed{209.96} meters."},{"prompt":"Among the numbers 3, 0, frac{π}{2}, frac{15}{11}, 0.2121121112ldots (with an increasing sequence of 1 between every two 2's), and 8.24, the rational numbers are ( ).

The sequence consists of segments where each segment k contains the k-th occurrence of the digit \`1\` and 2^{k-1} occurrences of the digit \`2\`.

By the dual nature, place the polyhedra D and I so that for every vertex ( A ) of I, the line ( AO ) is perpendicular to and passes through the center of a face of D, and vice versa for every vertex B of D. 5.

For ( x = 0 ), we can set ( k = 0 ) and no divisors ( d_i ) are needed. This satisfies the condition. 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the proposition is true for some ( n ), i.e., for every integer ( x < n! ), there exist distinct divisors ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_k ) of ( n! ) such that [ x = d_1 + d_2 + cdots + d_k ] where ( k leq n ). We need to show that the proposition holds for ( n + 1 ), i.e., for every integer ( x < (n + 1)! ). Take any integer ( x ) such that ( x < (n + 1)! ). By the Euclidean division, we can write ( x ) as: [ x = (n+1)q + r, ] where ( 0 leq r < n + 1 ) and ( q ) is an integer. Here, ( r ) is the remainder when ( x ) is divided by ( n + 1 ), and ( q ) is the quotient. Since ( 0 leq r < n + 1 ), ( r ) is a number less than ( n + 1 ). And since ( q ) is such that ( x < (n+1)! ), we have: [ (n+1)q + r < (n+1)! ] Hence, [ q < n! ] By the induction hypothesis, for ( q ) (which is less than ( n! )), there exist distinct divisors ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_m ) of ( n! ) such that: [ q = d_1 + d_2 + cdots + d_m, ] where ( m leq n ). These ( d_i ) are distinct divisors of ( n! ).

We are given that ( n in mathbb{N} ) and we need to demonstrate that the number of ways to express ( n ) as a sum of pairwise distinct positive integers is equal to the number of ways to express ( n ) as a sum of odd integers, without regard to the order of the terms. 2. Let ( A ) and ( B ) represent the sets of sums mentioned: ( A ) for sums of pairwise distinct positive integers, and ( B ) for sums of odd integers. Let ( P ) and ( Q ) denote the generating functions corresponding to these sets. 3. The condition given in the problem transforms into the following system of equations using generating functions: [ P + Q = frac{1}{1-X} ] This arises from the fact that the generating function for the series of all positive integers is ( frac{X}{1-X} ), and setting ( X ) to 0, we adjust to our context of sums. 4. Next, we need to encode the specific conditions for the sums: [ P^2 - P circ X^2 = Q^2 - Q circ X^2 ] Here, ( P^2 ) corresponds to the sum of two elements of ( P ), and ( P circ X^2 ) corresponds to the sums where each element of ( P ) is squared, which essentially indicates sums that are allowed to include duplicates. Similarly, it applies to ( Q ). 5. By combining these two equations, we derive: [ frac{P - Q}{P circ X^2 - Q circ X^2} = frac{P - Q}{P^2 - Q^2} = frac{1}{P + Q} = 1 - X ] This step simplifies the relationship between ( P ) and ( Q ). 6. Rewriting this in a telescoping product form, we have: [ frac{P circ X^{2^k} - Q circ X^{2^k}}{P circ X^{2^{k+1}} - Q circ X^{2^{k+1}}} = 1 - X^{2^k} ] 7.

Up to this point, symmetry is maintained between ( P ) and ( Q ). The telescoping process assumes ( frac{1}{P circ X^{2^k} - Q circ X^{2^k}} ) approaches 1, breaking symmetry when ( P ) and ( Q ) are interchanged. 9. By further analysis, we find expressions for ( P ) and ( Q ): [ P = frac{(P+Q) + (P-Q)}{2} ] [ Q = frac{(P+Q) - (P-Q)}{2} ] These expressions are substituted back into the original equations to confirm validity. Ensure that ( P ) and ( Q ) only have 0s and 1s as coefficients, validated because ( P + Q ) and ( P - Q ) meet the criteria. 10. The series generated by ( P - Q ) likely includes positive terms for sums involving an even number of distinct powers of 2. Conversely, negative terms correspond to sums of an odd number of such powers. 11. Thus, a natural number belongs to ( A ) or ( B ) based on the parity (even or odd) of the number of 1s in its binary representation, establishing the required correspondence. # Conclusion: [ boxed{ntext{ (as sum of positive distinct integers)} = ntext{ (as sum of odd integers)}} ]"},{"prompt":"Angle PQR is a right angle, and PR=15 units.

These circles intersect at two points, with A being one of the intersection points. There are two common tangents to C_1 and C_2 that touch C_1 and C_2 at points P_1, P_2 and Q_1, Q_2, respectively. Let M_1 and M_2 be the midpoints of P_1Q_1 and P_2Q_2, respectively. 2. **Assumptions**: To prove angle O_1AO_2 = angle M_1AM_2, we assume that the circles do not have equal radii, which simplifies the problem. When the radii are equal, the conclusion is straightforward. 3. **Intersection Point**: Let P_1P_2 cap Q_1Q_2 = O. It lies on the line O_1O_2. 4. **Homothety Centers**: The two circles are homothetic with respect to O. Since homothety preserves angles and ratios, we can denote the homothety transformation by K. 5. **Conjugate Points**: Let B be the other intersection point of circles C_1 and C_2. Let AB intersect P_1P_2 at T, and let OA intersect circle C_2 at C. Under the homothety K, A maps to C, and B maps to another appropriate point on C_2. 6. **Coordinate Setup**: TA is a perpendicular bisector for line M_1M_2, due to the homothety properties. This can be shown by reflecting A and B under homothety, resulting in collinear points M_1, M_2, O, and due perpendicular bisectors. 7. **Triangle Properties and Similarity**: Utilizing these transformations: [ angle CM_2O_2 = angle AM_1O_1 = angle AM_2O_1 ] implies that M_2, C, B are collinear. 8. **Angle Correspondence**: Therefore, by the properties of conjugate points and their respective homothety transformations: [ angle O_2AM_2 = angle O_2BM_2 = angle O_2CM_2 ] translates similarly to: [ angle O_1AM_1 = angle O_2AM_2 ] # Conclusion: Thus, we have: [ boxed{angle O_1AO_2 = angle M_1AM_2} ] resulting from properties of transformations, homotheties, and intersecting circles' angle properties."},{"prompt":"ABCDE is inscribed in a circle with AB = BC = CD = DE = 4 and AE = 2.

We need to find the maximum number of such points that can lie on a polynomial of degree 20. 2. **Establishing the Problem Statement Effectively:** Consider a polynomial (P(x)) of degree 20. We need to find the maximum number of integer solutions (x) such that (0 leqslant P(x) leqslant 10). 3. **Using a Contradiction Argument:** In order to prove the maximum number of such points, we use a contradiction method to show an upper bound: Assume there are more than 20 such points; let the number of solutions be at least 21. 4. **Ordering the Solutions:** Assume that the solutions are (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{21}) where (x_1 < x_2 < ldots < x_{21}) and let (x_1 = a), (x_{21} = b). From the ordering, we have: [ b - a geqslant 20 ] 5. **Considering the Polynomial Values:** According to our assumption, (P(a)) and (P(b)) are both integers between 0 and 10. Therefore: [ |P(a) - P(b)| leqslant 10 ] 6. **Distribution and Polynomial Degree:** (P(x)) is an integer polynomial, therefore for ( |P(a) - P(b)| leqslant 10 ) and ( b - a geqslant 20 ), we must have (P(a) = P(b)).

Given that the total edge length is 48 cm, the length is twice the width, and the width is equal to the height. By considering the width and height as 1 part each, and the length as 2 parts, making a total of 4 parts, we can use the sum of the edge lengths divided by 4 to find the sum of the length, width, and height. Using the method of proportional distribution, we can find the length, width, and height. Then, by substituting these values into the formulas for the surface area of a cuboid, s = (ab + ah + bh) times 2, and the volume of a cuboid, v = abh, we can solve for the surface area and volume. This problem mainly examines the calculation of the surface area and volume of a cuboid. First, calculate the length, width, and height based on the total edge length.

Let the set of these roots be ( T = { a_i mid 1 leq i leq 25, a_i in mathbb{Z} } ). 2. For each ( a_i in T ), we have: [ P(a_i)Q(a_i) = 2009 ] Since ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) are polynomials with integer coefficients, ( P(a_i) ) and ( Q(a_i) ) must be integers. Therefore, ( P(a_i) ) and ( Q(a_i) ) are integer divisors of 2009. 3. The prime factorization of 2009 is: [ 2009 = 7^2 cdot 41 ] The positive divisors of 2009 are ( 1, 7, 41, 49, 287, 2009 ).

By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree ( n ) can have at most ( n ) roots. Since ( P(x) - t_P ) has at least 3 distinct roots, the degree of ( P(x) - t_P ) must be at least 3. Since ( t_P ) is a constant, the degree of ( P(x) ) must be at least 3. 7. Similarly, let ( t_Q ) be one such divisor that occurs at least 3 times for ( Q(a_i) ).

By the same reasoning, the degree of ( Q(x) - t_Q ) must be at least 3. Since ( t_Q ) is a constant, the degree of ( Q(x) ) must be at least 3.

The vertices ( A_1, B_1, ) and ( C_1 ) lie on the arc of ( S_1 ), inside ( S_2 ), and similarly for ( A_2, B_2, ) and ( C_2 ).

Given that the slope of the tangent line at point A is 3, we can write f'(e) = 3. It follows that a + ln e + 1 = 3, which simplifies to a = 1. Thus, we have boxed{a = 1}. (2) From part (1), we have f(x) = x + xln x, and the derivative is f'(x) = ln x + 2. To find when f'(x) > 0, we solve for ln x + 2 > 0 which gives us x > e^{-2}. For f'(x) < 0, we get 0 < x < e^{-2}. Hence, f(x) is decreasing on (0, e^{-2}) and increasing on (e^{-2}, +infty).

Taking the derivative, we get g'(x) = frac{x - ln x - 2}{(x - 1)^2}. Setting h(x) = x - ln x - 2 where x > 1, the derivative is h'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} > 0, indicating h(x) is strictly increasing for x > 1. We have h(1) = -1 < 0, h(3) = 1 - ln 3 < 0, and h(4) = 2(1 - ln 2) > 0. This implies there exists x_0 in (3, 4) such that h(x_0) = 0, meaning g(x) decreases on (1, x_0) and increases on (x_0, +infty).

Without that information, we cannot accurately determine how many subsequent flights need to depart on-time to achieve the desired on-time departure rate. However, since you've stated that the answer is 4 flights, we can work backwards to find out what the on-time departure rate would be after these flights, assuming the first flight was the only late one. Let's assume the airport wants to achieve an on-time departure rate higher than 50%. If the first flight was late and the next 3 flights were on time, that would give us an on-time rate of 3 out of 4 flights, or 75%. To maintain an on-time departure rate higher than 50%, any number of subsequent on-time flights would work, as the rate would not drop below 50% as long as all flights are on-time. If the airport wants to achieve a higher percentage, say 80%, then after the first 4 flights (with 3 on-time), the on-time rate is 75%. To increase this to over 80%, we would need more on-time flights. After 4 more on-time flights, the total would be 7 on-time flights out of 8, which is an 87.5% on-time rate, thus achieving the goal of an on-time departure rate higher than 80%.

Here's the detailed proof: 1. **Base Case**: - Let us start by examining small cases. If ( m + n = 2 ), it’s trivial because the grid can consist of a ( 1 times 1 ) grid with a single positive number meeting the condition. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: - Assume that for any grid ( m times n ) where ( m + n = k ) and the grid satisfies the properties, then it must be that ( m = n ). 3. **Induction Step**: - Consider an ( m times n ) grid where ( m + n = k + 1 ). - Let’s denote the sum of the numbers in the first row as ( a ). 4. **Observations**: - Examine all rows and columns where the sum of the entries is also ( a ). - There are two possible cases: 1. **Every Row and Column Sum is ( a )**: - If every row’s sum and every column’s sum is ( a ), then calculating the total sum of the grid by summing the rows would give us ( ma ), and summing the columns would give us ( na ). - Hence, ( ma = na ).

The area of triangle ABC is given by S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}bcsin A = frac{1}{2} cdot 2 cdot sqrt{7} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = boxed{frac{sqrt{21}}{2}}."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function E(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",L,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
