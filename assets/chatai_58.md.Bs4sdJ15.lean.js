Assume the contrary, i.e., it is not possible to move any of the n-1 pieces to an adjacent cell such that none of the pieces are on neighboring cells. 2. In a n times n table, there are n columns. Since there are n-1 pieces, at least one column must be empty. 3. Notice that an empty column cannot be an edge column. To illustrate, if the rightmost column is empty, then from the farthest non-empty column to the left, we can move a piece to the right. 4. Similarly, there cannot be two consecutive empty columns. This is because, from the leftmost of these empty columns, the piece in the neighboring column can be moved to the right into the empty column. 5. Therefore, to the left of every empty column, there is a piece. If this piece cannot be moved to the right, there must be another piece in the same row that prevents this movement. Thus, each row containing a \\"left\\" piece must have another piece in the same row. 6. Let the number of empty columns be k. Since there must be at least one piece to the left of every empty column, the corresponding number of \\"left\\" pieces is at least k. 7. Consequently, the n-1-k pieces occupy at most n-1-k rows. Thus, there are at least k+1 empty rows, which is more than the k empty columns. 8. However, by similar reasoning, if we consider the empty rows, there must be more empty columns than empty rows, which contradicts the previous conclusion. 9.

This means all sides are of different lengths and all angles are acute. - Point O is such that OA = OB = OC, indicating that O is the circumcenter of triangle ABC (since the circumcenter in a triangle with unequal sides is equidistant from all vertices). 2. **Observations about Parallelograms Formed:** - Since O is given to be such a point inside triangle ABC, we explore the possibility of the described quadrilateral vertices forming parallelograms. 3. **Analysis of Specific Parallelograms:** - **First Type:** Consider quadrilateral formations with two sides from triangle vertices and the opposite points on the circumcircle: - square AOBC': Here, O is on the diagonal intersection since O is equidistant from A and B, and C' is the reflection (or the symmetric point) across O. - square AOCA': Similarly, O is equidistant to A and C, and B' is the reflection across O. - square BOCA': O is equidistant to B and C, and A' is symmetric across O. Thus, we have identified 3 parallelograms of the first type. 4. **Second Type:** - Additionally, we need to consider parallelograms formed solely by sides and reflections of the original sides of triangle ABC: - Quadrilateral BCC'B' where: - Reflected point B' is such that line segments BC and B'C' are parallel. - Quadrilateral ABA'B' where: - Reflected point A' such that line segments AB and A'B' are parallel. - Quadrilateral ACA'C' where: - Reflected point C' such that line segments AC and A'C' are parallel.

For a given integer expressed as d_{0} + 3d_{1} + 3^2 d_{2} + cdots + 3^n d_{n}, where d_{i} in {0,1,2}, we aim to show that there must be at least one d_i equal to 1 for 0 leq i leq n. 1. **Base Case Analysis**: - Consider the first digit, d_0. Since we are representing the sum in base 3, and the entire sum is given to be a perfect square, then d_0 must result in a perfect square modulo 3. - The possible values for d_0 are 0, 1, or 2. A perfect square modulo 3 is either 0 or 1 (i.e., 0^2 equiv 0 pmod{3} and 1^2 equiv 1 pmod{3}, but 2^2 equiv 4 equiv 1 pmod{3} matches too). 2. **Consider d_0 = 0**: - Suppose d_0 neq 1, so d_0 = 0. - Then, the sum becomes 3(d_1 + 3d_2 + 3^2 d_3 + cdots + 3^{n-1} d_n). - Since d_0 = 0, the summation term is: [ S = 3(d_1 + 3d_2 + 3^2 d_3 + cdots + 3^{n-1} d_n) ] - Let k = d_1 + 3d_2 + 3^2 d_3 + cdots + 3^{n-1} d_n. 3. **Square Sum Analysis**: - For S to be a perfect square, k itself must be divisible by 3 because S = 3k should remain a perfect square. That is: [ S = 3k implies 3(k) ] - Therefore, k mod 3 equiv 0. 4. **Checking Further Digits d_i**: - By iterating this process, if d_1 = 0, then: [ S = 3^2(d_2 + 3d_3 + 3^2 d_4 + cdots + 3^{n-2} d_n) ] - Similarly, we conclude that d_2 + 3d_3 + 3^2 d_4 + cdots + 3^{n-2} d_n must also be divisible by 3. - Repeating this logic, for every i, if d_i neq 1, then we assume d_i = 0. This leads to all terms becoming 0, resulting in: [ 0 + 3 times 0 + 3^2 times 0 + cdots + 3^n times 0 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] - This trivial all-zero sum cannot serve as a proper perfect square if the entire series has to satisfy d_0 + 3d_1 + cdots + 3^n d_n being a non-negative perfect square. 5. **Conclusion**: - Thus, by contradiction, if all d_i were entirely 0's (which won't provide a proper setup for a non-trivial perfect square formation), we infer that at least one d_i = 1 must exist within the range 0 leq i leq n to satisfy the condition that d_{0} + 3d_{1} + cdots + 3^n d_{n} is indeed a perfect square.

For four weeks, the wage increases by 50%, so the new wage is 1.5 times the normal wage. 3. **Calculate total earnings required**: Total earnings required = 4500. 4. **Calculate how much will be earned during the increased wage period**: Normal wage = (frac{4500}{25 times 14} = 12.86) per hour (approx).

If at the end of the game Discriminant has guessed the sequence of numbers, he wins; otherwise, he loses. For what values of N would you accept to play this game?","completion":"1. **Initial Consideration**: Suppose we have a finite sequence of natural numbers (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n) in mathbb{N}^{n+1}. 2. **Evaluate Polynomial at Two Points**: Discriminant can always win in two turns by evaluating the polynomial at specific points. This is explained as follows: - Let the polynomial be P(beta) = sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k beta^k. - The first value we can evaluate is P(1). Evaluating the polynomial at beta = 1 gives: [ P(1) = sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k ] This sum provides the sum of all the coefficients, but not their individual values. 3. **Evaluate at a Distinct Point**: To uniquely determine each coefficient, we evaluate the polynomial at another point, say beta = 10^M, where M is a number such that every coefficient a_k < 10^M. - The choice of 10^M is critical because it ensures that each term a_k (10^M)^k is distinct and does not overlap with other terms when represented in the decimal system. - Evaluate the polynomial at beta = 10^M: [ P(10^M) = sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k (10^M)^k ] - Given that each a_k is strictly less than 10^M, the number P(10^M) is a unique combination of the a_k's since each term's contribution to the sum can be distinctly identified. Specifically, the resulting value will have a unique form in base 10^{M}, where each coefficient a_k appears in a distinct position (powers of 10^{M}). 4. **Determine Coefficients**: The information from P(1) and P(10^M) allows Discriminant to determine the sequence (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n) completely. By writing P(10^M) in its expanded form and comparing with the previously computed P(1), each coefficient can be isolated. 5. **Conclusion**: Given the ability to determine the sequence (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n) with certainty in two evaluations, the least number of turns, N, required for Discriminant to guarantee a win is 2.

We can solve for (L) by equating the two expressions for (L): [25d = 24(d + 5/3)] To solve for (d), we multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction: [75d = 72d + 120] Subtracting 72d from both sides gives us: [3d = 120] Dividing both sides by 3 gives us the original distance between the poles: [d = 40] Now that we have the value of (d), we can substitute it back into the equation for (L) to find the total length of the wire: [L = 25d = 25 times 40 = 1000] Therefore, the length of the wire is boxed{1000} units (meters, feet, etc., depending on the unit used for the distance)."},{"prompt":"The quartic (4thdegree) polynomial P(x) satisﬁes P(1)=0 and attains its maximum value of 3 at both x=2 and x=3 .

Rotation Argument** Consider rotating the vertex A around each center O_i by 90^circ in the same direction. - When A is rotated by 90^circ around O_1, it maps to a point on the circle centered at O_1. - Similarly, rotating around O_2, O_3, and O_4, A will map back onto some other points that lie on the constructed circles. **4.

Divide this rectangle into smaller squares, each of size 2 times 2. Since n and m are integers, we will have a grid of frac{2n}{2} = n squares along one dimension and frac{2m}{2} = m squares along the other dimension. Therefore, the entire rectangle will be divided into n times m squares, each of size 2 times 2. 2. **Cover the Small Squares with Dominoes**: Note that each small 2 times 2 square can be covered by exactly 2 dominoes. The dominos are of size 1 times 2. There are two ways to cover a 2 times 2 square with dominos: - By placing two horizontal dominos. - By placing two vertical dominos. 3. **Constructing the First Layer**: For the first layer, we can choose any configuration to cover each 2 times 2 square: either with horizontal dominos or with vertical dominos. This can be done arbitrarily. 4. **Constructing the Second Layer**: For the second layer, we need to cover each 2 times 2 square again, but we need to ensure that no domino in the second layer overlaps with any domino from the first layer. Since each 2 times 2 square was covered in the first layer with either horizontal or vertical dominos, we only have two possible configurations. The second layer will use the configuration that was not used in the first layer for each 2 times 2 square: - If a 2 times 2 square was covered with two horizontal dominos in the first layer, then we cover it with two vertical dominos in the second layer. - If a 2 times 2 square was covered with two vertical dominos in the first layer, then we cover it with two horizontal dominos in the second layer. This ensures that no two dominos from different layers overlap. 5. **Conclusion**: By constructing the first and second layers as described, we ensure that both layers fully cover the rectangle 2n times 2m without any domino in the second layer overlapping with a domino in the first layer. Therefore, it is indeed possible to cover such a rectangle in two separate layers of 1 times 2 dominos.

Given that (y = mathrm{e}^{x}) and (y = ln x) are reflected over the line (y = x) because they are inverse functions, we can infer that the shortest distance from (B) to the curve (y = mathrm{e}^{x}) (when moved perpendicularly) will be minimized when this point projects onto the line (y = x). 2. The shortest distance from a point to a line is along the perpendicular dropped from the point to the line.

This means that the total amount of oil she can now get for Rs. 684 is the amount she used to get plus 4 kgs. Let's denote the original amount of oil she could get for Rs. 684 as X kgs. After the reduction, she can get X + 4 kgs for the same amount of money. Using the original price, the cost for X kgs of oil would be: Cost = X * P After the reduction, the cost for (X + 4) kgs of oil at the reduced price would be: Cost = (X + 4) * R Since the cost remains the same (Rs. 684) before and after the reduction, we can set the two equations equal to each other: X * P = (X + 4) * R Substituting R with 0.8P, we get: X * P = (X + 4) * 0.8P Dividing both sides by P, we get: X = (X + 4) * 0.8 Expanding the right side, we get: X = 0.8X + 3.2 Subtracting 0.8X from both sides, we get: 0.2X = 3.2 Dividing both sides by 0.2, we get: X = 3.2 / 0.2 X = 16 So, originally, the housewife could get 16 kgs of oil for Rs. 684. Now, let's find the reduced price per kg (R). We know that after the reduction, she can get 16 + 4 = 20 kgs for Rs. 684. Therefore, the reduced price per kg is: R = Total Cost / Total Quantity R = 684 / 20 R = 34.2 So, the reduced price per kg of oil is Rs. boxed{34.2} ."},{"prompt":"Given a circle ( S ) and a point ( M ) outside of it.

To bridge this gap, we need to express the powers of 2 in a form that can be substituted into the given function. This can be achieved by finding an x such that 3^x equals each power of 2 in the sequence. For 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^8, we can write these as 3^{log_{3}2}, 3^{log_{3}4}, 3^{log_{3}8}, ..., 3^{log_{3}256}. Notice that log_{3}2, log_{3}4, log_{3}8, ..., log_{3}256 are the exponents we need to substitute into the function f. Substituting these into the function f(3^x) = 4xlog_{2}3 + 233, we get: - For f(2): f(3^{log_{3}2}) = 4log_{3}2log_{2}3 + 233 - For f(4): f(3^{log_{3}4}) = 4log_{3}4log_{2}3 + 233 - For f(8): f(3^{log_{3}8}) = 4log_{3}8log_{2}3 + 233 - ... - For f(2^8): f(3^{log_{3}256}) = 4log_{3}256log_{2}3 + 233 Summing these up, we notice that 4log_{2}3 is a common factor, and 233 appears eight times (since there are eight terms from f(2) to f(2^8)).

How was this possible?","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem:** - We need to understand how a turtle managed to travel 10 meters in 6 minutes, given that each observer saw it move 1 meter per minute under the following conditions: - (a) There was always someone observing the turtle. - (b) Each observer observed for exactly one minute. - (c) Each observer saw the turtle move exactly 1 meter in their minute of observation. 2. **Contradiction Analysis:** - If the turtle indeed traveled 10 meters in 6 minutes, its average speed would be: [ text{Average speed} = frac{10 text{ meters}}{6 text{ minutes}} = frac{5}{3} text{ meters/minute} ] - Yet, each observer reports seeing the turtle move at exactly 1 meter per minute. There's no direct contradiction here since multiple observers monitoring overlapping intervals can provide differing cumulative observations. 3. **Overlap Observations:** - Since there's no restriction on the number of observers, there could be multiple overlapping observation periods. To cover all 6 minutes, if there were no overlaps, we would need exactly 6 observers, and the turtle would be seen moving 1 meter in each minute, totaling 6 meters in 6 minutes. 4. **Extending Observation and Speed Calculation:** - Consider a period where two observers overlap. For simplicity, let's take an interval of 1 minute and 10 seconds. - Observer 1 watches alone for the first 10 seconds. - Both observers watch together for the next 50 seconds. - Observer 2 watches alone for the last 10 seconds. - During these shared observations, the turtle is perceived to move (by each observer) 1 meter per minute but is stationary when both are watching. 5. **Calculating Total Distance Covered:** - In this 70-second interval: - For 10 seconds, the first observer sees the turtle moving 1 meter (during his 1-minute observation). - For the next 50 seconds, both observers are monitoring, and no additional distance is counted. - For the final 10 seconds, the second observer sees the turtle move 1 meter during his total 1-minute observation. - Thus, in 70 seconds (1 minute 10 seconds), the turtle covers 2 meters (1 meter first 10 seconds + 1 meter last 10 seconds). - The average speed for this period: [ text{Average speed} = frac{2 text{ meters}}{ frac{7}{6} text{ minutes}} = frac{2 times 6}{7} = frac{12}{7} text{ meters/minute} ] 6. **Scaling Observations:** - Now, scale up this scenario to 6 minutes (360 seconds), maintaining the same observation pattern: - With 5 such pairs of observers, each pair covering 70 seconds and moving 2 meters. Over 350 seconds, the turtle will cover: [ 5 text{ pairs} times 2 text{ meters} = 10 text{ meters} ] - In the remaining 10 seconds, the last observer (11th) can just validate the final meter, with no extra distance added. - Hence, despite each observer seeing the turtle consistently move at 1 meter/minute under their 1-minute observation, the turtle manages to accumulate 10 meters within the stipulated 6 minutes due to the additional overlapping observation periods and effective partitioning of the intervals observed. # Conclusion: [ boxed{The turtle traveled 10 meters in 6 minutes by overlapping observation periods and effective coordination, allowing the appearance of moving faster.} ]"},{"prompt":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} = (2, 1) and overrightarrow{b} = (x, y).

Specifically, we need to prove: [ | sin x | + | sin (x+1) | + | sin (x+2) | > frac{8}{5}. ] # Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Establish the periodic nature of (sin(x))**: The sine function is periodic with period ( 2pi ). Thus, for any ( x ), (sin(x)) takes values between (-1) and (1). 2. **Absolute value of sine**: We need to deal with the absolute values (|sin x|), (|sin(x+1)|), and (|sin(x+2)|). However, due to the periodicity and symmetry of the sine function, it is often convenient to interpret these terms on the unit circle or graphically. 3. **Estimate the lower bound**: For any interval of length 3, the sine function will cycle through multiple critical points, ensuring that on average, the absolute values of sine should achieve a certain regularity. We intuitively expect the sine function to fluctuate, allowing sums of absolute values to reach further in their respective periodic cycles. 4. **Integral approach**: Another way to estimate bounds is using the integral properties of the sine function over small intervals. Consider the mean value: [ int_{x}^{x+3} | sin t | , dt ] The inequality itself approximates well since the sine function's absolute value, integrated over any span of 3 units: Evaluating this integral over a complete sine wave which extends (3/2 ) units multiplying the area sorts: [ int_0^{pi} |sin t |dt = 2, ] similarly : [ left| sin tright| generally covers a multiple to reach the lower upper bounds interact. 5. **Verification by points**: To strengthen our argument, we can check specific values: - When (0 leq x leq pi), the sums cycle over all values, empirical results retain (tsum) minimum at least 2.5 considering anti-symmetry captures within units. Therefore, [ | sin x | + | sin(x+1) | > text { since spread units the measure >5 /8 due length scales the completes the rest evaluations rely as} thus the inequality necessarily supports over sum in n. 6. **General proof for (n)**: Going back to the general proof based on 3 intervals, Each (|sin|) results thus over any interval (k), especially surpassing : Summing, at lower limit intervals complete enough minimum measurements: [ | sin 1 | + | sin 2 | + ldots + | sin (3n) | geq frac{8}{5} each subset over practical entire since this thus obtained bound sufficient justifies. ] # Conclusion: Finally, summing these intervals and generalized for (3n) complete measure bounds sufficiently holds: Results subsume thus finally overall natural bounds validated completing proof: [ boxed{textbf{inequality correct.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Clara and Dina were born on the same date in different years, n years apart.

Without loss of generality, assume any 4 of ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_t ) have an empty intersection. 4. **Definition of Special Elements:** - An element ( x ) of ( A_1 cup A_2 cup ldots cup A_t ) is called *special* if it belongs to exactly 3 sets among ( A_1, ldots, A_t ). - Denote by ( b_i ) the number of special elements in ( A_i ) for any ( 1 leq i leq t ). - Denote by ( a_j ) the number of special elements in ( A_{j+t} ) for any ( 1 leq j leq k-t ). 5. **Claim 1: ( a_j geq 1 ) for all ( j ):** - **Proof:** If ( a_j = 0 ), then any 4 of the sets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_t, A_{j+t} ) have an empty intersection, contradicting the maximality of ( t ). 6. **Special Element Distribution:** - Any special element ( x ) appears in 4 of the ( A_1, ldots, A_k ), three of which are among ( A_1, ldots, A_t ), so there is a unique ( j_x ) such that ( x in A_{j_x+t} ). - Denote ( c_x = a_{j_x} ). 7. **Claim 2: ( sum_{x text{ special} in A_i} frac{1}{c_x} leq frac{b_i + 1}{2} ) for all ( i = 1, ldots, t ):** - **Proof:** - **Case a:** ( b_i = 0 ). The inequality is vacuously true. - **Case b:** ( b_i = 1 ). ( frac{1}{c_x} leq 1 = frac{b_i + 1}{2} ) for the special element ( x ) of ( A_i ). - **Case c:** ( b_i = 2 ).

This implies that overrightarrow {OB} - overrightarrow {OA} = k(overrightarrow {OC} - overrightarrow {OA}). By substituting the given vectors, we have: (a-1, 1) = k(-b-1, 2). Equating the components, we get two equations: 1. a-1 = k(-b-1) 2. 1 = 2k From equation (2), we solve that k = frac {1}{2}. Using this value in equation (1), we get: a-1 = frac {1}{2}(-b-1). Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 for clarity: 2a-2 = -b-1, which simplifies to 2a + b = 1. Given that a > 0 and b > 0, let's analyze the expression frac {2}{a} + frac {1}{b}: frac {2}{a} + frac {1}{b} = frac {4a + 2b}{2a} + frac {2a + b}{2b} = 2 + frac {2b}{2a} + 1 + frac {2a}{2b} = 3 + frac {b}{a} + frac {a}{b}.

Therefore, frac {2}{a} + frac {1}{b} = 3 + frac {b}{a} + frac {a}{b} geq 3 + 2 = 5. However, from 2a + b = 1, b can be expressed as 1 - 2a.

Using b = 1 - 2a in frac {b}{a} + frac {a}{b} again, we get: 1 + frac {a}{1 - 2a} = 1 + frac {a}{b} = 1 + frac {2a^2}{b}. Since we need to minimize this expression, observing the square properties, we can deduce the minimum occurs when frac {2b}{a} = frac {2a}{b}, which means b^2 = a^2. Hence, we have: frac {2}{a} + frac {1}{b} geq 3 + 2 = 5. And because 2b = a from our substitution, we solve further: frac {2}{a} + frac {1}{b} = 3 + frac {2b}{a} + frac {2a}{2b} = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. The equality holds when frac {2b}{a} = frac {2a}{b}, which implies b = a, but from 2a + b = 1, this cannot happen.

So, for the seven parrots: 7 parrots * 2 legs/parrot * 3 claws/leg = 42 claws. For the one parrot with an extra toe: 1 parrot * 2 legs/parrot * 4 claws/leg = 8 claws.

The selected points from sides sharing a common vertex are connected, resulting in four triangles.

The ratio of red to blue to green candles is 5:3:7. If Avianna had 45 red candles, we can use the ratio to find out how many blue and green candles she had. Since 45 red candles correspond to the '5' part of the ratio, we can find out how many units each part of the ratio represents by dividing the number of red candles by 5. 45 red candles / 5 = 9 candles per unit of the ratio Now we can find out how many blue and green candles she had: Blue candles: 3 (units of the ratio) * 9 (candles per unit) = 27 blue candles Green candles: 7 (units of the ratio) * 9 (candles per unit) = 63 green candles Next, let's calculate the cost of the blue and green candles: Cost of blue candles: 27 blue candles * 3 per blue candle = 81 Cost of green candles: 63 green candles * 4 per green candle = 252 Finally, let's add the cost of the blue and green candles to find the total cost: Total cost for blue and green candles = 81 (blue) + 252 (green) = 333 Avianna spent boxed{333} on blue and green candles altogether."},{"prompt":"Let ( A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{m} ) be ( m ) subsets of an ( n )element set.

Substituting the coordinates of (P) into the expression for (Q): [ -2xy = -2 cos(omega t) sin(omega t). ] Using the double angle identity (sin(2theta) = 2sin(theta)cos(theta)), we get: [ -2xy = -sin(2omega t). ] 3. Similarly, for the coordinate (y^2 - x^2): [ y^2 - x^2 = sin^2(omega t) - cos^2(omega t). ] Using the identity (cos(2theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta)), we get: [ y^2 - x^2 = -cos(2omega t). ] 4. Therefore, the coordinates of point (Q) become: [ Qleft(-sin(2omega t), -cos(2omega t)right). ] 5. To simplify the expression for point (Q), we express it in a parametric form with a new variable (t') such that: [ begin{cases} x' = -sin(2omega t) = cosleft(-2omega t + frac{3pi}{2}right), y' = -cos(2omega t) = sinleft(-2omega t + piright). end{cases} ] 6. This indicates that point (Q) moves with an angular velocity (2omega) in the clockwise direction (since (P(x, y)) moves counterclockwise but (Q(-2xy, y^2 - x^2)) changes sign). # Conclusion: Therefore, the motion of point (Qleft(-2xy, y^2 - x^2right)) is: [ boxed{text{(C)} text{ A} text{ngular velocity } 2omega text{ on the unit circle, clockwise. }} ]"},{"prompt":"The equation of the line with xintercept and yintercept of 3 and 4, respectively, is ( ).

If n = 0, then P(x) is a constant polynomial, which cannot have all integer roots for P^n(x) since it would imply infinitely many roots. Thus, n geq 1. 2. **Claim 1**: If P(a) = 0 for some integer a, then P(x) - a has n roots (repeated roots are allowed). - **Proof**: Consider P(P(x)) which has n^2 integer roots. Let {a_1, a_2, dots, a_n} be the integer roots of P. Suppose for some i, P(x) = a_i has fewer than n solutions. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists some 1 leq j leq n such that P(x) = a_j has at least n + 1 solutions. Since deg P = n, this implies P(x) = a_j for all x in mathbb{R}, making P a constant, which is a contradiction. Therefore, P(x) = a_i must have exactly n solutions for each a_i being a root of P. This implies P(x) - a has at least one integer solution for any a root of P. 3. **Claim 2**: The set mathcal{R} of all roots of P^n(x) for any n in mathbb{N} is finite. - **Proof**: Consider a directed graph where all members of mathcal{R} are vertices. Draw an edge from a to b if P(b) = a. From Claim 1, every vertex has an outdegree. Suppose mathcal{R} is infinite, implying the graph is infinite. Take an infinite path in the graph: 0 to v_1 to v_2 to v_3 to dots where P^i(v_i) = 0 for all i in mathbb{N}. Assume P has a positive leading coefficient. - **Subclaim**: mathcal{R} has an upper bound. - **Proof**: Suppose otherwise. Since P has a positive leading coefficient, P^i(x) > P^i(y) for all x > y > C for some constant C. Since deg P ge 2, P(x) > x for large x, implying P^k(x) > x for large x (for all x > C_2 for some constant C_2). Take large v_i > v_j > max(C, C_2) and i > j. Then 0 = P^i(v_i) > P^i(v_j) > P^j(v_j) = 0, a contradiction. - **Subclaim**: mathcal{R} has a lower bound. - **Proof**: Suppose otherwise. If P is of even degree, the same method as above works. If P is of odd degree, P^i(x) < P^i(y) for all x < y < C for some constant C. Since deg P ge 2, P(x) < x for small x, implying P^k(x) < x for small x (for all x < C_2 for some constant C_2). Take small v_i < v_j < min(C, C_2) and i > j. Then 0 = P^i(v_i) < P^i(v_j) < P^j(v_j) = 0, a contradiction. - Therefore, mathcal{R} has an upper and lower bound, forcing mathcal{R} to be finite, a contradiction. 4. **Claim 3**: P has a unique root. - **Proof**: Let mathcal{R} = {r_1, r_2, dots, r_k}. We have P(r_i) = r_j for any 1 le i, j le k. Since P: mathcal{R} to mathcal{R}, there is a unique bijection sigma: {1, 2, dots, k} to {1, 2, dots, k} such that P(r_i) = r_{sigma(i)}. Considering the directed graph where {1, 2, dots, k} are vertices, and connecting edges i to sigma(i), there must be a cycle. Since P in mathbb{Z}[x], the fixed point of P circ P circ dots circ P is also a fixed point of P circ P. Thus, P(P(r_i)) = r_i for all 1 le i le k. Taking r_i to be the roots of P(x), we have r_i = P(P(r_i)) = P(0), which is unique. Therefore, there is a unique root of P(x). 5. **Form of P(x)**: Let r = P(0). We know P(x) - r has only 0 as its root. Thus, P(x) - r = ax^b for some a in mathbb{Z}_{not= 0} and b in mathbb{N}_{ge 2}. This gives us P(x) = ax^b + r. Since P only has one root, P(r) = P'(r) = 0. - Solving ar^b + r = 0 and abr^{b - 1} = 0, we find r = 0. Thus, P(x) = ax^b for a in mathbb{Z}_{not= 0} and b in mathbb{N}_{ge 2}. 6. **Linear Case**: If P(x) = ax + b where a in mathbb{Z}_{not= 0} and b in mathbb{Z}, P(x) has an integer root, so a mid b. Rewrite as P(x) = a(x + c) for some c in mathbb{Z}. Notice P^n(x) = 0 has -frac{c}{a^{n - 1}} - frac{c}{a^{n - 2}} - dots - c as a root. Since all roots of P^n(x) are integers, frac{c}{a^{n - 1}} + frac{c}{a^{n - 2}} + dots + c in mathbb{Z} for all n in mathbb{N}. - If c = 0, any polynomial P(x) = ax works. - If c not= 0, a = 1 or a = -1. - **Proof**: Suppose otherwise, |a| ge 2. Take a large positive integer N such that a^N > 10c^{100}. Then frac{c}{a^N} in mathbb{Z}, contradicting our choice of c. Thus, |a| = 1. 7. **Conclusion**: The polynomials that satisfy the conditions are: - P(x) = ax^b for a in mathbb{Z}_{not= 0} and b in mathbb{N}_{ge 2}. - P(x) = x + c or P(x) = -x + c for any c in mathbb{Z}.

Given that the center of circle C lies on the line y=x+1, we can denote the center of the circle by C(a,a+1), where a is the x-coordinate of the center. Hence, the radius r of the circle is the absolute distance from the center to the x-axis, which is |a+1|. The general formula for a circle with center (h,k) and radius r is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. Substituting h=a, k=a+1, and r=a+1 (considering the positive case since radius is a magnitude), we get the equation of circle C as: [ left(x-aright)^{2}+left(y-a-1right)^{2}=left(a+1right)^{2} ] Given that point P(-5,-2) lies on circle C, substituting x=-5 and y=-2 into the equation yields: [ left(-5-aright)^{2}+left(-2-a-1right)^{2}=left(a+1right)^{2} ] Simplifying this, we find the values of a are a=-3 or a=-11.

This is a fundamental characteristic of odd functions. 2. **Applying the Given Condition**: The condition f(x) = f(2-x) can be manipulated by substituting -x for x, leading to f(-x) = f(2-(-x)) = f(2+x). Using the odd function property, we can rewrite this as -f(x) = f(2+x). 3. **Rearranging the Equation**: From the equation -f(x) = f(2+x), we can deduce that f(x+2) = -f(x). This shows that applying the function to x+2 changes the sign of the function value at x. 4. **Determining the Periodicity**: Continuing from the previous step, if we apply the function to x+4, we get f(x+4) = -f(x+2). But since f(x+2) = -f(x), substituting this into the equation gives f(x+4) = -(-f(x)) = f(x).

The floor is composed of a square and a right triangle. The area of the square is given as 36 square feet. Since the area of a square is the side length squared, the side length of the square is the square root of 36, which is 6 feet. The area of the right triangle is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height. The base and height are given as 6 feet and 4 feet, respectively. So the area of the triangle is (1/2) * 6 * 4 = 12 square feet. The total area of the floor is the sum of the area of the square and the triangle, which is 36 + 12 = 48 square feet. Now, let's calculate the area of the rug. The rug is a rectangle with side lengths of 2 feet and 7 feet, so its area is 2 * 7 = 14 square feet. To find the fraction of the floor that is not covered by the rug, we subtract the area of the rug from the total area of the floor and then divide by the total area of the floor: (Floor area - Rug area) / Floor area = (48 - 14) / 48 = 34 / 48 This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: 34 / 48 = (34/2) / (48/2) = 17 / 24 So, the fraction of the floor that is not covered by the rug is boxed{17/24} ."},{"prompt":"Let the function f(x)=ln x+x^{2}ax where a in mathbb{R}.

Differentiating, we get f'(x) = dfrac{1}{x} + 2x - a = dfrac{2x^2 - ax + 1}{x} quad (x > 0). When a=3, the derivative simplifies to f'(x) = dfrac{(2x-1)(x-1)}{x}. Setting f'(x) > 0 to find where the function is increasing, we have 0 < x < frac{1}{2} quad text{or} quad x > 1. Conversely, setting f'(x) < 0, we get frac{1}{2} < x < 1. Therefore, the intervals of increase are (0, frac{1}{2}) and (1, +infty), while the interval of decrease is ( frac{1}{2}, 1). (II) Since the function f(x) has two extreme points x_{1} and x_{2}, it follows that f'(x) = dfrac{2x^2 - ax + 1}{x} = 0, meaning that the quadratic equation 2x^2 - ax + 1 = 0 has two distinct real roots. Hence, by Vieta's formulas, we get x_{1} + x_{2} = frac{a}{2} quad text{and} quad x_{1}x_{2} = frac{1}{2}, which implies 2(x_{1} + x_{2}) = a and x_{2} = frac{1}{2x_{1}}.

We can subtract the cost of the paint from this total to find out how much he spends on primer. Total spent on primer = Total spent on paint and primer - Total cost of paint Total spent on primer = 245 - 125 Total spent on primer = 120 Blake needs 5 gallons of primer, one for each room.

To solve this problem, we will use two different approaches. The first is to generate ( n ) consecutive integers and ensure that none of them is a power of a prime. The second approach involves the Chinese Remainder Theorem and properties of prime factors. Approach 1: 1. **Consideration of Numbers:** - We start by considering the numbers of the form ((n+1)!^2+k) for ( k ) ranging from ( 2 ) to ( n+1 ). 2. **Divisibility Analysis:** - Notice that for each ( k ) in the given range, ( k ) divides ((n+1)! ) because ( k leq n+1 ). [ (n+1)!^2 + k equiv k pmod{k} ] 3. **Analysis for Power of a Prime:** - Suppose ((n+1)!^2+k) is a power of a prime ( p ). Then, ( k ) must also be a power of that prime ( p ), i.e., ( k = p^alpha ) for some ( alpha geq 1 ). - Now, ( k^2 = p^{2alpha} ) divides ((n+1)!^2), and also: [ (n+1)!^2 + k equiv p^alpha pmod{p^{2alpha}} ] This means that ( (n+1)!^2 + k ) modulo ( p^{2alpha} ) cannot be a power of ( p quadratic ) contradiction. Therefore, none of the integers in the range ((n+1)!^2+2, (n+1)!^2+3, ldots, (n+1)!^2+(n+1)) is a power of a prime. Approach 2: 1. **Selection of Primes:** - Choose ( 2n ) distinct prime numbers ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{2n} ) and group them in pairs: ( a_1 = p_1 times p_2, ) ( a_2 = p_3 times p_4, ldots, ) ( a_n = p_{2n-1} times p_{2n} ). 2. **Chinese Remainder Theorem:** - According to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists an integer ( N ) such that: [ N equiv 1 pmod{a_1}, quad N equiv 2 pmod{a_2}, quad ldots, quad N equiv n pmod{a_n} ] 3. **Construction of Sequence:** - Each of the ( N ) consecutive integers ( N-1, N-2, ldots, N-n ) has at least two prime factors. - For ( 1 leq k leq n ), ( N-k ) is divisible by ( a_k ). 4. **Prime Factor Analysis:** - Since each ( a_k = p_{2k-1} times p_{2k} ) contains two distinct prime factors, the integers ( N-1, N-2, ldots, N-n ) cannot be a power of a prime. Thus, using either approach, we conclude that for any positive integer ( n ), there exist ( n ) consecutive positive integers none of which is a power of a prime.

This provides the proper parallel constraint ensuring ( OQ ) remains perpendicular to ( AB ). 5. **Identify Midpoint ( M ):** - Point ( M ) is the intersection of line ( OQ ) and line ( RC ).

As the Winter Olympics approaches, BingDwenDwen dolls are selling very well.

The purchase price and selling price of the two dolls are as follows: | | A doll | B doll | |||| | Purchase Price (¥/each) | 20 | 15 | | Selling Price (¥/each) | 25 | 18 | (1) Xiao Li purchased 100 dolls of A and B for a total of ¥1650.

Xiao Li plans to purchase a total of 100 dolls of both types. How should Xiao Li design the purchase plan to maximize profit, and what is the maximum profit?","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: Finding the Number of Each Type of Doll Purchased Let's denote the number of A dolls purchased by Xiao Li as a. Consequently, the number of B dolls purchased would be (100 - a), since the total number of dolls purchased is 100. Given the purchase prices of A and B dolls, we can set up the following equation based on the total cost of ¥1650: [20a + 15(100 - a) = 1650] Expanding and simplifying this equation: [20a + 1500 - 15a = 1650] [5a = 150] [a = 30] Therefore, Xiao Li purchased 30 dolls of type A. To find the number of B dolls: [100 - a = 100 - 30 = 70] So, Xiao Li purchased boxed{30} dolls of type A and boxed{70} dolls of type B. Part 2: Maximizing Profit on the Second Purchase Let the number of A dolls purchased by Xiao Li on the second purchase be x, making the number of B dolls (100 - x).

The profit from selling the dolls can be calculated as: [w = (25 - 20)x + (18 - 15)(100 - x)] Simplifying the equation gives us: [w = 5x + 3(100 - x)] [w = 5x + 300 - 3x] [w = 2x + 300] This shows that the profit w increases with the number of A dolls x. However, according to the store's stipulation, x cannot exceed half the number of B dolls, which gives us the inequality: [x leq frac{1}{2}(100 - x)] Solving this inequality for x: [2x leq 100 - x] [3x leq 100] [x leq 33frac{1}{3}] Since x must be an integer, the maximum value of x is 33. Substituting x = 33 into the profit equation: [w = 2(33) + 300 = 366] And the number of B dolls would be 100 - x = 67. Therefore, to maximize profit, Xiao Li should purchase boxed{33} dolls of type A and boxed{67} dolls of type B, resulting in a maximum profit of boxed{¥366}."},{"prompt":"A larger square has a side length of 10 units.

Since gear L makes 20 revolutions per minute, we need to convert that to revolutions per second: 20 revolutions/minute * 1 minute/60 seconds = 20/60 revolutions/second Now, let's calculate how many revolutions gear L makes in 6 seconds: 20/60 revolutions/second * 6 seconds = 120/60 revolutions = 2 revolutions Gear R makes 6 more revolutions than gear L in 6 seconds, so: Gear R revolutions in 6 seconds = Gear L revolutions in 6 seconds + 6 Gear R revolutions in 6 seconds = 2 revolutions + 6 revolutions Gear R revolutions in 6 seconds = 8 revolutions Now we need to find out how many revolutions per minute gear R makes.

For a hyperbola expressed as frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, the distance from the center to a focus is c, and if the hyperbola's directrix passes through one of the foci of the given parabola, it implies that the focus of the hyperbola is at (-2, 0).

Using the relationship between a, b, and c in a hyperbola, which is c^2 = a^2 + b^2, we can calculate b^2: b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 2^2 - 1^2 = 4 - 1 = 3.

Since we are arranging all 5 notes, n = r = 5, so we have: [ {A}_{5}^{5} = frac{5!}{(5-5)!} = frac{5!}{0!} = 5! = 120 ] 2. **Calculate the number of sequences where 宫 (gong), 角 (jue), and 羽 (yu) must be adjacent**: When these three notes must be adjacent, we can treat them as a single unit. This leaves us with 3 units (the single unit of the three notes together, 商 (shang), and 徵 (zhi)). The number of ways to arrange these 3 units is {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6. Within the single unit, the three notes can be arranged in {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6 ways. Therefore, the total number of sequences where 宫 (gong), 角 (jue), and 羽 (yu) are adjacent is: [ {A}_{3}^{3}{A}_{3}^{3} = 6 times 6 = 36 ] 3. **Calculate the number of sequences with the restriction**: To find the number of sequences where 宫 (gong), 角 (jue), and 羽 (yu) cannot be adjacent to each other, we subtract the number of sequences where they are adjacent from the total number of sequences without restrictions: [ 120 - 36 = 84 ] Therefore, the number of different possible sequences, under the given condition, is boxed{84}."},{"prompt":"The guard detained a stranger and wants to evict him.

Pay the ( x ) coins and stay. 2. Refuse to pay and get expelled. 3. **Analyzing Gains and Losses:** - **Scenario 1: Paying the Bribe (staying)** - The stranger pays ( x ) coins to the watchman. - The friends pay the stranger 100 coins for winning the bet. - Net loss for the stranger: ( x - 100 ) coins. - **Scenario 2: Refusing the Bribe (getting expelled)** - The stranger does not pay ( x ) coins. - The stranger loses 100 coins to the friends for losing the bet. - Net loss for the stranger: 100 coins. 4. **Determining the Maximum Bribe:** - The stranger will opt to pay the bribe only if it results in a lesser net loss compared to being expelled. - Therefore, we need ( x - 100 leq 100 ). - Rearrange to find the maximum ( x ): [ x - 100 leq 100 x leq 200 ] 5. **Optimal Strategy for the Watchman:** - The stranger will be indifferent between paying the bribe and getting expelled if the net losses are equal, i.e., ( x = 200 ): [ x - 100 = 100 200 - 100 = 100 ] - However, to ensure the stranger prefers paying the bribe rather than the outcome of losing the bet, the watchman should demand a bit less: [ text{Max } x < 200 text{ implies maximally } x = 199 ] # Conclusion: The maximum number of coins the watchman can request such that the stranger, acting solely in his best interest, will still opt to pay the bribe rather than be expelled is: [ boxed{199} ]"},{"prompt":"w many terms will there be if the expression (left(4 x^{3} + x^{3} + 2right)^{2016}) is expanded and like terms are combined?","completion":"To determine the total number of terms in the expression ((4x^3 + x^{-3} + 2)^{2016}) when expanded and like terms combined, we follow these steps: 1. **Identify the general term:** From the multinomial expansion, each term in the expansion of ((4x^3 + x^{-3} + 2)^{2016}) will have contributions from the binomial expansions of the form: [ (4x^3)^a (x^{-3})^b (2)^c ] where (a), (b), and (c) are non-negative integers such that: [ a + b + c = 2016 ] 2. **Exponents in combined terms:** The exponent of (x) in each term of the expansion can be found by summing the exponents contributed by each factor: [ 3a - 3b ] Hence, each term in the expansion has an (x) raised to the power of (3(a - b)). 3. **Range of exponents:** Notice that (a) and (b) vary independently between 0 and 2016. The variable combination (3(a - b)) covers a range of integers, with the minimum exponent occurring when (a = 0) and (b = 2016), and the maximum exponent occurring when (a = 2016) and (b = 0). Therefore, the exponents of (x) are: [ 3(a - b) text{ for } a, b in [0, 2016] ] Running from ( -3 times 2016 = -6048 ) to ( 3 times 2016 = 6048 ). 4. **Counting the distinct terms:** Each integer exponent from (-6048) to (6048) appears exactly once in the sum (sum_{a + b + c = 2016} (4x^3)^a (x^{-3})^b 2^c). This range is inclusive, and the total number of distinct integer powers of (x) is: [ 6048 - (-6048) + 1 = 12097 ] 5. **Accounting for positive and negative coefficients:** Since we are dealing with integer exponents covered by the general terms, and considering the constraints (a + b + c = 2016), the term (n) ranges exactly from (-2016) to (+2016). This gives us: [ [-2016, 2016] ] Thus, providing the terms from (-(2016) ) to (+(2016)) yields: [ 2016 + 2016 + 1 = 4033 ] 6. **Conclusion:** The complete expansion contains ( boxed{4033} ) distinct terms upon combining all like terms."},{"prompt":"Dan has 3 left with him after he bought a candy bar for 2..

To do this, we use the Law of Sines, which states that frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}. Rearranging the given equation and substituting the values from the Law of Sines, we are led to the equation (a + c)(c - a) = b(c - b). When we expand and rearrange the terms, we get c^2 + b^2 - a^2 = bc. To find the measure of angle A, we use the formula for cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}. Substituting the derived equation into this formula, we get cos A = frac{1}{2}. Since the angle A is within the interval (0, pi), or (0^circ, 180^circ), this implies that A = frac{pi}{3}, or A = 60^circ. Therefore, the measure of angle A is boxed{frac{pi}{3}}. **(2) Finding the Perimeter of triangle ABC with Given Conditions** Given that a = 2sqrt{3} and the area of triangle ABC, denoted as S_{triangle ABC}, is 2sqrt{3}, we apply the area formula for a triangle: frac{1}{2}absin C. Since from part (1) we found that A = frac{pi}{3} and considering that the area formula can be generalized to frac{1}{2}bcsin A, we substitute A = frac{pi}{3} and get frac{1}{2}bcsin frac{pi}{3} = 2sqrt{3}. From the given condition a^2 = (2sqrt{3})^2 = 12, and using the derived equation c^2 + b^2 - bc = 12, we simplify to find that (b + c)^2 = 3bc + 12. Substituting frac{1}{2}bcsin frac{pi}{3} = 2sqrt{3} and solving for b + c, we find that (b + c)^2 = 36. This implies that b + c = 6. Thus, the perimeter of triangle ABC, which is the sum of its sides a, b, and c, is a + b + c = 2sqrt{3} + 6.

We want to find the number of triangles whose vertices are the vertices of the polygon and which contain the center ( O ). Method I: 1. **Fix the initial vertices and consider diagonals**: - For the diagonal ( A_0A_k ) where ( k leq n ), the triangle ( A_0 A_k A_l ) contains the center ( O ) if and only if ( A_l ) is located within the sector opposite to the segment ( A_0 A_k ). 2. **Determine allowable ( A_l )**: - The line ( O A_0 ) intersects the polygon at vertices ( A_n ) and ( A_{n+1} ), while the line ( O A_k ) intersects at ( A_{n+k} ) and ( A_{n+1+k} ).

Such a triangle can occur if ( A, B, C ) are chosen such that ( AC ) is the longest side and does not split the polygon in a way that the center falls into one of the halves containing vertex ( B ). - Fix a vertex ( A ) and consider the remaining ( n ) vertices in negative circulation (anticlockwise) direction.

Hence, we can set up the equation: frac{1}{2} = frac{4 - lambda}{sqrt{5 + lambda^2} cdot sqrt{6}} Cross-multiplying gives us: sqrt{5 + lambda^2} cdot sqrt{6} = 2(4 - lambda) Square both sides to remove the square roots: (5 + lambda^2) cdot 6 = 4(4 - lambda)^2 Expanding both sides: 6lambda^2 + 30 = 16(1 - 2lambda + lambda^2) Simplifying: 6lambda^2 + 30 = 16 - 32lambda + 16lambda^2 10lambda^2 - 32lambda - 16 + 30 = 0 10lambda^2 - 32lambda + 14 = 0 lambda^2 - frac{32}{10}lambda + frac{14}{10} = 0 lambda^2 - 3.2lambda + 1.4 = 0 Using the quadratic formula: lambda_{1,2} = frac{3.2 pm sqrt{3.2^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1.4}}{2 cdot 1} lambda_{1,2} = frac{3.2 pm sqrt{10.24 - 5.6}}{2} lambda_{1,2} = frac{3.2 pm sqrt{4.64}}{2} lambda_{1,2} = frac{3.2 pm 2.16}{2} We get the two possible values for lambda: lambda_1 = frac{3.2 + 2.16}{2} = frac{5.36}{2} = 2.68 lambda_2 = frac{3.2 - 2.16}{2} = frac{1.04}{2} = 0.52 Upon reviewing this process, it appears there has been an error made when setting up the quadratic equation.

Going back to the step where we simplified the quadratic equation, we see the actual quadratic equation should be: 6lambda^2 + 30 = 4(16 - 8lambda + lambda^2) 6lambda^2 + 30 = 64 - 32lambda + 4lambda^2 2lambda^2 - 32lambda - 34 = 0 Therefore, the correctly simplified form is: lambda^2 - 16lambda - 17 = 0 Applying the quadratic formula accordingly: lambda = frac{16 pm sqrt{16^2 + 4(17)}}{2} lambda = frac{16 pm sqrt{256 + 68}}{2} lambda = frac{16 pm sqrt{324}}{2} lambda = frac{16 pm 18}{2} So, lambda_1 = frac{16 + 18}{2} = frac{34}{2} = 17 and lambda_2 = frac{16 - 18}{2} = frac{-2}{2} = -1.

This gives us the intersection point of the quadratic function with the y-axis as (0,3), indicating that the function has a positive value at x=0. 2. **Finding the Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry of a quadratic function y=ax^2+bx+c is given by x=-frac{b}{2a}. For our function, this translates to x=-frac{-2a}{2a}=1. 3. **Determining the Discriminant Condition**: For the quadratic function to have no real roots and thus not intersect the x-axis (ensuring y is always positive or always negative), the discriminant Delta = b^2 - 4ac must be less than 0. Applying this to our function, we get Delta = (-2a)^2 - 4 cdot a cdot 3 < 0. Simplifying, we find 4a^2 - 12a < 0, which simplifies further to a^2 - 3a < 0, leading to a(a - 3) < 0.

However, this does not inherently disqualify it from forming a basis for space, as the statement suggests. The critical error in the analysis is the assumption that adding linear combinations of basis vectors cannot form another basis, which is incorrect without further justification.

The conclusion that {overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{c}} cannot form a basis for space is incorrect because the vectors being coplanar is not a given. overrightarrow{c} being a linear combination of overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} does not preclude the set from spanning a three-dimensional space if overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are non-collinear.

However, the conclusion that P, A, B, C are not coplanar is based on a specific linear combination and does not fully disprove coplanarity. The analysis of Proposition ③ potentially misinterprets the conditions for coplanarity. **Proposition ② Analysis:** If overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b} cannot form a basis for space with any vector, it implies they are collinear. This is because only collinear vectors lack the span to cover a three-dimensional space, necessitating a third, non-coplanar vector for a complete basis. Thus, Proposition ② is correctly identified as true based on definitions related to vector space bases. **Proposition ① Analysis:** If three non-zero vectors overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{c} cannot form a basis for space, it implies they are coplanar. This is because a set of vectors that cannot span three-dimensional space must be confined to a plane, thus being coplanar. Proposition ① is correctly identified as true based on the principles of vector spaces. **Conclusion:** Propositions ① and ② are true based on the principles of vector spaces and the definitions concerning collinearity and coplanarity.

The standard form of the parabola equation is x^2 = 4py, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. In this case, we have 4p = 12, so p = 3. The vertex of the parabola is at the origin (0,0), so the focus F is at (0, p) = (0, 3). Since P(2, 1) is the midpoint of segment AB, we infer that line l is the horizontal line y = 1. This line intersects the parabola at points A and B such that A and B are symmetric with respect to line y=1. We draw the directrix of the parabola, which is the line y = -3, because for a parabola of the form x^2 = 4py, the directrix is located a distance p below the vertex; hence, here it is y = -p = -3. Draw perpendicular lines from A, B, and P to the directrix, meeting the line at points C, D, and Q, respectively. By the definition of a parabola, the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the perpendicular distance from that point to the directrix. Therefore, |AC| = |AF| and |BD| = |BF|. Since P is the midpoint of AB and y = 1 is parallel to the directrix, PQ is half the distance of AB. Thus, we have: |AF| + |BF| = |AC| + |BD| = 2|PQ|. To find |PQ|, we use the fact that the line y = 1 is 4 units above the directrix y = -3. Since P is on the line y = 1, |PQ| = 4. Thus, the total length is: |AF| + |BF| = 2|PQ| = 2 times 4 = 8.

Third throw: - Janice throws the ball 17 feet higher than Christine's first throw, so Janice's third throw is 20 + 17 = 37 feet high. Since we know the highest throw is 37 feet and it's Janice's third throw, we need to find out how much higher Christine throws on her final throw compared to her second throw to see if she matches or exceeds this height. Let's assume Christine's final throw is x feet higher than her second throw. Her final throw would then be 30 + x feet high.

The number of perfect squares less than or equal to (n) is given by (lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor). For (0.02n) to be an integer, (sqrt{n}) must be an integer, so let (k = sqrt{n}). Then (n = k^2). 3. We need (0.02n = k), so (0.02k^2 = k). Solving for (k), we get: [ 0.02k^2 = k implies k^2 = 50k implies k(k - 50) = 0 ] Thus, (k = 0) or (k = 50).

To solve for (f(lambda) = alpha_{lambda} + beta_{lambda}), we need to analyze the angles formed by (EF) with (AC) and (BD). Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Orthogonality in the Tetrahedron:** Since (ABCD) is a regular tetrahedron, it follows that the line segments (AC) and (BD) are orthogonal, i.e., (AC perp BD). 2. **Parallel Segments Construction:** Draw a line segment (EG) parallel to (AC) such that it intersects (BC) at point (G). Then connect (G) to (F) forming segment (GF). By construction, (alpha_{lambda}) is the angle (angle GEF), and since (frac{CG}{GB} = frac{AE}{EB} = lambda), it follows that (GF) is parallel to (BD). 3. **Orthogonality of Constructed Lines:** Since (GF parallel BD) and (AC perp BD), it follows by transitivity and properties of parallel lines that (GF perp EG). 4. **Angle Composition:** Consequently, (beta_{lambda}) represents the angle (angle EFG). 5. **Sum of Angles in Triangle:** We now use the relationship in the plane triangle (EFG): - The sum of interior angles of a triangle is (180^circ), - Since the line segments (GF) and (EG) are orthogonal, (angle EGF = 90^circ).

The equilateral triangle condition implies combinatorial and geometric considerations based on the number of points and the coloring constraints. 3. **Point Coloring Dynamics**: - Players alternate coloring one of the two adjacent uncolored points. - Vasya's strategy must ensure that an equilateral triangle with uniformly colored vertices eventually forms. 4. **Critical Coloring Step**: Consider that initially, Pete colors the first point ( A ). As the process progresses, the key move for Vasy occurs when 33 points are colored. Suppose ( A ) is one of the endpoints of a segment of consecutive colored points on the circle after 33 moves.

When both pipes are open together, they fill the cistern at a combined rate of (1/12 + 1/15) per minute. To find the combined rate, we need to find a common denominator for 12 and 15, which is 60.

Now, the dealer allows 45 articles to be sold at the cost price of 40 articles. This means the selling price for 45 articles is 40. The cost price for 45 articles would be 45 * 1 = 45. Since the dealer still makes a profit of 20% on the cost price, we can calculate the actual selling price (SP) that includes the profit: Profit = 20% of cost price Profit = 0.20 * 45 Profit = 9 So the actual selling price including profit would be: SP = Cost Price + Profit SP = 45 + 9 SP = 54 But the dealer gives a cash discount of 10%, which means the listed price (LP) is higher than the actual selling price (SP). Let's calculate the listed price: Cash Discount = 10% of listed price 0.10 * LP = SP - Actual SP (after discount) 0.10 * LP = 54 - 40 0.10 * LP = 14 Now, we solve for LP: LP = 14 / 0.10 LP = 140 So, the articles were listed at 140 for 45 articles, which means the listed price per article is 140 / 45 ≈ 3.11. To find out how much percent above the cost price the articles were listed, we compare the listed price per article to the cost price per article: Percentage above cost price = [(Listed Price per article - Cost Price per article) / Cost Price per article] * 100 Percentage above cost price = [(3.11 - 1) / 1] * 100 Percentage above cost price = (2.11 / 1) * 100 Percentage above cost price = 2.11 * 100 Percentage above cost price = 211% Therefore, the articles were listed at boxed{211%} above the cost price."},{"prompt":"Find the remainder R when x^{50} is divided by x^2 4x + 3.

Let's define the possible figures more specifically: - There are three types of figures provided, each containing exactly four cells. - If we use these figures, each one will cover four cells from the 49 cells available. 6. Let’s calculate how many such four-cell figures can be formed: - The total number of figures possible ( n ) is given by dividing the total number of cells by the number of cells per figure, i.e., [ n = frac{49}{4}, ] which is not an integer. Hence, the number of figures formed must be constrained to maintain the grid dimensions. 7. Since 49-48=1, and each three-cell figure covers three cells, the grid can practically have three-cell figures entirely covering 48 cells: - Let’s split the 49 cells: 48 can be perfectly covered by three-cell figures, and the remaining part or cell belongs to four-cell inclusive figure. 8. Analyze the tiling: - We form 1 four-cell figure and 15 three-cell figures, covering all cells: [ 1 times 4 + 15 times 3 = 4 + 45 = 49. ] 9. Given the constraints; - Using more than one four-cell figure: - Assume using k four-cell figures where ( k >1 ): - The required cells must be: (4k), and resolving for ( remaining-remaining=0, or sufficient: exponentially quadratic, not integer(successive requiring). 10. Verify and conclude: - The exact usage where precisely correct. Hence, the conclusion of the analysis shows that only one four-cell figure can be used alongside fifteen three-cell figures to cover the 7 times 7 grid without exceeding or understating the cell count: [ boxed{ text{Only one four-cell figure}}]"},{"prompt":"the following equation, what digits do A, B, C, D, E each represent?

Can at least one grasshopper return to its original point after they make: (a) 12 jumps; (b) 13 jumps? **a)** 1. **First Method:** Step 1: After each \\"move\\", a grasshopper will not jump to the point where the next grasshopper was positioned before. Step 2: Therefore, the next grasshopper will not reach this point in two consecutive jumps. Step 3: Continuing this way, after the 12th jump, the first grasshopper will not reach its initial position. 2. **Second Method:** Step 1: Suppose one of the grasshoppers (let's call it the first grasshopper) returns to its original point A after 12 moves. Step 2: Then the other 11 grasshoppers must have jumped over point A before the first grasshopper returns there. Step 3: However, in one move, no more than one grasshopper can jump over point A, and on the first move, no grasshopper jumps over A. Step 4: Hence there is a contradiction, meaning the assumption that any grasshopper returns to point A is false. **b)** 1. **Initial Setup and Analysis:** Step 1: If, at the beginning, we shift one of the grasshoppers slightly clockwise, then by the first jump, it and the grasshopper after it will jump further, while the others will still jump to their respective midpoints. Step 2: By the second jump, three will jump further, and the others will jump as usual. Step 3: Continuing this process shows that after 13 jumps, all will have jumped further. 2. **Detailed Calculation for 13 Jumps:** Step 1: Number the grasshoppers against the clock (counterclockwise) and shift all except the first one to point O, where the first one sits. Step 2: With this initial setup and consecutive jumps: - The k-th grasshopper will first leave point O on the k-th move, jumping to a point at 1/2^k of the circle's length. - The first grasshopper, after this jump, will be at the same distance from point O but on the opposite side. Step 3: Thus, in the end, on the 13th jump, the first grasshopper returns to point O.

Thus, boxed{text{A: } g(1) = 1} is correct. # For Option B: From f(x+1) = f(-x+1) + 2x, we can write: - frac{f(x+1)}{x} + frac{f(-x+1)}{-x} = 2. Let h(x) = frac{f(x+1)}{x}, then: - h(x) + h(-x) = 2.

From g(x+1) = -g(-x+1) + 2, we deduce: - g(x+2) = -g(-x) + 2. This implies: - g(x+4) = g(x). Therefore, the period of g(x) is 4, not 2, making boxed{text{C: The period of the function } g(x) text{ is } 2} incorrect. # For Option D: Given the period of g(x) is 4, we analyze the sum: - sum_{k=1}^{2024}[g(k)-1][g(k+1)+1].

We need to prove that the point where (NF) intersects (BC) (which is (Q)) is the same where (ME) intersects (BC). 2. **Circularity Properties:** Consider the points (A, N, F, P). By the problem, the quadrilateral (ANFP) is cyclic (i.e., (A, N, F, P) lie on a circle). Therefore, the angles subtended by these points satisfy: [ angle AFQ = 180^circ - angle AFN ] Since (NF) is a perpendicular from (C) to (AP), we have: [ angle AFN = angle APN implies angle AFQ = 180^circ - angle APN ] Note that (angle APN) is equal to (angle APC) because they subtend the same arc AP over the circle: [ angle AFQ = 180^circ - angle APC = angle APC ] 3. **Extension to Cyclic Quadrilaterals:** Similarly, for quadrilateral (AFPE) which is cyclic, we have: [ angle PAB = angle PEF quad text{and} quad angle PED = angle PCD ] 4. **Calculating Angles:** Using the above cyclic properties and congruences, we can establish: [ angle FQB = angle AFQ - angle ABC = angle APC - angle ABC ] Expanding (angle APC): [ angle APC = angle APM + angle MPC ] And using that (P, M, B) is collinear: [ angle APM + angle MPC = angle AMP ] Further, (M) divides (B) in the line (BC), so: [ angle FQB = angle PAB + angle PCD = angle PEF + angle PED = angle DEF ] 5. **Concurring Lines:** If (Q) and (D) didn't coincide, we'd need to check quadrilateral cyclicality involving (F, E, D, Q). In such case, (NF) would intersect the circumcircle of (triangle DEF) at (Q), implying concurrence on (BC). However, if (Q) and (D) coincide, then the concurrency still holds by intersection properties on (BC). 6. **Conclusion Using Orthogonality:** Observing the right angles and the point circle properties: [ angle AEP = angle AFP = angle AMP = angle ANP = 90^circ ] Points (A, N, F, P, E, M) lie on a circle centered at (A).

Applying this to our given information, we get: -tan alpha =frac{1}{3} Step 2: Solve for tan alpha. From the equation above, we can solve for tan alpha: tan alpha =-frac{1}{3} Step 3: Substitute tan alpha into the desired expression. We need to find frac{{sinα+cosα}}{{sinα-cosα}}.

Multiply both sides by (([b]+n-2)cdot([b]+n-1)), assuming these terms are positive for valid values, and find a common denominator: frac{d + n - 2}{[b] + n - 2} - frac{[b] + n - 1 - b}{[b] + n - 1} = frac{(d+n-2) cdot ([b]+n-1) - ([b]+n-2) cdot ([b]+n-1-b)}{([b]+n-2) cdot ([b]+n-1)} 3. **Simplify the Numerator**: Expand and simplify the numerator: (d+n-2) cdot ([b]+n-1) - ([b]+n-2) cdot ([b]+n-1-b) Expanding each term: d cdot ([b]+n-1) + (n-2) cdot ([b]+n-1) - ([b]+n-2) cdot [b] - ([b]+n-2) cdot (n-1-b) Collect like terms: d cdot ([b]+n-1) + n[b] + n(n-1) - 2[b] - 2(n-1) - [b]^2 - bn + [b]b - n(b-2) 4. **Combine and Arrange Terms**: Use the definition of (d) and note that simplifications will occur due to cancelling terms. Replace (d) according to its definition: d = frac{([b] + 1 - b) cdot [b]}{[b] + 1} Thus, d - [b] + b = left( frac{[b]+1-b}{[b]+1}-1 right) cdot [b] + b = b left(1 - frac{[b]}{[b]+1}right) = frac{b}{[b]+1} Rewrite the numerator using: left( frac{b}{[b]+1} right) ( [b] + n - 1) - b = frac{b(n-2)}{[b]+1} 5. **Conclusion of Positive Numerator**: We found that the transformed numerator: frac{b(n-2)}{[b]+1} > 0 quad text{since} quad b > 0, [b] geq 0, text{and} n > 2 Hence, this implies that the original inequality holds true: frac{d+n-2}{[b]+n-2} > frac{[b]+n-1-b}{[b]+n-1} Therefore, the given inequality is confirmed to be true for all positive ( b ) and natural numbers ( n > 2 ).

That would suggest a total of: [ 12 times 11 = 132 text{ soldiers} ] However, there are only 120 soldiers available as mentioned by one of the soldiers. 2. **Identifying the officer's position**: The officer must stand at a point equidistant from all the ranks. A reasonable configuration to consider is the geometric center of a symmetric arrangement of the soldiers. 3. **Visualizing a possible solution**: - One possible arrangement is placing the soldiers in a circular arrangement. Since there have to be 11 soldiers per rank, this implies constructing concentric circles with 11 soldiers in each. - Given there are supposed to be 12 such ranks: - This suggests picturing 12 straight lines (ranks) emanating from the center, each with 11 soldiers distributed along them. - The officer would be positioned at the center, equidistant from the lines emanating. 4. **Evaluating the circular arrangement**: - If the officer stands at the center, each of the 12 lines would touch the circumference of a circle at distinct points that are evenly spaced. - Placing 11 soldiers on each line spanning from the circumference edges inward toward the center would mean each soldier is along one of these radial lines, spreading toward the center – aligning with the radius lines. - Given that 120 soldiers form the lines themselves and one officer at the center, the solution appears feasible as: [ 12 times 10 + 1 (text{officer}) = 120 text{ soldiers} ] 5. **Confirming the feasibility**: Given that all soldiers can fit into a radial arrangement and the officer at the center, the directive is satisfied.

However, the height provided is not the vertical height but the inclined height, which forms an angle of 53 degrees with the base. To find the vertical height (h), we need to use the angle to calculate the perpendicular height from the base to the top of the parallelogram. The vertical height can be found by using the sine of the angle, since the sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side (vertical height in this case) to the hypotenuse (the inclined height given). So, we have: sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse sin(53 degrees) = h / 11 cm To find the vertical height (h), we rearrange the formula: h = 11 cm * sin(53 degrees) Now, we calculate the sine of 53 degrees and then multiply by 11 cm to find the vertical height. h = 11 cm * sin(53 degrees) h ≈ 11 cm * 0.7986 (using a calculator) h ≈ 8.7846 cm Now that we have the vertical height, we can calculate the area of the parallelogram: Area = base * height Area = 21 cm * 8.7846 cm Area ≈ 184.4766 cm² So, the area of the parallelogram is approximately boxed{184.4766} square centimeters."},{"prompt":"Given that the square root of 2a1 is pm 3, the cube root of 3a+b9 is 2, c is the integer part of sqrt{57}, find the square root of a+2b+c.","completion":"To solve the given problem, we start by breaking it down into the equations provided by the problem statement: 1.

The formula for the circumradius R of triangle PAB is [ R = frac{2S}{a + b + c} ] where S is the area of triangle PAB and a, b, and \`c\` are sides of the triangle. 5. **Calculating Values**: - The area of triangle PAB: S_{triangle PAB} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times 2 times 8 = 8 - The perimeter: PA + PB + AB - PA = sqrt{(3-1)^2 + 4^2 + 8^2} = sqrt{4 + 16 + 64} = sqrt{84} = 2sqrt{21} - PB = sqrt{(3+1)^2 + 4^2 + 8^2} = sqrt{16 + 64 + 4} = 2sqrt{21} - AB = 2 6. **Substitute in ( R )**: [ R = frac{2 times 8}{2sqrt{21} + 2sqrt{21} + 2} = frac{16}{4sqrt{21} + 2} ] [ R=frac{16}{2(2sqrt{21} + 1)}=frac{8}{2sqrt{21} + 1} ] 7. **Volume Calculation**: The volume of the sphere with radius: [ r = 3 - sqrt{5} ] [ V = frac{4}{3} pi r^3 = frac{4}{3} pi (3 - sqrt{5})^3 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{4}{3}pi(3-sqrt{5})^3} ]"},{"prompt":"2008, the GDP of Changde was 1050 billion yuan, an increase of 13.2% over the previous year, achieving the goal of exceeding 1000 billion yuan in annual GDP by 2010 proposed by the Municipal Committee and Municipal Government in the Eleventh FiveYear Plan two years ahead of schedule.

Given the conditions x_{1} < 0 and x_{2} > 0, the range of frac{|AM|}{|BN|} is within (0,1), as e^{x_{2}} > 1 for x_{2} > 0.

For example, the cell in the first row and first column is labeled as ((1,1)), while the cell in the eighth row and eighth column is labeled as ((8,8)). 2. **Identifying Colors on the Chessboard**: - The chessboard is an 8x8 grid with alternating black and white squares. Specifically, a cell ((i,j)) on the chessboard is: - **White** if the sum of row and column indices ((i+j)) is odd. - **Black** if the sum of row and column indices ((i+j)) is even. 3. **Non-attacking Rooks**: - We know there are 8 rooks placed on the board such that no two rooks can attack each other. Hence: - Each row contains exactly one rook. - Each column contains exactly one rook. 4. **Sum of Indices**: - Considering all 8 rooks are placed in such a way that one rook is on each row and each column, the sum of the row and column indices where all the rooks stand is: [ 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36 quad text{for row indices} ] [ 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36 quad text{for column indices} ] - Therefore, the total sum of both row and column indices is: [ 36 + 36 = 72 ] 5. **Analyzing the Given Conditions**: - We are given that Vitya sees three rooks on white squares.

This odd nature would make the entire sum inconsistent with the total being even. 8. **Conclusion**: - To satisfy the condition that the total sum of indices is even, there must be at least one more rook on a white square to balance the parity.

How can this be done so that the remaining part of the parallelepiped can be reconstructed from 1 times 1 times 2 parallelepipeds? 1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements**: We need to form a cave within the 5 times 5 times 3 parallelepiped that opens to the surface only at the centers of two adjacent side faces. Additionally, the remaining structure should be able to be composed using 1 times 1 times 2 parallelepipeds. 2. **Strategy**: To figure this out, we'll remove parts from specific layers and ensure the remaining structure fits the given condition. 3. **Layer Analysis**: We will cut horizontal parallelepipeds from each layer. Let's analyze each layer: - **Layer 1 (Bottom Layer)**: Remove cells around the centers of the first layer, leaving openings for the cave: [ begin{array}{cccc} & & & & X & X & & X & X & & & & end{array} ] Here, (X) denotes areas where the cells are preserved. - **Layer 2 (Middle Layer)**: Create the pathway through which the cave will pass: [ begin{array}{cccc} & & & & & & & & & & & end{array} ] Here, nothing is preserved within the central cells indicating a complete hollow space for the cave pathway. - **Layer 3 (Top Layer)**: Again, remove cells around the centers of layers where the cave openings are intended: [ begin{array}{cccc} & & & & X & X & & X & X & & & & end{array} ] Again, (X) denotes areas where cells are preserved. 4. **Filling Vertical Parallelepipeds**: Fill in with vertical parallelepipeds at strategic points to ensure the structure can be reconstructed using 1 times 1 times 2 blocks.

This definition is a stronger condition than the usual convexity, which only requires [ frac{f(x) + f(y)}{2} ge fleft(frac{x + y}{2}right). ] Step 2: Setting Up the Contradiction Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that such a very convex function f exists. Step 3: Analyzing the Inequality Let's consider the case where y = x + 2b and x = a. The inequality becomes: [ frac{f(a) + f(a + 2b)}{2} ge f(a + b) + 2b. ] Rearranging terms, we get: [ left[frac{f(a+2b) - f(a+b)}{b}right] - left[frac{f(a+b) - f(a)}{b}right] ge 4. ] Define g(a) = frac{f(a+b) - f(a)}{b}, which represents the average rate of change of f over the interval from a to a+b. Step 4: Taking the Limit as b to 0 As b approaches zero, g(a) approximates the derivative f'(a), if it exists. The inequality suggests that the difference in these average rates of change over successive intervals of length b is always greater than 4. Summing these inequalities from a to a + kb gives: [ g(a + kb) - g(a) > 4k. ] As k to infty, the left-hand side suggests an unbounded increase, implying that g(a + epsilon) - g(a) to infty as epsilon to 0, which is not possible for any real-valued function f. Step 5: Contradiction from Unbounded Derivative This result implies that the derivative (or the slope of the secant, if the derivative does not exist) becomes unbounded in any neighborhood, contradicting the assumption that f is a real-valued function. Therefore, no such very convex function can exist. Conclusion Since the assumption that such a function exists leads to a contradiction, we conclude that no very convex function exists.

A fox proposed to divide the berries fairly. She can approach two bear cubs and distribute their berries equally between them, and if there is an extra berry, the fox eats it. She continues these actions until all the bear cubs have an equal number of berries. What is the minimum number of berries the fox can leave for the bear cubs?","completion":"We need to determine the smallest number of berries that the bear cubs can be left with after redistributing them equally among all the cubs while following the given rules, including the fox eating any leftover berries during redistribution. Initially, the number of berries each bear cub has follows the sequence: [ 1, 2, 4, 8, ldots, 2^{99} ] These numbers represent the first 100 terms of a geometric progression with the first term (a = 1) and common ratio (r = 2). **Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Berries** The sum ( S ) of the first ( n ) terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the formula: [ S = a frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} ] In our case: - ( a = 1 ) - ( r = 2 ) - ( n = 100 ) Thus, [ S = 1 cdot frac{2^{100} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{100} - 1 ] **Step 2: Understanding Berry Redistribution** The fox can only redistribute the berries between two bear cubs at a time such that each cub ends up with an equal number of berries. If there is an excess berry during such redistribution (i.e., if the sum of berries to be redistributed is odd), the fox eats the leftover berry. The process continues until all bear cubs have an equal number of berries or until no more redistributions are needed. **Step 3: Determine the Minimum Number of Berries Left** To find the smallest number of berries that can be left with each bear cub, notice the following important points: 1. Each redistribution action, as described, does not change the sum of the berries but can reduce the number of cubs with different amounts slowly to a smaller common number. 2. The fox eats any berry that cannot be evenly split during redistribution. 3. When the total number of berries is odd, at least one will be lost during the process since the fox eats it. If it is even, it can be redistributed completely. **Key Insight:** Each bear cub initially receives a number of berries which is a power of 2. Since the total sum ( 2^{100} - 1 ) is odd, it's crucial to recognize that the power of 2 sums and subsequent redistributions will lead the fox to eat a number of berries during the process. **Conclusion:** We need to find out the minimal number of berries per bear cub when it is even possible for them to have the same number. Important cases such as: - All cubs started with different counts which lead to common splitting patterns. Finally, through interpretive structuring and careful methodical checking, the conclusion derived is that even through intense redistributive processes, the cubs will get the total evenly checked from the initial setup with the smallest possible number reflecting essentially deriving consistent equal result each factor to the situation. # Final Minimum Quantity: After the process, we infer: [boxed{100 text{ berries}}]"},{"prompt":"Let left(a_{n}right)_{n geq 0} be the sequence of rational numbers with a_{0}=2016 and a_{n+1}=a_{n}+frac{2}{a_{n}} for all n geq 0.

This means that [ a_n + frac{2}{a_n} = left(frac{r}{s}right)^2 ] where r and s are positive integers with gcd(r, s) = 1. Therefore, we must have: [ a_n^2 - left(frac{r}{s}right)^2 a_n + 2 = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in terms of a_n. The discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square because a_n is rational. Thus, [ Delta = left(frac{r}{s}right)^4 - 8 = frac{r^4 - 8s^4}{s^4} ] Since a_n is rational, r^4 - 8s^4 must be a perfect square. Hence, we write this as: [ r^4 - 8s^4 = w^2 quad text{with} quad gcd(r, s) = 1, quad r, s, w in mathbb{N}. ] 2. **Minimal Solution and Parity:** We need to show that this equation r^4 - 8s^4 = w^2 has no solutions for s neq 0. Let's consider a solution (r, s, w) with the smallest s > 0. Since r^4 - 8s^4 = w^2, both r and w must have the same parity. Let g = gcd(r, w). Then: [ g^2 mid 8s^4 quad text{and since} quad gcd(r, s) = 1 Rightarrow g^2 mid 8 Rightarrow g in {1, 2}. ] 3. **Exclusion of g = 2:** Let's exclude the case when g = 2. If g = 2, we can write r = 2r' and w = 2w' with gcd(r', w') = 1. Since gcd(r, s) = 1, s must be odd. Therefore: [ 4r'^4 - 8s^4 = 4w'^2 Rightarrow r'^4 - 2s^4 = w'^2. ] This implies w'^2 is even, and thus w' must be even. If w' = 2w'', then r'^4 - 2s^4 = 4w''^2 which implies: [ r'^4 = 2s^4 + 4w''^2. ] Since this result is incompatible and s cannot be even, this leads to a contradiction. 4. **Factoring the Equation:** Assuming gcd(r, w) = 1, we factorize the equation: [ left(r^2 - wright)left(r^2 + wright) = 8s^4. ] Given r equiv w pmod{2} and gcd(r, w) = 1: [ gcdleft(r^2 - w, r^2 + wright) = gcdleft(r^2 - w, 2wright) = gcdleft(r^2 - w, 2right) = 2. ] 5. **Possible Factor Cases:** Hence, there exist coprime integers a and b with a odd such that: [ begin{aligned} & r^2 - w = 2a^4, & r^2 + w = 4b^4, end{aligned} ] or [ begin{aligned} & r^2 - w = 4b^4, & r^2 + w = 2a^4. end{aligned} ] 6. **Summing and Halving the Equations:** By summing and halving either pair of these equations: [ r^2 = a^4 + 2b^4 quad text{and} quad gcd(a, b) = 1 quad text{with} quad a equiv 1 pmod{2}. ] We note that a cdot b = s. 7. **Impossible Parity Requirements:** From this relation, it follows directly: [ r equiv a equiv 1 pmod{2} Rightarrow r^2 equiv a^4 equiv 1 pmod{4} Rightarrow b text{ must be even.} ] Given that gcd(a, 2b^4) = 1 Rightarrow gcd(a, r) = 1, we rewrite this: [ left(r - a^2right) left(r + a^2right) = 2b^4. ] Since gcdleft(r - a^2, r + a^2right) = gcdleft(r - a^2, 2rright) = 2, we find suitable integers x and y (with x odd) such that: [ begin{aligned} & r - a^2 = 2x^4, & r + a^2 = (2y)^4, end{aligned} ] or: [ begin{aligned} & r - a^2 = (2y)^4, & r + a^2 = 2x^4. end{aligned} ] 8. **Further Factorization:** Finally, factorizing the above, we obtain: [ pm a^2 = x^4 - 8y^4, quad gcd(x, y) = 1, quad x equiv 1 pmod{2}. ] Given that b = 2xy, substituting s = 2axy yields a new solution to the equation with 0 < y < s, which contradicts the minimality assumption of s. 9. **Conclusion:** Since a_0 = 2016 is not a perfect square, the sequence does not contain any squares of rational numbers.

Each line segment's endpoints must sum to one of the new sequence of five consecutive natural numbers. Let these consecutive numbers be denoted as (n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4). 5. Considering the symmetry and the given conditions: - The sum of the numbers at the five vertices must be counted twice when summed over all the line segments. - This means that the total sum, denoted as (T), of all the individual sums along each line segment is: [ T = 2 times (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 2 times 15 = 30 ] 6.

This can be factored as (x-3)(x+2)leqslant 0. By analyzing the inequality, we find that the roots of the equation x^{2}-x-6=0 are x=3 and x=-2. Considering the nature of a quadratic equation, the inequality holds between its roots, so we get -2leqslant xleqslant 3. Therefore, the set A can be described as A={x|-2leqslant xleqslant 3}. Next, we need to determine the set B. Given B={y|y=|x|+1}, we know that the absolute value function |x| ensures that all values of x are transformed into non-negative values before 1 is added. This means that the smallest value of y in set B is 1, when x=0. Therefore, the set B can be described as B={y|ygeqslant 1}. To find the intersection Acap B, we need to find the common elements between sets A and B. Since A includes values of x from -2 to 3, and B includes values of y starting from 1 (which corresponds to the absolute value of x plus 1), the intersection will start from the smallest positive value of x in A that satisfies B, which is 0, giving y=1, and go up to the largest value of x in A, which is 3, giving y=|3|+1=4. However, since we are considering y=|x|+1, the maximum value in the intersection that y can take is 3+1=4. But, considering the definition of set B more carefully, it actually represents all y values generated by the transformation of x values in A through y=|x|+1. Therefore, the upper limit should be reconsidered based on the x values directly, leading to a maximum y value of 3 when x=3 or x=-3. However, since x=-3 is not within the bounds of A, the maximum y value generated by x values in A is indeed 4 when x=3. But, to correct the interpretation, we focus on the intersection of A and B based on the conditions given, which leads us to reconsider the output of the intersection based on the values directly allowed by both sets. Given the corrected understanding, the intersection Acap B should actually reflect the values of x in A that, when transformed through |x|+1, result in values that are also in B. Since B starts from y=1, and considering the nature of |x|, the intersection effectively starts from x=0 (yielding y=1) and includes all x values up to 3 (yielding y=4 when x=3). Thus, the correct interpretation of the intersection based on the conditions and the transformation y=|x|+1 should focus on the x values that, when transformed, yield y values in the range starting from 1. Given this analysis, the intersection Acap B is correctly identified based on the range of x values in A that satisfy the condition for B through the transformation y=|x|+1.

His bike cost 80 and the repairs cost 25% of what his bike cost. After the repairs are paid for, 1/5 of the money he'd earned remains. Given that all customers purchasing apples from Reginald took advantage of the promotional discount, how many apples did he sell?","completion":"First, let's calculate the cost of the bike repairs. The repairs cost 25% of the bike's original price, which was 80. Repair cost = 25% of 80 Repair cost = 0.25 * 80 Repair cost = 20 Now, let's find out how much money Reginald made after paying for the repairs. We know that 1/5 of his earnings remain after paying for the repairs. Let's call the total amount he earned E. E - 20 = 1/5 * E To solve for E, we multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction: 5 * (E - 20) = E 5E - 100 = E Now, we subtract E from both sides to get: 4E = 100 Divide both sides by 4 to find E: E = 100 / 4 E = 25 So, Reginald earned 25 after paying for the repairs. Since this is 1/5 of his total earnings, we can calculate his total earnings before the repairs: Total earnings before repairs = 5 * 25 Total earnings before repairs = 125 Now, let's find out how many apples he sold. We know that for every 5 apples sold, the customer gets 1 additional apple for free. So for every 6 apples, the customer pays for 5. The price per apple is 1.25, so for every 6 apples, the customer pays: 5 apples * 1.25/apple = 6.25 Now, we'll divide the total earnings before repairs by the price paid for every 6 apples to find out how many sets of 6 apples were sold: Number of sets of 6 apples sold = Total earnings before repairs / Price per set of 6 apples Number of sets of 6 apples sold = 125 / 6.25 Number of sets of 6 apples sold = 20 Since each set includes 6 apples, we multiply the number of sets by 6 to find the total number of apples sold: Total apples sold = Number of sets of 6 apples sold * 6 Total apples sold = 20 * 6 Total apples sold = 120 Reginald sold boxed{120} apples."},{"prompt":"f onethird of onefourth of a number is 15, what is the fraction of that number that equals 54?","completion":"Let's call the number we're looking for \\"N\\".

Consider a convex n-gon. In a convex polygon, all internal angles are less than 180^circ. The sum of the internal angles of an n-gon is given by the well-known formula in geometry: [ (n-2) times 180^circ ] 2. Now, observe that the external angle of a polygon is formed by extending one side of the polygon and measuring the angle between the extended side and the side adjacent to it. Importantly, an external angle and its corresponding internal angle add up to 180^circ. Hence, if theta_i denotes the internal angle and theta_i' denotes the corresponding external angle, we have: [ theta_i + theta_i' = 180^circ ] 3. Given this relationship, the sum of an internal angle and its corresponding external angle for all n angles is: [ sum_{i=1}^n (theta_i + theta_i') = n times 180^circ ] 4. Using the formula for the sum of internal angles, we know: [ sum_{i=1}^n theta_i = (n-2) times 180^circ ] 5. Substituting this back into the equation for the sum of internal and external angles: [ (n-2) times 180^circ + sum_{i=1}^n theta_i' = n times 180^circ ] 6.

The convex hull M will encapsulate N entirely, meaning every external angle of N at points where N coincides with M is either equal to or greater than the corresponding external angle at the same vertex for M because an internal angle smaller than 180^circ in N leads to an external angle greater than that of more polygonal nature (still collectively forming no less than 360^circ).

Consider triangles ( A A_1 D_1 ) and ( C C_1 B_1 ): - Since ( A A_1 D_1 ) and ( C C_1 B_1 ) are congruent by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) criteria (they share the side and the two angles adjacent to it are equal), we have: [ triangle A A_1 D_1 cong triangle C C_1 B_1 ] - Therefore, the corresponding sides are equal: [ AD_1 = CB_1 ] 4.

Let the coordinates of the points where these lines intersect the parabola be A (x_1, y_1) and B (x_2, y_2). The equations of lines PA and PB, considering they pass through (a, b) and slope m, can be written in the standard form of the line equation. 3.

Next, line AB's equation can be given by substituting the coordinates of A and B into the line formula: [ b y = 2(x + a) ] 7. To determine R, we realize R is the intersection of AB with the x-axis (y = 0): [ b cdot 0 = 2(x + a) implies x = -a ] 8.

Given widehat{CDB} = 40^circ. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Calculate widehat{CDA}:** Since D is the midpoint of AB and we are given widehat{CDB} = 40^circ, the angle at D on the other side is: [ widehat{CDA} = 180^circ - widehat{CDB} = 180^circ - 40^circ = 140^circ. ] 2. **Sum of Angles in Triangle triangle ADC:** In any triangle, the sum of the angles is 180^circ. Hence, for triangle ADC, [ widehat{CAD} + widehat{CDA} + widehat{DCA} = 180^circ. ] Substituting the known values: [ 20^circ + 140^circ + widehat{DCA} = 180^circ. ] 3. **Calculate widehat{DCA}:** Solving for widehat{DCA}, we get: [ widehat{DCA} = 180^circ - 20^circ - 140^circ = 20^circ. ] Since widehat{CAD} = 20^circ and widehat{DCA} = 20^circ, triangle ADC is isosceles with AD = DC. 4. **Isosceles Properties in triangle CDB:** Knowing triangle ADC is isosceles, it implies that AD = DC. Since D is also the midpoint of AB, we have DB = DA and DA = DC. This means triangle CDB is also isosceles. 5. **Angles in Isosceles Triangle triangle CDB:** In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Therefore, let widehat{DBC} = widehat{DCB}. Since widehat{CDB} = 40^circ, the sum of angles in triangle CDB: [ 2widehat{DBC} + widehat{CDB} = 180^circ. ] [ 2widehat{DBC} + 40^circ = 180^circ. ] 6. **Calculate widehat{DBC}:** Solving for widehat{DBC}, [ 2widehat{DBC} = 180^circ - 40^circ = 140^circ. ] [ widehat{DBC} = frac{140^circ}{2} = 70^circ. ] Since widehat{ABC} is equal to the calculated widehat{DBC}, Conclusion: Therefore, [ boxed{70^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"10 boxes, place pingpong balls such that the number of balls in each box is at least 11, not equal to 17, not a multiple of 6, and all numbers are distinct.

Specifically, since (DH) is the height of the pyramid and (AH perp BC), we can deduce: [ DA perp BC ] 6. **Repeat the above steps for other vertices:** - Similarly, consider other projections and use the properties of orthocenters: - For line segment (DB), where (BH) is perpendicular to (AC), it follows that: [ BH perp AC Rightarrow DB perp AC ] - For line segment (DC), where (CH) is perpendicular to (AB), it follows that: [ CH perp AB Rightarrow DC perp AB ] 7. **Conclusion:** - Since (DA perp BC), (DB perp AC), and (DC perp AB), it follows that the opposite edges of the pyramid (ABCD) are pairwise perpendicular.

What is the maximum number of marked points that lie on one circle?","completion":"1. We start with a regular polygon having 1976 sides (1976-gon). We know that in this problem, the midpoints of all the sides and the midpoints of all the diagonals of this polygon are marked. 2. Let's first consider the midpoints of the sides. Since there are 1976 sides, we will have 1976 midpoints, one for each side. 3. Next, we consider the midpoints of the diagonals of the polygon. In a (n)-sided polygon (or (n)-gon), the total number of diagonals is given by: [ text{Number of diagonals} = frac{n(n-3)}{2} ] For (n = 1976), the number of diagonals is: [ frac{1976(1976 - 3)}{2} = frac{1976 cdot 1973}{2} = 1952 cdot 1973 = 1930528 ] Therefore, there are (1930528) diagonals in a 1976-gon, and thus, there are (1930528) midpoints of these diagonals. 4. Each marked midpoint of the sides and the midpoints of the diagonals will lie on the circumference of circles due to the symmetry of the polygon. Each of these circles is centered at the center (O) of the 1976-gon and passes through all midpoints of a particular set of sides or diagonals. 5. There are a total of 987 such circles centered at (O) (where (987) represents half of 1976 due to opposite pairs of sides and diagonals being treated symmetrically). These circles contain the marked points we are interested in. 6. We are interested in the maximum number of these marked points that can lie on any single circle. Each circle contains 1976 marked points because there are 1976 midpoints for either sides or diagonals. Therefore, all the marked points except the center (O) lie on a circle. 7. Any other circle (gamma) that intersects these 987 circles will intersect each of these initial circles in exactly two points (since circles generally intersect in two points). 8. Consequently, if we count the intersection points of (gamma) with each of these 987 circles, we have: [ 987 cdot 2 = 1974 ] Additionally, (gamma) may pass through the center (O), adding one more marked point to (gamma). Thus, the total number of marked points that can lie on any such circle (gamma) is no more than: [ 1974 + 1 = 1975 ] Therefore, on any one circle (gamma) other than the 1976 circles centered at (O), at most 1975 marked points lie. 9. Thus, the maximum number of marked points that can lie on one circle is the total number of midpoints of the sides of the 1976-gon, which is 1976.
