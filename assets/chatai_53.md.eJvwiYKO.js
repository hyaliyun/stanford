Then there must be some cell ((i, j)) with (R) engraved on it such that its successor ((i+1, j-1)) has (U) engraved on it. This would imply a conflict at cell ((i+1, j)), which is a contradiction. 4. **Claim 2: Salty Cell on the Main Bread Crust:** The last cell (salty cell) lies on the main bread crust. - **Proof:** Suppose otherwise. Then all cells on the main bread crust have the same character engraved on them. However, the top-left cell ((1, 1)) and the bottom-right cell ((n, n)) must have (R) and (U) engraved on them respectively to avoid conflict at ((1, 1)). This implies that the main bread crust cells are engraved with (R)s, then the salty cell, and (U)s. 5. **Reformulation as a Graph Problem:** Let (G) be a directed graph over ({1, 2, dots, n}) with vertices (a) and (b) such that: - For all vertices (1 leq i < a), there is an edge (i mapsto i+b+1). - For all vertices (a < i leq n), there is an edge (i mapsto i+b) (modulo (n)). - If (G) is Hamiltonian, then (a) is odd. 6. **Proof of the Graph Problem:** - If (a > b), replace (a) with (n+1-a) and (b) with (n+1-b) and reverse the Hamiltonian (G) to reduce to (a leq b). - Since there is no edge leading out of (a), it must be the end of the Hamiltonian path, and there is no edge leading into (b+1). - When (a leq b), consider the process modulo (n-1) with (a) \\"deleted\\". Adding exactly (b) each time, we must have visited (n+a-b-1) before (a). - This implies (n+a-b-1 equiv (n-1)b pmod{(n-1)}), leading to (a-b equiv 0 pmod{(n-1)}). - Since adding (b) covers all residues, (gcd(b, n-1) = 1). Thus, (a equiv b pmod{(n-1)}) and (a) and (n-1) are relatively prime. Since (n-1) is even, (a) is odd. 7. **Conclusion:** The salty cell was ((a, n+1-a)). Since (a) is odd, both coordinates are odd.

Since the library is located halfway between his house and school, the distance from his house to the library is D/2 km. The boy travels to the library at a speed of 3 km/hr, so the time taken to reach the library is (D/2) / 3 hours. After spending 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours) at the library, he continues to school at a speed of 2.5 km/hr. The remaining distance to school is also D/2 km, so the time taken to reach school from the library is (D/2) / 2.5 hours.

The total time for the entire trip is the sum of all these times, which is given as 5 hours and 30 minutes (or 5.5 hours). Therefore, we can write the equation: (D/2) / 3 + 0.5 + (D/2) / 2.5 + D / 2 = 5.5 To solve for D, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

We want to determine if it's possible for the entire 101 times 101 grid to be covered with black cells, except for one corner cell remaining white. 2. **Conceptual Approach:** To solve this, recognize that any 101 times 101 square without one corner cell can be derived from using a grid stamp with particular properties. We conceptualize the grid and the printed area systematically. 3. **Mathematical Setup:** Consider a square of dimensions (2N + 1) times (2N + 1) without one corner cell. Throughout, we'll use the specific case where N = 50, thus making the grid dimensions 101 times 101. We will employ the grid stamping technique where a grid of 2N times 2N can be completed by combining it with stripes of dimensions 1 times 2N.

Since ( p ) and ( q ) are primes, they can be either 2 or 3 modulo 3. If both ( p ) and ( q ) are not equal to 3, then they must be 2 modulo 3. However, ( 2^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ), so: [ 1 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{3} ] which cannot be equal to ( n^2 pmod{3} ) since ( n^2 equiv 0 ) or ( 1 pmod{3} ). Therefore, one of ( p ) or ( q ) must be 3. 4. Without loss of generality, assume ( p = 3 ). Substituting ( p = 3 ) into the original equation, we get: [ 3(3 + 3) + q(q + 3) = n(n + 3) ] Simplifying, we have: [ 18 + q(q + 3) = n(n + 3) ] 5. Rearrange the equation to solve for ( n ): [ n^2 + 3n - q^2 - 3q - 18 = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in ( n ). The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for ( n ) to be an integer: [ Delta = 9 + 4(q^2 + 3q + 18) = 4q^2 + 12q + 81 ] Let ( Delta = k^2 ) for some integer ( k ). Then: [ k^2 = 4q^2 + 12q + 81 ] 6. Rearrange to form a difference of squares: [ k^2 - 81 = 4q^2 + 12q ] [ (k - 9)(k + 9) = 4q(q + 3) ] 7. We need to find integer solutions for ( k ) and ( q ). By trial and error, we find that ( k = 11 ) and ( q = 2 ) works: [ (11 - 9)(11 + 9) = 2 cdot 5 cdot 4 = 40 ] [ 2 cdot 20 = 40 ] 8. Substituting ( q = 2 ) back into the equation: [ 18 + 2(2 + 3) = n(n + 3) ] [ 18 + 10 = n(n + 3) ] [ 28 = n(n + 3) ] 9. Solving the quadratic equation: [ n^2 + 3n - 28 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula: [ n = frac{-3 pm sqrt{9 + 112}}{2} = frac{-3 pm 11}{2} ] [ n = 4 quad text{or} quad n = -7 ] Since ( n ) must be a positive integer, we have ( n = 4 ). 10. Therefore, the only solution is: [ (p, q, n) = (3, 2, 4) ] The final answer is (boxed{(3, 2, 4)})."},{"prompt":"The cashier of a savings bank paid out an amount of money, which is an integer multiple of 50 mathrm{Ft}, in banknotes to a depositor.

They are 200 meters apart before meeting, so the equation representing their positions relative to each other is: [120x - 200(x-5) = 200] Expanding and solving for x: [ begin{align*} 120x - 200x + 1000 &= 200 -80x &= -800 x &= 10 end{align*} ] Thus, A departs 10 minutes before the two people are 200 meters apart in this scenario. # Scenario 2: After Meeting For the situation where they are 200 meters apart after meeting, we use a similar approach. Let x again be the number of minutes A has been traveling by the time they are 200 meters apart. The equation for their positions relative to each other in this case is: [200(x-5) - 120x = 200] Expanding and solving for x: [ begin{align*} 200x - 1000 - 120x &= 200 80x &= 1200 x &= 15 end{align*} ] Therefore, A departs 15 minutes before the two people are 200 meters apart in this scenario. Combining both scenarios, the two possible minute marks after A departs when they are 200 meters apart are 10 minutes and 15 minutes.

The difference between the two sides starting from vertex A: b - c, 2. The length of the angle bisector from vertex A: f_a, 3. The length A O where O is the center of the inscribed circle. Here is a structured approach using geometric properties: Step-by-Step Construction: 1. **Initial Setup:** - Assume the problem is solved, and label the vertices of the triangle as A, B, C. - Let the endpoint of the angle bisector from A on side BC be denoted as A_1. - We are given the lengths: A A_1 = f_a, A O = u, and b - c = d. 2. **Apollonius Circle Properties:** - According to the Angle Bisector Theorem, the lengths BA and BA_1, and CA and CA_1 satisfy: [ frac{BA}{BA_1} = frac{u}{v} = frac{CA}{CA_1} ] - This implies that B and C lie on the Apollonius circle, which has points at distances A and A_1 in the ratio u : v. 3. **Reflection Properties:** - The Apollonius circle passes through O because its diameter O P is positioned such that: [ P A : P A_1 = u : v ] - Reflecting point B across the angle bisector requires creating a new point B' such that B' C = b - c = d. 4. **Circle Construction and Intersection:** - Construct the Apollonius circle ensuring it passes through O and such that its center lies on the line A A_1 = f_a. - Draw a line segment of length d (the given difference b - c) as a chord in this circle. - Find the tangent from point A to this derived circle (this tangent intersects the Apollonius circle at points B' and C). 5. **Identification of Points:** - Join C to A_1. - The point where this line meets the Apollonius circle is the required third vertex B of the triangle. Conditions for Solutions: 1. The necessary condition for the construction to be valid is: [ u < f_a < 2u ] This ensures that the segments and the diameter circle requirements are physically possible. 2. Another condition involving the radius r of the Apollonius circle: [ d leq frac{2uv}{u - v} ] This must be satisfied to ensure the difference b - c falls appropriately within the geometric constraints. Verification: - Prove that the constructed segments satisfy the angle bisector properties: - B O should bisect angle B A_1 A. - C O should bisect angle C A_1 A. Verifying these ensures that A O is indeed the angle bisector of angle B A C. # Conclusion: Given the thorough verification and provided conditions, the triangle can be constructed with the stated properties.

However, the problem states that none of the boxes' contents match their labels. 2. Let's denote the boxes by their labels as BB, ЧЧ, and БЧ. Because the content of each box does not correspond to its label, we must deduce the actual content by drawing only one ball from any box. 3. To find the content of all boxes logically, let's start from the box labeled \\"БЧ,\\" which should contain either two white balls or two black balls, but not one white and one black ball due to the mismatch condition. 4. **Case 1:** Suppose we draw a ball from the box labeled \\"БЧ\\" and it is white. - This implies this box must contain both white balls, because the content cannot be a mix (one white and one black). - Now, the real content of the box labeled \\"БЧ\\" is two white balls. - Hence, the labels of the other two boxes must also be incorrectly assigned. 5. Examine the remaining boxes: - The box labeled \\"ЧЧ\\" must contain either two black balls or one white and one black ball. Since the label says two white balls and it is incorrect, the content must be one white and one black ball. - Thus, we conclude the box labeled \\"ЧЧ\\" contains one white and one black ball. 6.

Following through the same analysis for the rest of the boxes: - The box labeled \\"ЧЧ\\" contains one white and one black ball. - The box labeled \\"BB\\" thus contains two white balls.

For the first function, y = -x. As x increases (towards 0), y decreases because the negative sign inverts the direction of growth. For example, if x changes from -2 to -1, then y changes from 2 to 1, showing a decrease. 2. For the second function, y = x. As x increases, y also increases directly in proportion. For instance, if x changes from -2 to -1, then y changes from -2 to -1, showing an increase. 3. For the third function, y = dfrac{1}{x}. As x increases (towards 0), y becomes more negative at an increasing rate, indicating that y decreases. For example, if x changes from -2 to -1, y changes from -dfrac{1}{2} to -1, showing a decrease. 4. For the fourth function, y = x^{2}. As x increases, y also increases because squaring a negative number results in a positive number, and the value of y becomes larger as x moves towards 0. For example, if x changes from -2 to -1, y changes from 4 to 1, but in the context of y decreasing as x increases, we consider the direction of change rather than the values. The confusion arises from the phrasing; to clarify, as x increases (becomes less negative), the output of x^2 actually decreases in the sense that it approaches 0, which is a decrease in the function's growth rate, not the absolute value. Therefore, for functions ①y = -x, ③y = dfrac{1}{x}, and ④y = x^{2}, y decreases as x increases when x < 0. For function ②y = x, y increases as x increases. Thus, the correct answer is boxed{C}, which indicates that 3 functions have y decreasing as x increases when x < 0."},{"prompt":"a 8 times 8 grid, each cell is filled with a natural number. It is allowed to select a 3 times 3 or 4 times 4 square subgrid each time and increment all numbers within that subgrid by 1. Can you make all the numbers in the grid divisible by 10 through a finite number of such operations?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given an 8 times 8 grid where each cell initially contains a natural number. The allowed operations are to select a 3 times 3 or 4 times 4 sub-grid and increment each number in the sub-grid by 1. The task is to determine whether it is possible, through a finite number of such operations, to make all numbers in the grid divisible by 10. 2. **Rethinking the Problem Modulo 10:** Since we want all numbers to be divisible by 10, we only need to consider the last digit of each number. This reduces the problem to a grid where each cell contains a digit between 0 and 9. Our aim then is to see if we can make all digits zero. 3. **Transformations in a Smaller Problem:** Define the grid transformation as changing the digit in all cells of a selected 3 times 3 or 4 times 4 sub-grid by adding 1 to each digit, modulo 10. We need to determine whether we can transform any initial grid into a grid where every cell contains the digit 0, starting from some other arbitrary configuration. 4. **Counting Possible Configurations:** The total number of different configurations for an 8 times 8 grid where each cell contains one digit is: [ 10^{64} ] This is because there are 64 cells, each of which can have one of 10 different values (0 through 9). 5. **Counting the Number of Available Transformations:** Consider the transformations one can make. In an 8 times 8 grid: - There are 36 different 3 times 3 sub-grids. - There are 25 different 4 times 4 sub-grids. Therefore, the total number of possible selections for sub-grids is: [ 36 + 25 = 61 ] Each sub-grid transformation does not change the parity of its cells’ values. Each such transformation can be applied at most 9 times (as applying it 10 times leaves the grid unchanged modulo 10). 6. **Comparing Total Configurations vs. Reachable Configurations:** Starting from a grid full of zeros, you can only reach: [ 10^{61} ] distinct configurations (as each of the 61 different transformations can be applied in 10 different ways, but considering modulo constraints reduces effective distinct transformations). Thus, the number of configurations one can achieve from an initial grid with all zeros (considering allowed operations) is far less than the ( 10^{64} ) possible grids. Hence, there must be grids that cannot be reached from this all zero grid with any number of operations. 7. **Conclusion:** Since it is not possible to reach every possible configuration from the \\"all zeros\\" grid, it is also not possible to guarantee transforming any arbitrary grid to the \\"all zeros\\" grid. Therefore, it is not possible to ensure that every number in the grid can be divisible by 10 through the given finite number of operations.

If they together can complete a work in 18 days, and A takes 45 days to complete the work alone, what is the ratio of their capacities to do work?","completion":"Let's denote the capacity of A to do work as A and the capacity of B to do work as B. The ratio of their capacities to do work is A:B. Since A can complete the work alone in 45 days, we can say that A's work rate is 1/45 (work/day). When A and B work together, they can complete the work in 18 days. Therefore, their combined work rate is 1/18 (work/day). We can express the combined work rate as the sum of A's and B's individual work rates: A + B = 1/18 We already know that A's work rate is 1/45, so we can substitute that into the equation: 1/45 + B = 1/18 Now, we need to solve for B's work rate. To do this, we'll subtract A's work rate from the combined work rate: B = 1/18 - 1/45 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 45 is 90, so we'll convert both fractions to have a denominator of 90: B = (5/90) - (2/90) B = 3/90 B = 1/30 So, B's work rate is 1/30 (work/day). Now, we have the work rates of A and B: A's work rate = 1/45 B's work rate = 1/30 To find the ratio of their capacities to do work, we can simply take the inverse of their work rates, since capacity is directly proportional to the amount of work one can do in a given time: Ratio of capacities A:B = (45/1) : (30/1) Ratio of capacities A:B = 45:30 We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 15: Ratio of capacities A:B = (45/15) : (30/15) Ratio of capacities A:B = 3:2 Therefore, the ratio of their capacities to do work is boxed{3:2} ."},{"prompt":"a music festival, there are 50 participants consisting of 22 women, 18 men, and 10 children.

The problem asks if the goat can circle around the tree and return to the stake such that the end of the rope aligns with its start. 3. When the goat circles around the tree and approaches the stake, the rope will partially lie on the surface of the tree. The remaining part of the rope will consist of two straight segments. 4. To determine if the goat can make it around the tree and back to the stake, we must calculate the minimum necessary length of the rope to do so. 5. Consider the geometry: - Distance from the stake to the tree surface: (d = 1 text{ meter}) - Radius of the tree trunk: (R = 0.5 text{ meters}) - Total length of the rope: (L = 4.7 text{ meters}) 6.

We can do this by dividing 999 by 7. 999 ÷ 7 = 142 with a remainder of 5. So the last multiple of 7 before 1000 would be 999 - 5 = 994. Now we can find the number of multiples of 7 between 903 and 994 by subtracting the smaller multiple from the larger one and then dividing by 7. 994 - 903 = 91 91 ÷ 7 = 13 So there are 13 multiples of 7 between 903 and 994, inclusive.

First, we need to determine how many odd numbers there are up to 25. Since every other number is odd, we can find the count of odd numbers by dividing 25 by 2 and rounding up (since 25 itself is an odd number). Count of odd numbers = (25 + 1) / 2 = 26 / 2 = 13 Now we can use the formula to find the sum: Sum = k^2 = 13^2 = 169 So, the sum of the consecutive odd integers from 1 to 25 is boxed{169} ."},{"prompt":"Given that triangle ABC has an internal angle of 120^circ and that the lengths of its sides form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, the area of △ABC is ______ .","completion":"Let's denote the sides of the triangle as x-2, x, and x+2, where x is the middle term of the arithmetic sequence. We start by noting that the problem refers to an arithmetic progression (AP) for the sides of the triangle, which implies there are three sides in sequence: a smaller side (x-2), a middle side x, and a larger side (x+2). Knowing that one of the internal angles is 120^circ, and using the law of cosines, which states that for any triangle ABC with sides a, b, and c opposite angles A, B, and C respectively, we have: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos(C), we can relate the sides of the triangle to the cosine of the 120^circ angle. Substituting the given angle and expressing cos120^circ with the respective sides, we have: cos(120^circ) = frac{(x)^2 + (x - 2)^2 - (x + 2)^2}{2cdot xcdot (x - 2)} = -frac{1}{2}. Simplifying the equation: x^2 + (x - 2)^2 - (x + 2)^2 = -(xcdot (x - 2)), x^2 + x^2 - 4x + 4 - (x^2 + 4x + 4) = -x^2 + 2x, x^2 - 8x = -x^2 + 2x, 2x^2 - 10x = 0. Dividing through by 2, we get: x^2 - 5x = 0, x(x - 5) = 0. This yields two solutions, x = 0 and x = 5. However, x = 0 is not possible as it would lead to non-positive side lengths. Therefore, the middle side of the triangle is x = 5. Now we can determine the side lengths of the triangle: 3, 5, and 7. To compute the area of the triangle, we use the formula: text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}.

This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with axes lengths of 2 and 4. For the line l with parametric equations begin{cases} x=1+tcos alpha y=2+tsin alpha end{cases}, we need to eliminate the parameter t. Observe that x-1 = tcos alpha and y-2 = tsin alpha. Dividing these equations side by side, assuming cos alpha neq 0, gives us frac{x-1}{cos alpha} = frac{y-2}{sin alpha} implies sin alpha (x-1) = cos alpha (y-2). Rearranging gives the rectangular coordinate equation of the line: sin alpha cdot x - cos alpha cdot y = 2cos alpha - sin alpha. (2) Substituting the parametric equations of line l into the equation of the ellipse gives: frac {(2+tsin alpha)^2}{16} + frac {(1+tcos alpha)^2}{4} = 1.

Let ( S ) be the set of vertices which aren't on the path. By assumption, ( |S| geq 2 ). Call a vertex ( v_i ) on the path **social** if it is connected to at least one vertex in ( S ). Otherwise, call ( v_i ) **antisocial**. - For each ( 1 leq i leq k-1 ), at least one of ( v_i ) or ( v_{i+1} ) is antisocial. Otherwise, we could enlarge the path by traveling from ( v_1 ) to ( v_i ), then going from ( v_i ) to ( S ), then exiting ( S ) to ( v_{i+1} ), and finally traveling to ( v_k ). - Both ( v_1 ) and ( v_k ) must be antisocial, otherwise we can directly lengthen the path by adding an edge from ( v_1 ) or ( v_k ). - All antisocial vertices are connected to each other and all vertices in ( S ) are connected to each other. If ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) are antisocial, we can apply the condition on ( v_i, v_j, a, b ) for ( a, b in S ) (since ( |S| geq 2 )). - If there are no social vertices, then our graph is simply the union of two complete graphs, and we can satisfy the desired requirement by taking one city in each part. - Suppose ( v_i ) is social, where ( i ) is the minimal such ( i ). If ( a ) is connected to ( v_i ) for ( a in S ), then ( av_iv_{i-1}v_{i-2} cdots v_1 v_{i+1} v_{i+2} cdots v_k ) is a longer path, where we used the fact that ( v_1 v_{i+1} ) is an edge since both are antisocial (( v_{i+1} ) is antisocial because otherwise ( v_i ) and ( v_{i+1} ) would both be social).

This means each antisocial vertex ( w ) is connected with all other antisocial vertices, except possibly one. - If there are no social vertices, then ( v ) has degree 0 and there are 99 antisocial vertices. There must be an antisocial vertex ( t ) with even degree, and since all antisocial vertices have degree at least 97, it must have degree 98. In other words, ( t ) is connected to all antisocial vertices, and the problem is solved by taking ( v ) and ( t ). - Suppose there exists some social vertex, say ( v_i ). Then ( i notin {1, 99} ). Also, ( v_{i-1} ) and ( v_{i+1} ) must both be antisocial, else we can \\"insert\\" ( v ) into the path again. - We cannot have ( i-1 = 1 ) and ( i+1 = 99 ), so assume ( i-1 neq 1 ) by symmetry. Since ( v_{99} ) can only be disconnected with at most one other antisocial vertex, at least one of ( v_{i-1}v_{99} ) or ( v_1v_{99} ) is an edge. - If ( v_{i-1} v_{99} ) is an edge, then the path ( v v_i v_{i+1} v_{i+2} cdots v_{99} v_{i-1} v_{i-2} cdots v_1 ) is Hamiltonian, contradiction. - If ( v_1v_{99} ) is an edge, then the path ( v v_i v_{i+1} cdots v_{99} v_1 v_2 cdots v_{i-1} ) is Hamiltonian, contradiction. - Hence, there is no social vertex, and we're done in this case as well.

Malvina, Paulina, and Georgina each received one card. After sharing the values, only Malvina could identify her function. We need to determine the sum of all possible values on Malvina's card. 2. **Analyzing the conditions**: - Since Malvina could identify her function, the values on the other two cards must be such that they could not distinguish between ( sin x ), ( cos x ), and ( tan x ). - This implies that the values on the other two cards must be equal, as this would make it impossible for Paulina and Georgina to distinguish their functions. 3. **Case 1: ( sin x = cos x )**: - If ( sin x = cos x ), then ( x = frac{pi}{4} ) (or 45 degrees). - For ( x = frac{pi}{4} ), we have: [ sin frac{pi}{4} = cos frac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] - The value of ( tan frac{pi}{4} = 1 ). - Therefore, Malvina's card could have the value ( 1 ). 4. **Case 2: ( cos x = tan x )**: - If ( cos x = tan x ), then: [ tan x = frac{sin x}{cos x} implies cos^2 x = sin x ] - Using the Pythagorean identity ( sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1 ): [ sin^2 x + sin x = 1 implies sin^2 x + sin x - 1 = 0 ] - Solving this quadratic equation for ( sin x ): [ sin x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{5}}{2} ] - Since ( sin x ) must be positive and between 0 and 1 for an acute angle: [ sin x = frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ] - Therefore, Malvina's card could have the value ( frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ). 5. **Case 3: ( tan x = sin x )**: - If ( tan x = sin x ), then: [ sin x = frac{sin x}{cos x} implies cos x = 1 ] - This is not possible for an acute angle since ( cos x = 1 ) only when ( x = 0 ) degrees, which is not acute. 6. **Summing the possible values**: - The possible values on Malvina's card are ( 1 ) and ( frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ). - Summing these values: [ 1 + frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} = frac{2}{2} + frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{2} = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ] The final answer is ( boxed{frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}} )."},{"prompt":"What fraction of frac{3}{4} is frac{2}{9}?","completion":"To find what fraction of frac{3}{4} is frac{2}{9}, we need to compute frac{frac{2}{9}}{frac{3}{4}}.

For a prime ( p ), and non-negative integers ( n ) and ( k ) with base ( p ) representations ( n = n_m n_{m-1} ldots n_0 ) and ( k = k_m k_{m-1} ldots k_0 ), the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{k} ) modulo ( p ) is given by: [ binom{n}{k} equiv prod_{i=0}^{m} binom{n_i}{k_i} pmod{p} ] For ( p = 2 ), the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{k} ) is odd if and only if each ( k_i leq n_i ). 3. **Binary Representation:** Convert 2008 and 2009 to binary: [ 2008_{10} = 11111011000_2 ] [ 2009_{10} = 11111011001_2 ] 4. **Counting Odd Binomial Coefficients:** To find the number of odd binomial coefficients in row 2008, we need to count the number of ( k ) such that ( binom{2008}{k} ) is odd.

To confirm that ( g(y) ) takes all values greater than 6, we need to show that for any ( c > 6 ), the equation ( frac{2}{y} + frac{9}{2} y = c ) has a solution in ( (0, 1] ). 6. Rearrange the equation: [ frac{9}{2} y^2 - cy + 2 = 0. ] The discriminant of this quadratic equation is: [ Delta = c^2 - 36. ] Since ( c > 6 ), ( Delta > 0 ), meaning that there are two real roots. 7. As the sum of the roots is ( frac{2c}{9} ) (positive) and their product is ( frac{4}{9} ), both roots are positive, and at least one must lie in ( (0, 1] ). 8.

W + S + T + F = 979 We can substitute the value of F into equation 4: W + S + T + 199 = 979 Now, we can solve for W + S + T: W + S + T = 979 - 199 W + S + T = 780 We can also express S and T in terms of W using equations 1 and 2: S = W - 53 T = W - 79 Now, let's substitute these into the equation for W + S + T: W + (W - 53) + (W - 79) = 780 3W - 132 = 780 3W = 780 + 132 3W = 912 W = 912 / 3 W = 304 So, the winner received 304 votes.

Prove that it is impossible to organize a duty schedule such that any two people are on duty together exactly once.","completion":"1. **Introduce the problem:** We need to prove that it's impossible to organize the schedule for a group of 100 people, where 3 people are on duty each evening, such that every pair of people is on duty together exactly once. 2. **Theoretical background:** This type of scheduling problem is known in combinatorial design theory. Specifically, it relates to the concept of Steiner triple systems, which are detailed in references such as [58] and [64]. 3. **Consider one member of the group:** Let's denote one member of this 100-member group as ( A ). 4. **Analyze the duties involving member A:** If such a scheme were possible, then the 99 remaining members would each have to team up with ( A ) exactly once during their duties. 5. **Pairing the remaining members:** This suggests that the 99 other members must be grouped in pairs, and each pair must have shared the duty with ( A ). However, forming such pairs is impossible because 99 is an odd number, and thus it cannot be divided exactly into pairs. 6. **Mathematical proof:** The idea proceeds as follows: - If we attempt to create pairs from 99 individuals, we would have 49 pairs plus one individual left unmatched. - If each pair is meant to be on duty with ( A ), we would have an incomplete pairing suggesting at least one individual would have to repeat, which contradicts the problem statement that each pair must be on duty exactly once without repetition. 7. **Formulate the contradiction:** - Let's consider the total number of pairs that can be formed from 100 people. - There are (binom{100}{2}) = 4950 total unique pairs. - If each pair of the 100 people is to be on duty exactly once, and we need each duty to consist of 3 people, we consider the combinations: - The number of ways to pick 3 from 100 is (binom{100}{3}). - Each selection of 3 consists of (binom{3}{2}) = 3 pairs. - So, the number of groups of 3 needed to cover all pairs is ( frac{4950}{3} = 1650 ). 8. **Double checking with combinatorial design:** By applying combinatorial design theory: - In a Steiner system, a balanced incomplete block design is one where every pair of elements occurs in exactly one block. - For a Steiner triple system, the number of elements must be either ( n equiv 1 pmod{6} ) or ( n equiv 3 pmod{6} ). 9. **Check compliance with Steiner system:** ( 100 mod 6 = 4 ), which does not satisfy the necessary condition for forming a Steiner triple system. 10. **Conclusion:** Since 100 does not align with the structural requirements of a Steiner system and because 99 can't be paired evenly, the described scheduling system is indeed impossible.

This implies that ( k ) must be such that ( k ) and 2022 are coprime (i.e., (gcd(k, 2022) = 1)).

Our goal is to count the number of ways to choose four vertices such that they form an isosceles trapezoid. An isosceles trapezoid has one axis of symmetry that passes through the midpoints of the parallel sides. 1. **Identifying Axes of Symmetry**: - Observe that since we have a regular 22-gon, any symmetric four-sided figure inscribed in it will have an axis of symmetry. - We can categorize these axes of symmetry into two types: - _Type 1_: Axes that pass through a pair of opposite vertices. - _Type 2_: Axes that do not pass through any vertices but through the midpoints of segments joining opposite edges. 2. **Counting all 4-gons with each type of symmetry**: - Consider all possible n = 22/2 = 11 pairs of opposite vertices (type 1 symmetry axes). - For each pair of opposite vertices, choose any two vertices from the remaining 10 vertices on one side of the axis. - The number of ways to choose these two vertices is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{10}{2} ). - This results in ( binom{10}{2} = frac{10 cdot 9}{2} = 45 ) choices for each pair of opposite vertices. - Thus, total number of 4-gons for type 1 symmetry: [ 11 cdot 45 = 495 ] - Consider all possible 11 symmetry axes (type 2). - For each type 2 symmetry axis, choose any two points out of 11 on one side of the axis. - The number of ways to choose two points out of 10 on one side is still given by ( binom{10}{2} ). - This results in ( binom{10}{2} = frac{10 cdot 9}{2} = 45 ) choices for each midpoint axis. - Thus, total number of 4-gons specific to type 2 axes: [ 11 cdot 45 = 495 ] 3. **Avoid Counting Rectangles**: - Rectangles have two axes of symmetry, one passing through a pair of vertices, and the other passing through the midpoints of opposite sides. - We need to consider each rectangle once.

The distance from the center to a vertex of the hexagon is the circumradius (r) of the base: [ r = a = frac{1}{2} ] The space diagonal (d) connecting the center of the base to the top vertex is the radius (R) of the sphere and is given by: [ R = sqrt{r^2 + (frac{h}{2})^2} = sqrt{ left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2 } ] Simplifying: [ R = sqrt{ left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right)^2} = sqrt{frac{1}{4} + frac{3}{4}} = sqrt{1} = 1 ] 5. **Determine the Volume of the Sphere:** The volume (V) of the sphere is: [ V_{text{sphere}} = frac{4}{3} pi R^3 ] Substituting (R = 1) into the formula: [ V_{text{sphere}} = frac{4}{3} pi (1)^3 = frac{4}{3} pi ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{4}{3} pi} ]"},{"prompt":"Given sets [A = left{ t mid t, text{ such that } left{ x mid x^2 + 2tx 4t 3 neq 0 right} = mathbf{R} right}] [B = left{ t mid t, text{ such that } left{ x mid x^2 + 2tx 2t = 0 right} neq varnothing right}] where (x) and (t) are real numbers, find (A cap B).","completion":"Given the sets: [ A = left{ t mid left{ x mid x^2 + 2tx - 4t - 3 neq 0 right} = mathbb{R} right} ] [ B = left{ t mid left{ x mid x^2 + 2tx - 2t = 0 right} neq varnothing right}, ] where (x) and (t) are real numbers.

Suppose there exist two integers k_1 and k_2 such that the values of ( sin left( frac{k_1 pi}{sqrt{3}} right) ) and ( sin left( frac{k_2 pi}{sqrt{3}} right) ) are equal. 2. According to the periodic property of the sine function, if these two values are equal: [ sin left( frac{k_1 pi}{sqrt{3}} right) = sin left( frac{k_2 pi}{sqrt{3}} right) ] 3. This equality implies: [ frac{k_1 pi}{sqrt{3}} = n pi pm frac{k_2 pi}{sqrt{3}} ] for some integer n. Rearranging the equation, we have: [ frac{k_1 pi}{sqrt{3}} = n pi pm frac{k_2 pi}{sqrt{3}} ] 4.

The total number of balls in the bag is 100, and we know that there are 20 white, 30 green, 10 yellow, and 37 red balls. So the total number of balls that are neither red nor purple is the sum of white, green, and yellow balls, which is 20 + 30 + 10 = 60. The probability that a randomly chosen ball will be neither red nor purple is given as 0.6 (or 60%). This probability is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (balls that are neither red nor purple) by the total number of possible outcomes (total balls in the bag). So we have the equation: (Number of balls that are neither red nor purple) / (Total number of balls) = Probability of neither red nor purple 60 / 100 = 0.6 Since we already know this is true from the problem statement, we can now calculate the number of purple balls. The total number of balls that are red or purple is the complement of the balls that are neither red nor purple. Since the probability of neither red nor purple is 0.6, the probability of red or purple is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. Now we can calculate the number of red or purple balls: 0.4 * 100 = 40 We know there are 37 red balls, so the number of purple balls is: 40 (red or purple balls) - 37 (red balls) = 3 (purple balls) Therefore, there are boxed{3} purple balls in the bag."},{"prompt":"A total of 290 yuan was spent on buying instant noodles and sausages for all students in the class.

The key to solving this problem is to calculate the total amount of money needed for each student. Let's denote the number of students as x.

So, we calculate this minimum value: [y(1) = (1)^2 - 2(1) - 3 = 1 - 2 - 3 = -4.] Next, we evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval to ensure we capture the maximum value within the specified range of x: - At x = -2, [y(-2) = (-2)^2 - 2(-2) - 3 = 4 + 4 - 3 = 5.] - At x = 2, [y(2) = (2)^2 - 2(2) - 3 = 4 - 4 - 3 = -3.] Since the axis of symmetry is within the interval and the parabola opens upwards, the minimum value at x = 1 is -4, and the maximum value within the interval occurs at x = -2 which is 5. Therefore, the function's range for -2leqslant x leqslant 2 is: [boxed{left[-4,5right]}.]"},{"prompt":"For the inequality system about x: left{begin{array}{l}{2x1≤5}{xm＞0}end{array}right., there are exactly three integer solutions.

So, the amount he got from selling the PlayStation is the difference between the total cost and the amount he paid out of his pocket: Amount from PlayStation sale = Total cost - Amount paid out of pocket Amount from PlayStation sale = 900 - 580 Amount from PlayStation sale = 320 Now, let's find out the percentage less he sold the PlayStation for.

To show this, observe that: - Both triangle AKM and triangle ABM share the angle at A. - The angle angle AKM is a right angle, as KM is perpendicular to AC. - Hence, triangle AKM sim triangle ABM by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. 4. Consider the fact that triangle AKM and triangle ABM are similar. This similarity implies that corresponding angles in these triangles are equal. Therefore, angle angle AMK is equal to angle angle ABM. 5. Because K is the midpoint of AB, segment AK is half the length of segment AB, and M being the foot of the perpendicular from K onto AC, ensures that point M lies on the circle with diameter BC. 6. The crucial observation here is that every point M we obtain from dropping the perpendicular from K (midpoint of AB) to AC lies on the circle formed with diameter BC. The angle subtended by BC in a semicircle is a right angle, which confirms that such points M indeed lie on this circle. 7.

What is the measure of the opposite angle?","completion":"To find the measure of the angle opposite to the side of the triangle that is equal to the radius of its circumcircle, let's analyze the given problem step-by-step with a geometric approach and properties of triangles. 1. **Identify the Given Elements**: - Let the triangle be ( triangle ABC ). - Let ( R ) be the radius of the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ). - One side of the triangle is equal to the circumradius ( R ). Without loss of generality, let this side be ( BC = R ). 2. **Locate the Central Angle**: By the definition of a circumcircle, the center ( O ) of the circumcircle is equidistant from all vertices of the triangle, i.e., ( OA = OB = OC = R ). 3. **Apply the Extended Law of Sines**: The Extended Law of Sines states that in any triangle: [ frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} = 2R ] where ( a, b, c ) are the lengths of the sides opposite to the angles ( A, B, C ) respectively. 4. **Focus on the Angle ( A )**: Since ( BC = a = R ), we use the formula: [ a = 2R sin A Rightarrow R = 2R sin A ] Divide both sides by ( 2R ): [ sin A = frac{1}{2} ] 5. **Determine the Angle from the Sine Value**: The angle ( A ) whose sine is ( frac{1}{2} ) is known to be ( 30^circ ): [ A = 30^circ ] 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the measure of the angle opposite the side that equals the circumradius is: [ boxed{30^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"Ryan wants to take 5 peanut butter sandwiches to the beach.

By Vieta's Theorem for the roots of the quadratic equation (a x^{2}+2 b x+c), we know: [ x_{1} x_{2} = frac{c}{a} ] Therefore, to show that the roots have different signs, it suffices to prove the inequality (a c < 0). 3.

Here, the length of a path is the number of edges it has. We will use induction on ( n geq 2 ). 1. **Base Case:** For ( n = 2 ), the graph ( G ) must have more than ( frac{2k}{2} = k ) edges. Since the maximum number of edges between two vertices is 1, this case is trivial and does not apply. We start with ( n geq 3 ). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for any graph with ( n-1 ) vertices and more than ( frac{(n-1)k}{2} ) edges, there exists a path of length ( k+1 ). 3. **Inductive Step:** Consider a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices and more than ( frac{nk}{2} ) edges. We can assume ( G ) is connected; otherwise, we can consider its connected components separately. 4. **Vertex Removal:** Let ( v ) be any vertex in ( G ). The graph ( G - {v} ) has ( n-1 ) vertices. By the inductive hypothesis, if ( e(G - {v}) > frac{(n-1)k}{2} ), then ( G - {v} ) contains a path of length ( k+1 ). 5. **Degree Condition:** Suppose ( e(G - {v}) leq frac{(n-1)k}{2} ).

Our goal is to find a contradiction based on this assumption. 2. **Prime Factorization:** Suppose (m) is an integer such that (sqrt{frac{n}{3}} < m leq n-2) and let (p) be the smallest prime factor of (m^2 + m + n).

Consider (P_n(x)) having integer roots (r_{n,1}, r_{n,2}, ldots, r_{n,n}). 2. **Product of roots**: By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of the polynomial (P_n(x)) (which is (x^n + x^{n-1} + ldots + x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c)) is given by: [ (-1)^{n} c = r_{n,1} r_{n,2} cdots r_{n,n} ] Since (c) is non-zero, none of the roots can be zero. 3. **Bound the roots that are not (pm 1)**: Consider the number of roots that are not equal to 1 or -1. Let (k) be the number of such roots. Since the polynomial's remaining roots must be 1 or -1, we have: [ |c| geq 2^k ] This is because the absolute value of each root not equal to ±1 must be at least 2. 4. **Polynomials evaluated at 1 and -1**: Evaluate the polynomial at (x = 1): [ P_n(1) = 1^n + 1^{n-1} + 1^{n-2} + cdots + 1^3 + a cdot 1^2 + b cdot 1 + c ] [ = n - 2 + a + b + c ] 5. **Sign of the polynomial at (x = 1)**: Since we suspect some roots to be (1) or (-1), assume (n) is large enough so that: [ n > 2 + |a| + |b| + |c| ] This results in: [ P_n(1) = n - 2 + a + b + c > 0 ] Therefore, for sufficiently large (n), (P_n(1) > 0). 6. **Roots predominantly (-1)**: Consequently, this means that (-1) must be a root at least (n - k) times as (P_n(1)) cannot account for all (n) roots being 1. 7. **Evaluate the sum of the roots**: Let (S) be the sum of the roots. From Vieta’s formulas, (S = -1): For large (n), if most of the roots are -1, it leads to: [ S = r_{n,1} + r_{n,2} + cdots + r_{n,n} ] 8. **Bounding the magnitude of one positive root**: There must be a positive root (r). Considering the largest root (M = max (|a|, |b|, |c|)), for sufficiently large (n > 10), terms like (x^n), (a x^2), (x^{n-1}), (b x), (x^{n-2}), and (c) are strictly positive. Hence, (r leq M), indicating that: [ S leq (-1 cdot (n-k)) + k M ] 9. **Conclusion from the sum of roots**: For sufficiently large (n), [ S = -1 ] This would lead to (S < -2) for large (n), resulting in a contradiction. # Conclusion Hence, it is impossible for the polynomial (P_n(x)) to have (n) integer roots for all (n geq 4).

If he is 45% short of the price, that means he has 55% of the 100 needed for the new tank. 55% of 100 is: 0.55 * 100 = 55 This 55 is the profit he made from selling goldfish. Now, let's calculate the profit he makes per goldfish sold. The profit per goldfish is the selling price minus the buying price: 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.50 Now, we can calculate how many goldfish he sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per goldfish: 55 / 0.50 = 110 goldfish So, the owner sold boxed{110} goldfish that week."},{"prompt":"A board 180 cm long is cut into three pieces.

The length of the longest piece is equal to the sum of the other two pieces increased by 30 cm: L = (M + S) + 30 cm 3. The length of the medium piece is half that of the longest piece, decreased by 10 cm: M = (L/2) - 10 cm Now, let's use these equations to solve for the lengths of the pieces. From equation 2, we can express S in terms of L: S = L - 30 cm - M Substitute S in equation 1 with the expression from above: L + M + (L - 30 cm - M) = 180 cm 2L - 30 cm = 180 cm 2L = 210 cm L = 105 cm Now that we have the length of the longest piece (L), we can find the length of the medium piece (M) using equation 3: M = (105 cm / 2) - 10 cm M = 52.5 cm - 10 cm M = 42.5 cm Finally, we can find the length of the shortest piece (S) using the expression we found earlier: S = 105 cm - 30 cm - 42.5 cm S = 75 cm - 42.5 cm S = 32.5 cm So, the lengths of the pieces are: Longest piece (L) = 105 cm Medium piece (M) = 42.5 cm Shortest piece (S) = boxed{32.5} cm"},{"prompt":"Two right circular cones share a common base plane, axis, and apex, with their vertex angles in the ratio 1:2.

Determine the vertex angle of each cone and the angle formed by the generators of the smaller cone when projected by the planes of projection of the larger cone if alpha and beta are given.","completion":"Step 1: Define basic components and projections Let’s start by defining the components of the two conical sections: - The apex of both cones is denoted as ( C ). - The center of the base circle of the bigger cone is denoted as ( O ). - The slant heights (generators) of the bigger cone are ( CP_2 ) and ( CQ_2 ). - The points ( P_1 ) and ( Q_1 ) are defined such that ( P_1 ) and ( Q_1 ) are points on the base circle of the smaller cone, and they are the projections of ( P_2 ) and ( Q_2 ) respectively. Additionally, denote the following angles: - The half-angle of the larger cone ( angle P_2CO = varphi ). - The half-angle of the smaller cone ( angle P_1CO = varphi/2 ). - The angle between generators ( CP_1 ) and ( CQ_1 ) is ( angle P_1CQ_1 = x ). - The given angle between ( CP_2 ) and ( CQ_2 ) is ( angle P_2CQ_2 = alpha ). - The angle between the projections of ( CP_2 ) and ( CQ_2 ) on the base circle plane is ( beta ). Step 2: Derive relationships using trigonometric identities By considering the right triangle ( CPO ), projective relationships can be established. Using trigonometric properties of sine and cosine, we analyze the triangles formed: [ sin varphi = frac{OP_2}{CP_2} ] And knowing ( OP_2 ) and ( CP_2 ) in terms of other parameters, we can write: [ sin varphi = frac{P_2Q_2 cdot (2 sin frac{beta}{2})}{P_2Q_2 cdot (2 sin frac{alpha}{2})} ] Thus, simplifying the above ratio, we get: [ sin varphi = frac{sin frac{alpha}{2}}{sin frac{beta}{2}} ] Step 3: Solve for the smaller cone's half-angle Now using the smaller half-angle, replace (varphi) with ( varphi/2 ) in our defined trigonometric relationship: [ sin frac{varphi}{2} = frac{sin frac{x}{2}}{sin frac{beta}{2}} ] Solving for ( x ), realizing an extension for the definition of sine, we have: [ sin frac{x}{2} = sin frac{beta}{2} cdot sin frac{varphi}{2} ] Step 4: Address constraints and confirm real cone properties Given the constraints provided: [ 0^circ < alpha < beta < 180^circ ] We conclude that the value of sine is indeed between 0 and 1 ensuring one specific solution. Step 5: Determine more straightforward relationships using cosine and tangent Using the cosine relationship enhancement: [ cos varphi = sqrt{1 - sin^2 varphi} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{sin^2 frac{alpha}{2}}{sin^2 frac{beta}{2}}right)} = sqrt{frac{cos alpha - cos beta}{1 - cos beta}} ] Using the simpler relationships based on tangent: [ tan frac{varphi}{2} = frac{sqrt{1 - cos beta} - sqrt{cos alpha - cos beta}}{sqrt{1 - cos alpha}} ] Transcribing and simplifying, we get: [ cos x = frac{1}{2}(1 + cos beta + sqrt{(1 - cos beta)(cos alpha - cos beta)}) ] Ensuring the correctness concludes the proof.

Field 1: 13.86 hectares = 13.86 * 10,000 = 138,600 square meters Field 2: 21.54 hectares = 21.54 * 10,000 = 215,400 square meters Field 3: 9.42 hectares = 9.42 * 10,000 = 94,200 square meters The area (A) of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.

The lines AL and BC intersect at P, BM and CA intersect at Q, and CN and AB intersect at R. We are to prove that P, Q, and R are collinear. 1. Let's denote: - The semi-perimeter of triangle ABC as s, - The circumradius as R, - The inradius as r. 2. We begin by examining point T, where the angle bisector of angle A meets BC, making use of some known properties of triangle centers and reflections: [ AT = frac{2R sin B sin C}{sin left(frac{A}{2} + Cright)} ] 3. Next, we use the double reflection property for point D concerning line EF. The key step here is: [ DL = 2DX = 4r sin angle DEF sin angle DFE ] By expressing the angles in terms of the triangle’s internal angles: [ sin angle DEF = sin left( frac{A + C}{2} right) quad text{and} quad sin angle DFE = sin left( frac{A + B}{2} right) ] Which gets us: [ DL = 4r sin left( frac{A + C}{2} right) sin left( frac{A + B}{2} right) ] 4.

How many ways that we can fill the table with {0,1} such that two neighbor squares (have one common side) have product which is equal to 0 ?","completion":"To solve the problem of filling a (4 times 4) table with ({0,1}) such that two neighboring squares (sharing a common side) have a product equal to (0), we need to ensure that no two adjacent squares both contain (1). This means that each (1) must be surrounded by (0)s. 1. **Define the Problem in Terms of Columns:** Let's denote the columns of the (4 times 4) table as (C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4). Each column can be represented as a 4-tuple of ({0,1}). 2. **Constraints on Columns:** For any column (C_i), the entries must be such that no two adjacent entries are both (1). This means each column must be a valid configuration where no two (1)s are adjacent. 3. **Valid Column Configurations:** We need to count the number of valid configurations for a single column. A column can be represented as a 4-tuple ((a, b, c, d)) where (a, b, c, d in {0, 1}) and no two adjacent entries are both (1). The valid configurations for a single column are: - (0, 0, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 0, 1) - (0, 0, 1, 0) - (0, 1, 0, 0) - (1, 0, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 1, 1) - (0, 1, 0, 1) - (0, 1, 1, 0) - (1, 0, 0, 1) - (1, 0, 1, 0) - (1, 1, 0, 0) There are 11 valid configurations for a single column. 4. **Transition Between Columns:** The next step is to determine how these columns can transition from one to the next while maintaining the constraint that no two adjacent squares (in the same row) both contain (1). For example, if the first column is ((0, 0, 0, 0)), the second column can be any of the 11 valid configurations. If the first column is ((0, 0, 0, 1)), the second column must have (0) in the last position to avoid having two (1)s adjacent in the same row. 5. **Recursive Formula:** Let (a_n) be the number of ways to fill the (n)-th column such that the constraints are satisfied. The recursive formula for (a_{n+1}) can be derived based on the valid transitions from the (n)-th column to the ((n+1))-th column. The recursive formula is: [ a_{n+1} = a_n + 2b_n + 2c_n + 2d_n + e_n ] where (a_n, b_n, c_n, d_n, e_n) represent the counts of specific valid configurations in the (n)-th column. 6. **Sequence and Final Count:** The sequence of valid configurations for the (4 times 4) table is given by the OEIS sequence [A051737](http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A051737).

( overrightarrow{BC} + overrightarrow{CD} + overrightarrow{EC} = overrightarrow{AC} ) - ( overrightarrow{BC} + overrightarrow{CD} = overrightarrow{BD} ) because vector addition is associative. - Next, we note ( overrightarrow{DM} = overrightarrow{EC} ) since (DEF) is part of the regular hexagon and vectors along the sides of a regular hexagon are equivalent. - Thus, adding vectors, we get ( overrightarrow{BD} + overrightarrow{DM} = overrightarrow{BM} = overrightarrow{AC} ). Therefore, ( overrightarrow{BC} + overrightarrow{CD} + overrightarrow{EC} = overrightarrow{AC} ), which is correct. 2. ( 2 overrightarrow{BC} + overrightarrow{1C} = overrightarrow{AC} ) - First, consider that ( 2 overrightarrow{BC} = overrightarrow{BN} ) where (N) is a point such that (B) to (N) covers two segments in the hexagon (essentially moving from (B) to (N)). - Then, if (N) is such point, ( overrightarrow{NM} = overrightarrow{DC} ). Thus, ( overrightarrow{BN} + overrightarrow{NM} = overrightarrow{BM} = overrightarrow{AC} ). Therefore, ( 2 overrightarrow{BC} + overrightarrow{1C} = overrightarrow{AC} ), which is again correct. 3. ( overrightarrow{FE} + overrightarrow{ED} = overrightarrow{AC} ) - Notice ( overrightarrow{FE} ) and ( overrightarrow{ED} ) are parts of the hexagon and adding these vectors results in linear traversal from (F) to (O), which in our hexagon, correlates perfectly to (A) to (C). Hence, ( overrightarrow{FE} + overrightarrow{ED} = overrightarrow{FO} = overrightarrow{AC} ) is correct. 4. ( overrightarrow{BC} - overrightarrow{BA} = overrightarrow{AC} ) - Recognize that in a regular hexagon, subtracting the vector ( overrightarrow{BA} ) from ( overrightarrow{BC} ) is equivalent to moving from (B) to (C) directly normalized by ( overrightarrow{A}), ensuring counter-clockwise direction. - As vector subtraction works similar to adding the reverse vector, this confirms ( overrightarrow{BC} - overrightarrow{BA} = overrightarrow{AC} ) also holds true.

Therefore, the number of games she initially owned plus the number of games she received as gifts equals 30: [ G + 20 = 30 ] To find the number of games Radhika initially owned (( G )), we can solve for ( G ): [ G = 30 - 20 ] [ G = 10 ] So, Radhika initially owned 10 games. The ratio of the number of games she initially owned (( G )) to the number of games she was given as gifts (20) is: [ frac{G}{text{gifts}} = frac{10}{20} ] This ratio can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 10: [ frac{10}{20} = frac{1}{2} ] Therefore, the ratio of the number of games Radhika initially owned to the number of games she was given as gifts is boxed{1:2} ."},{"prompt":"Determine the real numbers p and q such that 2^{p x+q}=p cdot 2^{x}+q for every real number x.","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: Given the equation to solve for real numbers ( p ) and ( q ): [ 2^{px + q} = p cdot 2^x + q quad text{for all real } x. ] 2. **Evaluate at Specific Values**: Since the equality holds for all ( x ), it must hold for specific values ( x = 0, 1, 2 ) as well.

Then we can write: [ x = da quad text{and} quad y = db ] where ( a ) and ( b ) are coprime (since ( d = text{GCD}(x, y) )). Also, we know that: [ text{LCM}(x, y) = frac{xy}{text{GCD}(x, y)} = frac{dab}{d} = dab ] Our equation then becomes: [ d + dab - (da + db) = 2021 ] [ d + dab - da - db = 2021 ] Factoring out ( d ) from the terms involving it, we get: [ d(1 + ab - a - b) = 2021 ] Analyzing the parity (even or odd nature) of the equation: 1. If both ( x ) and ( y ) are even: - ( text{GCD}(x, y) ) and ( text{LCM}(x, y) ) are both even. - Sum of ( x ) and ( y ) is even. - An even number minus an even number is even. - Thus, ( d(1 + ab - a - b) ), which equals 2021, is even.

We start by expressing ( overline{BE} ) in terms of the basic vectors ( overline{BA} ) and ( overline{BC} ): [ overline{BE} = 0.4 overline{BA} + 0.6 overline{BC}. ] This is because: [ overline{AE} = 1.5 overline{EC} implies overline{AE} = 1.5 times overline{c} ] Thus, [ overline{BE} text{ in terms of combination of }overline{BA} text{ and } overline{BC}.. overline{BE} = overline{c-a} + overline{1.5 c} = - overline{AE} + .5AC ]. 4.

Find the image of f (where, by image it is understood the set of all x such that exists an n with f(n)=x ).","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the set of all possible values of the sum of the digits of perfect squares. Let ( f(n) ) be the function that maps a natural number ( n ) to the sum of the digits of ( n^2 ). We are interested in the image of ( f ), i.e., the set of all possible values ( f(n) ) can take. 2. **Using Known Results:** We use two known results to find patterns in the sum of the digits of perfect squares. 3. **First Result:** Consider the number ( 11cdots 1122cdots 225 ) (with ( n ) times the digit 1 followed by ( n+1 ) times the digit 2 and ending with the digit 5). This number is a perfect square. The sum of its digits is: [ n cdot 1 + (n+1) cdot 2 + 5 = n + 2(n+1) + 5 = 3n + 7 ] Therefore, the sum of the digits of this perfect square is ( 3n + 7 ). 4. **Second Result:** Consider the number ( (10^n - 1)^2 ). Expanding this, we get: [ (10^n - 1)^2 = 10^{2n} - 2 cdot 10^n + 1 = 100cdots 000 - 20cdots 000 + 1 = 99cdots 9800cdots 001 ] (with ( n-1 ) times the digit 9, followed by ( n-1 ) times the digit 0, and ending with the digits 8 and 1). The sum of its digits is: [ 9(n-1) + 8 + 1 = 9n ] Therefore, the sum of the digits of this perfect square is ( 9n ). 5. **Combining Results:** From the first result, we have sums of the form ( 3n + 7 ). From the second result, we have sums of the form ( 9n ). 6. **Modulo 9 Analysis:** We observe that: [ 3n + 7 equiv 0, 1, 4, 7 pmod{9} ] and [ 9n equiv 0 pmod{9} ] Therefore, the possible values of the sum of the digits of perfect squares modulo 9 are ( 0, 1, 4, 7 ). 7. **Conclusion:** The possible values of the sum of the digits of perfect squares are those that are congruent to ( 0, 1, 4, ) or ( 7 ) modulo 9.

After each test, he noticed that the average of his test scores was always an integer. His score on the eighth test was 90. What was his score on the seventh test?","completion":"First, simplify the problem by subtracting 84 from each score, making the range between 1 and 16. Jacob's score on the eighth test becomes (90 - 84 = 6). The problem states that Jacob received 8 integer scores out of 1 to 16. Since 6 is given as the eighth test score, we consider the other seven scores from the set (S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}). The average score for the eight tests must be an integer, meaning the sum of the eight scores must be a multiple of 8. The sum must include 6, so we consider sums of the remaining seven scores that, added to 6, result in a multiple of 8. The possible sums of seven numbers from (S) range from the sum of the seven smallest numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 30) to the sum of the seven largest numbers (10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 = 91). We must find multiples of 8 from (30 + 6 = 36) to (91 + 6 = 97). The valid sums are 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96. Considering Jacob's scores up to the seventh test, their sum must also be a multiple of 7. From the valid sums, we subtract 6 (eighth score) and check for multiples of 7. The only possible sum that is a multiple of 7 and 8 is 56. Therefore, the sum of the scores for the first seven tests is (56 - 6 = 50). The sum of the scores from the first to the sixth test must be a multiple of 6. The possible interval is from (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 22) to (11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 = 81). Since (50 - 6 = 44) and is not a multiple of 6, we adjust the interval to include valid sums: 48 is valid.

The sum of the elements in ( B ) is ( 3 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 18 ). We need to find the number of distinct distributions of ( n ) boxes on the first 10 floors for ( n ) from 1 to 15. We can express ( n ) as a linear combination of the sums of ( A ) and ( B ): [ 42a + 18b = n ] We need to find the values of ( a ) and ( b ) that satisfy this equation for each ( n ) from 1 to 15. # Case Analysis Case 1: ( n = 6 ) [ 42a + 18b = 6 ] Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the equation has no integer solutions because 6 is not a multiple of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 42 and 18, which is 6. Therefore, there are no solutions for ( n = 6 ). Case 2: ( n = 12 ) [ 42a + 18b = 12 ] Similarly, using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the equation has no integer solutions because 12 is not a multiple of the GCD of 42 and 18, which is 6. Therefore, there are no solutions for ( n = 12 ). General Case For ( n ) to have solutions, ( n ) must be a multiple of the GCD of 42 and 18, which is 6. Therefore, the only possible values of ( n ) that can be expressed as ( 42a + 18b ) are multiples of 6, i.e., ( n = 6, 12 ).

Each passenger, if they find their assigned seat empty, will sit in it. Otherwise, they take the first open seat they find. # First Method: 1. The first passenger, denoted as Passenger 1, chooses a seat randomly. 2. Any other passenger (i) will sit in their assigned seat if it is empty. If it’s not, they will occupy the first available seat they encounter. 3. We need to calculate the probability that Passenger (n) (the last passenger) will end up in seat (n). Let's consider the state just before the last passenger enters. By this time, every other passenger except passenger (1) and (n) have already entered and taken their spots according to the rules. Two possible scenarios: - Passenger 1 took seat (n). In this case, passenger (n) will not be able to sit in seat (n). - Passenger 1 did not take seat (n). Therefore, seat (n) remains available to the current last passenger, and he will sit in his proper seat. In both cases above, the probability is: [ P(text{Passenger } n text{ sits in seat } n) = frac{1}{2} ] Thus: begin{equation} boxed{frac{1}{2}} end{equation} # Second Method: We can use induction to generalize the problem. Base Case (n=2): If there are only 2 seats and Passenger 1 (scattered scientist) randomly chooses a seat, there are two seats, hence only two scenarios: - Passenger 1 sits in seat 1, then passenger 2 will sit in seat 2. - Passenger 1 sits in seat 2, then passenger 2 must sit in seat 1. In each scenario, the probability that passenger 2 will sit in seat 2 is: [ P(text{Passenger 2 sits in seat 2}) = frac{1}{2} ] Inductive Step: Assume for (k = n), the probability is: [ P(text{Passenger } n text{ sits in seat } n) = frac{1}{2} ] For (k = n+1): - Passenger 1 can sit in any of the (n+1) seats. - If Passenger 1 sits in seat 1 or seat (n+1), our previous result holds because it doesn't disturb the arrangement. As each seat taken by Passenger 1 influences the remaining seating accordingly, it is adhered to by rules of inductive case leading towards probability preservation, which reinforces our base probability as: [ P(text{Passenger } (n+1) text{ sits in seat } (n+1)) = frac{1}{2} ] Thus, by induction: [ boxed{frac{1}{2}} ] is the probability that the last passenger will sit in his assigned seat."},{"prompt":"From a point, objects are thrown at equal speeds but at different angles. Determine the geometric locus of the vertices of the parabolic trajectories that are in the same vertical plane.","completion":": 1. **Coordinate System Setup** We place a coordinate system in a vertical plane. The origin ((0,0)) is at the launch point, with the horizontal axis as the x-axis and the vertical axis as the y-axis. 2. **Projectile Motion Equations** Launching a projectile from the origin with initial speed ( c ) at an angle ( alpha ), the coordinates of the vertex of the parabolic trajectory (highest point) are given by: [ y = frac{c^2}{2g} cdot sin^2 alpha ] [ x = frac{c^2}{2g} cdot sin 2alpha ] 3. **Eliminate ( alpha )** To find the locus of the vertices, we need to eliminate ( alpha ) from the equations. Using the trigonometric identity: [ 2 sin^2 alpha = 1 - cos 2alpha ] Substitute this into the ( y )-equation: [ y = frac{c^2}{2g} cdot frac{1 - cos 2alpha}{2} = frac{c^2}{4g} (1 - cos 2alpha) ] Rearrange to get: [ y - frac{c^2}{4g} = -frac{c^2}{4g} cos 2alpha ] 4. **Square Both Sides** Squaring both sides, we get: [ left( y - frac{c^2}{4g} right)^2 = left( frac{c^2}{4g} right)^2 cos^2 2alpha ] This can be written as: [ cos^2 2alpha = frac{left( y - frac{c^2}{4g} right)^2}{left( frac{c^2}{4g} right)^2} ] 5. **Use Another Trigonometric Identity** From the ( x )-equation, we know: [ x = frac{c^2}{2g} sin 2alpha ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ x^2 = left( frac{c^2}{2g} right)^2 sin^2 2alpha ] This can be written as: [ sin^2 2alpha = frac{x^2}{left( frac{c^2}{2g} right)^2} ] 6. **Combine Results** Adding the squared results, we obtain: [ cos^2 2alpha + sin^2 2alpha = 1 ] Substituting the squared equations: [ frac{left( y - frac{c^2}{4g} right)^2}{left( frac{c^2}{4g} right)^2} + frac{x^2}{left( frac{c^2}{2g} right)^2} = 1 ] 7. **Simplify** Introducing new coordinates ( X ) and ( Y ) where: [ x = X ] [ y - frac{c^2}{4g} = Y ] The equation simplifies to: [ frac{X^2}{left( frac{c^2}{2g} right)^2} + frac{Y^2}{left( frac{c^2}{4g} right)^2} = 1 ] 8. **Conclusion: Ellipse** The equation represents an ellipse with semi-major axis ( frac{c^2}{2g} ) and semi-minor axis ( frac{c^2}{4g} ). Therefore, the geometric locus of the vertices of the parabolic trajectories is an ellipse with these axis lengths.

For the segment (CR) versus (RB): [ CR: RB = x:(a-x) ] - Express (x): [ x = a cdot frac{b}{a + b} = frac{ab}{a+b} ] - Thus the ratio (CR: RB) becomes: [ CR: RB = frac{ab}{a+b} : left( a - frac{ab}{a+b} right) = frac{ab}{a+b} : frac{a^2}{a+b} ] 6. **Simplifying the Ratio**: - Simplify the ratio further: [ frac{ab}{a+b} : frac{a^2}{a+b} = b : a ] - Therefore, (e) and (f) divide (PQ) in the same ratio (b:a), proving the proportional similarity. 7. **Conclusion**: - Since (e) and (f) both divide (PQ) in the (b:a) ratio, the intersection (M) of these lines lies directly on the side (PQ) of the inscribed square. Hence, the point (M) indeed lies on the perimeter of the square inscribed in the right triangle.

The sum (sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{1 + (x - a_i)^2}) represents a superposition of these Cauchy distributions. 2. **Integral of a Single Cauchy Distribution:** Recall that the integral of the square of a single Cauchy distribution over the entire real line is: [ int_{-infty}^{infty} left(frac{1}{1 + x^2}right)^2 , dx = frac{pi}{2}. ] This is a known result from the properties of the Cauchy distribution. 3. **Expanding the Integral:** Consider the integral of the square of the sum of (n) Cauchy distributions: [ int_{-infty}^{infty} left(sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{1 + (x - a_i)^2}right)^2 , dx. ] Expanding the square inside the integral, we get: [ int_{-infty}^{infty} left(sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{1 + (x - a_i)^2}right)^2 , dx = int_{-infty}^{infty} left(sum_{i=1}^n frac{1}{1 + (x - a_i)^2} + sum_{1 le i neq j le n} frac{1}{1 + (x - a_i)^2} cdot frac{1}{1 + (x - a_j)^2}right) , dx. ] 4. **Separating the Terms:** The integral can be separated into two parts: [ int_{-infty}^{infty} sum_{i=1}^n left(frac{1}{1 + (x - a_i)^2}right)^2 , dx + int_{-infty}^{infty} sum_{1 le i neq j le n} frac{1}{1 + (x - a_i)^2} cdot frac{1}{1 + (x - a_j)^2} , dx. ] 5. **Evaluating the First Term:** The first term is straightforward: [ sum_{i=1}^n int_{-infty}^{infty} left(frac{1}{1 + (x - a_i)^2}right)^2 , dx = sum_{i=1}^n frac{pi}{2} = frac{npi}{2}. ] 6. **Bounding the Second Term:** For the second term, we use the fact that the product of two Cauchy distributions centered at different points decays rapidly as the distance between the centers increases. Specifically, we have: [ int_{-infty}^{infty} frac{1}{1 + (x - a_i)^2} cdot frac{1}{1 + (x - a_j)^2} , dx le frac{C}{(a_i - a_j)^2}, ] for some constant (C). 7. **Combining the Results:** Combining these results, we get: [ frac{npi}{2} + sum_{1 le i neq j le n} frac{C}{(a_i - a_j)^2} le An. ] This implies: [ sum_{1 le i neq j le n} frac{1}{(a_i - a_j)^2} le frac{2An}{C} - frac{npi}{2C}. ] 8. **Relating to the Desired Sum:** To relate this to the desired sum, note that: [ sum_{i,j=1}^n left(1 + (a_i - a_j)^2right) = n + sum_{1 le i neq j le n} left(1 + (a_i - a_j)^2right). ] Using the inequality derived above, we can bound the sum: [ sum_{1 le i neq j le n} (a_i - a_j)^2 ge Bn^3, ] for some constant (B > 0).

This means we are adding ( n ) balls ( p ) times: [ pn text{ balls in total} ] 3. **Distribution Analysis:** Distributing these balls means each box will have received balls multiple times in a non-uniform way initially, but because of the stated relationship ( pm = qn + 1 ), the operation of distributing ( n ) balls ( p ) times will lead to: [ m text{ boxes getting } q + 1 text{ balls each and } q text{ receiving only } q text{ balls.} ] 4. **Achieving Equal Distribution:** We continue to do the operations.

In the process of moving forward, obviously a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n = n-4 remains unchanged, performing the second shift. By analogy, each shift decreases the value of a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n by 2. After a finite number of shifts, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n can definitely be adjusted to alternate between 1 and -1. Since n is odd, the minimum value of a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n = 1. Therefore, the set of possible values for a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n is boxed{{1, 3, 5, ldots, 2k-1}}. - (III) From ① and ②, it is known that the ordered array (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n}) contains n +1s and n -1s. Clearly, the number of ways to choose n +1s from (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n}), with the rest being -1s, is C_{2n}^{n} kinds. Next, we consider how many of such arrays do not satisfy condition ③, denote this number as t_n. If (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n}) does not satisfy condition ③, then there must exist the smallest positive integer s (s leq n) such that (i) a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{2s-2} = 0; (ii) a_{2s-1} = -1. By changing the sign of a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2s-1}, this correspondence f is: (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2s-1}, a_{2s}, ldots, a_{2n}) rightarrow (-a_1, -a_2, ldots, -a_{2s-1}, a_{2s}, ldots, a_{2n}), thus transforming (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n}) into an ordered array composed of n+1 +1s and n-1 -1s. Conversely, any ordered array (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n}) composed of n+1 +1s and n-1 -1s. Since the number of +1s exceeds the number of -1s, there must exist the smallest positive integer s (s leq n) such that a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{2s-1} = 1. Let the corresponding f^{-1} be: (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2s-1}, a_{2s}, ldots, a_{2n}) rightarrow (-a_1, -a_2, ldots, -a_{2s-1}, a_{2s}, ldots, a_{2n}), thus transforming (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n}) into an ordered array composed of n-1 +1s and n+1 -1s. Therefore, t_n is the number of ordered arrays composed of n+1 +1s and n-1 -1s. Hence, the number of A_{2n} is C_{2n}^{n} - C_{2n}^{n+1} = frac{1}{n+1} C_{2n}^{n}, which gives the final answer as boxed{frac{1}{n+1} C_{2n}^{n}}."},{"prompt":"Given a set A, if for any a, b in A, we have a+b in A, then the set A is called a closed set.

Inductive step: Assume that the formula holds for some (m), i.e., 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ldots + m^3 = left(frac{m(m+1)}{2}right)^2 We need to show that it also holds for (m+1), i.e., 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ldots + m^3 + (m+1)^3 = left(frac{(m+1)(m+2)}{2}right)^2 Consider the left-hand side: left(frac{m(m+1)}{2}right)^2 + (m+1)^3 We aim to prove: left(frac{m(m+1)}{2}right)^2 + (m+1)^3 = left(frac{(m+1)(m+2)}{2}right)^2 Rewriting the left-hand side: [ left(frac{m(m+1)}{2}right)^2 + (m+1)^3 = frac{m^2(m+1)^2}{4} + (m+1)^3 ] Factor out ((m+1)^2) from the terms: [ = frac{(m+1)^2 [m^2 + 4(m+1)]}{4} ] Simplify inside the brackets: [ = frac{(m+1)^2 [m^2 + 4m + 4]}{4} = frac{(m+1)^2 (m+2)^2}{4} ] Thus, we have: [ frac{(m+1)^2 (m+2)^2}{4} = left(frac{(m+1)(m+2)}{2}right)^2 ] Therefore: [ left(frac{m(m+1)}{2}right)^2 + (m+1)^3 = left(frac{(m+1)(m+2)}{2}right)^2 ] Thus, by mathematical induction, we have proven that: [ 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ldots + m^3 = left(frac{m(m+1)}{2}right)^2 ] Now, applying this result to our initial problem, [ 1^3 + 3^3 + 5^3 + ldots + (2n-1)^3 =n^2(2n^2-1) ] Therefore, we conclude: [ boxed{n^2(2n^2-1)} ]"},{"prompt":"A (17 times 17) square is cut out from squared paper.

Using the combinatorial concept often called \\"stars and bars\\", we determine the number of ways to place 4 indistinguishable \\"stars\\" (scoops) into 4 distinguishable \\"bars\\" (flavor categories). The formula to compute this is given by binomial coefficient: [ binom{n+k-1}{k-1} ] where ( n ) is the number of stars (scoops) and ( k ) is the number of bars (flavors). Thus: [ binom{4+4-1}{4-1} = binom{7}{3} ] Calculating (binom{7}{3}): [ binom{7}{3} = frac{7 times 6 times 5}{3 times 2 times 1} = 35 ] So, the total number of distinct flavors Ice-cream-utopia can create is: [ boxed{35} ]"},{"prompt":"A circle passes through point F (0, 1) and is tangent to the line y = 1.

(1) Find the equation of the locus M; (2) Prove that angle BAD = angle CAD; (3) If the distance from point D to line AB equals frac{sqrt{2}}{2}|AD| and the area of triangle ABC is 20, find the equation of line BC.","completion":"(1) Let the coordinates of the circle's center be (x, y). Given that the moving circle passes through the fixed point F(0, 1) and is tangent to the fixed line y = -1, we have sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1)^2} = |y + 1|. This leads to (y - 1)^2 + x^2 = (y + 1)^2, which simplifies to x^2 = 4y. Therefore, the equation of the locus M is x^2 = 4y. boxed{x^2 = 4y} (2) From (1), we have y = frac{1}{4}x^2, thus y' = frac{1}{2}x. Let D have coordinates (x_0, frac{1}{4}x_0^2). The geometric meaning of the derivative gives the slope of line l as k_{BC} = frac{1}{2}x_0. Then, A has coordinates (-x_0, frac{1}{4}x_0^2), and let C and B have coordinates (x_1, frac{1}{4}x_1^2) and (x_2, frac{1}{4}x_2^2), respectively. Thus, k_{BC} = frac{frac{1}{4}x_1^2 - frac{1}{4}x_2^2}{x_1 - x_2} = frac{x_1 + x_2}{4} = frac{1}{2}x_0, which implies x_1 + x_2 = 2x_0. The slopes k_{AC} = frac{x_1 - x_0}{4} and k_{AB} = frac{x_2 - x_0}{4}, therefore k_{BC} + k_{AB} = frac{x_1 - x_0}{4} + frac{x_2 - x_0}{4} = frac{x_1 + x_2 - 2x_0}{4} = 0, which means k_{AB} = -k_{BC}. Hence, angle BAD = angle CAD. boxed{angle BAD = angle CAD} (3) The distance from point D to line AB being frac{sqrt{2}}{2}|AD| implies angle BAD = 45^circ. Assuming C is above AD, i.e., x_2 < x_1, the equation of line AB is y - frac{1}{4}x_0^2 = -(x + x_0). Solving this together with x^2 = -4y, we find the coordinates of point B as (x_0 - 4, frac{1}{4}(x_0 - 4)^2). Therefore, |AB| = sqrt{2}|x_0 - 4 - (-x_0)| = 2sqrt{2}|x_0 - 2|. Knowing angle CAD = angle BAD = 45^circ, similarly, we get |AC| = 2sqrt{2}|x_0 + 2|. Thus, the area of triangle ABC is frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{2}|x_0 + 2| times 2sqrt{2}|x_0 - 2| = 20. Solving this gives x_0 = pm 3. When x_0 = 3, B is (-1, frac{1}{4}), and k_{BC} = frac{3}{2}, the equation of line BC is 6x - 4y + 7 = 0. When x_0 = -3, B is (-7, frac{49}{4}), and k_{BC} = -frac{3}{2}, the equation of line BC is 6x + 4y - 7 = 0. boxed{6x - 4y + 7 = 0, 6x + 4y - 7 = 0}"},{"prompt":"Two people move in the same direction.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge.

The conversion factor from kmph to m/s is: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 36 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 10 m/s Now, we can calculate the distance the train travels while crossing the bridge using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken to cross the bridge is 29.997600191984642 seconds, and the speed of the train is 10 m/s, so the distance is: Distance = 10 m/s * 29.997600191984642 s = 299.97600191984642 meters This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge.

(a) Given an acute-angled triangle ABC with its bisector AD, median BM, and altitude CH intersecting at one point: 1. Let's denote the angle at vertex A as alpha. We need to prove that alpha > 45^circ. 2. Consider a construction where we extend lines through alpha and create appropriate segments and intersections to follow the given conditions. 3. Suppose we lay off an arbitrary segment AC, drop perpendicular CH from C to the extended line passing through A, and join the midpoint M of segment AC with the intersection point of CH and the bisector of the angle at A. 4. We observe that any triangle constructed this way will have angles altered based on the value of alpha, but most importantly, alpha will uniquely determine the shape and position of the triangle, hence fixing its angles. 5. If alpha leq 45^circ, we need to investigate if it can lead to angle ACB = gamma being obtuse. To achieve that, we draw a line through C making angle UCE = 2alpha, so angle ACE = 180^circ - 2alpha. 6. For a condition where alpha leq 45^circ, it leads to angle ACE geq 90^circ and thus AE > CE. Given the isosceles triangle ACE formed by bisectors and perpendiculars, which fixes the relations, we conclude that: [ angle ACB > angle ACE geq 90^circ ] This means alpha leq 45^circ would make angle ACB = gamma obtuse. 7. Hence, from the logical derivation and analysis of constructed angles, alpha must be greater than 45^circ to keep the triangle acute-angled under the given intersecting conditions. # Conclusion: [ boxed{alpha > 45^circ} ] (b) Now, we identify all values alpha (angle at vertex A) can take considering it must be more than 45^circ and making triangle ABC acute-angled. 1.

From previous results, we identify that gamma seems to switch its nature between acute and obtuse values based on changing alpha. By a specific rotation, drawing parallels, and using trigonometric limits derived from the initial set problem, we end up with gamma = 90^circ boundary. 3. Evaluate boundary by setting gamma = 90^circ which gives cos^2(alpha_0) + cos(alpha_0) - 1 = 0. Solving: [ cos^2 alpha_0 + cos alpha_0 - 1 = 0 ] Solving the quadratic in cos alpha_0 yields: [ cos alpha_0 = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} ] This represents: [ alpha_0 = arccosleft(frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2}right) approx 51^circ 50' ] # Required Range: [ boxed{51^circ 50' < alpha < 90^circ} ] With this boxed result, we have deduced the possible angular range for alpha under the given conditions, ensuring the provided conditions hold in the problem premises."},{"prompt":"A shopping mall purchased a batch of air conditioners for 24000 yuan and then sold them at a price of 3000 yuan per unit.

This setup helps to visualize the problem and benefits from properties of such a grid. 3. **Tiling Consistency**: Each smaller rectangle used in the tiling process must have its edges parallel to the edges of the original rectangle. Additionally, each smaller rectangle must cover equal areas of black and white squares due to its defined properties (having one side of integer length), leading to an equal distribution of areas covered on the modified chessboard. 4. **Area Distribution Analysis**: The total area covered by white squares within each smaller rectangle must equal the total area covered by black squares. Since the entire original rectangle adheres to this equal distribution via its subdivision into smaller rectangles, the initial assumption holds — both areas (black and white) covered must be equal. 5. **Verification by Contradiction**: Assume the original rectangle does not have any sides of integer length. - Cut out a subrectangle from the bottom-right corner of the original rectangle. This subrectangle's sides would be the amounts by which the original sides exceed the nearest integers. - The resulting figure after removal is a concave hexagon.

We need to prove: [ frac{1}{1+2a} + frac{1}{1+2b} + frac{1}{1+2c} geq 1 ] given that (abc = 1). 1. **Substitution:** Use the substitutions ( a = frac{x}{y} ), ( b = frac{y}{z} ), and ( c = frac{z}{x} ). Note that these substitutions maintain the given condition since: [ left(frac{x}{y}right)left(frac{y}{z}right)left(frac{z}{x}right) = 1. ] Applying these substitutions to the original inequality: [ frac{1}{1+2a} = frac{1}{1+2left(frac{x}{y}right)} = frac{y}{y + 2x} ] [ frac{1}{1+2b} = frac{1}{1+2left(frac{y}{z}right)} = frac{z}{z + 2y} ] [ frac{1}{1+2c} = frac{1}{1+2left(frac{z}{x}right)} = frac{x}{x + 2z} ] Hence, the inequality transforms into: [ frac{y}{2x + y} + frac{z}{2y + z} + frac{x}{2z + x} geq 1 ] 2. **Using Nesbitt's Inequality:** We can employ Nesbitt's Inequality, which states that for any positive real numbers ( x, y, z ): [ frac{x}{y+z} + frac{y}{z+x} + frac{z}{x+y} geq frac{3}{2}. ] However, we need to manipulate our expression to match the form needed for Nesbitt’s Inequality.

We start with the information that when the band members line up in rows of 26, there are 4 left over. This can be represented by the congruence: [20n equiv 4 pmod{26}.] 2. To simplify this congruence, we divide both sides by 4. However, we must also divide 26 by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4 and 26, which is 2. This simplifies the congruence to: [5n equiv 1 pmod{13}.] 3. We are looking for a multiple of 13 that is one less than a multiple of 5. Observing that 13 times 3 = 39 has a units digit of 9, we find that adding 1 to this product and dividing by 5 gives us 8. Therefore, the inverse of 5 modulo 13 is 8. Multiplying both sides of our congruence by 8 yields: [n equiv 8 pmod{13}.] 4. This means that n can be expressed as n = 8 + 13k for some integer k, under the condition that 20n < 1000. Rewriting this inequality in terms of n gives us: [n < 50.] 5. Substituting n = 8 + 13k into the inequality and solving for k gives: [8 + 13k < 50.] Subtracting 8 from both sides and then dividing by 13, we find: [k < frac{42}{13}.] The maximum integer value for k that satisfies this inequality is k = 3. 6.

Prove that it is impossible to make all the cells white by flipping the entire rows or columns.

In such a scenario, if we isolate a 2 times 2 sub-square containing the black cell, it forms our basis for understanding how row and column flipping affects the parity (evenness or oddness) of black cells. 2. **Parity Analysis**: - Consider flipping a row in the grid. Flipping a row changes the color of each cell in that row from black to white or vice versa. - Similarly, flipping a column changes the color of each cell in that column. This transformation changes the color of the cells within the selected column from black to white or vice versa. 3. **Preservation of Parity in Corners**: - Now look at the four corner cells of the 3 times 3 grid. Initially, one of these corner cells is black, and the rest are white. - Observe the effect of flipping any row or column on these corner cells: - Flipping a row could change the color of the two cells at the ends of that row. - Flipping a column could change the color of the two cells at the ends of that column. Whenever we flip a row or column, it impacts either zero or two corner cells simultaneously. Hence, any move made by flipping rows or columns will leave the number of black cells among the four corners even. 4. **Objective Impossibility**: - Suppose we want to achieve a grid where all cells are white. The intended target configuration would have zero black cells in total. - However, if at the start we have one black cell, flipping any row/column results in either maintaining the parity of the grid corners. - Each move preserves the even or odd nature of the number of black cells within the corners. Since one black cell (odd parity) cannot be transformed into zero black cells (even parity) by any sequence of row/column flips, we cannot reach the state where all cells are white. Therefore, starting from a single black cell (odd parity) in any corner, it is impossible to make the entire grid white through these operations. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{It is impossible to change all cells to white by flipping rows and columns.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the number of moles of Ammonium hydroxide formed on combining some moles of Ammonium chloride with 1 mole of Sodium hydroxide, if the reaction produces 1 mole of Ammonium hydroxide.

Now, solve for the ( a_i )'s in descending order, starting with ( a_{k-1} ) and working downwards. By comparing the ( x^k )-coefficients on both sides of the equation, we clearly have ( a_{k-1} = 1 ). If ( a_{i+1}, cdots, a_{k-1} ) have been determined for some ( i ge 0 ), then ( a_i ) is uniquely determined by examining the ( x^{i+1} )-coefficients on both sides of the equation. Furthermore, we can see that ( a_i ) is integral. (blacksquare) 2. As guaranteed by Lemma 1, let ( P(x) ) be a monic polynomial of degree ( k-1 ) with integer coefficients and ( c in mathbb{Z} ) be an integer such that [ xP(x) - P(x-1) = x^k + c. ] 3. **Lemma 2**: ( c = 0 ) and ( a_n = P(n) ) for all ( n in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0} ). **Proof**: Let ( b_n = P(n) - a_n ) for all ( n in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0} ). Note that from the condition of the problem: [ na_n - a_{n-1} = n^k, quad forall n in mathbb{N}. ] From the equation ( xP(x) - P(x-1) = x^k + c ), we have: [ nP(n) - P(n-1) = n^k + c, quad forall n in mathbb{N}. ] Therefore, subtracting the two equations gives: [ nb_n - b_{n-1} = c, quad forall n in mathbb{N}. ] Let ( M = max(|b_0|, |c|) ). We claim now that this implies ( b_i in [-2M, 2M] ) for all ( i in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0} ). For ( i = 0, 1 ), this is immediate from the definition of ( M ). For ( i > 1 ), we can prove it easily by induction on ( i ). Hence, we've shown that the sequence ( {b_i} ) is bounded by ( 2M ) in absolute value. 4. Now, notice that for ( n > 3M ), we have: [ |b_n| = left|frac{b_{n-1} + c}{n}right| le left|frac{b_{n-1}}{n}right| + left|frac{c}{n}right| < frac{2M}{3M} + frac{M}{3M} = 1, ] and hence ( b_n = 0 ). Therefore, ( c = (3M+2)b_{3M+2} - b_{3M+1} = 0 ), as claimed. From here, it easily follows from downwards induction (with base case ( n = 3M+1 )) that ( b_n = 0 ) for all ( n in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0} ). This implies that ( P(n) - a_n = 0 Rightarrow a_n = P(n) ) for all ( n in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0} ). (blacksquare) 5. From the lemma, as ( c = 0 ), we know that: [ xP(x) - P(x-1) = x^k. ] 6.

Now, observe that ( P(x) - R(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)Q(x) ) for some ( Q in mathbb{Z}[x] ). In particular, observe that ( x^2 - x + 1 mid P(x) - R(x) ) and ( x^2 - x + 1 mid P(x-1) - R(x-1) ), since ( (x-1)^2 + (x-1) + 1 = x^2 - x + 1 ). Therefore, viewing the equation in modulo ( x^2 - x + 1 ), we obtain: [ xR(x) - R(x-1) equiv x^k. ] 7. Plugging the formula for ( R ) into the equation yields: [ ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx - a(x-1)^3 - b(x-1)^2 - c(x-1) - d equiv x^k. ] Noting that for ( i in mathbb{Z}_{ge 2} ), we have ( x^i equiv x^{i-1} - x^{i-2} ) and ( (x-1)^i equiv -(x-1)^{i-1} - (x-1)^{i-2} ), we have that: [ (c+d-a)x - (b+c) + (b-c)x + (c-a-d) equiv x^k, ] i.e. [ (b+d-a)x - (a+b+d) equiv x^k. ] 8. Observe that: [ 1 equiv 0 cdot x + 1, ] [ x equiv 1 cdot x + 0, ] [ x^3 equiv -1, ] and [ x^4 equiv (-1) cdot x + 0. ] So since ( b+d-a, a+b+d ) are either both 0 or both nonzero (since ( a, b, d in mathbb{Z} )), we cannot have ( k in {0, 1, 3, 4} ).

For these to be the sides of a triangle, they must satisfy: [ sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} > sqrt{c} ] 3. **Utilize the triangle inequalities**: Start with the known inequality: [ a + b > c ] 4. **Transform the inequality**: Consider the expression: [ (sqrt{a} + sqrt{b})^2 ] Expanding it, we get: [ (sqrt{a} + sqrt{b})^2 = a + b + 2sqrt{ab} ] Given (a + b > c), we thus have: [ a + b + 2sqrt{ab} > a + b > c ] Due to the transitive property of inequalities: [ (sqrt{a} + sqrt{b})^2 > c implies sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} > sqrt{c} ] Therefore, there exist sides (sqrt{a}), (sqrt{b}), and (sqrt{c}) that satisfy the triangle inequality, and hence they form a triangle. 5. **Evaluate the reverse assertion**: The reverse assertion claims that if (sqrt{a}), (sqrt{b}), (sqrt{c}) form a triangle, then (a, b, c) must also form a triangle. 6. **Counterexample**: Consider an isosceles right triangle with legs of length 1 (i.e., ( sqrt{2} ) is the hypotenuse such that (sqrt{a} = sqrt{b} = 1) and (sqrt{c} = sqrt{2})).

Assume (n geq 2) and (p geq 3). Given that ((p-1)^n + 1) is odd, it implies that (n) must be odd. Moreover, (n < 2p). Let (q) be the smallest prime factor of (n). Then (q mid (p-1)^n + 1), which implies that: (p-1)^n equiv -1 pmod{q}. Since ((q, p-1) = 1) and ((n, q-1) = 1), by Bézout's identity, there exist integers (u) and (v) such that: un + v(q-1) = 1. Then, applying Fermat's Little Theorem, we have: p-1 equiv (p-1)^{q-1} pmod{q}, which means that (p-1)^{un} equiv (p-1)^{u(q-1)} equiv (-1)^u pmod{q}. Since (q) is odd, (u) must be odd, and thus: p-1 equiv -1 pmod{q}, leading to: p equiv 0 pmod{q}, implying (p = q). Given that (n < 2p = 2q) and (q) is the smallest prime factor of (n), it follows that: n = p = q. Now, it remains to check whether ((p-1)^p + 1) is divisible by (p^{p-1}). Expanding ((p-1)^p) using the Binomial Theorem, we get: (p-1)^p = p^p - binom{p}{1} p^{p-1} + cdots + (-1)^p. Thus, (p-1)^p + 1 = p^p - binom{p}{1} p^{p-1} + cdots + (-1)^p + 1.

Attempting to color the regions accordingly: - For instance, assigning S_2 as blue and thereby S_3 cannot be red or blue, so S_3 would be yellow. - Proceeding similarly, if S_4 is colored blue (same as S_2), [ S_2 text{ (blue)}, quad S_3 text{ (yellow)}, quad S_4 text{ (blue)}, quad S_5 text{ (yellow)}, quad S_6 text{ (blue)}, quad S_7 text{ (yellow)} ] Then, S_8 will conflict with S_7 and S_1 regardless of chosen color (as red, blue, or yellow is already adjacent).

The biker going to Atlanta has a lower daily mileage due to the shorter total distance and fewer days affected by terrain and weather. Therefore, the greatest number of miles a day each can bike, considering these factors, is determined by the biker going to Atlanta, which is 77.19 miles per day. To ensure they cover equal distances each day, the biker going to Boston should also plan to bike boxed{77.19} miles on their normal days. This means they will need to adjust their plan to accommodate the terrain and weather conditions while still biking the same daily distance as the biker going to Atlanta."},{"prompt":"Rick took off on a road trip for the summer.

We need to compute the probability that among the jury of 2m people, consisting of randomly selected mothers from the 2n total, a certain number of them are dishonest. First, we find the probability of having exactly q dishonest mothers and 2m-q fair mothers in the jury of 2m people: [ P(Q = q) = frac{binom{n}{q} cdot binom{n}{2m - q}}{binom{2n}{2m}} ] 4. If this event happens, the outcome depends on the distribution of votes among the dishonest mothers. If t children of dishonest mothers participate in the worst play, then the worst play gets exactly t votes, while the remaining votes 2m - t will go to the best play. Therefore, the best play wins if: [ 2m - t > t implies t < m ] 5.

Combining the above, the probability that the best play wins given q dishonest mothers is the probability that t < m: [ P(text{Best play wins} | Q = q) = sum_{t=0}^{min(q, m-1)} P(T = t | Q = q) ] Thus: [ P(text{Best play wins} | Q = q) = sum_{t=0}^{min(q, m-1)} frac{binom{q}{t} cdot binom{2n - q}{n - t}}{binom{2n}{n}} ] 7.
