Consider the number ( p times 2p ): [ p times 2p = 2p^2 = 2n ] Therefore, [ n mid 2n ] Additionally, since ( p > 2 ), we have: [ 2p < p^2 - 1 ] Consequently, ( 2p ) will appear in the product ((n-1)!): [ (n-1)! = 1 times 2 times cdots times p times cdots times 2p times cdots times (n-1) ] Thus, ( (n-1)! ) contains the factor ( p times 2p = 2n ), and so: [ n mid (n-1)! ] Hence, [ (n-1)! equiv 0 pmod{n} ] 3. **Proof for prime ( p ) that ((p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p}):** For prime ( p ), consider the set of integers ({1, 2, ldots, p-1}). Each element ( x ) in this set has a unique modular inverse ( y ) such that: [ xy equiv 1 pmod{p} ] The only elements that are their own inverses are ( pm 1 ), since: [ x^2 equiv 1 pmod{p} quad text{implies} quad (x - 1)(x + 1) equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Hence, for all ( x ) between 2 and ( p-2 ), ( x ) pairs up with ( y neq x ) where ( y ) is its modular inverse. This allows us to rewrite: [ (p-1)! = 1 times 2 times cdots times (p-2) times (p-1) ] By pairing up such that each product modulo ( p ) is ( 1 ): [ 2 times 3 times cdots times (p-2) equiv 1 pmod{p} ] Therefore, taking into account the elements ( -1 ) and ( 1 ): [ (p-1)! = (-1) times 1 times 2 times cdots times (p-2) equiv -1 pmod{p} ] Hence, [ (p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p} ] 4. **Conclusion**: - If ( n ) is a prime number, then ((n-1)! equiv -1 pmod{n}). - If ( n geq 6 ) is a composite number, then ((n-1)! equiv 0 pmod{n}). As for the specific case ( n = 4 ): [ (4-1)! = 3! = 6 quad text{and} quad 6 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] Clearly, ( 2 notequiv -1 pmod{4} ).

Draw the perpendicular from L to BC meeting AP at F. 5. By the Power of a Point theorem, we have: [ FP cdot PH = CP cdot PL = BP cdot PT ] 6. This implies that TF perp BT, which in turn implies that points P, L, F, T are concyclic with circumcircle Gamma centered at PF. 7. Extend DP to intersect Gamma again at point I. 8. Next, angle FIP = 90^circ = angle PGD implies that points F, I, G, D are concyclic with circumcircle Gamma' centered at DF. 9.

If the initial alcohol content is 1mg/mL, or equivalently 100mg in 100mL of blood, we want to know how many hours it will take for this content to decrease to 20mg in 100mL of blood, which is the threshold for being considered safe to drive under the influence. Let x be the number of hours required for the alcohol content to reach this level. The alcohol content in 100mL of blood after x hours can be represented as y = 100 times 0.8^x mg. We are looking for the value of x when y = 20 mg. Starting with the equation for y: [y = 100 times 0.8^x] Substituting y = 20 gives us: [20 = 100 times 0.8^x] Solving for 0.8^x: [0.8^x = frac{20}{100} = 0.2] To find x, we take the logarithm of both sides: [x = log_{0.8}0.2] Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we can express this in terms of common logarithms (base 10): [x = frac{log 0.2}{log 0.8}] Recognizing that log 0.2 = log 2 - 1 and log 0.8 = log 8 - 1 = 3log 2 - 1 (since log 8 = 3log 2 because 8 = 2^3), we substitute these values into the equation: [x = frac{log 2 - 1}{3log 2 - 1}] Given that log 2 approx 0.301, we substitute this approximation: [x approx frac{0.301 - 1}{3 times 0.301 - 1}] Performing the calculation: [x approx frac{-0.699}{0.903 - 1} = frac{-0.699}{-0.097} approx 7.206] Since x represents the number of hours and it must be a whole number, the closest whole number that is not less than 7.206 is 8.

For which positive real numbers x does the series[ sum_{n=1}^infty frac{x^{a(n)}}{n^3} ]converge?","completion":"1. **Rewriting the Series**: We start with the series [ sum_{n=1}^infty frac{x^{a(n)}}{n^3} ] where (a(n)) is the number of zeroes in the base 3 representation of (n). 2. **Grouping by Powers of 3**: To simplify the analysis, we group the terms by powers of 3. Specifically, for (3^m le n < 3^{m+1}), we approximate (n^3) by (27^m). This approximation is valid because (3^m le n < 3^{m+1}) implies (27^m le n^3 < 27^{m+1}). 3. **Rewriting the Sum**: Using this approximation, we rewrite the series as: [ sum_{m=0}^{infty} frac{sum_{3^m le n < 3^{m+1}} x^{a(n)}}{27^m} ] 4. **Counting Zeroes in Base 3**: Next, we need to count the number of zeroes in the base 3 representation of numbers in the range (3^m le n < 3^{m+1}). The number of such numbers with exactly (k) zeroes is given by the binomial coefficient (binom{m}{k}) times (2^{m-k}) (since each of the remaining (m-k) digits can be either 1 or 2). 5. **Summing Over Zeroes**: Therefore, the inner sum can be written as: [ sum_{3^m le n < 3^{m+1}} x^{a(n)} = sum_{k=0}^m binom{m}{k} cdot 2^{m-k} cdot x^k ] 6. **Simplifying the Inner Sum**: This sum is a binomial expansion: [ sum_{k=0}^m binom{m}{k} left(frac{x}{2}right)^k cdot 2^m = 2^m left(1 + frac{x}{2}right)^m ] 7. **Substituting Back**: Substituting this back into our series, we get: [ sum_{m=0}^{infty} frac{2^m left(1 + frac{x}{2}right)^m}{27^m} = sum_{m=0}^{infty} left(frac{2}{27}right)^m left(1 + frac{x}{2}right)^m ] 8. **Combining Terms**: This can be further simplified to: [ sum_{m=0}^{infty} left(frac{2+x}{27}right)^m ] 9. **Convergence of the Geometric Series**: The series (sum_{m=0}^{infty} r^m) converges if and only if (|r| < 1).

Initially, ((1,1)) and ((n,n)) are on, the others are off. 2. **Strategy 1: Lighting Lamps:** Suppose Alice lights up all the lamps in the first row and the last column, except for the lamp at ((n,1)). This makes the lamps in the positions ((1,2)) through ((1,n)) and ((2,n)) through ((n-1,n)) turned on. 3. **Operation Illustration:** Alice now performs the following operations to turn off all lamps: - Flip all the lamps in the first row.

In this case, for the smaller sphere: [ R = 4 , text{cm} ] The area given is ( 37 , text{cm}^2 ), so: [ 37 = 2pi cdot 4 cdot h ] Solving for ( h ): [ h = frac{37}{8pi} ] 3. **Set up the proportionality for the larger sphere**: Since the radius ( R ) of the larger sphere is (6 , text{cm}): [ A_{large} = 2pi cdot 6 cdot h ] Using the height ( h ) obtained from the smaller sphere: [ A_{large} = 2pi cdot 6 cdot frac{37}{8pi} ] 4. **Simplify the expression**: Simplify the equation to find ( A_{large} ): [ A_{large} = 2pi cdot 6 cdot frac{37}{8pi} = frac{6 cdot 37}{4} = frac{222}{4} = 55.5 ] The calculated area is: [ boxed{55.5 , text{cm}^2} ] 45.

Define the variables: [ x = frac{-a + b + c}{2}, quad y = frac{a - b + c}{2}, quad z = frac{a + b - c}{2} ] 2. Note that ( x, y, z > 0 ). We can then express (a), (b), and (c) in terms of (x), (y), and (z): [ a = y + z, quad b = x + z, quad c = x + y ] 3.

For every 1 yuan increase in the selling price, the daily sales decrease by 10 items. We can express this relationship as follows: - When x = 8, y = 200. - For every 1 yuan increase in x, y decreases by 10 items. This can be modeled by the equation y = 200 - 10(x - 8). Simplifying this equation gives us: [ y = 200 - 10x + 80 ] [ y = -10x + 280 ] Therefore, the functional relationship between y and x is boxed{y = -10x + 280} for 6 leqslant x leqslant 12. # Part 2: Functional Relationship Between Daily Sales Profit w and Selling Price x The daily sales profit w can be calculated by multiplying the profit per item by the number of items sold. The profit per item is (x - 6), and the number of items sold is given by the relationship we found in part 1, y = -10x + 280. Therefore, the daily sales profit w is: [ w = (x - 6)(-10x + 280) ] Expanding this and completing the square gives us: [ w = -10x^2 + 280x - 60x + 1680 ] [ w = -10x^2 + 220x + 1680 ] [ w = -10(x^2 - 22x - 168) ] [ w = -10(x^2 - 22x + 121) + 1210 ] [ w = -10(x - 11)^2 + 1210 ] Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative (-10), the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the maximum value of w occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex form of the equation is already given by w = -10(x - 11)^2 + 1210, so the vertex is at (11, 1210). However, we are constrained by the stipulation that x cannot exceed 12 yuan. Therefore, we need to evaluate w at x = 12: [ w = (12 - 6)(-10(12) + 280) ] [ w = 6(-120 + 280) ] [ w = 6 times 160 ] [ w = 960 ] Thus, when x = 12, the daily sales profit is maximized, and the maximum profit is boxed{960} yuan."},{"prompt":"Jill invests 10000 in an account that pays a certain annual rate, compounding semiannually.

If we denote the factors of x as f_1, f_2, ..., f_(n+1), then the product of all factors is: Product = f_1 * f_2 * ... * f_(n+1) Since the factors of x are all the powers of p from 0 to n, we can write the product as: Product = p^0 * p^1 * p^2 * ... * p^n Notice that each power of p from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the product (once as a factor and once as a multiple of another factor), and p^0 (which is 1) appears once.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: [ (n-2) times 180 + x = 1350 ] Expanding and rearranging the terms gives: [ 180n - 360 + x = 1350 ] Solving for x yields: [ x = 1350 + 360 - 180n ] Simplifying this expression, we find: [ x = 1710 - 180n ] Given that an external angle must be greater than 0^{circ} and less than 180^{circ} (since it's the angle outside the polygon), we can set up the inequality: [ 0 < 1710 - 180n < 180 ] Breaking this into two parts, we have: 1. 1710 - 180n > 0 2. 1710 - 180n < 180 Solving the first inequality for n: [ 1710 > 180n ] [ 9.5 > n ] Solving the second inequality for n: [ 1710 - 180 < 180n ] [ 1530 < 180n ] [ 8.5 < n ] Combining these inequalities gives us: [ 8.5 < n < 9.5 ] Since n must be a whole number (as it represents the number of sides of a polygon), the only value of n that satisfies this condition is n=9. Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is boxed{9}."},{"prompt":"A wire is cut into two pieces so that one piece is 2/3 of the other. The shorter piece is 27.999999999999993 cm long.

A diagonal is allowed to be drawn if it intersects (at internal points) with an even number of previously drawn diagonals (and has not been drawn before). The player who cannot make a move loses. Who will win with optimal play?","completion":"1. First, observe that in a regular (2n+1)-gon (where n>1), the diagonals are drawn such that each diagonal either intersects an even number of other diagonals or an odd number of other diagonals. Given the rule, a diagonal can only be drawn if it intersects an even number of previously drawn diagonals. 2. It's important to note that each side of a diagonal has either an even number or an odd number of vertices. Thus, each diagonal intersects an even number of other diagonals in a (2n+1)-gon. 3. Let us consider a specific moment in the game where it's no longer possible to make a move. This implies that each remaining undrawn diagonal intersects an odd number of already drawn diagonals, forcing those undrawn diagonals to also intersect an odd number of other undrawn diagonals. 4. Such a scenario is only feasible if the number of remaining undrawn diagonals is even. Hence, the game progresses until all diagonals that can be drawn under the given conditions are drawn, and the game ends when it's impossible to draw another diagonal. 5. To determine the winner, consider the total number of diagonals in a (2n+1)-gon. The formula for the number of diagonals in a (2n+1)-gon is given by: [ text{Number of diagonals} = frac{(2n+1)(2n-2)}{2} = (2n+1)(n-1) ] 6. From the formula above, it is apparent that: - If n is even, (2n+1)(n-1) is odd. - If n is odd, (2n+1)(n-1) is even. 7. Hence, if n is even, the total number of diagonals in the (2n+1)-gon is odd, and the player making the first move, given to Player 1, will eventually win because the game will involve an odd number of total moves, ensuring that Player 1 makes the last move. 8. Conversely, if n is odd, the total number of diagonals in the (2n+1)-gon is even, and Player 2 will be making the last effective drawing move, thus winning the game. # Conclusion: When ( n ) is odd, the second player will win.

According to the problem, Diana agreed to pay 6% simple annual interest on her charge account. The simple interest ( I ) can be calculated using the formula: [ I = P times r times t ] where: ( I ) is the interest, ( P ) is the principal amount, ( r ) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), ( t ) is the time in years. Since Diana owed 63.6 after a year, this amount includes both the principal amount ( P ) and the interest ( I ). Therefore, we can write: [ P + I = 63.6 ] Given that the interest rate is 6%, we convert this percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: [ r = 6% = frac{6}{100} = 0.06 ] The time ( t ) is 1 year. Now we can substitute ( r ) and ( t ) into the simple interest formula to find ( I ): [ I = P times 0.06 times 1 ] [ I = 0.06P ] Now we can substitute ( I ) into the equation ( P + I = 63.6 ) to find ( P ): [ P + 0.06P = 63.6 ] [ 1P + 0.06P = 63.6 ] [ 1.06P = 63.6 ] Now we can solve for ( P ) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.06: [ P = frac{63.6}{1.06} ] [ P = 60 ] So, Diana charged boxed{60} on her account in January."},{"prompt":"Susan had a bouquet of 3 dozen roses.

Since Susan had 3 dozen roses, and there are 12 roses in a dozen, she had a total of: 3 dozen x 12 roses/dozen = 36 roses After giving some roses to her daughter and placing the rest in a vase, one-third of the flowers in the vase wilted, and 12 flowers remained. This means that the wilted flowers were also one-third of the flowers in the vase before they wilted. If we let the number of flowers in the vase before wilting be F, then one-third wilted and two-thirds remained: (1/3)F = wilted flowers (2/3)F = remaining flowers = 12 roses To find the original number of flowers in the vase (F), we can solve for F: (2/3)F = 12 F = 12 / (2/3) F = 12 * (3/2) F = 18 So, there were originally 18 roses in the vase before they wilted. Since Susan started with 36 roses and 18 were left in the vase, she must have given the remaining roses to her daughter: 36 roses - 18 roses = 18 roses given to her daughter Now, to find the ratio of the number of roses given to her daughter to the total number of roses in the bouquet, we have: Number of roses given to daughter : Total number of roses 18 roses : 36 roses This ratio can be simplified by dividing both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 18: (18 roses / 18) : (36 roses / 18) 1 : 2 Therefore, the ratio of the number of roses given to her daughter to the total number of roses in the bouquet is boxed{1:2} ."},{"prompt":"find large number from below question the difference of two numbers is 1365 . on dividing the larger number by the smaller , we get 6 as quotient and the 15 as remainder ?","completion":"Let the smaller number be x and the larger number be y.

According to the information given, the man spends: - 1/5 of his salary on food - 1/10 of his salary on house rent - 3/5 of his salary on clothes - Saves 1/20 of his salary The total fraction of his salary spent and saved is: (1/5) + (1/10) + (3/5) + (1/20) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 20 in this case: (4/20) + (2/20) + (12/20) + (1/20) = (19/20) This means that 19/20 of his salary is spent or saved. Now, we know that taxes take away 1/8 of his initial salary. So, the fraction of his salary left after taxes is: 1 - (1/8) = (8/8) - (1/8) = (7/8) The amount of salary left after taxes and spending/saving is the fraction of the salary that is not spent or saved, which is: 1 - (19/20) = (20/20) - (19/20) = (1/20) So, the fraction of his salary that is left after taxes and after all spending and saving is: (7/8) * (1/20) = (7/160) We are given that this amount is 18,000.

To find the smallest number where this condition holds, the digits before the final '50' should ideally be as small as possible, while still allowing the product to be a multiple of 50.

The smallest such number is 550, as it ends in 50 and has an additional '5', making the product of digits (5 times 5 times 0 = 25), which is not a multiple of 50.

To find the tangent line at P, we need the derivative of the parabola's equation. We start by expressing y as a function of x, y = frac{x^2}{4}. Taking the derivative with respect to x, we get y' = frac{1}{2}x. For the point P(-2, 1), the slope of the tangent is: y'(-2) = frac{1}{2}(-2) = -1. The equation of the tangent line can be determined using the point-slope form y - y_1 = m(x - x_1): y - 1 = -1(x + 2), which simplifies to x + y + 1 = 0. For the point P(2, 1), the slope of the tangent is: y'(2) = frac{1}{2}(2) = 1. Again, using the point-slope formula: y - 1 = 1(x - 2), which simplifies to x - y - 1 = 0.

What is the maximum number of viewers who could have voted after moment T ?","completion":"1. Let us consider the moment when the rating decreases by 1. Assume that before this moment, n people had voted, and the rating was an integer x. Therefore, the total sum of points was nx. The rating at any moment is calculated as: [ text{Rating} = frac{text{Sum of all ratings}}{text{Number of votes}} ] Given that the rating is x and there were n votes, we have: [ frac{text{Sum of all ratings}}{n} = x implies text{Sum of all ratings} = nx ] 2. If the next viewer gives a rating y, the sum of ratings becomes nx + y. The new rating will be: [ text{New Rating} = frac{nx + y}{n+1} ] Given that this new rating is x-1: [ frac{nx + y}{n+1} = x - 1 ] 3. Solving for y: [ nx + y = (n+1)(x-1) ] [ nx + y = nx + x - n - 1 ] [ y = x - n - 1 ] 4. To maximize the number of viewers after moment T, let's consider the constraints: - The highest possible value of x is 10. - The smallest possible value of n at the initial moment is 1 (since there is at least one vote giving rise to an integer rating). Therefore, initially: [ y_{text{max}} = 10 - 1 - 1 = 8 ] 5.

How many feasible networks are there?","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of feasible networks that can be formed under the given conditions. Let's break down the solution step-by-step. 1. **Define the function ( f(n) )**: Let ( f(n) ) be the number of feasible networks with ( n ) airports. 2. **Base cases**: - For ( n = 1 ), there is only one feasible network (the empty network), so ( f(1) = 1 ). - For ( n = 2 ), there are two feasible networks: the empty network and the network with a single connection between the two airports. Thus, ( f(2) = 2 ). 3. **Inductive hypothesis**: Assume that for ( k-1 ) airports, the number of feasible networks is ( f(k-1) = 2^{k-2} ). 4. **Inductive step**: Consider ( k ) airports. We split the number of feasible networks into two cases: - **Case 1**: Airport 1 is not connected to any other airport. In this case, the number of feasible networks is ( f(k-1) ). - **Case 2**: Airport 1 is connected to at least one other airport. In this case, airport 1 must be connected to airport ( k ) (the highest priority airport), and airport ( k ) must be connected to all airports from 1 to ( k-1 ). This configuration exists in every feasible network of length ( k ). Creating a feasible network within the airports 1 to ( k-1 ) is equivalent to creating a feasible network of ( k ) airports because each airport ( i ) is connected to airport ( k ). Therefore, this case also gives ( f(k-1) ) feasible networks. 5. **Combine the cases**: Since both cases are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities, we have: [ f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-1) = 2f(k-1) ] 6. **Solve the recurrence relation**: Using the recurrence relation ( f(k) = 2f(k-1) ) and the base case ( f(1) = 1 ), we can solve for ( f(n) ): [ f(2) = 2f(1) = 2 f(3) = 2f(2) = 4 f(4) = 2f(3) = 8 vdots f(n) = 2^{n-1} ] 7. **Apply the formula for ( n = 10 )**: [ f(10) = 2^{10-1} = 2^9 = 512 ] The final answer is ( boxed{512} )."},{"prompt":"Tracy, Michelle, and Kati take a road trip that is a total of 1000 miles.

What percent of his apples does the vendor sell on the first day?","completion":"Let's denote the total number of apples the vendor initially has as A. On the first day, the vendor sells some percent of his apples. Let's call this percentage S (where S is a fraction representing the percentage, so for example, if the vendor sells 30% of his apples, S would be 0.30). So, the number of apples sold on the first day is S * A. The number of apples remaining after the first day's sale is A - S * A = A(1 - S). The vendor then throws away 20% of the remaining apples, which is 0.20 * A(1 - S). The number of apples remaining after throwing away 20% is A(1 - S) - 0.20 * A(1 - S) = A(1 - S)(1 - 0.20) = A(1 - S)(0.80). On the second day, the vendor sells 50% of the remaining apples, which is 0.50 * A(1 - S)(0.80). The number of apples thrown away on the second day is the other 50% of the remaining apples, which is also 0.50 * A(1 - S)(0.80). The total percentage of apples thrown away is the sum of the apples thrown away on the first day and the second day, which is 42% of A. So we have: 0.20 * A(1 - S) + 0.50 * A(1 - S)(0.80) = 0.42 * A We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by A: 0.20(1 - S) + 0.50(1 - S)(0.80) = 0.42 Now let's solve for S: 0.20 - 0.20S + 0.40 - 0.40S = 0.42 Combine like terms: 0.60 - 0.60S = 0.42 Subtract 0.60 from both sides: -0.60S = 0.42 - 0.60 -0.60S = -0.18 Divide both sides by -0.60: S = -0.18 / -0.60 S = 0.30 So the vendor sells boxed{30%} of his apples on the first day."},{"prompt":"Given the origin (O) as the center of a circle, and the circle is tangent to the line (x+y+2=0), the equation of the circle is ______, and the positional relationship between circle (O) and the circle (x^{2}+y^{2}2y3=0) is ______.","completion":"Since the origin is the center of the desired circle, and the circle is tangent to the line (x+y+2=0), the radius (r) of the desired circle is equal to the distance (d= dfrac {2}{ sqrt {2}}= sqrt {2}), thus, the equation of the desired circle is (x^{2}+y^{2}=2). The center of the circle (x^{2}+y^{2}-2y-3=0) is ((0,1)), with a radius of (2). The distance between the centers of the two circles is (1), which is between the difference and the sum of their radii, indicating that the two circles intersect. Therefore, the answer is: the equation of the circle is boxed{x^{2}+y^{2}=2}; they intersect.

Given that (frac{asqrt{3} + b}{bsqrt{3} + c}) is a rational number, we can represent it as (frac{r}{s}) where (r, s in mathbb{Z}).

Therefore, we must have: [ as - br = 0 quad text{and} quad cr - bs = 0 ] This simplifies to: [ as = br quad text{and} quad cr = bs ] 2. From (as = br) and (cr = bs), we can multiply these two equations to get: [ (as)(cr) = (br)(bs) ] Simplifying, we obtain: [ acsr = b^2rs ] Dividing both sides by (rs), we get: [ ac = b^2 ] 3. Next, we need to show that (frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{a + b + c}) is an integer. We start by noting the identity: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) ] Therefore: [ frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{a + b + c} = frac{(a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca)}{a + b + c} ] 4. For (frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{a + b + c}) to be an integer, ((a + b + c)) must divide (a^2 + b^2 + c^2). From the identity above, this is equivalent to: [ (a + b + c) mid 2(ab + bc + ca) ] 5. Using the fact that (b^2 = ac), we can rewrite (2(ab + bc + ca)) as: [ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 2(ab + bc + b^2) = 2b(a + b + c) ] Since (2b(a + b + c)) is clearly divisible by ((a + b + c)), it follows that: [ (a + b + c) mid 2(ab + bc + ca) ] Therefore, (frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{a + b + c}) is an integer.

We can express this as: [ SP = CP times (1 + frac{37.5}{100}) ] [ SP = CP times (1 + 0.375) ] [ SP = CP times 1.375 ] Substituting the value of ( SP ) from the profit percentage into the first equation, we get: [ N times CP = 16 times (CP times 1.375) ] [ N times CP = 16 times CP times 1.375 ] Since ( CP ) is not zero, we can divide both sides of the equation by ( CP ) to get: [ N = 16 times 1.375 ] [ N = 22 ] Therefore, the merchant has boxed{22} articles."},{"prompt":"Tom is playing a game and gets 10 points for killing an enemy.

Since he gets 10 points for each enemy killed, we multiply the number of enemies by the points per enemy: 150 enemies * 10 points/enemy = 1500 points Now, we know that Tom's total score with the bonus is 2250 points. To find out the bonus, we subtract the score without the bonus from the total score: 2250 points (total score) - 1500 points (without bonus) = 750 points (bonus) To find the percentage of the bonus, we take the bonus points and divide them by the score without the bonus, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (750 points (bonus) / 1500 points (without bonus)) * 100 = 50% So, the percentage of the bonus Tom gets for killing at least 100 enemies is boxed{50%} ."},{"prompt":"(The full score for this question is 7 points) Xiangyang Flower Base sells two types of flowers: lilies and roses, with unit prices as follows: roses at 4 yuan per plant, and lilies at 5 yuan per plant.

We start with the given equation: [-x^2 + 2y^2 - 10x - 16y + 1 = 0.] **Step 1: Complete the square for both x and y terms.** For the x terms: begin{align*} -(x^2 + 10x) &= -(x^2 + 10x + 25) + 25 &= -(x + 5)^2 + 25. end{align*} For the y terms: begin{align*} 2(y^2 - 8y) &= 2(y^2 - 8y + 16) - 32 &= 2(y - 4)^2 - 32. end{align*} Substituting these into the original equation gives: begin{align*} -(x + 5)^2 + 2(y - 4)^2 + 1 &= 0 -(x + 5)^2 + 2(y - 4)^2 &= -1 -(x + 5)^2 + 2(y - 4)^2 + 25 - 32 &= -1 -(x + 5)^2 + 2(y - 4)^2 &= 6. end{align*} **Step 2: Rewrite in standard form.** Dividing the entire equation by 6 yields: [frac{(y - 4)^2}{3} - frac{(x + 5)^2}{6} = 1.] This matches the standard form of a hyperbola: [frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1,] where a = sqrt{3}, b = sqrt{6}, h = -5, and k = 4. The center of the hyperbola is at (h, k) = (-5, 4). **Step 3: Determine the coordinates of the foci.** Since the hyperbola opens vertically (the y^2 term is positive), the foci are vertically aligned with the center. The distance from the center to each focus is given by c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}: [c = sqrt{3 + 6} = sqrt{9} = 3.] Therefore, the coordinates of the foci are: [(-5, 4 pm 3).] This gives us two points: (-5, 7) and (-5, 1).

On each step, a spectator indicates which card from the edge should be discarded, and the magician selects whether to count from the left or right edge, discarding the corresponding card. For which initial positions of the three of clubs can the magician guarantee the success of the trick?","completion":": 1. We start by understanding the rules of the problem. The magician lays out a deck of 52 cards in a row and announces that 51 cards will be thrown away, leaving only the three of clubs (denoted as T). 2. The key to solving the problem is to ensure that T is never thrown out. A card will be discarded from either the left or the right end based on the choice given by the spectator. 3. The solution suggests that T should be placed at one of the ends of the row (either the extreme left or the extreme right). 4. To elucidate why T must be at one of the ends, we consider what might happen if T starts anywhere but the ends. It will be displaced progressively closer to the center, making it eventually necessary to remove it as cards are removed from both ends. 5. Here’s a detailed reasoning: - If T starts at an end, the magician can always ensure that any other card is removed. If the spectator chooses a number k, the magician can choose which end to count from such that k does not align with T if T is at an end. - If T starts not at an end, then at some point, it will be the closer of the two middle cards forcing it to be removed when only these choices remain. 6. Let's illustrate this with the two strategies provided for the spectator: **Strategy 1:** - The spectator always names the position of T. The magician can keep T safe initially by choosing the opposite end. - However, when T is forced into a central position, the distances to both ends become equal. Thus, the magician will eventually have no choice but to discard T. **Strategy 2:** - The spectator names positions randomly but avoids edge positions. - When there are only three cards left, T eventually becomes the middle card (if it isn’t already discarded) and the magician will have no option but to discard one of the edge cards. 7. The magician can only guarantee the T at an end because they can manipulate the discards from the opposite ends to ensure T is never the one forcefully removed by the equality of positions. # Conclusion: Therefore, the success of the magician’s trick can only be guaranteed if the three of clubs (T) is initially placed at one of the ends of the row.

Step 1: Calculate the total sum and the sum for each face The sum of all integers from 1 to 4 is: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. ] A tetrahedron has 4 faces, and each vertex belongs to 3 faces. The sum of the numbers on each face, considering each vertex count, must be: [ frac{10 times 3}{4} = 7.5. ] However, this result is not an integer, indicating a miscalculation. Correcting it: The sum of the face should be counted as each number appears in three different face sums: [ frac{10}{3} ] This is not correct since the sum should be an integer. We must reconsider the approach or check if such a configuration is possible. Step 2: Reanalyze the problem Since each number appears exactly once on each face, and the total sum is 10, the sum of any three numbers (each vertex of a tetrahedron face) should be the same and should divide the total sum of all numbers by the number of faces. Given four numbers sum to 10, and there are four faces, each face should sum to: [ frac{10 times 3}{4} = 7.5 ] which is impossible in integer terms.

We aim to prove that (KLMN) is a tangential quadrilateral and that the center of its incircle is (E). Step-by-Step Proof: **Step 1: Introduce Perpendiculars and Midpoints** Define points (K_1, L_1, M_1,) and (N_1) to be the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from point (E) to the sides (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA) respectively. These points are midpoints of segments (EK, EL, EM,) and (EN) since the reflections ensure symmetry. **Step 2: Smaller Quadrilateral (Q_1) and Similarity with (Q)** Quadrilateral (Q_1 = K_1 L_1 M_1 N_1) is similar to quadrilateral (Q = KLMN) with a similarity ratio of (1:2) and a similarity center at (E). Therefore, if we prove (Q_1) is a tangential quadrilateral with the incenter at (E), the same must hold for (Q). **Step 3: Proving (Q_1) is Tangential** To demonstrate that (Q_1) is tangential, we establish that angles at points (K_1, L_1, M_1,) and (N_1) are bisected by lines (EK_1, EL_1, EM_1,) and (EN_1). Here is the detailed reasoning: - Quadrilateral (EN_1AK_1) and (EL_1BK_1) are cyclic because (N_1) and (K_1) are right angles (perpendiculars to a common point). - From cyclic properties, we have: [ angle EK_1N_1 = angle EAN_1 = angle CAD ] [ angle EK_1L_1 = angle EBL_1 = angle DBC ] Due to the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, angles (angle CAD) and (angle DBC) subtended by the same arcs are equal: [ angle CAD = angle DBC ] Thus, [ angle EK_1N_1 = angle EK_1L_1 ] proving that (K_1) bisects the angle it subtends. Since this property holds for all corners of (Q_1), it confirms that (Q_1) is a tangential quadrilateral with incenter (E). **Step 4: Extending Results to (Q)** By the established similarity, the quadrilateral (Q = KLMN) inherits the properties of (Q_1). Therefore, (Q) is tangential with its incenter at (E). **Conclusion:** Thus, (KLMN) is a tangential quadrilateral, and the center of its incircle is indeed (E).

Since (a < b), there must also be one integer among these (b) consecutive integers that is divisible by (a). Denote this integer by (A). 3. Based on the divisibility properties: - If (A neq B), their product (AB) will be divisible by both (a) and (b). Therefore, (AB) will be divisible by (a cdot b), since (gcd(a, b) = 1). 4. Now consider the case where (A = B). In this scenario, (B) is a common multiple of both (a) and (b).

The area of triangle (LMQ) is given as (2). 2. **Prove that (KLMN) is an isosceles trapezoid:** - Since (KL = MN) and (KLMN) is inscribed in a circle, this suggests (KL) and (MN) are parallel, and thus (KLMN) is an isosceles trapezoid. 3. **Set up the bases of the trapezoid (KLMN:)** - Let (KN = x) and (LM = y). - Given (KN + LM = 24), we can write: [ x + y = 24 ] 4. **Use the geometry of the triangles to find the lengths:** - Using the properties of trapezoids, the distance between the bases (height) is (6). The legs of the isosceles trapezoid will be the same, and thus one leg forms a right-angled triangle when the height is dropped from (L) and (M). Denote these legs as (b). 5. **Determine the triangles formed by the height:** - The height dropped from (L) onto (KN) divides (KN) into two segments, each half of (KN) since the trapezoid is isosceles. Therefore, each segment is (x/2). - Similarly, the height dropped from (M) onto (KN) divides (KN) into half at the midpoint, thus each segment is (y/2). 6. **Relate the leg and the height to solve for the lengths:** - Form triangles (LKN) and react based on the information given. - From the area of triangles and how they relate to the trapezoid’s structure, we know each triangle shares the height (6) and thus can set up: [ Area_{LKN} + Area_{LMQ} = total Area. ] Given our specific properties: [ Total Area = frac{1}{2} * height * (x + y) ] Setting up (LMQ): ( text{Area}_{LMQ} = 2. ) By substituting the given relationships and solving: With heights: Calculation: [ 2 + 2 = frac{1}{2} * 6 * 20, This calculates: boxed{LM = 4 , KN = 20} ] We can validate more using the area formulas but the essential combining area results with trapezoidal properties above. 7. **Find the radius (R):** - Utilize putting these back into our setting Circle properties geometrically rove (LM, KN!)

Initial observation**: First, we consider what it means for two numbers a and b to be relatively prime divisors of n. If a and b are relatively prime, their greatest common divisor gcd(a, b) = 1. The problem states we must find all natural numbers n such that for any relatively prime divisors a and b, the number a + b - 1 is also a divisor of n. **2. Simple cases (prime powers)**: It is known that for numbers of the form p^k, where p is a prime, such numbers satisfy the condition. This is because the divisors of p^k are 1, p, p^2, ldots, p^k, and any sum of such divisors minus one will be another multiple of p, hence a divisor of p^k. **3. Case for n = 12:** It is straightforward to check that n = 12 meets the given criteria. The set of divisors of 12 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. We check all combinations of relatively prime pairs: - (1, 2) rightarrow 1 + 2 - 1 = 2 (2 text{is a divisor of} 12) - (1, 3) rightarrow 1 + 3 - 1 = 3 (3 text{is a divisor of} 12) - (1, 4) rightarrow 1 + 4 - 1 = 4 (4 text{is a divisor of} 12) - (1, 6) rightarrow 1 + 6 - 1 = 6 (6 text{is a divisor of} 12) - (1, 12) rightarrow 1 + 12 - 1 = 12 (12 text{is a divisor of} 12) - (2, 3) rightarrow 2 + 3 - 1 = 4 (4 text{is a divisor of} 12) - (2, 4) rightarrow 2 + 4 - 1 = 5 (5 text{is not a divisor of} 12) Here, since (2, 4) are not relatively prime (gcd(2, 4) neq 1), this pair does not need to be checked. Remaining pairs follow similarly, verifying n = 12 fits the criteria. **4. Excluding other even numbers**: Consider n as an arbitrary even number that is not a power of 2. Let us write n in the form n = 2^m k, where m geq 1 and k > 1 is an odd number. This form covers all even integers. - Take k (odd) and another number 2, which are relatively prime: 1 + k - 1 = k. - k+2-1 = k+1: Since k is odd, k+1 is even and can be written as 2^alpha for some integer alpha. But, k+1 needs to be a divisor of k, which leads to a contradiction since k and k+1 are coprime. Therefore, k+1 being 2^alpha where alpha > 1 is incompatible with k being relatively prime, and thus such n must be 2^m or specific even non-powers of 2 like 12. **5. Establishing completeness and coherence**: For higher powers of 2: * If n=2, 4, 8, 16, ldots, these satisfy the condition. Universal step for any a and b: - Every sum a + b - 1 generates within the same module, validating p^k primes iteratively.

Let lines (AB) and (CD) be the internal common tangents of circles (odot O_1) and (odot O_2) respectively, implying all four points (A, B, C,) and (D) lie on the circle (Gamma). Let (EF) denote the external common tangent of (odot O_1) and (odot O_2). We claim that (AC parallel EF). **Proof of the Lemma:** Using the power of a point theorem which states: [ AG' cdot CH + AC cdot EF = AH' cdot CG ] we have this scenario: [ begin{aligned} & Rightarrow (OA - OG)(OC - OH) + AC(OM + ON) = (OA + OH)(OC + OG) & Rightarrow AC(OM + ON) = (OA + OH)(OC + OG) - (OA - OG)(OC - OH) ] Rewriting and simplifying then leads to: [ frac{MN}{AC} = frac{OM + ON}{OA + OC} ] From the cosine rule in both (triangle O_1 OMN) and (triangle O ACC), we get: [ begin{aligned} & frac{OM^2 + ON^2 - MN^2}{2 OM cdot ON} = frac{OA^2 + OC^2 - AC^2}{2 OA cdot OC} & Rightarrow frac{(OM + ON)^2 - MN^2}{(OA + OC)^2 - AC^2} = frac{OM cdot ON}{OA cdot OC} end{aligned} ] Thus, it must be true that: [ begin{aligned} & frac{MN}{AC} = frac{OM - ON}{OA - OC} = frac{OM + ON}{OA + OC} & Rightarrow frac{MN}{AC} = frac{OM}{OA} = frac{ON}{OC} Rightarrow AC parallel EF end{aligned} ] With the lemma validated, focus moves to Figure 4. **Main Proof:** Construct the Nine-Point Circle (odot N) of (triangle ABC). The Nine-Point Circle (odot N) also serves as the Nine-Point Circle for (triangle ABH) and (triangle ACH) and passes through points (D) and (M). By Feuerbach's Theorem, circles (odot I_1) and (odot I_2) are both internally tangent to (odot N). Define (l) as the external common tangent line to (odot I_1) and (odot I_2) that intersects (HD). Let the internal common tangents intersect (odot N) at point (M'). According to the lemma, (M'D parallel l). Our goal is to show that (BC parallel l). Assume that: Define (AB = c), (BC = a), (AC = b), the angles (angle BAC = alpha), (angle ABC = beta), (angle ACB = gamma). From basic trigonometric properties and the distances: [ begin{aligned} & AH = a cot alpha, & BH = b cot beta, & CH = c cot gamma end{aligned} ] We can therefore calculate: [ begin{aligned} & AF = frac{a cot alpha + b - c cot gamma}{2}, & FI_2 = AF tan left( frac{pi}{4} - frac{gamma}{2} right) end{aligned} ] Similarly, find expressions for (AE) and (EI_1). Thus, formula (1) results: [ begin{aligned} & frac{1 + tan left( frac{pi}{4} - frac{gamma}{2} right)}{1 + tan left( frac{pi}{4} - frac{beta}{2} right)} & = frac{cos alpha + sin gamma - cos beta}{cos alpha + sin beta - cos gamma} & = frac{sin gamma - 2 sin left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) cdot sin left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right)}{sin beta - 2 sin left( frac{alpha + gamma}{2} right) cdot sin left( frac{alpha - gamma}{2} right)} end{aligned} ] Verify: [ frac{cos frac{gamma}{2} cdot cos left( frac{pi}{4} - frac{beta}{2} right)}{cos frac{beta}{2} cdot cos left( frac{pi}{4} - frac{gamma}{2} right)} ] Therefore, only need to show: [ frac{sin left( frac{pi}{4}-frac{gamma}{2} right) + cos left( frac{pi}{4} - frac{gamma}{2} right)}{sin left( frac{pi}{4} - frac{beta}{2} right) + cos left( frac{pi}{4} - frac{beta}{2} right)} = frac{cos frac{gamma}{2}}{cos frac{beta}{2}} ] which evidently holds. Next, consider (odot I_1) and (odot I_2) as perpendicular to (AH) and intersecting (DH) at segments intersecting line (AD) at points (T_1) and (T_2). From formula (1), knowing (AT_1 = AT_2), implies points (T_1) and (T_2) coincide at a single point (T).

Now, we are given that the difference between g(106) and g(some number) is 105. Since 106 is an even number, g(106) is the same as g(105), which is the product of all odd integers from 1 to 105.

Let's denote the \\"some number\\" as m. We are looking for a value of m such that: g(105) - g(m) = 105 Since g(m) must be a product of odd integers, and the difference is 105 (which is also an odd number), it suggests that m must be an odd number less than 105.

Find all natural numbers ( n ) such that a ( 1995 times n ) rectangle can be divided into a set of stripes with all different dimensions.","completion":"To determine all natural numbers ( n ) for which a ( 1995 times n ) rectangle can be divided into pairs of strips with different widths, we consider the following two cases: **Case 1: ( n < 1995 )** 1. The longest strip that can be divided is of length 1995; 2. Therefore, we need the number of different dimension strips that can be formed to cover the entire area of the rectangle. These least differences can only sum up to: [ 1 + 2 + cdots + 1995 = frac{1995 cdot (1995 + 1)}{2} = 1995 cdot 998. ] - This is because, via arithmetic series sum formula ( sum_{i=1}^{k}i = frac{k cdot (k+1)}{2} ) where ( k = 1995 ) 3. Hence, for the splitting with different widths to be valid, we must have ( n ) satisfy: [ 1995 times n leq 1995 times 998 ] - Dividing both side by 1995, [ n leq 998 ] 4. We conclude that ( n ) must be at most 998 in this case. For natural numbers ( n leq 998 ), we can arrange parallel strips. The ( k )-th longest strip can be split into a strip of length ( k ) and a strip of length ( n − k ) without replicating dimensions. **Case 2: ( n geq 1995 )** 1. Here, the longest dimension ( 1995 times n ) must be evaluated in terms of strip of length ( n ): [ 1 + 2 + cdots + n = frac{n cdot (n+1)}{2} ] 2. To cover the entire area, the count should be sufficient: [ 1995 cdot n leq frac{n cdot (n + 1)}{2} ] 3. Rearranging the terms, we solve: [ 3990 leq n + 1 ] - Multiplying both sides by 2 and then dividing by ( n): [ 1995 leq frac{n + 1}{2} ] - This simplifies further to yield ( n geq 3989 ) 4. When ( n geq 3989 ), the same method from Case 1 applies. The area effectively being split justifies using the same differences approach to form pairs of strip (e.g., length ( i ) and length ( (1995 - i) )). **Conclusion:** Thus, the natural numbers ( n ) that allow a ( 1995 times n ) rectangle to be divided into pairs of strips with different widths are: [ boxed{n leq 998 text{ and } n geq 3989} ]"},{"prompt":"Pamela bought 9.8 ounces of sugar, and she spilled some of it on the floor.

This is because: - We can find a subsequence of 30 integers whose sum is divisible by (2^{15}). - We can find a subsequence of 18 integers whose sum is divisible by (3^6). - We can find a subsequence of 15 integers whose sum is divisible by (5^3). - We can find a subsequence of 14 integers whose sum is divisible by (7^2). - We can find a subsequence of 11 integers whose sum is divisible by (11). - We can find a subsequence of 13 integers whose sum is divisible by (13). 6. **Combine the results**: By combining these subsequences and using the multiplication operation, we can ensure that the entire expression is divisible by (16!).

Since 18 is divisible by 3, 64,350 is also divisible by 3. - **4**: For divisibility by 4, the last two digits of the number must be divisible by 4. The last two digits are 50, and since 50 is divisible by 4, so is 64,350. - **5**: 64,350 ends in a 0, so it is divisible by 5. - **6**: Because 64,350 is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6. - **7**: To check divisibility by 7, double the last digit (0) and subtract it from the rest of the number (6435). So we check if 6435 is divisible by 7. It is not immediately clear, but by further calculations, we find that 6435 is not divisible by 7. - **8**: For a number to be divisible by 8, the last three digits must be divisible by 8. Here, the last three digits are 350. Since 350 is not divisible by 8, 64,350 is also not divisible by 8. - **9**: As identified earlier, the sum of the digits is 18, which is divisible by 9, so 64,350 is divisible by 9. Hence, the integers 1 to 9 that divide 64,350 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9. Therefore, the answer is 7 divisors.

The equation of circle C is ________.","completion":"First, let's find the two points where the line 2x - y + 2 = 0 intersects the coordinate axes. For the x-axis, set y = 0: 2x + 2 = 0 Rightarrow x = -1. So the point on the x-axis is (-1, 0). For the y-axis, set x = 0: -y + 2 = 0 Rightarrow y = 2. So the point on the y-axis is (0, 2). Now let's find the focus of the parabola y^2 = 8x. The standard form of a parabola is y^2 = 4ax, where (a,0) is the focus. Comparing y^2 = 8x to y^2 = 4ax, we find that a = 2. Hence, the focus of the parabola is (2, 0). We now know that circle C passes through (-1,0), (0,2), and (2,0). A circle's equation can be written as: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h,k) is the center, and r is the radius. Since our circle passes through the three points, we will use their coordinates to form three equations. Using point (-1,0), we have: (-1 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2, which simplifies to: h^2 + 2h + 1 + k^2 = r^2. tag{1} Using point (0,2), we have: (0 - h)^2 + (2 - k)^2 = r^2, which simplifies to: h^2 + k^2 - 4k + 4 = r^2. tag{2} Using point (2,0), we have: (2 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2, which simplifies to: h^2 - 4h + 4 + k^2 = r^2. tag{3} We can use equations (1), (2), and (3) to find h and k. Subtracting (1) from (2) and (1) from (3) to eliminate r^2, we get: -4k + 4 = 2h, -4h + 4 = 2h. Solving the two resulting equations: -2k + 2 = h, -2h + 2 = h. From the second equation, we have: -3h + 2 = 0 Rightarrow h = frac{2}{3}. Substituting h into the first equation gives us k: -2k + 2 = frac{2}{3} Rightarrow k = frac{2}{3}. Since (h,k) is the center of the circle, we now know that the center of circle C is at left(frac{2}{3},frac{2}{3}right). To find r^2, we substitute h and k into one of the equations above, say equation (1): left(frac{2}{3}right)^2 + 2left(frac{2}{3}right) + 1 + left(frac{2}{3}right)^2 = r^2, r^2 = frac{4}{9} + frac{4}{3} + 1 + frac{4}{9}, r^2 = frac{8}{9} + frac{4}{3} + 1, r^2 = frac{8 + 12 + 9}{9}, r^2 = frac{29}{9}.

In such a trapezoid, among other properties, the diagonals are equal: [ B C_2 = A D ] 4. Since A D was also equal to B C_1, it follows that: [ B C_2 = B C_1 ] Thus, B C_1 = B C_2. blacksquare **III.

This means for any triplet ( (a_x, a_y, a_z) ) with ( a_x leq a_y leq a_z ), we have: [ a_z geq a_x + a_y ] 5. **Apply the assumption to the largest stones:** Using the assumption for the largest stones, we get: [ a_n geq a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} ] [ a_{n-1} geq a_{n-2} + a_{n-3} ] [ vdots ] [ a_3 geq a_2 + a_1 ] 6. **Sum the inequalities:** Adding all these inequalities, we get: [ a_n + a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + ldots + a_3 geq (a_{n-2} + a_{n-3} + ldots + a_1) + a_2 ] Simplifying, we get: [ a_n geq (a_{n-2} + a_{n-3} + ldots + a_1) + a_2 ] [ a_n geq S - a_n - a_{n-1} + a_2 ] [ 2a_n + a_{n-1} geq S + a_2 ] 7. **Contradiction:** From step 3, we have: [ 2a_n + a_{n-1} < S ] Combining this with the inequality from step 6, we get: [ S > 2a_n + a_{n-1} geq S + a_2 ] This implies: [ S > S + a_2 ] which is a contradiction since ( a_2 > 0 ). 8. **Conclusion:** The assumption that no good triplet exists leads to a contradiction.

In the right triangle AOA_{1}, applying this theorem we get: [ OT^{2} = AT cdot TA_{1}. ] Since AO = A_{1}O = r (radii of the circle), we have: [ r^{2} = MA cdot NA_{1}. ] 3. **Repetition for all points A, B, C:** Similarly, we can establish the same relationship for the points B and C. For any point X on MK and its corresponding intersection on NL (let's call it X_1), we have: [ r^{2} = MX cdot NX_{1}. ] Specifically: [ r^{2} = MB cdot NB_{1}, ] [ r^{2} = MC cdot NC_{1}. ] 4. **Using the harmonic division property:** Given that MA = MB = BC, we need to check the harmonic division condition. For harmonic sets, (N, C_{1}, B_{1}, A_{1}) must satisfy a specific ratio: [ frac{NA_1 cdot NC_1}{NB_1^2} = 1, ] Given MB = frac{1}{2}(MA+MC), we can manipulate the expressions: [ frac{1}{NB_{1}} = frac{1}{2}left( frac{1}{NA_{1}} + frac{1}{NC_{1}} right). ] This rearrangement complies with the harmonic mean condition as stated. # Conclusion: Thus, we have proved that the points N, C_{1}, B_{1}, A_{1} form a harmonic quadruple.

We have: [y=-frac{1}{4}x^2 implies x^2=-4y] This form of the equation helps us identify the focus and directrix of the parabola. For a parabola described by x^2=4py, the focus is at (0, p) and the directrix is the line y=-p. Comparing, we find that p=-1. Therefore, the focus, F, is at (0, -1) and the directrix is the line y=1. The expression sqrt{m^2+(n+1)^2}+sqrt{(m-4)^2+(n+5)^2} represents the sum of distances from a point P(m, n) on the parabola to the focus F(0, -1) and to another point A(4, -5). By the definition of a parabola, the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to its distance to the directrix. Thus, the distance from P(m, n) to F(0, -1) is equal to the distance from P(m, n) to the line y=1. The minimum value of the given expression occurs when point P(m, n), the focus F(0, -1), and point A(4, -5) are collinear, and P(m, n) is directly between F and A. This is because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and adding another point on this line between them minimizes the total distance. Given the directrix y=1 and the focus F(0, -1), the minimum distance from F to the directrix is 1 - (-1) = 2. However, since we are considering the distance from F to A through a point on the parabola, we need to consider the vertical distance from A to the directrix as well, which is 1 - (-5) = 6.

According to the rules: - Alicia can only add 4 or divide by 2 if ( n ) is even. Since ( n ) is odd, Alicia can only add 4 to ( n ) during her turn. Let's denote the number at the start of Alicia's turn as ( n ). Alicia will make the move ( n to n + 4 ). Now, Florent's turn follows. Florent has two choices: he can either subtract 2 from ( n + 4 ) or multiply it by 2 if the number is odd. Since ( n + 4 ) is odd (odd + even = odd), Florent chooses to subtract 2, resulting in: [ n + 4 - 2 = n + 2 ] At each pair of turns (Alicia and Florent), the number ( n ) increases by 2. Thus, Florent can continuously ensure that ( n ) remains odd by this strategy: [ n to n + 2 to n + 2 + 2 to ldots ] Eventually, ( n ) will become larger than 1000, thus ensuring Florent's win because Alicia will not be able to reach 0 or 1 within 100 turns. Therefore, in cases where ( n ) is odd, Florent has a winning strategy. 2. **Alicia's Strategy When ( n ) is Even:** Now consider the scenario where ( n ) is even. In this case, Alicia has a potential winning strategy: - If ( n ) is divisible by 4, she will divide ( n ) by 2. - If ( n ) is not divisible by 4, she will add 4 to ( n ). Let's denote ( n = 4k + 2 ) (where ( k ) is an integer). Now: - Alicia will add 4 to ( n ): [ n = 4k + 2 to 4k + 6 ] The new value ( n = 4k + 6 ) (which is even but not divisible by 4). Now, it's Florent's turn: - Florent can only subtract 2 from ( 4k + 6 ). Therefore, [ 4k + 6 - 2 = 4k + 4 ] ( 4k + 4 ) is now divisible by 4. Alicia will divide by 2: [ 4k + 4 to 2k + 2 ] Consider this process repeatedly: - After 1 more paired turn (Alicia and Florent), if the initial ( n ) is of the form ( 4k + 2 ): [ frac{n}{2} - 2 leq frac{n}{2} ] This means that within every two turns the number ( n ) reduces by approximately half. For brevity, we can generalize that ( n rightarrow frac{n}{2} ) within a finite number of turns significantly diminishes ( n ).

Any two flight paths using the same airline company share a common endpoint. We need to show that we can partition all the cities into k+2 groups such that no two cities within the same group are directly connected by a flight path. 1. **Base Case: ( k = 0 )** - When ( k = 0 ), there are no airlines. Thus, no cities are connected by any flight paths. Hence, we can trivially partition the cities into as many groups as we like, including ( k+2 ) groups. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** - Assume that for any number ( k ) of airlines, we can partition the cities into ( k+2 ) groups such that no two cities within the same group are connected by a flight path. 3. **Induction Step:** - Consider partitioning with ( k+1 ) airlines. Let's represent the cities and their connections as a graph where vertices represent cities, and edges represent flight paths between them. Each airline company corresponds to a set of edges ( E_1, E_2, dots, E_k ). 4. **Graph Properties:** - We examine the graph induced by ( E_i ), which contains the edges of the ( i )-th airline. - For any set ( E_i ), the graph it forms must be of a specific type: it should either be a tree or contain a single cycle (forming a \\"cactus graph\\"). 5. **Handling \\"Star\\" Graphs or Trees:** - If there exists a set ( E ) that forms a \\"star\\" graph with a central vertex ( A ), we can remove vertex ( A ) and all the edges connected to ( A ). This reduces the problem to ( k-1 ) airlines among the remaining vertices. - Following the induction hypothesis, we can partition the remaining vertices into ( (k-1) + 2 = k+1 ) groups. 6. **Add Central Vertex Back:** - Assign the central vertex ( A ) as its own group. This forms ( k+2 ) groups where no two vertices within the same group are connected by a flight path. 7. **Verification of Partition:** - Consider the case where each ( E_i ) is actually a tree. In such scenarios, the entire graph remains connected and without cycles. Partition the vertices such that any two vertices connected by the same ( E_i ) edge end up in different groups. - Let’s denote the groups ( B_1, B_2, dots, B_n ) with ( n geq k+3 ). We verify the absence of flight paths within the same groups by considering the partition's properties. If not, we keep merging groups until attaining ( k+2 ) groups. 8. **Final Argument:** - We partition vertices into the minimum number of groups (at most ( k+2 )). This satisfies the condition where no two cities within the same group share a direct flight path and there are no contradictions (i.e., conditions of the graph lead to a correct induction). Conclusively, the statement holds via mathematical induction for any ( k ) providing a consistent partitioning.

Additionally, the angle bisector intersects the circumcircle of triangle ABC at point Z. 2. Consider that the perpendicular dropped from the circumcenter O to the chord AZ intersects it at its midpoint, which we denote by P. This is a known property of the perpendicular bisector theorem stating that any perpendicular dropped from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord. 3. Identify points M and N as the midpoints of segments AB and AC respectively. Given this setup, the triangles triangle AYM, triangle AXM, and triangle XOZ allow us to analyze the angular relations further. 4. Since angle OXY = angle AXM, we observe that these two triangles are congruent due to them sharing angle A (half of angle A to be specific). [ angle OXY = 90^circ - frac{1}{2} angle A ] 5. Applying the same logic for angle OYX, we get: [ angle OYX = 90^circ - frac{1}{2} angle A ] 6. Because angle OXY = angle OYX, we conclude that triangle OXY is isosceles, i.e., OX = OY. 7. Given that triangle OXY is isosceles with OX = OY and OR being the altitude, it automatically serves as the median of triangle OXY. 8. Knowing the property that the median of an isosceles triangle divides the base into two equal segments, we can conclude: [ PX = PY ] Therefore, point P is the midpoint of segment XY. 9. Consequently, we express the relations using the lengths of these segments next: [ AX = AP - PX ] Given PX = PY, it follows: [ AX = AP - YP ] 10. Finally, because P is also the midpoint of AZ, we can write that: [ AZ - YP = YP ] Simplifying, we get: [ AX = YZ ] 11.

These planes are distinct (they do not coincide). 3. **Common Intersection**: The common intersection of these two planes is precisely the line segment AB. 4. **Circumsphere of Tetrahedron**: The tetrahedron ABCD has a circumsphere passing through all four vertices A, B, C, D, so this sphere intersects the planes of DAB and CAB in circles. 5. **Unique Circumsphere**: As each triangle (e.g., DAB) has a unique circumcircle and a sphere intersecting a plane results in a circle, the sphere described passes through both circles K_1 and K_2. 6. **Conclusion**: Hence, both circles K_1 and K_2 lie on the sphere determined by points A, B, C, D. Therefore, we have shown using two approaches that there exists a sphere on which both circles K_1 and K_2 lie. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Student Vasya, who lives 50 km from his institute, rides his bicycle to classes and always arrives exactly on time.

Xiaoming plans to spend a total of 30 yuan on these flowers. Therefore, we can write the equation as: [2x + 3y = 30] To find the number of different purchasing plans, we need to solve this equation for positive integer values of x and y. We can rearrange the equation to solve for y: [y = 10 - frac{2}{3}x] Since x and y must be positive integers, we can substitute different integer values for x and check if y is also an integer. The possible solutions are: 1. When x = 3, we have y = 10 - frac{2}{3}cdot3 = 10 - 2 = 8. 2. When x = 6, we have y = 10 - frac{2}{3}cdot6 = 10 - 4 = 6. 3.

Given that the target is hit at least once, we are interested in finding the probability that A hits the target, denoted as P(A|B'), where B' represents the event that the target is hit at least once. To find P(B'), we consider all the scenarios where the target is hit at least once: 1. A hits and B misses: P(A) times (1 - P(B)) = 0.6 times (1 - 0.5) = 0.6 times 0.5. 2. A misses and B hits: (1 - P(A)) times P(B) = (1 - 0.6) times 0.5 = 0.4 times 0.5. 3. Both A and B hit the target: P(A) times P(B) = 0.6 times 0.5.

Also, she has to pay an income tax of 15% on her total earnings each month, and after babysitting for 15 hours a week, her hourly pay is reduced to 15 per hour.","completion":"First, let's calculate Doris's weekly earnings from babysitting and teaching online classes, excluding taxes. From babysitting on weekdays (Monday to Friday), she earns: 3 hours/day * 20/hour * 5 days/week = 300/week On Saturdays, the number of hours she babysits varies between 2 to 5 hours. Since it's uniformly distributed, the average number of hours she babysits on Saturday is the midpoint of the range: (2 hours + 5 hours) / 2 = 3.5 hours However, after babysitting for 15 hours a week, her hourly pay is reduced to 15 per hour. Since she already babysits for 15 hours during the weekdays, all of her Saturday babysitting will be at the reduced rate: 3.5 hours * 15/hour = 52.50 Adding her online teaching earnings: 100/week So, her total weekly earnings before taxes are: 300 (weekday babysitting) + 52.50 (Saturday babysitting) + 100 (online teaching) = 452.50/week Now, let's calculate the income tax she has to pay on her total earnings each month. Since she earns 452.50 per week, her monthly earnings before taxes are: 452.50/week * 4 weeks/month = 1810/month The income tax she has to pay is 15% of her total earnings: 1810 * 15% = 271.50 Her monthly earnings after taxes are: 1810 - 271.50 = 1538.50 Now, let's find out how many weeks it takes for Doris to earn enough to cover her monthly expenses of 1200 after taxes.

(In this context, it didn't matter which color pieces each player used.) How many members were in the company and how many days did the vacation last?","completion":"1. Let's denote the number of members of the group as t, the number of days of the vacation as n, and the number of chess boards as s. It is assumed that everyone in the group can play both ping-pong and chess. From the problem, we know that there was exactly one ping-pong match per day and the total number of days is the number of ways to choose 2 members from the t members which is given by the combination: [ n = binom{t}{2} ] 2. We assign each chess board a unique number and consider all possible pairs of players that could play on each board. For the first board, there are binom{t}{2} possible pairs, for the second board binom{t-2}{2} possible pairs (since 2 players are already paired on the first board), and so on. The number of pairs for the s-th board is binom{t-2(s-1)}{2}. 3. Thus, the total number of possible distinct pairing arrangements on all boards is: [ binom{t}{2} binom{t-2}{2} binom{t-4}{2} cdots binom{t-2(s-1)}{2} ] 4. Since each chess board is distinct but the arrangement of pairings across different boards is indistinguishable, there are s! ways to arrange s such distinct pairings, reducing the total number of distinct pairings by a factor of s!: [ n = frac{1}{s!} cdot binom{t}{2} binom{t-2}{2} binom{t-4}{2} cdots binom{t-2s+2}{2} ] 5.

The expression for n can now be simplified and equated to the expression from step 1. Recall: [ n = binom{t}{2} = frac{t(t-1)}{2} ] 7. By setting both expressions for n equal: [ frac{t(t-1)}{2} = frac{t!}{s! cdot 2^s cdot (t-2s)!} ] 8. Simplify and equate: [ frac{(t-2)!}{s! cdot 2^{s-1} cdot (t-2s)!} = 1 ] Which can be written as: [ frac{(t-2)!}{s! cdot 2^{s-1} cdot (t-2s)!} = 1 ] 9. This leads to: [ binom{t-2}{t-2s} cdot (2s-2) cdot (2s-3) cdot ldots cdot (s+1) = 2^{s-1} ] 10. To solve, consider s=1 and the remaining factorizations: - s=1 gives t=2, trivially rejected since n must form meaningful tournaments greater than 1. - Setting s=2, evaluate: [ binom{t-2}{t-4} = binom{t-2}{2} = 2 ] Expands to: [ (t-2)(t-3) = 4 quad text{(No integer solutions for t)} ] 11. Test s=3: - Leads to: [ binom{t-2}{t-6} cdot 4 = 4 ] - Which means: [ t-6 = 0 implies t = 6 ] 12.

Simplifying this, we get frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. - For the second pair of sides, we have frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{6}}. Simplifying this, we get frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{6}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. - For the third pair of sides, we have frac{sqrt{5}}{sqrt{15}}. Simplifying this, we get frac{sqrt{5}}{sqrt{15}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. Since all three ratios of the corresponding sides are equal and simplify to frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, this means that the sides of triangle ABC are proportional to the sides of triangle DEF. According to the criteria for determining similar triangles, if the ratios of the corresponding sides are equal, then the triangles are similar. Therefore, triangle ABC and triangle DEF are definitely similar.

This will give us four pieces in total: two squares of side length (a/2) and two rectangles each of dimensions (frac{a}{2} times frac{a}{2}). 4. **Forming Two Squares**: - The objective is to now form two squares from the four pieces obtained. Consider the following: - The two squares of side length (a/2) already fit perfectly into a single square of side length (a/2). - The remaining pieces, which are smaller squares of side length (frac{a}{sqrt{2}}), rearranged form one square with side (a/sqrt{2}).

Capacity of the third cooler = Total capacity - (First cooler's capacity + Second cooler's capacity) Capacity of the third cooler = 325 liters - (100 liters + 150 liters) Capacity of the third cooler = 325 liters - 250 liters Capacity of the third cooler = 75 liters Now, to find the ratio of the capacity of the third cooler to the capacity of the second cooler, we divide the capacity of the third cooler by the capacity of the second cooler.

We are concerned with two layers: - The layer moved by operation (X), indicated by arrows suggesting a 90-degree clockwise rotation from the top to the right. - The layer moved by operation (Y), indicated by arrows suggesting a 90-degree clockwise rotation from the front to the top. 2. **Define Move (M):** Move (M) is defined as performing move (X) followed by move (Y). 3. **Band of Cubies:** Consider the two intersecting bands that are affected by move (M). Cubies only three units away from the cube's edge have the potential to move out of their initial plane. 4. **Behavior of Cubies:** - Some cubies remain fixed. - Other cubies that move only in a single plane will make one complete circle back to their original positions with four 90-degree rotations. - Cubies involved in both layers, however, require more detailed tracking as they move. 5. **Cubies Moving in Two Planes:** Observe the cubie at the top-left intersection of the shaded layers (initial position): - **First Move (M):** (X) moves it to the right face, (Y) moves it from there to the bottom face. - **Second Move (M):** (X) moves it to the left face of the bottom layer, (Y) moves it to the back face. - **Third Move (M):** (X) moves it upwards at the back face, (Y) moves it again within the top layer. - **Fourth Move (M):** Now, ^X^ and ^Y^ moves bring it back around, re-circulating but not yet reaching the starting position. 6. **Total Repeat Cycle for Cubies:** - A single layer cycle repeats every four movements: after four operations of (X), each cubie either is back to the original row/column within the rotating layer. - The same cubie repeated in both rotating layers completes a full reposition after seven total operations: being affected by both (X) and (Y). 7. **Least Common Multiple (LCM):** To ensure all cubies return to their original positions: - The LCM of 4 (single plane rotation) and 7 (dual layer repositioning) is calculated as follows: [ text{LCM}(4, 7) = frac{4 times 7}{gcd(4, 7)} = frac{28}{1} = 28 ] 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the smallest number of repeats of move (M) required for the entire cube to be restored to its original configuration is 28.

So, let's consider n = 17. - We need the sum to be exactly 2050, but the sum for n = 17 is 1785. Thus, we check for the possibility of finding distinct squares to reach 2050. - Additional required sum = 2050 - 1785 = 265. - Searching for a square near 265, we find that 17^2 = 289 is slightly over, and 16^2 = 256 is slightly less. 5. **Resolving with extra squares**: - If we skip using 17^2 and instead use 16^2, the total becomes 1785 - 289 + 256 = 1752. - Now we need 2050 - 1752 = 298. The nearest square is 18^2 = 324, which is too large, and no smaller square would fit the gap. 6. **Conclusion**: - Unfortunately, we can't form exactly 2050 using distinct squares up to n = 17.

Two units of model A cost 5,000 yuan less than three units of model B, which translates to 2x - 3y = -0.5 (in 10,000s of yuan).

We must divide the grid such that each part contains one blue square. - There must exist a division passing through blue squares, partitioning them into smaller parts which each have a good division by our assumption. - By the uniqueness assumption, these partitions must align exactly such that each blue square contributes to a subdivision extending the full length or width of the grid. 5. **Grid Configuration:** - If each row or column partition contains exactly one blue square, intersections are along unique grid lines. - Considering minimal partition along vertical and horizontal lines, if blue squares align (e.g., in a strip), they form single-row or single-column. 6. **Rectangular Alignment:** - Hence, the only configuration with each blue square uniquely positioned within a considerable linear grid line implies a rectangular strip of 1 times 101 or 101 times 1. - Thus, to accommodate 101 blue squares uniquely without violating perpendicular partitions, the grid must at least cover 101 cells on one axis. 7. **Conclusion:** - The smallest n such that the whole grid includes a 1 times 101 rectangle is n = 101. - Therefore, the minimal possible value for n should be 101 to satisfy the conditions presented. boxed{101}"},{"prompt":"Given the sets A={2,4,6,8,10} and B={xmid 3leqslant xleqslant 7}, find the intersection Acap B.","completion":"To find the intersection of sets A and B, we look for the common elements in both sets. 1.

If all elements of ( A_{t+1} ) are the same color, assume they are all red (similar argument holds if all are black). - Choose an element ( y in A_{t+1} ) and change its color to black. - Now, ( A_{t+1} ) contains both red and black elements. 5. **Ensuring No Conflict with Previously Colored Sets:** - If modifying the color of ( y ) causes any set ( A_i ; (1 leq j leq t) ) to become monochromatic, then ( y ) must have been an element of that set and changing ( y )'s color would have made all elements of ( A_i ) black. - Given (left|A_i cap A_{t+1}right| = left{yright}) does not cause conflict as (left|A_i cap A_jright| neq 1). - Therefore, this situation will not occur. # Conclusion: By carefully changing the color of a single element in any set that becomes monochromatic, all sets ( A_1, A_2, dots, A_{t+1} ) can be ensured to have at least one element of each color.

Observe that (7(x + y)) is clearly divisible by (7) since it is a multiple of (7). 7. Thus, if (2x + 3y) is divisible by (7), say (2x + 3y = 7k) for some integer (k), then: [ 5x + 4y = 7(x + y) - (2x + 3y) ] 8. Substitute (2x + 3y = 7k) into the equation: [ 5x + 4y = 7(x + y) - 7k = 7(x + y - k) ] 9. Since (x + y - k) is an integer, (5x + 4y) is also divisible by (7). 10. Conversely, if (5x + 4y) is divisible by (7), say (5x + 4y = 7m) for some integer (m), then: [ 2x + 3y = 7(x + y) - (5x + 4y) ] 11. Substitute (5x + 4y = 7m) into the equation: [ 2x + 3y = 7(x + y) - 7m = 7(x + y - m) ] 12.

We start with the necessary condition. **1. Necessary Condition:** Let ( triangle ABC ) be a triangle, and let ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) be points on the plane of ( triangle ABC ) such that perpendiculars are drawn from ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) to ( BC, CA, AB ) respectively, and these perpendiculars intersect at a common point ( M ). The perpendicular from ( A_1 ) to ( BC ) intersects ( BC ) at ( H_1 ), the perpendicular from ( B_1 ) to ( CA ) intersects ( CA ) at ( H_2 ), and the perpendicular from ( C_1 ) to ( AB ) intersects ( AB ) at ( H_3 ). Since these perpendiculars are concurrent at ( M ), we have: [ A_1B^2 - A_1C^2 = BH_1^2 - CH_1^2 = BM^2 - CM^2 ] Similarly, [ B_1C^2 - B_1A^2 = CH_2^2 - AH_2^2 = CM^2 - AM^2 ] And, [ C_1A^2 - C_1B^2 = AH_3^2 - BH_3^2 = AM^2 - BM^2 ] Adding these equations, we get: [ (A_1B^2 - A_1C^2) + (B_1C^2 - B_1A^2) + (C_1A^2 - C_1B^2) = (BM^2 - CM^2) + (CM^2 - AM^2) + (AM^2 - BM^2) ] The right-hand side simplifies to 0 because: [ (BM^2 - CM^2) + (CM^2 - AM^2) + (AM^2 - BM^2) = BM^2 - BM^2 = 0 ] Thus, [ A_1B^2 - A_1C^2 + B_1C^2 - B_1A^2 + C_1A^2 - C_1B^2 = 0 ] **2. Sufficient Condition:** Now, let's show the sufficiency by assuming the given equation is true: [ A_1B^2 - A_1C^2 + B_1C^2 - B_1A^2 + C_1A^2 - C_1B^2 = 0 ] We need to show that the perpendiculars from ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) to ( BC, CA, AB ) respectively are concurrent. Assume points ( A_1, B_1 ) draw perpendiculars intersecting at point ( M ). Since: [ MB^2 - MC^2 = A_1B^2 - A_1C^2, quad MC^2 - MA^2 = B_1C^2 - B_1A^2 ] Adding: [ MB^2 - MA^2 = A_1B^2 - A_1C^2 + B_1C^2 - B_1A^2 ] From our assumption, we insert: [ A_1B^2 - A_1C^2 + B_1C^2 - B_1A^2 = C_1A^2 - C_1B^2 ] Thus: [ MB^2 - MA^2 = C_1A^2 - C_1B^2 = MA^2 - MB^2 ] So, point (M) lies on the perpendicular from ( C_1 ) to ( AB ). Therefore, ( M ) is the common point of intersection of all three perpendiculars. In conclusion, the condition ( A_1B^2 - A_1C^2 + B_1C^2 - B_1A^2 + C_1A^2 - C_1B^2 = 0 ) is both necessary and sufficient.

If a circle with F as its center and FM as its radius intersects the directrix of C, then the range of values for x_0 is ______.","completion":"The given parabola C has the equation y^2 = 8x. The standard form of a parabolic equation is y^2 = 4ax where the focus of the parabola is located at point (a,0). By comparing, we find that a = 2 for our parabola, so the focus F of C is at (2,0). Now, let's consider the distance FM where M is any point (x_0, y_0) on the parabola. By the definition of the parabola, the point M is equidistant from the focus F and the directrix, which has the equation x = -a = -2. For the circle centered at F with radius FM to intersect the directrix, the radius of this circle must be greater than the distance from the focus F to the directrix. This means that |FM| > |FQ|, where Q is a point on the directrix directly opposite to F, thus |FQ| = 2a = 4. By the Distance Formula, |FM| = sqrt{(x_0 - 2)^2 + y_0^2}. Since M lies on the parabola, y_0^2 = 8x_0. Substituting this into the expression for |FM| gives |FM| = sqrt{(x_0 - 2)^2 + 8x_0}. We require |FM| > 4, so we set up the following inequality: sqrt{(x_0 - 2)^2 + 8x_0} > 4. Squaring both sides, we get (x_0 - 2)^2 + 8x_0 > 16. Expanding, simplifying, and rearranging terms: x_0^2 - 4x_0 + 4 + 8x_0 > 16, x_0^2 + 4x_0 - 12 > 0. Solving this quadratic inequality, we find that the solutions to x_0^2 + 4x_0 - 12 = 0 are x_0 = -6 or x_0 = 2. These are not the actual solutions to our inequality but rather the values where the parabola formed by the quadratic function intersects the x-axis.

If ( AC neq BD ), it follows that [ frac{AP}{BP} = frac{AC}{BD}. ] This means that ( P ) lies on the Apollonian circle of points such that the ratio of their distances ( P ) to points ( A ) and ( B ) is constant, specifically ( frac{AC}{BD} ).

We denote this circle by ( k_2 ). By the properties of Apollonian circles, ( P ) is one of the intersection points of ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ). There are generally two such intersection points for these circles, except in special cases where the circles tangent each other or do not intersect. 3.

We can simplify the problem by considering the weights of the pieces as a sequence of positive reals ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n} ) arranged in a circle. We can subtract the minimum weight from each piece, making the smallest piece weight zero. Thus, we have ( a_1 = 0 ) and ( a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{2n} ) are positive reals. 2. **Case Analysis for Different ( n )**: - **Odd ( n )**: - For ( n ) odd, Olesya can ensure her win by strategically placing a very large piece ( a_3 ) such that it is greater than half the total weight. Let ( a_3 = 10^N ) for a large ( N ), and the other pieces be negligible in comparison. - If Andriy takes any piece other than ( a_3 ), Olesya can take ( a_3 ) in her next move and win. - If Andriy takes pieces from the right end, Olesya will follow by taking the next two rightmost pieces, ensuring she eventually takes ( a_3 ). - This strategy works because the parity of ( n ) ensures that Olesya will have the opportunity to take ( a_3 ) before Andriy can. - **( n = 2 )**: - For ( n = 2 ), the game involves 4 pieces. Andriy can always take the two largest pieces in his first move, leaving Olesya with the smaller pieces.

A detailed case analysis shows that Andriy can always force Olesya into a losing position by taking pairs that prevent her from accumulating more than half the total weight. - Regardless of Olesya's initial move, Andriy can always respond in a way that leaves Olesya with less than half the total weight.

Once I asked why and he told me that watering plants spoiled them because it made them grow weaker. He said you had to make things tough for the trees so that only the strongest could survive.

This can be written as: [ a_n = underbrace{111ldots1}_{2n text{ digits}} ] This number can be expressed as: [ a_n = frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} ] This is because the number consisting of (2n) ones is the sum of a geometric series: [ 1 + 10 + 10^2 + ldots + 10^{2n-1} = frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} ] 2. **Divisibility by 11:** We need to check the divisibility of (a_n) by 11. Using the expression for (a_n): [ a_n = frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9} ] We need to check if (10^{2n} - 1) is divisible by 11. Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that: [ 10^{10} equiv 1 pmod{11} ] Since (2n) is even, we can write: [ 10^{2n} equiv 1 pmod{11} ] Therefore: [ 10^{2n} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{11} ] This implies that (10^{2n} - 1) is divisible by 11, and hence (a_n) is divisible by 11. 3. **Quotients (q_i):** Since (a_n) is divisible by 11, the quotient (q_i) when (a_i) is divided by 11 is: [ q_i = frac{a_i}{11} ] Given that (a_i) is divisible by 11, (q_i) is an integer. 4. **Sum of nine consecutive quotients:** We need to prove that the sum of nine consecutive quotients (s_i = q_i + q_{i+1} + q_{i+2} + ldots + q_{i+8}) is a multiple of 9 for any (i = 1, 2, 3, ldots, (n-8)). Since each (a_i) is divisible by 11, each (q_i) is an integer. We need to show that the sum of any nine consecutive (q_i) is a multiple of 9. Given that (a_i = frac{10^{2i} - 1}{9}), we have: [ q_i = frac{a_i}{11} = frac{10^{2i} - 1}{99} ] Since (10^{2i} equiv 1 pmod{11}), we have: [ q_i = frac{1 - 1}{99} = 0 ] Therefore, each (q_i = 0).

This implies that f(x + 2) = f(x) for every x in mathbb{R}, which indicates that f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 2. 1. To determine whether f(x) is an odd function, we need to check if f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. Since f(x) is periodic and when x in [-1, 1), f(x) = x, we know that f(1) = f(-1 + 2) = f(-1) = -1. However, since f(1) = 1, so f(-1) neq -f(1). Thus, f(x) is not an odd function. Statement ① is incorrect. 2. As previously shown, f(x) is a periodic function with period 2. Statement ② is correct. 3. Since when x in [-1, 1), we have f(x) = x, it follows that f(0) = 0. Due to the periodicity of f(x) with period 2, the zeros of f(x) occur at x = 2k, for k in mathbb{Z}. Statement ③ is correct. 4. For the interval x in [-1, 1), setting f(x) = g(x) yields the equations x = frac{1}{x}. Solving gives us x = -1 or x = 1, but since x = 1 is not in the interval [-1, 1), we discard it.

Step 1: Analyzing the system and determining the coordinate system 1. Two weightless cylindrical rollers lie parallel to each other on a horizontal surface. The radii of the cylinders are ( R = 1 , text{m} ) and ( r = 50 , text{cm} = 0.5 , text{m} ). 2. A flat heavy slab with mass ( m = 75 , text{kg} ) rests on top of the cylinders and is inclined at an angle ( alpha = arccos(0.82) ) to the horizontal. Step 2: Determining the inclination angle ( alpha ) [ alpha = arccos(0.82) ] Step 3: Calculating the direction of the slab's motion 1. In a coordinate system where the center of the left cylinder is stationary, all points on the circumference of the cylinders move with the same speed ( v ). The surface of the slab approaches the cylinders at an angle ( alpha ) above the horizontal, and to the right. 2. Therefore, the slab’s instantaneous velocity at the point of contact with the cylinders is ( v ) directed at an angle ( alpha ) to the right. Step 4: Transformation to the earth’s fixed frame 1. In the absolute coordinate system (attached to the earth), to all speeds we must add a horizontal speed ( v ). - The resultant motion of the slab will be composed of a translational component in the direction of ( v ) combined with the angle of inclination.

This is achieved by taking the minimum of the two weighted scores, which encourages students to allocate some amount of time to both subjects since neglecting either will lower their overall grade. - **Importance of Both Subjects:** If a student spends all their time on one subject, they will get a low score on the other, resulting in a lower final grade due to the minimum criterion. - For instance, if Ivanov allocated all 4.6 time units to either subject, the resulting calculation from the other subject would significantly lower the weighted minimum score. - **Not Always Perfect Representation:** While the minimum criterion ensures a balanced understanding, it might not always perfectly encapsulate the teacher's view if the weightings or effort per time unit required for subjects were different. If the difficulty levels or learning efficiencies varied significantly, a student might still focus more on one subject to maximize scores based on the individual effort-to-score return. In conclusion, the optimal balance in this case results in a final score of 4, which fulfills the criteria set by the teacher and reflects Ivanov's understanding of both microeconomics and macroeconomics.

If the seating order is (A, C, E, B, D), each person's neighbors will be new, and hence the problem condition is satisfied. 7. **Illustration**: - The cyclical arrangement (A, C, E, B, D) ensures new neighbors, maintaining acquaintance conditions with exactly 237 others per individual. 8. **Conclusion**: Following the conditions of the problem, we verified that the number of pairs of acquaintances can be exactly given by: [ frac{240 times 237}{2} = 28440 ] Therefore, the minimum number of pairs of acquaintances in the village of Sosnovka is: [ boxed{28440} ]"},{"prompt":"w many moles of Ammonium nitrate are required to react with 2 moles of Sodium hydroxide to form some moles of Sodium nitrate, 2 moles of Ammonia, and 2 moles of Water?

Assume there exists a polynomial P(x) of degree at least 1 and a function T from the set of integers to the set of integers such that the number of integers x with T^{n}(x) = x equals P(n) for every n geq 1. 2. Let A(n) denote the set of all integers x in mathbb{Z} such that T^{n}(x) = x. Thus, |A(n)| = P(n). Let B(n) denote the set of all integers x in mathbb{Z} for which T^{n}(x) = x and T^{k}(x) neq x for all 1 leq k < n. Both sets are finite under the given assumptions. - A(n) refers to all x that return to their original value after n applications of T. - B(n) consists of those x which first return to their original values after exactly n applications. 3. For each x in A(n), there is a smallest positive integer k such that T^k(x) = x. Therefore, x in B(k). Let d = gcd(k, n). By the properties of the greatest common divisor, there are integers r and s such that: [ r k - s n = d. ] Thus, we have the relation: [ T^{r k}(x) = T^{s n + d}(x). ] Since T^n(x) = x, we further get: [ T^{s n + d}(x) = T^d left(T^{s n}(x)right) = T^d(x). ] From the minimality of k, we infer that d = k, implying k mid n. 4. From the previous results, it follows that: [ A(n) = bigcup_{d mid n} B(d) ] as a disjoint union. Consequently, we derive: [ |A(n)| = sum_{d mid n} |B(d)|. ] 5. Analyzing B(n), observe that for each x in B(n), the set { x, T^1(x), T^2(x), ldots, T^{n-1}(x) } contains n distinct elements. If T^i(x) = T^j(x) for some 0 leq i < j leq n-1, it would imply: [ x = T^{n - i} left(T^i(x)right) = T^{n - i}(T^j(x)) = T^{j - i}(T^n(x)) = T^{j-i}(x), ] contradicting the minimality of n. Therefore, T permutes the elements of B(n) in disjoint cycles of length n, indicating: [ n mid |B(n)|. ] 6. Now assume the polynomial P(x) is given by: [ P(x) = sum_{i=0}^{k} a_i x^i, ] where a_i in mathbb{Z}, k geq 1 and a_k neq 0. Suppose that |A(n)| = P(n) for all n geq 1. Let p be any prime number. Then, we have: [ p^2 mid |B(p^2)| = |A(p^2)| - |A(p)| = a_1(p^2 - p) + a_2(p^4 - p^2) + cdots. ] Hence, p mid a_1. Since this holds for all primes p, it follows that a_1 = 0. 7. Consider any two distinct primes p and q. Since a_1 = 0, we have: [ |A(p^2 q)| - |A(p q)| = a_2(p^4 q^2 - p^2 q^2) + a_3(p^6 q^3 - p^3 q^3) + cdots ] which is a multiple of p^2 q. Additionally, we have: [ p^2 q mid |B(p^2 q)| = |A(p^2 q)| - |A(p q)| - |B(p^2)|. ] This leads to: [ p^2 q mid |B(p^2)| = |A(p^2)| - |A(p)| = a_2(p^4 - p^2) + a_3(p^6 - p^3) + cdots. ] Since this must hold for every prime q, it implies that: [ a_2(p^4 - p^2) + a_3(p^6 - p^3) + cdots + a_k(p^{2k} - p^k) = 0 ] for every prime p. Since this expression is a polynomial in p of degree 2k, and a non-zero polynomial of degree 2k can have at most 2k roots, this leads to a contradiction. Conclusion.

The percentages of the votes for the first three candidates add up to: 45% + 25% + 15% = 85% The fourth candidate and the null votes are not given in percentages, so we will add them separately. Since the fourth candidate got 180 votes and there were 50 null votes, we can say: 180 (fourth candidate's votes) + 50 (null votes) = 230 votes Now, the remaining 15% of the votes must be equal to these 230 votes because the percentages must add up to 100% for all the votes.

Then: [ phi(10^{10}) = phi(2^{10} times 5^{10})= 10^{10}(1 - frac{1}{2})(1 - frac{1}{5}) = 10^{10} times frac{1}{2} times frac{4}{5} = 4 times 10^{9} ] 5. **Periodicity derivation:** By Euler's theorem: [ 2^{phi(10^{10})} equiv 1 pmod{10^{10}} ] Therefore: [ 2^{4 times 10^{9}} equiv 1 pmod{10^{10}} ] Because this result implies that any power of 2 raised to multiples of (4 times 10^{9}) would bring the congruence down to modulo (10^{10}). 6. **General form analysis:** Given a general term in the sequence (2^n), the number (2^{n + 4times10^9} equiv 2^n pmod{10^{10}}) leads to the conclusion that: [ 2^n quad text{and} quad 2^{n + 4times10^9} quad text{share the same last 10 digits.} ] 7. **Initial condition:** To determine the starting point for this periodic behavior, note that if we start examining from (2^{10}): [ 2^{10} = 1024 ] This calculation along with (2^{7812500+n}) will ensure that the same 10 digits observed from (n = 10) continues perpetually every (4 times 10^{9}) iterations. # Conclusion: The last 10 digits of the numbers in the sequence (2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{3}, ldots, 2^{n}, ldots) repeat periodically every (4 times 10^{9}) numbers, starting from the (10^{text{th}}) number in the sequence, which is (2^{10}).

Since the function has both a maximum and a minimum value, the equation (f′(x)=0) must have two distinct real roots. This means (3x^{2}+2ax+(a+6)=0) has two distinct real roots.

Knowing that the function has both a maximum and a minimum value implies that the equation obtained by setting the derivative to (0) has two distinct real roots.

Transforming the condition that the function has both a maximum and a minimum value into the condition that the equation (f′(x)=0) has two distinct real roots is key to solving the problem."},{"prompt":"dicate the similarities and differences between the concepts: parallel lines and skew lines; parallel lines and intersecting lines.","completion":"To analyze the given problems, we classify and compare the geometric properties of parallel and skew lines, as well as parallel and intersecting lines.

Given that the ratio of the length to the width is 2:1, we can express the area of the rectangular piece in terms of x as follows: 1. The area of the rectangular piece is given by the product of its length and width, which can be expressed as 2x cdot x = 30m^{2}. 2. Simplifying this equation gives 2x^{2} = 30. 3. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x^{2} = 15. 4. Taking the square root of both sides to solve for x, we find x = sqrt{15}.

Step 2: Prime Factorization Each ( k_i ) is divisible by a prime number ( p_i ) that does not divide any of the others. Thus, ( k_0 cdots k_n ) possesses at least ( n+1 ) distinct prime factors. Step 3: Polynomial Form We need to show that ( forall n in mathbb{N}^* ), there exists ( a in mathbb{N}^* ) such that ( a(a+1) + 1 ) has at least ( n ) distinct prime factors. We will use the polynomial ( P(x) = x(x+1) + 1 = x^2 + x + 1 ) for this purpose.

We have: [ P(x) equiv 0 pmod{p_i} Rightarrow x^2 + x + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p_i} Rightarrow x^2 - (p_i - 1)x + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p_i} ] Rewriting this: [ left(x - frac{p_i - 1}{2}right)^2 equiv -1 + left(frac{p_i - 1}{2}right)^2 pmod{p_i} ] which simplifies to: [ -1 + left(frac{p_i - 1}{2}right)^2 equiv frac{-4 + p_i^2 - 2p_i + 1}{4} equiv left(2^{-1}right)^2 cdot (-3) pmod{p_i} ] Step 5: Quadratic Reciprocity To have a solution for the congruence, ( -3 ) must be a quadratic residue modulo ( p_i ), and we need to show that this is possible for an infinite number of primes ( p_i ), using quadratic reciprocity. Step 6: Chinese Remainder Theorem Assuming we have chosen ( p_1, ldots, p_n ) appropriately, let ( x_1, ldots, x_n ) be solutions such that ( p_i mid P(x_i) ). Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists an ( x ) such that: [ x equiv x_i pmod{p_i} quad forall 1 leq i leq n ] Thus, ( P(x) equiv 0 pmod{p_i} ) for all ( 1 leq i leq n ), ensuring ( P(x) = x(x+1) + 1 ) is divisible by ( p_1 cdots p_n ).

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for (a, b, c ): [ (a+b+c)^2 leq (3)(a^2+b^2+c^2) = 3 cdot 9 = 27 quad Rightarrow quad a+b+c leq sqrt{27} = 3sqrt{3}. ] However, for simplification, we note that: If (a = b = c): Substituting in the constraint: [ 3a^2 = 9 quad Rightarrow quad a^2 = 3 quad Rightarrow quad a = sqrt{3} text{ or } a = -sqrt{3}, ] In both cases, we get: [ begin{aligned} (ab + bc + ca) = ( sqrt{3} cdot sqrt{3} + sqrt{3} cdot sqrt{3} + sqrt{3} cdot sqrt{3}) = 3 cdot 3 = 9. end{aligned} ] Therefore, [ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 2 cdot 9 = 18. ] Thus, [ 18 - 2(ab+bc+ca) = 18 - 18 = 0. ] If one root is positive, then the minimum value of (ab+bc+ca) can be weakly assumed when permutations are 1, 1, and rest negative product. Thus conversely maximum difference is as written (27-0). Given the derived result, the **maximum value of** ((a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2) is obtained maximally thus not wrongly padded by double to arrive at an answer proportional appropriately hence: Thus maximum derivation packaged agrees via inequality: and .

If his total expenditure in the 2 years combined is double his expenditure in the 1st year (adjusted for inflation), what percentage of his income in the first year did he save, considering the varying annual income percentages and the inflation and tax effects on his expenditure?","completion":"Let's denote the man's income in the first year as I and the portion he saves as S. Therefore, the portion he spends (expenditure) in the first year is I - S. In the second year, his income increases by a fluctuating percentage between 40% to 60%. Let's take the average increase of 50% for calculation purposes. So, his income in the second year is I + 0.5I = 1.5I. His savings in the second year increase by a range of 90% to 110%. Again, let's take the average increase of 100% for calculation purposes. So, his savings in the second year are 2S. The total expenditure in the second year is the income in the second year minus the savings in the second year, adjusted for tax and inflation. Before adjusting for tax and inflation, the expenditure in the second year is 1.5I - 2S. Now, let's account for the tax deduction of 15% on his income each year. The after-tax income in the first year is I - 0.15I = 0.85I, and in the second year, it is 1.5I - 0.15(1.5I) = 1.275I. The inflation rate of 3% affects the expenditure. The expenditure in the first year adjusted for inflation in the second year would be (I - S) * 1.03. According to the problem, the total expenditure in the 2 years combined is double his expenditure in the 1st year (adjusted for inflation). So we have: Expenditure in the first year (adjusted for inflation) + Expenditure in the second year (after tax) = 2 * Expenditure in the first year (adjusted for inflation) (I - S) * 1.03 + (1.275I - 2S) = 2 * (I - S) * 1.03 Expanding and simplifying: 1.03I - 1.03S + 1.275I - 2S = 2.06I - 2.06S Combining like terms: 2.305I - 3.03S = 2.06I - 2.06S Now, let's solve for S: 0.245I - S = 0.06I S = 0.245I - 0.06I S = 0.185I To find the percentage of his income in the first year that he saved, we divide the savings by the initial income and multiply by 100: (S / I) * 100 = (0.185I / I) * 100 = 18.5% Therefore, the man saved boxed{18.5%} of his income in the first year."},{"prompt":"a right prism with triangular bases, given that the sum of the areas of three mutually adjacent faces (two lateral faces and one base) is 30, find the maximum volume of the prism.","completion":"Let's denote the sides of the base triangle as (a) and (b), the included angle as (theta), and the altitude of the prism as (h).

Given the sum of these areas is 30, we have: [ ah + bh + frac{1}{2} ab sin theta = 30. ] The volume (V) of the prism is: [ V = frac{1}{2} abh sin theta. ] Using the variables (X = ah), (Y = bh), and (Z = frac{1}{2} ab sin theta), the equation becomes (X + Y + Z = 30).

Using Rule 1, the new coordinate F' of the jumping frog will satisfy F'P = 2FP. This implies the change in coordinates for the jumping frog will be: - F' = 3F - 2P. 3. **Multiple of Three Argument**: If the frogs have coordinates (x, y) initially, then after a jump using Rule 1, each coordinate moves by a multiple of three: - For a frog with coordinates differing by (x, y), the coordinates after the jump will be (3x, 3y). - However, for a frog to land at the center (0,0), both coordinates must be divisible by 3. 4. **Initial Conditions**: At the start, none of the frogs have coordinates divisible by 3 because their coordinates are (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (-1,0), (0,-1), and (-1,-1). None of these coordinates have both x and y divisible by 3. 5. **Conclusion for Rule 1**: Since the coordinates after each jump continue to be multiples of 3, and no frog starts with coordinates both divisible by 3, it is impossible for any frog to land at the center of the hexagon using Rule 1 alone. blacksquare (b) If both Rule 1 and Rule 2 are allowed, is it possible for some frog to land at the center of the original hexagon after a finite amount of time? 1. **Revisiting Coordinates with Rule 2**: With Rule 2, if a frog at point F jumps over a frog at point P, it will land at F' such that F'P = frac{FP}{2}. This implies when frogs are separated by (x,y), the coordinates for jumping frog will be: - F' = frac{3F + P}{2}. 2. **Coordinate Adjustments**: Let's focus on the effect on coordinates. Consider the jump in the first coordinate, we have: - F = (p/q), and - F' = frac{p}{q} + frac{3x/2}, - After a jump, it is transformed to: F' = frac{2p + 3qx}{2q}. 3. **Numerator and Denominator Check**: Notice that if p is not divisible by 3 before the jump, after the jump, the numerator becomes 2p + 3qx. If 3 does not divide 2p, it cannot result in both 2p and 3qx divisible by 3. 4. **Fraction Simplification Using Rule 2**: To simplify, let us double all coordinates before jumping (ensuring coordinates stay as integers): - Applying this, any jump becomes an equivalent form under multiples of three. - Thus, similar to conclusion from step (a), coordinates retain their initial non-divisible-by-3 nature. 5. **Conclusion Applying Both Rules**: The use of Rule 2 and adjustments do not change the fundamental characteristic that coordinates are not both divisible by 3 from the initial state. Therefore, even with both rules, frogs cannot reach the center of the original hexagon. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A departmental store has 9 managers and some associates.

Let ( x ) be the number of people playing the double bass, excluding Igor, and let ( y ) be the number of people playing the violin, also excluding Igor. 2.

After Igor switched to playing the violin, the number of double bass players is ( x ) and their new average age is 46 years. Thus, the total age of these ( x ) double bass players is: [ x times 46 ] 4. The age of Igor can be determined from these equations since the decrease in total age due to Igor switching is given by the difference in total ages: [ (x + 1) times 45 - x times 46 ] Simplifying this expression, we get: [ 45x + 45 - 46x = 45 - x ] Therefore, Igor's age is: [ 45 - x ] 5. Similarly, consider the number of violin players. The original average age of violin players was 22 years, so the total age of these ( y ) violin players is: [ y times 22 ] After adding Igor, the number of violin players becomes ( y + 1 ) and the new average age increases to 23 years. Thus, the new total age of these ( y + 1 ) violin players now becomes: [ (y + 1) times 23 ] 6.

A pair of people sitting directly across from each other has a distance of 2. - Since n=4, one of the key distances (between the directly opposite pair) will be 2 units. - Given the circular nature of seating, if one person (A) is fixed, the others, say (B, C, D), will either be adjacent or directly opposite. - Therefore, a person might have to be directly opposite (A) at both lunch and dinner, making it impossible to achieve different distances for all pairs. Hence, for (n = 4), it is **impossible** to meet the new seating arrangement condition. 2. **Case when n = 5:** - At a round table with 5 seats, distances can be 1, 2, and 3 units. - Each person at lunch can attempt to be seated such that different distances are maintained in the evening: - Fixing (A) at one spot, consider placing (B) opposite to (A), so the evening distance differs from k. Then (C, D, E) need to be arranged such that they maintain different distances. - For instance, (B) and (E) must sit around (A) differently than how they we alternately arranged for (B). As (A) remains fixed, we can ensure all pairs have different evening distances without 2's recursion condition. Let's explicitly follow an example: - **Initial Lunch Arrangement:** A, B, C, D, E - **Evening Arrangement:** A remains fixed, (B) is moved to the opposite and the other participants switch positions accordingly: (B) opposite to (A), and the remaining as adjusted previously. For (n = 5), indeed a valid re-positioning ensuring all distances vary can be achieved. 3. **Case when n = 6:** - Integral distances possible here for pairing (1, 2, 3). Consider fixing (A) and aligning others (B, C,...). - Asserting no consecutive pairs should sit the same distance as before, try fixing iteratively: 1. (A) fixed as first position. 2. (B, F) at second and last. 3. (C) can’t position following same adjacency The evaluations required to displace relationships maintaining distances varied are challenged by aligned positions creating mirrored symmetry whose validity gets restricted, thereby ensuring noting arrangements meet : Hence, for (n=6) is similarly contradictory by proving unable toward meeting differential alignment. 4. **Case when n = 7**: - Choices amplify between 1, 2, 3, 4 variances permutation.

This is because, for an equilateral triangle with side length (a), the perimeter is (3a = 1), implying (a = frac{1}{3}).

Each face thus comprises 5 edges, and the challenge is to label these edges with 1s and 0s such that the sum of the labels per face equals 2. Step 2: Calculating Valid Labelings Per Face Labeling the edges such that each face has a sum of 2 means we choose 2 out of 5 edges to be labeled as 1 (the rest as 0). The number of ways to do this for one pentagon is: text{Number of ways} = binom{5}{2} = 10 Step 3: Extending to the Entire Dodecahedron Each edge in the dodecahedron belongs to exactly two faces. Thus, labeling of one face influences the adjacent face: - Any edge labeled 1 for one face must be considered in the context of ensuring that the adjacent face also has exactly two labeled edges as 1. Step 4: Visualizing and Analyzing Connections We apply the same reasoning for all neighboring faces ensuring consistency. Given that every two adjacent faces share exactly one edge, and edges do not overlap between non-adjacent faces, a systematic propagation of the labeling can be carried out without conflicting the requirements for any pair of faces. Step 5: Counting All Possible Configurations Multiplying the number of valid label sets per face might not directly yield the solution due to overlapping constraints among different faces. However, if we count the ways considering that each face is independently labeling without violating the set condition, there are: text{Total ways} = 10^{12} text{ (as initial rough upper bound)} However, this count must be adjusted down by considering symmetry and over-counting due to shared edges and face-connectivity, necessitating a more detail-oriented combinatorial or computational check beyond simple hand calculations for precision. Conclusion This initial rough calculation gives an upper bound, and precise calculation might involve advanced combinatorial methods or computational approaches. The approach, however, does ensure that each face has exactly two edges labeled as 1, theoretically conforming to the requirement.

This means that the cross-ratio ( (B, C; A_1, P) ) is -1. - This implies that ( PA_1 ) is divided harmonically by ( B ) and ( C ). 5. **Midpoint and Harmonic Conjugates:** - Since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( PA_1 ), it lies on the harmonic conjugate of ( A_1 ) with respect to ( B ) and ( C ). 6. **Equal Tangents:** - The tangents from ( M ) to the incircle are equal in length because ( M ) is equidistant from the points of tangency. - Similarly, the tangents from ( M ) to the circumcircle are equal in length because ( M ) is equidistant from the points where the tangents touch the circumcircle. 7. **Conclusion:** - Since ( M ) lies on the harmonic conjugate and is equidistant from the points of tangency, the lengths of the tangents from ( M ) to both the incircle and circumcircle are equal.
