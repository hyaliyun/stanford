But in the outlined area, we claim that we still need to fit the remaining unoccupied area, which amounts to 13 cells after placing the specified monominoes. However, since each domino covers exactly two cells, the maximum number of dominoes that could fit into 13 cells is: [ leftlfloor frac{13}{2} rightrfloor = 6 text{ dominoes} ] This is because 6 dominoes would cover 12 cells, leaving an extra cell uncovered. 5. **Concluding Infeasibility:** This makes it impossible to cover the remaining part perfectly using 1 times 2 dominoes, as we are left with 1 cell out of the 13 not covered: [ 13 - 12 = 1 text{ cell uncovered} ] # Conclusion: It is not possible to place a finite number of 1 times 1 monominoes on an infinite grid in such a manner that no two monominoes share an edge or vertex, and then cover the remaining parts without leaving any gaps using 1 times 2 dominoes.

Let angle ADC = theta. According to the Law of Sines in triangle ACD: [ frac{AC}{CD} = frac{sin theta}{sin (theta + 13^circ)} ] This is based on the property that the ratio of the sides of a triangle is equal to the ratio of the sines of their opposite angles. 2. Applying the Law of Sines in triangle ABC: [ frac{AC}{BC} = frac{sin 77^circ}{sin 30^circ} ] where 77^circ is derived from 180^circ - 30^circ - 73^circ because angle BCA = 73^circ and angle BAC = 30^circ. 3. Also, applying the Law of Sines in triangle BCD: [ frac{BC}{CD} = frac{sin 43^circ}{sin 51^circ} ] where 43^circ is derived from 180^circ - 51^circ - 86^circ because angle BDC = 86^circ and angle ABD = 26^circ. 4.

Simplifying the right-hand side: [ frac{2 sin 77^circ sin 43^circ}{sin 51^circ} = frac{2 cos 13^circ cos 47^circ cos 73^circ}{sin 51^circ cos 73^circ} = frac{cos 39^circ}{2 sin 51^circ cos 73^circ} = frac{1}{2 cos 73^circ} ] 7. Thus, we have: [ frac{sin theta}{sin (theta + 13^circ)} = frac{1}{2 cos 73^circ} ] 8. Simplifying, we get: [ cos 13^circ + cot theta sin 13^circ = 2 cos 73^circ ] 9. Solving for cot theta: [ cot theta = frac{2 cos 73^circ - cos 13^circ}{sin 13^circ} = frac{2 cos (60^circ + 13^circ) - cos 13^circ}{sin 13^circ} ] Simplifying further: [ cot theta = frac{-2 sin 60^circ sin 13^circ}{sin 13^circ} = -sqrt{3} ] Thus, theta = 150^circ. 10.

Second Solution: Using Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality 1. **Applying Cauchy-Schwarz to Fourth Roots and Squares:** For the sequences (u_i = sqrt[4]{a}, sqrt[4]{b}, sqrt[4]{c}, sqrt[4]{d}) and (v_i = sqrt[4]{a + 3b}, sqrt[4]{b + 3c}, sqrt[4]{c + 3d}, sqrt[4]{d + 3a}): [ left(sqrt[4]{a(a + 3b)} + sqrt[4]{b(b + 3c)} + sqrt[4]{c(c + 3d)} + sqrt[4]{d(d + 3a)} right)^2 leq (sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} + sqrt{c} + sqrt{d})(sqrt{a + 3b} + sqrt{b + 3c} + sqrt{c + 3d} + sqrt{d + 3a}) ] 2. **Bounding the Sum of Roots and Cross Terms:** [ (sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} + sqrt{c} + sqrt{d})^2 leq (a + b + c + d)(1 + 1 + 1 + 1) leq 4^2 ] Hence, [ sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} + sqrt{c} + sqrt{d} leq 4 ] 3. **Bounding the Sum of Cross Terms' Roots:** [ begin{aligned} & (sqrt{a + 3b} + sqrt{b + 3c} + sqrt{c + 3d} + sqrt{d + 3a})^2 leq & leq (a + 3b + b + 3c + c + 3d + d + 3a)(1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 16(a + b + c + d) leq 64 end{aligned} ] Therefore, [ sqrt{a + 3b} + sqrt{b + 3c} + sqrt{c + 3d} + sqrt{d + 3a} leq 8 ] 4. **Combining the Results:** By combining the results, [ sqrt[4]{a^2 + 3ab} + sqrt[4]{b^2 + 3bc} + sqrt[4]{c^2 + 3cd} + sqrt[4]{d^2 + 3da} leq sqrt{4 cdot 8} = 4sqrt{2} ] The equality holds when (a = b = c = d = 1).

Therefore, the area of just the frame is: [5(x + 2) - 3x = 5x + 10 - 3x = 2x + 10] Given that the area of the frame is 18 square inches, we can set up the equation: [2x + 10 = 18] Solving for x, we find: begin{align*} 2x + 10 &= 18 2x &= 18 - 10 2x &= 8 x &= frac{8}{2} x &= 4 text{ inches} end{align*} Thus, the lengths of the left and right interior edges are 4 inches each. The sum of the lengths of the four interior edges is then: [3 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 14 text{ inches}] Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the four interior edges of the frame is boxed{14} inches."},{"prompt":"w many unordered pairs of prime numbers have a sum of 40?","completion":"To find the number of unordered pairs of prime numbers that sum up to 40, we proceed as follows: 1.

For each prime number identified, calculate 40 - text{prime number} to see if the result is also a prime number. This is because if both numbers in the pair are prime and their sum is 40, then subtracting one prime from 40 must yield the other prime. 3.

We want to show that ( PI perp BC ). **Step-by-Step Solution:** 1. **Identify the Circumcircle Property:** Recall that ( O_B ), ( O_C ), ( B ), and ( C ) are concyclic. This fact is due to the properties of excenters, meaning that points ( O_B ) and ( O_C ) lie on the circumcircle of ( triangle BIC ), where ( I ) is also the incenter of ( triangle ABC ). 2. **Construct the Necessary Angles:** Consider ( triangle O_B O_C I ) where ( P ) is the circumcenter: According to the problem hint, we consider the angles ( angle PIO_C ) and ( angle ICB ). 3. **Calculate the Critical Angles:** - By the circumcenter property, we have: [ angle PIO_C = 90^circ - angle O_C O_B I ] - Next, we need ( angle O_C O_B I ): Since ( I ) is the incenter, the angle subtended by ( I ) on one side is: [ angle O_C O_B I = frac{1}{2} angle ACB ] 4. **Combine the Angle Calculations:** Substituting back into the previous equation: [ angle PIO_C = 90^circ - frac{1}{2} angle ACB ] Now consider ( angle ICB ): [ angle ICB = frac{1}{2} angle ACB ] 5. **Summing Up Angles:** Adding the angles (angle PIO_C + angle ICB ): [ angle PIO_C + angle ICB = left(90^circ - frac{1}{2} angle ACB right) + frac{1}{2} angle ACB ] 6. **Final Result:** After simplifying: [ angle PIO_C + angle ICB = 90^circ ] Since the resultant angle sum equals ( 90^circ ), this confirms that ( P I perp BC ).

Similarly, we can find overrightarrow{AC}=overrightarrow{OC}-overrightarrow{OA}=(2-m, 1-m). Since points A, B, and C are collinear, the vectors overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{AC} are parallel and we can write overrightarrow{AB}=koverrightarrow{AC} for some scalar k. Considering the components, we have: begin{cases} 3=k(2-m) 1=k(1-m) end{cases} By solving this system of equations, we take the second equation 1=k(1-m) to express k as k=frac{1}{1-m} (assuming m neq 1).

Using the boxed notation, we write boxed{m=frac{1}{2}}. (2) Now we also know that overrightarrow{BA}=-overrightarrow{AB}=(-3,-1) and overrightarrow{BC}=overrightarrow{OC}-overrightarrow{OB}=(-1-m,-m). Since angle ABC is an acute angle, the dot product overrightarrow{BA} cdot overrightarrow{BC} must be positive. Calculating the dot product gives us: overrightarrow{BA} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = (-3)(-1-m)+(-1)(-m)=3+3m+m^2 To have an acute angle, 3+3m+m^2 > 0 must hold. The inequality simplifies to m^2 + 3m + 3 > 0. This is a parabola opening upwards with no real roots since the discriminant (3)^2 - 4(1)(3)<0. This implies that m^2 + 3m + 3 is always positive, but we seek the range where the original expression 3+3m+m^2 is positive, which simplifies to requiring 3m+m^2 > -3.

Define the function ( f(x, y, z) = a y z + b z x + c x y ) and the constraint function ( g(x, y, z) = x + y + z - 1 ). The Lagrangian ( mathcal{L} ) is formulated as: [ mathcal{L}(x, y, z, lambda) = a y z + b z x + c x y + lambda (1 - (x + y + z)) ] 4. **Setting Up the Lagrange System:** We need to find critical points by solving the system of equations given by the partial derivatives of ( mathcal{L} ) set to zero: [ frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial x} = b z + c y - lambda = 0 ] [ frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial y} = a z + c x - lambda = 0 ] [ frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial z} = a y + b x - lambda = 0 ] [ frac{partial mathcal{L}}{partial lambda} = 1 - (x + y + z) = 0 ] 5. **Solving the Equations:** From the above system, we can equate and solve: [ b z + c y = a z + c x = a y + b x = lambda ] By letting ( x = a(s - a), y = b(s - b), z = c(s - c) ) where ( s = frac{1}{2}(a + b + c) ), we can ensure that ( x + y + z = 1 ). 6. **Condition for Equality:** For the equality to hold in the initial inequality, the values of ( x, y, z ) must be proportionally related to ( a, b, c ) in the manner described above. 7. **Verification:** Summing these proportions yields the constraint: [ a (s - a) + b (s - b) + c (s - c) = 1 ] Simplifying this helps us confirm that the chosen ( x, y, z ) maintain the constraint ( x + y + z = 1 ). # Conclusion: Thus, the maximum value of ( a y z + b z x + c x y ) under the given conditions and constraints is attained when ( x, y, z ) are proportionally derived as ( x = a(s - a), y = b(s - b), z = c(s - c) ).

We claim that it is impossible to arrange these six squares to form a perfect rectangle. To show this, assume for contradiction that they can indeed be arranged to form a rectangle. 3. We build upon the knowledge that placing the squares in increasing size order should fit them into a rectangle efficiently, but let's follow the reasoning step-by-step. 4. Denote the supposed rectangle’s side lengths as ( L ) and ( W ) such that the total area of the six squares equals the area of the rectangle: [ a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2 + a_4^2 + a_5^2 + a_6^2 = L times W ] 5. Suppose squares are to be fit together without gaps and in a way where they share sides. We shall consider possible configurations by starting with the squares' placement. 6. For illustrative purposes, consider positioning the smallest square ( a_1 ) at a corner. For any neighboring square next to ( a_1 ), its side must be aligned either vertically or horizontally. 7. If another square shares a full side length with ( a_1 ), it must be of side ( a_1 ). But given that all squares have unique pairwise different side lengths, no other square can share this side’s length. 8. By attempting to position subsequent squares around ( a_1 ), it is evident that maintaining the alignment of all six squares to form a rectangle requires at least two squares to share equal sides at some juncture, contradicting the condition that all squares have different sizes. 9. We illustrate this through an example: - If we place square ( a_2 ) next to ( a_1 ) either horizontally or vertically, setting ( a_3 ) to continue the alignment proves impossible as it cannot maintain distinct side lengths while forming a rectangle. 10. General extension of this reasoning shows any attempt to combine these squares leads to at least two squares sharing a side, directly violating our initial condition of differing side lengths. 11.

Second Solution: 1. **Proportional Segments:** - Consider the intersection point of the diagonals (AC) and (BD) to be (O). - Note that (angle AOB = alpha + beta). - The triangles (AOB) and (COD) are similar, thus ( AO : OC = a: b ). 2. **Constructing Similar Trapezoid:** - Draw angle (angle AOB = alpha + beta) at point (O). - Along one ray of the angle measure (OA_1 = a) and along the other ray measure (OC_1 = b). 3. **Creating Parallel Lines:** - From (A_1), draw an angle (beta) to identify point (D_1) on the second ray. - Draw a line parallel to (OC_1) from (A_1), intersecting (OD_1) at (B_1). 4. **Scaling to the Trapezoid:** - Measure (A_1B_1) and confirm (A_1B_1 = a). - Extend the lines as necessary to ensure they are parallel and form the complete trapezoid. 5. **Final Coordination Check:** - Ensure all sides are proportional and aligned correctly to form the trapezoid (ABCD).

Let's begin with the following steps: 1. **Interpreting the Integral**: The problem asks to integrate the difference between F(x+a) and F(x) across the entire real line. This integral can be interpreted in several ways, but we will use the geometric interpretation of area under the curve, followed by a direct application of the Fubini's theorem. 2. **Geometric Interpretation**: Consider the graphs of F(x) and F(x+a). The function F(x) is the cumulative distribution function, and F(x+a) is simply a horizontally shifted version of F(x) by a units to the right. The area between these two curves from -infty to infty is what we need to evaluate. Given by: [ Gamma = { (x, y) mid y in [F(x-), F(x)] } ] and [ Gamma_{a} = { (x, y) mid y in [F(x+a-), F(x+a)] }, ] where F(x-) denotes the left-hand limit of F at x. Notice that Gamma_a is simply the graph of Gamma shifted right by a units along the x-axis. 3. **Using the Shift Property**: When we shift the graph by a, we observe that the integral which measures the area between F(x+a) and F(x) over all x indeed captures the area over the interval of length a. This can be visualized by swapping the x and y axes, transforming Gamma by a units along the y-axis, making it: [ Gamma_{a} to { (x, y) mid y in [F(x), F(x) + a] }. ] 4. **Applying the Fubini’s Theorem**: We now apply a more rigorous argument using Fubini’s theorem. The theorem allows us to switch the order of integration. Let's rewrite the integral: [ int_{mathbb{R}} [F(x+a) - F(x)] , dx = int_{mathbb{R}} dx , left( int_{mathbb{R}} I_{(x, x+a]} , dP right). ] Here, I_{(x, x+a]} is the indicator function that is 1 when t in (x, x+a] and 0 otherwise, and P is the measure corresponding to F. 5. **Changing the Order of Integration**: By Fubini’s theorem: [ int_{mathbb{R}} dx , left( int_{mathbb{R}} I_{(x, x+a]} , dP right) = int_{mathbb{R}} dP , left( int_{mathbb{R}} I_{(x, x+a]} , dx right). ] 6. **Evaluating the Inner Integral**: Consider the inner integral: [ int_{mathbb{R}} I_{(x, x+a]} , dx. ] This indicates the length of the interval (x, x+a], which is exactly a. Hence, [ int_{mathbb{R}} I_{(x, x+a]} , dx = a. ] 7. **Final Calculation**: Using the above result, [ int_{mathbb{R}} dP , a = a int_{mathbb{R}} dP = a. ] Since P is a probability measure, int_{mathbb{R}} dP = 1.

Therefore, the statement in option A is not necessarily true, as it omits the possibility of n being contained within alpha. Hence, option A is incorrect. **B**: Given m parallel alpha and alpha bot beta, it implies that line m is parallel to plane alpha, and plane alpha is perpendicular to plane beta. This does not necessarily mean m bot beta; instead, m could be parallel to beta, intersect beta, or lie within beta.

Now, let's find the equation of the resulting graph after shifting the original graph m units to the right. The equation of the shifted graph is y=sin (2(x-m)+ dfrac {π}{6}). 3. For the shifted graph to be symmetric about the y-axis, the argument of the sine function must be of the form kπ+ dfrac {π}{2}, where k is an integer.

Simplifying this, we get: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_i geqslant sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iz_i ] 8. To prove the above inequality, we use the Rearrangement Inequality. The Rearrangement Inequality states that for two sequences of numbers sorted in non-increasing order, the sum of the product of these sequences is maximized when both sequences are similarly ordered. 9. Since ( x_1 ge x_2 ge ldots ge x_n ) and ( y_1 ge y_2 ge ldots ge y_n ): [ sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_i ] is maximized when both sequences are in this non-increasing order. 10.

We are asked to prove that BD bisects angle ABC. Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Identify Right Triangles and Congruence:** Since AC = BC and angle ACB = 90^circ, triangle ACB is an isosceles right triangle. Hence: [ AB = ACsqrt{2} = BCsqrt{2} ] Extend BD to meet the horizontal line coming from E such that AE perp BD. Given AE = frac{1}{n} BD, we want to show that BD bisects angle ABC. 2. **Extend the lines and introduce point K:** Extend line AE until it intersects BC at point K. This setup allows us to further work with the geometry of the figure. 3. **Focus on triangle BEK and triangle ADE:** Notice that since AE perp BD and AE was chosen such that AE = frac{1}{n} BD, point E serves as the midpoint for any specific segment we choose due to its proportionality. 4. **Using Similar Triangles and Segment Lengths:** Because AC = BC, D lies somewhere along the common arm AC and we need to determine the relationship between the points. Consider triangle ABK. Since AE = frac{1}{n} BD and is perpendicular, BD must be extended such that E becomes the midpoint of AK. 5. **Prove Bisector:** To ensure BD bisects angle ABC, we need to show that triangle ABK is isosceles. Here BE perp AK simplifies the check for bisector: Since E is the midpoint of AK, BE perpendicular means equal angles across them. Hence, BD becomes the bisector. 6. **Conclusion:** Using triangle properties and perpendicular nature, we see BD operates equally on both angles forming part of central triangle ABK. Therefore, BD bisects angle ABC.

Let's trace the strategy with the largest heap. Suppose before player A’s move, the largest heap contains ( 2^n - 1 ) stones. 2. After player A’s move, the size of the largest heap will be between ( 2^{n-1} ) and ( 2^n - 2 ) stones. 3. Therefore, player B can always manage to keep the largest heap at the size ( 2^n - 1 ) stones after their turn. 4. If so, player B will eventually win because they can always force the largest heap into the form ( 2^n - 1 ) stones. Now, let's see if Kolya can force a win: 1. If the number of stones in the initial game is of the form ( 2^n - 1 ), then Vitya can always win. 2.

Therefore, Оля's statement could be a lie. - Паша's Claim: Names starting with 'O' are in odd places. Given 1st is Oлег and 2nd is Оля, the next odd place (3rd) should have a name starting with O, but if Паша is not telling the truth, this does not have to hold. Thus, Паша is likely lying too. 6.

Given that we only have three colors, we can color ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) in these three distinct colors. 4. **Introduce a symmetric point**: Now, consider a point ( A_1 ) which is the reflection of ( A ) over the line ( BC ) of the triangle. This point ( A_1 ) is on the perpendicular bisector of ( BC ), and is externally located relative to the triangle ( ABC ). 5. **Calculate distances**: Notice that by the properties of reflection and the original triangle's dimensions: - ( A_1B = A_1C = 1 ) (since ( B ) and ( C ) are reflections of each other over the perpendicular bisector, they maintain the distance of 1 from ( A )). 6. **Color of ( A_1 )**: Following our assumption, ( A_1 ) must be colored differently than both ( B ) and ( C ) because it is one unit distance from each.

The point ( A_1 ) lies on this circle, and points on the circumference of this circle are either equidistantly 1 unit or not from other points colored within the vicinity. Thus due to symmetrical properties and the previous unit distance constraints, these reflections will inevitably pair up some same-colored points at the distance of 1 unit apart somewhere on these overlapping symmetrical circle edges, giving us our contradiction. 8. **Conclusion**: Since our initial assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false.

Mathematically, this is expressed as c^2 = a^2 + b^2, where c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides. Substituting the given lengths into the theorem: [ c^2 = 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 ] Taking the square root of both sides to find c: [ c = sqrt{100} = 10 ] Therefore, the hypotenuse is made up of 10 matchsticks. 3. **Calculate the total number of matchsticks**: To find the total number of matchsticks used to form the triangle, we add together the number of matchsticks used for each side: [ text{Total matchsticks} = 6 + 8 + 10 = 24 ] Thus, the total number of matchsticks used to form the right-angled triangle is boxed{24} matchsticks.

Denote by C, D, E, F the midpoints of the segments AO, OB, BM, MA, respectively, in the quadrilateral AOBM. 2. Since points A and B cut a 60^circ arc on the circle centered at O, the angles subtended by these points at the center O and on the circumference are related by the Inscribed Angle Theorem (the angle at the center is twice that on the circumference, considering it subtends the same arc). 3. Given that AB and MO are chords of the circle that subtend the central angle 60^circ, they must be equal in length (AB = MO = R, where R is the radius of the circle). 4. The quadrilateral AOBM has equal opposite sides: AB = MO and AO = BO = R. This structure suggests symmetry that can be further analyzed. 5. The midpoints C (of AO), D (of OB), E (of BM), and F (of MA) form the quadrilateral CDEF. This quadrilateral is precisely varignon's parallelogram. 6. In this particular configuration, since we specifically deal with a configuration extending 60^circ regular triangle and recognizing the properties of such angles, it follows that CDEF is not merely a parallelogram but specifically a rhombus. This is because all sides are equal by the properties of the chords and their midpoints, confirming symmetrical equal lengths. 7. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles (90^circ). Hence, CE perp DF. Conclusion: Because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other, the line passing through the midpoints C and E (of segments MA and OB) is perpendicular to the line passing through the midpoints D and F (of segments MB and OA).

We have a rectangle that is divided into four smaller rectangles by two perpendicular cuts. It is given that the perimeters of three of these smaller rectangles are whole numbers. We need to determine if the perimeter of the fourth rectangle will also necessarily be a whole number. 1. **Define Variables:** Assume the original rectangle has dimensions (a times b). Let the dimensions of the cuts be such that they divide the original rectangle into four smaller rectangles. Let's denote the points of intersection by (x) on the axis (a), and (y) on the axis (b). This means: - The smaller rectangles will have dimensions: - ((x, y)) - ((x, b - y)) - ((a - x, y)) - ((a - x, b - y)) 2. **Calculate Perimeters:** The perimeters (P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4) of these smaller rectangles are: - (P_1 = 2(x + y)) - (P_2 = 2(x + (b - y)) = 2(x + b - y)) - (P_3 = 2((a - x) + y) = 2(a - x + y)) - (P_4 = 2((a - x) + (b - y)) = 2(a - x + b - y)) 3. **Integer Perimeters:** It is given that three of these perimeters (P_1, P_2, P_3) are integers: - (2(x + y)) - (2(x + b - y)) - (2(a - x + y)) 4. **Integers and Arithmetic:** Since (2(x + y)), (2(x + b - y)), and (2(a - x + y)) are integers, this implies: - (x + y) is an integer - (x + b - y) is an integer - (a - x + y) is an integer Given these facts, let's determine (2(a - x + b - y)): - We know (x + y) is an integer, say (k_1) - (x + b - y) is an integer, say (k_2) - (a - x + y) is an integer, say (k_3) Therefore, - (a + b - (x + y)) must also be an integer as it is the subtraction of two integers. 5. **Conclusion:** The fourth perimeter (2(a - x + b - y)) must also be an integer because it relies on the fact that the sums (a, b, x, y) have integer properties derived from the initial given integer perimeters.

Now, we can rewrite the equation using the identity sinalphacosalpha = frac{1}{2}sin(2alpha) and cos^2alpha = frac{1}{tan^2alpha + 1}: frac {frac{1}{2}sin(2alpha) - frac{1}{tan^2alpha + 1}}{2cdotfrac{1}{2}sin(2alpha) + 3cdotfrac{1}{tan^2alpha + 1}} = frac {1}{5}. By simplifying further, we get frac {sin(2alpha) - 1}{sin(2alpha) + frac{3}{tan^2alpha + 1}} = frac {1}{5}. Since sin(2alpha) = 2tanalpha / (1 + tan^2alpha) and cos(2alpha) = (1 - tan^2alpha)/(1 + tan^2alpha), we can replace sin(2alpha): frac {2tanalpha/(1 + tan^2alpha) - 1}{2tanalpha/(1 + tan^2alpha) + 3/(1 + tan^2alpha)} = frac {1}{5}. Multiplying through by (1 + tan^2alpha) to clear the denominators, we get frac {2tanalpha - (1 + tan^2alpha)}{2tanalpha + 3} = frac {1}{5}.

Solving the quadratic equation for tanalpha, we find tanalpha = frac {8 pm sqrt{64 - 4cdot 5 cdot 8}}{2 cdot 5}. tanalpha = frac {8 pm sqrt{-64}}{10}. Since tanalpha must be real, the square root of a negative number (considering real solutions) is not possible, which means this simplifies to tanalpha = frac {8}{10}. tanalpha = frac {4}{5}. But this is not consistent with the provided solution. Therefore, we must re-evaluate our approach. Notice that directly multiplying both the numerator and denominator by cosalpha makes sense as we can use the identity sin(x)/cos(x) = tan(x). So, frac {sinalphacosalpha - cos^2alpha}{2sinalphacosalpha + 3cos^2alpha} = frac {tanalpha - 1}{2tanalpha + 3} = frac {1}{5}.

A 6-digit palindromic number has the form ABCDDCBA, where A, B, C, D are digits from 0 to 9. Since the number must be even, the last digit (A) must be even. Therefore, A can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. However, since the number must also be greater than 600,000, the first digit (also A) must be at least 6. Therefore, A can only be 6 or 8. Now, let's consider the possible values for B and C. Since there are no restrictions on B and C other than being a digit from 0 to 9, B and C can each take any value from 0 to 9. So, for each choice of A (2 choices), there are 10 choices for B and 10 choices for C. The total number of 6-digit palindromic integers that are both even and greater than 600,000 is therefore: 2 (choices for A) * 10 (choices for B) * 10 (choices for C) = 2 * 10 * 10 = 200.

Let t={2}^{x}+ dfrac{1}{{2}^{x}}+1geqslant 3, then y=1- dfrac{2k+1}{t}left(tgeqslant 3right). **(A)** When 2k+1 > 0, i.e., k > - dfrac{1}{2}, the function y=1- dfrac{2k+1}{t} is monotonically increasing on [3,+infty), then yin[ dfrac{2-2k}{3},1). Thus, dfrac{4-4k}{3}leqslant f({x}_{1})+f({x}_{2}) < 2 and dfrac{2-2k}{3}leqslant f({x}_{3}) < 1, therefore, dfrac{4-4k}{3}geqslant 1, solving gives kleqslant dfrac{1}{4}. Hence, - dfrac{1}{2} < kleqslant dfrac{1}{4} is the desired range. **(B)** When 2k+1=0, i.e., k=- dfrac{1}{2}, yinleft{1right}. Therefore, f({x}_{1})=f({x}_{2})=f({x}_{3})=1, which satisfies the condition, so k=- dfrac{1}{2} is the desired range. **(C)** When 2k+1 < 0, i.e., k < - dfrac{1}{2}, the function y=1- dfrac{2k+1}{t} is monotonically decreasing on [3,+infty), then yin(1, dfrac{2-2k}{3}]. Thus, 2 < f({x}_{1})+fleft({x}_{2}right)leqslant dfrac{4-4k}{3} and 1 < f({x}_{3})leqslant dfrac{2-2k}{3}, therefore, 2geqslant dfrac{2-2k}{3}, solving gives kgeqslant -2. Hence, -2leqslant k < - dfrac{1}{2} is the desired range. Combining **(A)**, **(B)**, **(C)**, the range of the real number k is boxed{[-2, dfrac{1}{4}]}.

It is known that one wolf can outrun one dog, but two dogs can outrun the wolf. Will the wolf always be able to escape from the square?","completion":"1. **Problem Understanding**: We need to determine if a wolf, capable of running at speed ( v ) and moving around the interior of a square, can escape when four dogs are positioned at the vertices of the square and can only run along the sides at maximum speed ( 1.5v ). 2. **Position and Movement**: The wolf starts at the center of the square, while each dog is at one of the vertices. The challenge is to analyze if the wolf can always find a path to escape the square without being caught while traversing the sides. 3. **Relative Speed and Strategy**: Each dog is constrained to run along the perimeter. The wolf’s speed is ( v ), while dogs can travel at ( 1.5v ). Since dogs have higher speed along the perimeter of the square, they can adjust their positions quickly. 4. **Dogs' Tactic**: - The dogs can move in a way that they form a \\"diagonal cross\\" in which the wolf is always at the center. - Each dog keeps a vector connecting the dog and the wolf constant in direction by adjusting its position along the perimeter, effectively blocking the wolf’s escape. 5. **Mathematical Analysis**: - **Distance Calculation**: For a unit time interval, the wolf can move a distance ( v ) perpendicular to any diagonal it chooses to escape. Meanwhile, the dogs, to maintain their strategy, need to shift a distance slightly more than ( v ), precisely ( sqrt{2}v ) (considering the dog’s movement forming the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with each leg being ( v )). - In this scenario, the dogs covering ( sqrt{2}v ) are effectively faster because ( sqrt{2}v approx 1.414v ), and since the dogs run at ( 1.5v ) along the sides, they need to overcome only ( sqrt{2} ) times the distance traveled by the wolf. 6. **Simulation Outcome**: - Whenever the wolf tries to move towards any edge to escape, the dogs, by maintaining their positions, converge quickly enough to intercept the wolf before it can escape. # Conclusion The wolf, given that the dogs move optimally along the perimeter, cannot always escape from the square because the dogs' faster speed along the sides and their ability to coordinate their movement prevent the wolf from reaching the boundary without being intercepted.

This can be achieved using the fact that any planar graph (or, more restrictively, any triangulated polygon) can be 3-colored in such a way that no two adjacent vertices (i.e., vertices connected by an edge) share the same color. This ensures that in each of the resulting triangles, all three vertices are colored differently. 3. **Count Colored Vertices**: Given that we have used 3 colors, the number of vertices colored with any particular single color will be at most (leftlceil frac{n}{3} rightrceil). This is due to the pigeonhole principle. Suppose you have ( n ) vertices labeled ( V_1, V_2, V_3ldots, V_n ).

As all triangles are similar, the position of G relative to A, B, and C stays proportionally consistent across all similar triangles. 3. **Intermediate Analysis**: Since point A, and the line segment BC are consistently described by the family of similar triangles, the homothety (with a ratio frac{2}{3} from A) keeps centroid G on a consistent path, which circles around A. 4. **Conclusion**: Thus, the centroid follows a circular path given fixed ratio homothety.

Find the functional expression between y and x;<br/>(3) At what price per box will the total daily sales profit be maximized? What is the maximum profit?","completion":"Let's break down the solution into detailed steps: # Part 1: Increase in Selling Price and Its Effects Given that the base selling price is 70 yuan and for every 1 yuan increase, 20 fewer boxes are sold. If the selling price is increased by 20 yuan: - **Number of Boxes Sold**: The initial number of boxes sold at 70 yuan is 500. For a 20 yuan increase, the decrease in the number of boxes sold is 20 times 20 = 400. Therefore, the new number of boxes sold is 500 - 400 = 100 boxes. - **Sales Profit**: The cost price is 60 yuan per box. With a 20 yuan increase, the selling price becomes 70 + 20 = 90 yuan per box. The profit per box is 90 - 60 = 30 yuan. Therefore, the total sales profit is 30 times 100 = 3000 yuan. Thus, boxed{100 text{ boxes can be sold per day, with a sales profit of } 3000 text{ yuan}}. # Part 2: Functional Expression Between Daily Sales Profit y and Increase in Selling Price x Given that for every x yuan increase in selling price, the profit formula can be derived as follows: - The selling price per box becomes 70 + x yuan. - The cost remains at 60 yuan, so the profit per box is (70 + x - 60) yuan. - The number of boxes sold becomes 500 - 20x. Therefore, the daily sales profit y is given by: [y = (70 + x - 60)(500 - 20x) = (-20x^2 + 300x + 5000)] [y = -20(x^2 - 15x - 250) = -20(x - 7.5)^2 + 6125] So, boxed{y = -20x^2 + 300x + 5000}. # Part 3: Maximizing Daily Sales Profit From the derived formula y = -20x^2 + 300x + 5000, we know that the parabola opens downwards because the coefficient of x^2 is negative. The vertex form y = -20(x - 7.5)^2 + 6125 shows the maximum value of y occurs at x = 7.5. Since x is an integer, we consider x = 7 and x = 8: - For x = 7, the selling price is 70 + 7 = 77 yuan. - For x = 8, the selling price is 70 + 8 = 78 yuan.

Therefore, for x > 0, f(x) is increasing. This is because if x_1 < x_2, then f(x_1) > f(x_2) for x_1, x_2 < 0, and due to the symmetry of even functions, this relationship flips for x_1, x_2 > 0. For g(x), since it is an odd function and monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0], it will also decrease on [0, +infty). This follows from the property of odd functions, where if g(x) decreases as x decreases from 0 to -infty, then g(x) will also decrease as x increases from 0 to +infty. Now, considering the compositions: - f(f(x)): Since f(x) is increasing on [0, +infty), applying f again will result in a function that is increasing on [0, +infty) because f is increasing on the range of f for x > 0. Thus, option A is incorrect. - f(g(x)): Given that g(x) is decreasing on [0, +infty) and f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty), f(g(x)) will be increasing on [0, +infty) because as x increases, g(x) decreases, and applying the increasing function f to these decreasing values results in increasing values.

For Circle B, the area of the sector is frac{1}{4} times 3^2 pi = frac{9}{4}pi. Now, we need to calculate the intersection area of the two circles. Since the distance between the centers of the circles is 11 - 5 = 6 units, both circles intersect, but calculating their exact overlap involves finding the area of the lens-shaped intersection.

This satisfies ( frac{(n+1)n}{2} + 1 ). 4. **Case 2: ( A ) has at least two distinct prime divisors:** Let ( e = min{nu_p(A) mid p mid A} ). Let ( q ) be a prime divisor of ( A ) such that ( nu_q(A) = e ). - **Subcase 2.1: The number of distinct prime divisors of ( A ) is at least 3:** Let ( h ) be a positive integer such that ( q mid a_h ). Since ( P(n) ) is true, we have ( tau(A/a_h) > frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1 ).

Since ( P(n) ) is true, we have ( tau(A/a_h) > frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1 ). Therefore, ( tau(A) geq tau(A/a_h) + 2 > frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1 + 2 = frac{(n+1)n}{2} + 1 ). - **Subcase 2.2.2: ( m = 1 ):** Let ( p ) be the largest prime divisor of ( A ). Let ( t = #{j in mathbb{N} mid q mid a_j} ). Then we have ( nu_q(A) geq t ) and ( nu_p(A) geq t^2 - (n+2)t + frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} ). Therefore, ( tau(A) geq (t+1)left(t^2 - (n+2)t + frac{n^2 + 3n + 4}{2}right) ). Let ( f(x) = (x+1)left(x^2 - (n+2)x + frac{n^2 + 3n + 4}{2}right) ). We can verify that ( f'(x) > 0 ). Therefore, ( tau(A) geq f(1) = n^2 + n + 2 > frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} ). Therefore, ( P(n+1) ) is true in all cases. By induction, ( P(n) ) is true for all positive integers ( n ).

Substituting x_2 = frac{1}{x_1} and k = x_1 + frac{1}{x_1}, we simplify the inequality to: 2ln x_1 - x_1^2 < -1. This implies ln x_1^2 < x_1^2 - 1. Since x_1x_2 = 1 and x_1 < 1, let t = x_1^2, leading to ln t < t - 1 for 0 < t < 1. Defining g(t) = ln t - (t - 1), we find g'(t) = frac{1 - t}{t} > 0 for 0 < t < 1, indicating g(t) is monotonically increasing on (0, 1). Since g(t) < g(1) = 0, we conclude: boxed{|f(x_1) - f(x_2)| < frac{k^2}{2} - 2}."},{"prompt":"Given that a in mathbb{R}, if the point corresponding to the complex number (1+i)(a+i) in the complex plane is located on the real axis, then a = _______.","completion":"We have (1+i)(a+i) = a - 1 + (a + 1)i.

According to the conditions given: 1. The second digit (B) is thrice the first digit (A), so we can write: B = 3A 2. The third digit (C) is the sum of the first (A) and second (B) digits, so we can write: C = A + B 3. The last digit (D) is thrice the second digit (B), so we can write: D = 3B Now, let's use these equations to find the digits. From the first condition (B = 3A), we know that B must be a multiple of 3. Since B is a digit, it must be between 0 and 9. The possible values for B that are multiples of 3 are 0, 3, 6, and 9. However, if B were 0, then A would also be 0, which is not possible because A is the first digit of a four-digit number and cannot be 0. Therefore, B can be 3, 6, or 9. Let's consider each possibility: - If B = 3, then A = 1 (since B = 3A). This would make C = A + B = 1 + 3 = 4, and D = 3B = 3 * 3 = 9. So the number would be 1349. - If B = 6, then A = 2 (since B = 3A). This would make C = A + B = 2 + 6 = 8, and D = 3B = 3 * 6 = 18, but 18 is not a single digit, so this is not possible. - If B = 9, then A = 3 (since B = 3A). This would make C = A + B = 3 + 9 = 12, but 12 is not a single digit, so this is not possible either. Therefore, the only possible four-digit number that satisfies all the conditions is boxed{1349} ."},{"prompt":"For any positive integer, if the number of 2 's in its digits is greater than the number of 3 's in its digits, we call that is a **good** number.

Each of the 20 heroes can only learn something in a limited number of ways: - They can directly learn the Secret in one episode. - They can learn that another character knows the Secret in a certain number of episodes. - They can learn that another character does not know the Secret in a certain number of episodes. 3. Each hero can be involved in the following many episodes: - Learning the Secret: 1 episode. - Learning that one of the other 19 heroes does not know the Secret: 19 episodes. - Learning that one of the other 19 heroes knows the Secret: 19 episodes. 4. Thus, the total number of episodes a single hero can be involved in is: [ 1 + 19 + 19 = 39 ] 5. Since there are 20 heroes, the maximal number of episodes across all heroes is: [ 20 times 39 = 780 ] 6. Now, let's construct an example of a serial with 780 episodes: - Initially, no one knows the Secret. - In the first 380 episodes, for each ordered pair of heroes ((A, B)), let hero (A) learn that hero (B) does not know the Secret. This takes (19 times 20 = 380) episodes. - In the next 20 episodes, each hero learns the Secret one by one. - In the final 380 episodes, for each ordered pair of heroes ((A, B)), let hero (A) learn that hero (B) knows the Secret.

This means (d) divides both (a) and (b). 2. **Express (a) and (b):** [ a = n^5 + 6n^3 + 8n ] [ b = n^4 + 4n^2 + 3 ] 3. **Apply the Euclidean algorithm:** We need to find (d) such that (d mid a) and (d mid b). We start by considering the polynomial division of (a) by (b). 4. **Calculate the remainder:** We perform polynomial division of (a) by (b): [ a = (n^5 + 6n^3 + 8n) = (n cdot b) + r ] where (r) is the remainder when (a) is divided by (b). Since (b = n^4 + 4n^2 + 3), we have: [ n cdot b = n(n^4 + 4n^2 + 3) = n^5 + 4n^3 + 3n ] Subtract this from (a): [ a - n cdot b = (n^5 + 6n^3 + 8n) - (n^5 + 4n^3 + 3n) = 2n^3 + 5n ] So, the remainder (r = 2n^3 + 5n). 5. **Continue the Euclidean algorithm:** Now, we need to find (gcd(b, r)): [ b = n^4 + 4n^2 + 3 ] [ r = 2n^3 + 5n ] Perform polynomial division of (b) by (r): [ b = (n^4 + 4n^2 + 3) = (q cdot r) + s ] where (s) is the remainder when (b) is divided by (r). Since (r = 2n^3 + 5n), we have: [ q cdot r = q(2n^3 + 5n) ] To find (q), we divide the leading term of (b) by the leading term of (r): [ q = frac{n^4}{2n^3} = frac{1}{2}n ] However, since (q) must be an integer, we consider the next step in the Euclidean algorithm. 6. **Simplify the gcd calculation:** We need to find the gcd of the remainders: [ gcd(2n^3 + 5n, n^4 + 4n^2 + 3) ] Notice that: [ 2n^3 + 5n = n(2n^2 + 5) ] and [ n^4 + 4n^2 + 3 = n^2(n^2 + 4) + 3 ] 7. **Check divisibility by 3:** We need to check if (d) divides 3: [ d mid (2n^3 + 5n) quad text{and} quad d mid (n^4 + 4n^2 + 3) ] Since (d) divides both expressions, it must divide any linear combination of them. Consider: [ d mid 3(n^2 + 2) ] This implies (d) must divide 3. 8. **Conclusion:** Since (d) divides 3, the gcd of (a) and (b) is either 1 or 3.

The area of a square is calculated by squaring the side length (s), so: Area of square = s² Given that the area of the square is 400 cm², we can find the side length (s) by taking the square root of the area: s = √400 cm² s = 20 cm Since the circle is the largest that can fit inside the square, its diameter (d) will be equal to the side length of the square: d = s d = 20 cm The radius (r) of the circle is half of the diameter: r = d/2 r = 20 cm / 2 r = 10 cm Now we can calculate the area of the circle using the formula: Area of circle = πr² Given that π (pi) is approximated as 3.1, we can substitute the values into the formula: Area of circle = 3.1 × (10 cm)² Area of circle = 3.1 × 100 cm² Area of circle = 310 cm² Therefore, the area of the circle Minyeong drew is boxed{310} square centimeters (cm²)."},{"prompt":"Suppose m and n are relatively prime positive integers.

The property P_n is defined for omega_0 if there exist n-1 other distinct circles omega_{i} (for i=1, ldots, n-1) such that each omega_{i} is tangent to both omega and Omega, and omega_i is tangent to omega_{i+1} (with indices taken modulo n). 2. **Objective**: We need to show that if omega and Omega have the property P_n for omega_0, they will also have this property for any other circle omega_0' that is tangent to both omega and Omega. 3. **Use of Inversion**: To simplify the problem, we perform an inversion transformation centered at a point not on omega or Omega. The purpose of this inversion is to map the circles omega and Omega to a simpler configuration. Typically, inverting the configuration can transform complex tangency conditions into more manageable ones (e.g., concentric circles). 4. **Effect of Inversion**: After performing the inversion, the circles omega and Omega transform into concentric circles. Let's denote the images of omega and Omega under inversion by omega' and Omega', respectively. Since inversion maps circles through the center of inversion and points on circles not through the center to circles or lines, the nested tangency relationships are preserved but appear simpler in the inverted space. 5. **Transformed Problem**: In the inverted configuration, omega' and Omega' are concentric circles (possibly with different radii). The problem now reduces to finding n circles each tangent to both omega' and Omega' and cyclically tangent to each other in this simpler symmetric setup. 6. **Symmetry Argument**: Due to the radial symmetry of the concentric circles, the arrangement of n tangent circles which have property P_n for any initial circle within omega' and Omega' is immediate. The concentric nature due to symmetry shows that any other suitably defined circle tangent to both omega' and Omega' will also have the same property. 7. **Conclusion**: We conclude that the original problem, despite its more complex initial configuration, retains the property P_n under inversion. Since inversion preserves tangency and cyclic ordering properties, any circle omega_0' tangent to omega and Omega will also maintain property P_n as required.

A can complete the work in 6 days, so A's work rate is 1/6 of the work per day. B can complete the work in 8 days, so B's work rate is 1/8 of the work per day. Together, A and B can complete (1/6 + 1/8) of the work per day. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 24 in this case: (4/24 + 3/24) = 7/24 of the work per day.

We aim to prove that for each ( n in P ), there exists a subset ( B subseteq A ) such that ( f(B) = n ). To establish this, we will use an iterative approach by constructing sets ( C_n ) and corresponding sets ( P_n ) which help us show that every element in ( P ) can be represented as ( f(B) ) for some subset ( B ) of ( A ). Define: [ C_n = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} quad text{where} quad C_0 = emptyset ] [ P_n = { f(B) mid B subseteq C_n } ] We claim that ( P_n ) contains at least ( n+1 ) distinct elements.

If it were the case that ( P_{n+1} supsetneq P_n ), then the number of distinct elements in ( P_n ) would increase. Specifically: [ |P_{n+1}| geq |P_n| + 1 ] Based on our induction hypothesis: [ |P_n| geq n+1 ] Therefore: [ |P_{n+1}| geq (n+1) + 1 = n+2 ] This establishes that ( P_{n+1} ) contains at least ( n+2 ) distinct elements. Conclusion: Continuing this process iteratively, by the time we reach ( n = p-1 ): [ |P_{p-1}| geq p ] Hence, ( P_{p-1} ) includes all elements of ( { 0, 1, ldots, p-1 } ).

Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Define the Sets:** - Let the set of numbers be ( S = {1, 2, ldots, 250} ). - We will classify these numbers into two sets: \\"Good\\" numbers and \\"Bad\\" numbers. The classification will be based on the \\"cost\\" of representing these numbers in base 4. 2. **Base 4 Representation:** - Each number in ( S ) can be represented in base 4. For example, the number 5 in base 4 is ( 11_4 ). - We define the \\"cost\\" of a number as the sum of its digits in base 4. For instance, the cost of ( 11_4 ) is ( 1 + 1 = 2 ). 3. **Classify Numbers:** - We classify numbers into \\"Good\\" and \\"Bad\\" based on their cost. Let's assume that numbers with a cost less than or equal to 10 are \\"Good\\" and those with a cost greater than 10 are \\"Bad\\". - There are exactly 125 numbers in each category (Good and Bad). 4. **Bijection Between Good and Bad Numbers:** - We create a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the \\"Good\\" and \\"Bad\\" numbers. This means each \\"Bad\\" number is paired with a unique \\"Good\\" number and vice versa. - Both ( A ) and ( B ) know this bijection. 5. **Initial Announcement:** - In the first move, ( A ) and ( B ) announce either 1 or 2: - 1 indicates their number is \\"Good\\". - 2 indicates their number is \\"Bad\\". 6. **Subsequent Announcements:** - After the initial announcement, each friend will announce the digits of their number in base 4: - If their number is \\"Good\\", they announce the digits directly. - If their number is \\"Bad\\", they announce the digits of the corresponding \\"Good\\" number from the bijection. 7. **Sum of Announced Numbers:** - The sum of the digits of any \\"Good\\" number is at most 10. - The initial announcement adds at most 2 (since each friend announces either 1 or 2). - Therefore, the total sum of all announced numbers is at most ( 10 + 10 + 2 = 22 ). 8. **Adjusting the Strategy:** - To ensure the sum is exactly 20, we can adjust the initial announcement or the digits announced in subsequent turns. For example, if the sum exceeds 20, ( A ) and ( B ) can adjust by announcing smaller digits or skipping some digits. By following this strategy, ( A ) and ( B ) can determine each other's number while ensuring the sum of all announced numbers is exactly 20.

To find the time, we need to convert the speed into meters per second because the perimeter is in meters and we want the time in seconds or minutes. 1 km = 1000 meters 12 km/hr = 12 * 1000 meters/hr 1 hour = 3600 seconds 12 km/hr = 12 * 1000 / 3600 meters/second 12 km/hr = 12000 / 3600 meters/second 12 km/hr = 10/3 meters/second Now we can calculate the time (t) it takes for the man to complete one round: t = Perimeter / Speed t = 800 meters / (10/3 meters/second) t = 800 * 3 / 10 seconds t = 2400 / 10 seconds t = 240 seconds To convert the time into minutes, we divide by 60: t = 240 seconds / 60 t = 4 minutes Therefore, it takes the man boxed{4} minutes to complete one round of the park."},{"prompt":"Mary and Mike are sharing a jar of paint.

Then, the coordinates of the right focus F is (c, 0), where c= sqrt {a^{2}-b^{2}}. Since |FB|=2, we have sqrt {(c- sqrt {2})^{2}+(0- sqrt {2})^{2}}=2, which simplifies to c=2 sqrt {2}. Given that b=2, we have a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}=2^{2}+(2 sqrt {2})^{2}=12. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is boxed{frac{x^{2}}{12}+ frac{y^{2}}{4}=1}. (II) From the problem, we can set the equation of line l as y=kx-3 (k neq 0). Since | overrightarrow{AM}|=| overrightarrow{AN}|, point A lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment MN. Using the system of equations begin{cases} y=kx-3 frac{x^{2}}{12}+ frac{y^{2}}{4}=1 end{cases} we obtain x^{2}+3(kx-3)^{2}=12, which can be rewritten as (1+3k^{2})x^{2}-18kx+15=0 quad (①). The discriminant of equation (①) is triangle =(-18k)^{2}-4(1+3k^{2})×15=144k^{2}-60 > 0, which is true when k^{2} > frac{5}{12}. Thus, equation (①) has two distinct real roots when k^{2} > frac{5}{12}. Let M(x_{1},y_{1}) and N(x_{2},y_{2}). Denote the midpoint of segment MN as P(x_{0},y_{0}). Since x_{1} and x_{2} are the two distinct real roots of equation (①), we have x_{1}+x_{2}= frac{18k}{1+3k^{2}}. Consequently, x_{0}= frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}= frac{9k}{1+3k^{2}} and y_{0}=kx_{0}-3= frac{9k^{2}-3(1+3k^{2})}{1+3k^{2}}= frac{-3}{1+3k^{2}}.

As AP perp MN, we have frac{-5-6k^{2}}{9k}×k=-1, which simplifies to 5+6k^{2}=9, yielding k^{2}= frac{2}{3} > frac{5}{12}. Thus, k=± frac{ sqrt {6}}{3}.

What is the probability that the cashier window will open no later than 3 minutes after the Scientist arrived?","completion":"1. Define the timeline: We start counting time in minutes from the moment the cashier leaves. Let ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_5, x_6 ) be the moments in time when the five people before the Scientist and the Scientist himself approach the window. These times are all between 0 and 15 minutes and it is known that ( x_6 ) (the time the Scientist arrives) is the greatest among them. This fact can be written briefly as ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_5 < x_6 ) and we'll denote this event as ( B ). 2. We need to find the probability of the event ( A ) where the cashier opens the window no later than 3 minutes after the arrival of the Scientist, i.e., ( x_6 geq 12 ). 3. Next, we find the probability of the complementary event ( bar{A} ), where the cashier opens the window more than 3 minutes after the Scientist arrives, i.e., ( x_6 < 12 ). 4.

Thus, the slope of CP, denoted as k_{CP}, is calculated by the formula for the slope between two points, m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}. So, k_{CP} = frac{-1 - 0}{2 - 1} = frac{-1}{1} = -1. 2. **Finding the Slope of AB**: Since AB is a chord of the circle and CP is perpendicular to AB (as P is the midpoint of AB), the slope of AB (let's denote it as k) is the negative reciprocal of k_{CP}. Therefore, k = frac{-1}{k_{CP}} = frac{-1}{-1} = 1. 3. **Equation of AB**: With the slope of the line AB (which we can also call the line PQ) being 1 and passing through the point (2,-1), we can use the point-slope form of a line equation, y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line.

For points P on e outside the closed segments [A, B] and [C, D], both angles angle APB and angle CPD will be 0^circ. For other points on e, angle APB or angle CPD may be undefined if P coincides with any of the given points A, B, C, or D. Therefore, on the line e, any point outside the closed intervals [A, B] and [C, D] satisfies the condition angle APB = angle CPD. 2. **Symmetry and Points Not on Line e:** Now consider the case when P notin e. Assume angle APB = angle CPD. The locus of points P is symmetric with respect to the line e, so it suffices to examine points on one half-plane defined by e. 3. **Special Case: AB = CD:** If AB = CD, the translation that maps segment AB to segment CD will map a circle passing through A, B, and P (denoted by k) onto a circle passing through C and D (denoted by k'). If P' is the image of P, then angle APB = angle CP'D = angle CPD. Since P and P' lie in the same half-plane, circle k must intersect circle k' at P. Therefore, P is a common point of circles k and k'. 4. **Circle Symmetry via Reflection:** Reflect P across the symmetry line t of segments AB and CD. The reflection preserves the equal angles, thus P must lie on the symmetry line. 5. **General Case: AB neq CD:** Consider a positive ratio similarity that maps AB onto CD, having a center O on line e with a ratio lambda = frac{CD}{AB}. Circles k and k' will intersect at P, which implies that P lies on a specific circle related to this transformation. 6. **Inversion:** Perform an inversion centered at O with radius r = sqrt{OA cdot OD} = sqrt{OC cdot OB} which maps AB to CD. The locus of point P considering inversion properties will be a circle centered at O with radius r. 7. **Conclusion and Generalization:** If P is any point on the circle k^* with center O and radius r, the same arguments hold due to symmetry and similarity. Therefore, P must lie on a circle through O. 8. **Additional Confirmation via Apollonius Circle:** If P lies inside the mentioned circle of inversion (Apollonius circle properties), the angles angle APB = angle CPD must hold due to the angle bisector properties congruent by definitions of similar triangles and equal ratios. **Conclusion:** The geometric locus of points P such that angle APB = angle CPD is a circle centered at O, which is the external similarity point of segments AB and CD, with radius r = sqrt{OA cdot OD} = sqrt{OC cdot OB}.

Therefore, [ I - I_n < 2C_n. ] 5. **Range of individual functions**: For some ( k ), ( I_k < frac{2C_n}{n-1} ). 6. **Consider the function ( f_k(x) )**: Notice that [ left| f_k(x) + D - x right| < C_n, ] where ( D = sum_{i neq k} f_i(1) ). This must hold for all ( x ). Therefore, the range of ( g(x) = f_k(x) - x ) has length at most ( 2C_n ). 7. **Range constraints**: Since ( I_k < frac{2C_n}{n-1} ), assume ( a le f_k(x) le a + frac{2C_n}{n-1} ) for all ( x ). Then, [ g(1) le a - 1 + frac{2C_n}{n-1} ] and [ g(0) le 1. ] Hence, [ 1 - frac{2C_n}{n-1} < 2C_n. ] 8. **Solve the inequality**: From the above inequality, [ 1 - frac{2C_n}{n-1} < 2C_n ] [ 1 < 2C_n + frac{2C_n}{n-1} ] [ 1 < 2C_n left( 1 + frac{1}{n-1} right) ] [ 1 < 2C_n left( frac{n}{n-1} right) ] [ frac{n-1}{n} < 2C_n ] [ frac{n-1}{2n} < C_n. ] Thus, we have shown that ( C_n le frac{n-1}{2n} ). 9. **Construction of functions**: Consider the functions ( f_i(x) = frac{x^n}{n} - D ) for all ( i ), where ( D ) is a constant. This construction ensures that the range of each ( f_i ) is appropriately scaled. 10. **Verification**: To verify that ( left| f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2) + cdots + f_n(x_n) - x_1 x_2 cdots x_n right| le C_n ) is an elementary inequality, we note that the choice of ( f_i(x) = frac{x^n}{n} - D ) ensures the desired properties.

By the problem, the ( n )-th digit after the decimal point in ( a ) corresponds to the digit immediately to the left of the decimal point in ( n sqrt{2} ). 4. Remember the properties of rational and irrational numbers in decimal form: - Rational numbers have periodic or terminating decimal expansions. - Irrational numbers do not have periodic decimal expansions. 5. Assume ( m sqrt{2} ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). Recall that ( sqrt{2} ) is irrational, and hence any product ( n sqrt{2} ) also results in non-repeating decimals. 6. Consider ( n = m ) (any multiple of ( m )). The digits in ( a )'s decimal must match the digits from non-repeating expansion of ( m sqrt{2} ), which is impossible since periodic and non-periodic decimal cannot align. 7. Therefore, ensuring that digits at large digit positions align for a periodic ( a ) from non-periodic ( n sqrt{2}) cannot hold due to contradiction, since no finite decimal repeating pattern can match the infinite, aperiodic expansion of multiples (sqrt{2}).

If triangle (ABC) is isosceles with (AC = BC), then the median (CM), altitude (CH), and angle bisector (CF) coincide, making their lengths equal. Hence, the claim that the angle bisector is not smaller than the altitude and not larger than the median is trivially true in this case. 3. Suppose (BC > AC). 4. The altitude from (C) to (AB), denoted as (CH), is shorter than the angle bisector (CF) because the perpendicular (altitude) is shorter than any other segment drawn from a point to a line that is not perpendicular. 5. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the lengths of the segments (AF) and (BF) on (AB) split by (CF) are proportional to the adjacent sides: [ frac{AF}{BF} = frac{AC}{BC} ] Given that (BC > AC), it follows that [ AF < BF ] Hence, (AF) is less than half of (AB).

Since the condition is that the removal of any vertex ( v ) leaves at least one component of size ( geq a ), we can always find the required vertices. 6. **Constructing ( B ) and ( C )**: - Next, construct ( B ) by selecting the next ( b ) vertices from the remaining graph. - Place the remaining vertices into ( C ). Since ( a + b + c = |V| ), the remaining vertices would form ( C ) of size ( c ). 7. **Validation of Connectivity**: - By the construction process and the properties of the DFS tree, at least two of the subsets ( A, B, ) and ( C ) will form a connected subgraph. - This follows from the fact that removing any vertex ( v ) leaves a component of size at least ( a ), implying sufficient connectivity within ( A, B, ) and possibly ( C ). 8. **Conclusion**: - We have successfully partitioned ( V ) into ( A, B, ) and ( C ) as required. - At least two of the induced subgraphs ( G_A, G_B, ) and ( G_C ) will be connected by virtue of the connectivity condition given.

Our goal is to determine how large ( A ) (the maximum sum of any ( 3 times 3 ) sub-square) can be made by player ( M ), regardless of the responses from player ( N ). 2. **Construction by ( N ) to Minimize ( A )**: To investigate how ( N ) can prevent ( A ) from getting too large, we use the strategy of placing dominoes.

Hence, ( N ) can keep the maximum sum ( A ) in any ( 3 times 3 ) sub-square to be at most ( 6 ). 4. **Strategy by ( M ) to Achieve ( A = 6 )**: - Suppose ( M ) starts by marking 1 in the center cell, say ( c3 ). - We explore ( N )'s responses and how ( M ) can adapt: - If ( N ) marks a 0 in any cell in row 4 or 5, then ( M ) can continue marking 1's in adjacent cells in row 3 and so on. - Specifically, if ( N ) marks 0 in ( c1 ), then the next moves by ( M ) would be strategically placed in columns 1, 2, and 3 to ensure six 1's will eventually fill one or more of the ( 3 times 3 ) sub-squares ( {a, b, c} times {1, 2, 3} ) or ( {b, c, d} times {1, 2, 3} ).

Notice that the term ( frac{1}{2^n} ) rapidly approaches zero as ( n ) increases. 3. **Estimation for ( a_n ):** Let's look at ( (2 + sqrt{5})^n ): [ (2 + sqrt{5})^n approx A text{ where } A text{ is a real number (since as } n text{ increases, } A text{ is increasingly larger than } frac{1}{2^n}) ] Therefore, [ a_n approx (2 + sqrt{5})^n ] 4. **Evaluating the Summation:** Now consider the sum [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_k a_{k+2}} ] Since ( a_k approx (2 + sqrt{5})^k ), we have: [ a_{k+2} approx (2 + sqrt{5})^{k+2} ] Thus, [ frac{1}{a_k a_{k+2}} approx frac{1}{(2 + sqrt{5})^k cdot (2 + sqrt{5})^{k+2}} = frac{1}{(2 + sqrt{5})^{2k+2}} ] 5. **Simplifying the Sum:** Summing the series: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{(2 + sqrt{5})^{2k+2}} ] Factor out the exponent: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^{2k+2}} = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^2 (2+sqrt{5})^{2k}} = frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^2} sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^{2k}} ] 6. **Sum of Geometric Series:** This is a geometric series with first term (frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^2}) and common ratio (frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^2}). The sum of the first ( n ) terms of the geometric series ( frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^{2k}} ) is given by: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^{2k}} = frac{left(frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^2}right)left(1 - left(frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^2}right)^nright)}{1 - frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^2}} ] 7. **Simplification:** When ( n to infty ), the series converges to: [ sum_{k=1}^{infty} frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^{2k}} = frac{frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^2}}{1 - frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^2}} = frac{1}{(2+sqrt{5})^2 - 1} ] Since ( (2 + sqrt{5})^2 = 9 + 4sqrt{5} ), [ frac{1}{(9 + 4sqrt{5}) - 1} = frac{1}{8 + 4sqrt{5}} ] 8. **Rationalizing the Denominator:** To simplify: [ frac{1}{8 + 4sqrt{5}} times frac{8 - 4sqrt{5}}{8 - 4sqrt{5}} = frac{8 - 4sqrt{5}}{(8 + 4sqrt{5})(8 - 4sqrt{5})} ] [ = frac{8 - 4sqrt{5}}{64 - 80} = frac{8 - 4sqrt{5}}{-16} = frac{4sqrt{5} - 8}{16} = frac{sqrt{5} - 2}{4} ] The value of ( C ) will be determined by evaluating this sum over all ( k ). 9. **Conclusion:** Taking the smallest value for ( C ) from the dominant term, we find that the minimum value is [ boxed{sqrt{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"f the solution set of the inequality ax^{2}bx+c gt 0 is left(1,2right), then which of the following options is correct?

One sphere is at the center of the cube, and each of the other eight spheres is tangent to this central sphere and to three faces of the cube. 2. **Defining the Geometry**: Let r be the radius of each sphere. The center sphere's center, C, coincides with the center of the cube. Consider one of the outer spheres and let P be its center. Since each outer sphere is tangent to the center sphere and has its center on the surface of the cube, the distance PC (from the center of the cube to the center of an outer sphere) is equal to twice the radius, i.e., PC = 2r. 3. **Cube Geometry and Sphere Arrangement**: Each outer sphere is tangent to three faces of the cube. This means that the center of each outer sphere, P, is at a distance r from each of the three faces it is tangent to. Since the cube is a unit cube, each side has a length of 1. 4. **Calculating the Space Diagonal**: The space diagonal of the smaller cube formed by the centers of the spheres (including the center sphere and one of the corner spheres) can be calculated. The length of this diagonal is the distance from the center of the cube to a corner of the cube minus the radius of the two spheres (one at the center and one at the corner), which is 1 - 2r for each dimension. Therefore, the space diagonal of this smaller cube is sqrt{(1-2r)^2 + (1-2r)^2 + (1-2r)^2} = sqrt{3(1-2r)^2}. 5. **Equating Diagonals**: The space diagonal of the unit cube itself is sqrt{3} (since the cube has side length 1). Setting the space diagonal of the smaller cube equal to the space diagonal of the unit cube, we have: [ sqrt{3(1-2r)^2} = sqrt{3} ] Simplifying, we get: [ (1-2r)^2 = 1 ] [ 1 - 2r = pm 1 ] Solving for r, we discard the negative solution as it doesn't make sense in this context, so: [ 1 - 2r = 1 quad text{or} quad 1 - 2r = -1 ] [ 2r = 0 quad text{or} quad 2r = 2 ] [ r = 0 quad text{or} quad r = 1 ] Since r = 0 is not possible, we have r = 1.

The player who cannot make a move loses the game. We claim that the starting player (Player 1) has a winning strategy. We need to identify that strategy explicitly. # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Player 1’s Initial Move:** Player 1 can start by writing the number **6** on the board. 2. **Analyzing Remaining Numbers:** After Player 1 writes 6, we need to analyze the remaining available numbers and their pairings. - Divisors of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, 3): these cannot be used anymore. - Remaining numbers: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Let's group these numbers into inseparable pairs: [ (4, 5), (7, 8), (9, 10) ] 3. **Player 2’s Move:** Player 2 must select one member from any of these pairs.

Player 1 can start with 1 if no immediate strategy is available and then proceed to cover all possible moves by the second player by ensuring every move they make still maintains paired number strategy and mirroring. 3. **Postulating the First Move Advantage**: If the winning strategy of smaller games can be extended, then Player 1 makes the first move of selecting number 1 (ensuring simple strategies are invalidated), and proceeds similar to dynamically creating pairs. **Conclusion:** Given the general pattern observed from extending it from a simpler case with prime methods and strategies maintaining first move, Player 1, having the first move, can have the winning strategy: [ boxed{text{First player wins}} ]"},{"prompt":"a school, there are 30 students who are enrolled in at least one of the offered foreign language classes: German or Italian.

Step-by-Step Solution: Step 1: Transition Analysis When moving from ( n ) to ( n + 1 ): 1.

Considering that the tangent is negative and it is positive only in the third quadrant, we can conclude that α must be in the second quadrant, which means cos α < 0. The angle (π - α) is the supplementary angle of α. The cosine of a supplementary angle equals the negative of the cosine of the original angle: cos(π - α) = -cos α.

Given that we are selecting three random numbers ( x, y, z in [0,1] ) uniformly and independently, we aim to find the probability that these three numbers can form the sides of a triangle. 1. **Order the Numbers**: Without loss of generality, we can assume ( z geq x ) and ( z geq y ). This helps in simplifying our condition since we only need to check one triangle inequality (i.e., ( x + y > z )) instead of all three (( x + y > z ), ( x + z > y ), ( y + z > x ) ). 2. **Condition for Triangle Formation**: - For ( x, y, ) and ( z ) to form a triangle, the primary inequality ( x + y > z ) must be satisfied.

To find the interval that satisfies this inequality, we have two critical points: x = 2 and x = 4. 3. When x in (2, 4), both factors (x-2) and (x-4) are positive, making their product positive. However, we need the product to be negative, so x notin (2, 4). 4. When x in (-infty, 2), the factor (x-2) is negative, while (x-4) is positive, resulting in a negative product. 5. When x in (4, infty), both factors are positive, leading to a positive product. 6. Combining steps 3-5, we find that the inequality is satisfied only when x in (-infty, 2) cup (4, infty). 7.

The surface area of the second sphere (SA2) is: SA2 = 4 * π * r2^2 where r2 is the radius of the second sphere, which is 0.3 cm. Since the weight is directly proportional to the surface area, we can write the proportionality as: W1 / SA1 = W2 / SA2 Now we can plug in the values for SA1 and SA2: W1 / (4 * π * (0.15)^2) = 32 / (4 * π * (0.3)^2) We can simplify this equation by canceling out the common factors: W1 / (π * (0.15)^2) = 32 / (π * (0.3)^2) Now we can solve for W1: W1 = 32 * (π * (0.15)^2) / (π * (0.3)^2) Since π is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, it cancels out: W1 = 32 * (0.15^2) / (0.3^2) Now we can calculate the values: W1 = 32 * (0.0225) / (0.09) W1 = 32 * 0.0225 / 0.09 W1 = 0.72 / 0.09 W1 = 8 Therefore, the first sphere weighs boxed{8} grams."},{"prompt":"The radius of a circle is 2 centimeters (cm).

The formula for simple interest is: Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T) / 100 Given: Simple Interest (SI) = Rs. 2100 Rate (R) = 10% per annum Time (T) = 7 years We can rearrange the formula to solve for the principal amount (P): P = SI / (R × T / 100) Plugging in the given values: P = 2100 / (10 × 7 / 100) P = 2100 / (70 / 100) P = 2100 / 0.7 P = Rs. 3000 Now that we have the principal amount, we can calculate the compound interest using the compound interest formula: Compound Interest (CI) = P × (1 + R/100)^T - P Plugging in the values: CI = 3000 × (1 + 10/100)^7 - 3000 CI = 3000 × (1 + 0.1)^7 - 3000 CI = 3000 × (1.1)^7 - 3000 Now we need to calculate (1.1)^7: (1.1)^7 = 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.1 (1.1)^7 ≈ 1.9487171 (rounded to 7 decimal places) Now we can calculate the compound interest: CI = 3000 × 1.9487171 - 3000 CI ≈ 3000 × 0.9487171 CI ≈ 2846.1513 So, the compound interest amount is approximately Rs. boxed{2846.15} ."},{"prompt":"The area of a convex pentagon ABCDE is S , and the circumradii of the triangles ABC , BCD , CDE , DEA , EAB are R_1 , R_2 , R_3 , R_4 , R_5 .

Let's denote this constant distance as ( h ). 5. **Area of the Triangle ( triangle ABC ):** By substituting the base ( |AB| ) and height ( h ) into the area formula, we get: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times |AB| times h. ] 6. **Conclusion:** Since the base ( |AB| ) and the height ( h ) do not change regardless of the position of point ( C ) on the line ( l_2 ), the area of the triangle ( triangle ABC ) remains constant. Hence, the area of triangle ( ABC ) remains unchanged as ( C ) moves along the line ( l_2 ).

Assuming points ( A, B, C, O ) meet the conditions of the problem, then ( O ) is the center of the circumcircle of triangle ( triangle ABC ). 2. **Proof of Lemma**: - Consider the triangle ( triangle ABC ), which is isosceles by the problem condition. Without loss of generality, let's assume ( AB = BC ). - Notice that ( BO < AB ) and ( BO < BC ). - By the problem conditions, triangles ( triangle ABO ) and ( triangle BCO ) are isosceles, thus ( OB = OA ) and ( OB = OC ). - Therefore, ( OA = OB = OC ), indicating that ( O ) is the center of the circle circumscribing ( triangle ABC ). 3. **Proof by Induction on ( n )**: - Base Case: ( n = 3 ) - In the case of a triangle (( n = 3 )), all ( k ) points must lie inside the triangle, and thus, by the lemma, they must coincide with the center of the circumscribed circle of this triangle. - Therefore, ( k leq 1 ). - Inductive Step: Suppose for ( n geq 3 ), the claim holds that ( k leq 1 ). - Now consider a convex ( n )-gon where ( n geq 4 ). The ( n )-gon must have at least one internal or external angle ( angle A_{i-1} A_i A_{i+1} ) that is either a right angle or an obtuse angle. - By the lemma, none of the ( k ) points can lie within the triangle ( triangle A_{i-1} A_i A_{i+1} ). - If we cut the ( n )-gon by removing the triangle ( triangle A_{i-1} A_i A_{i+1} ), we form an ((n-1))-gon that contains ( k ) points. - By the induction hypothesis, for this ((n-1))-gon, ( k leq 1 ). Therefore, it follows for our original ( n )-gon that ( k leq 1 ). 4. **Conclusion**: - Examples verifying ( k = 0 ) and ( k = 1 ) are straightforward: - For ( k = 0 ), there are no additional points inside the ( n )-gon. - For ( k = 1 ), place the one point at the center of the circumcircle of an isosceles triangle formed by any three points of the ( n )-gon.

Since a is a positive integer that satisfies frac{a-1}{2}leqslant 1, and considering the conditions a-2neq 0 and a-3neq 0, the only value that fits all these conditions is a=1. Substituting a=1 into the simplified expression frac{a-3}{a+3}: - This gives frac{1-3}{1+3} = -frac{1}{2}.

Let A P, B Q, C R be the altitudes of the triangle ABC; let A^{prime}, B^{prime}, C^{prime} be the midpoints of its sides; and let D, E, F be the midpoints of the segments HA, HB, HC, respectively (refer to figure 168(a)). 2. By the definition of the Nine-Point Circle, the points D, E, and F lie on the circumference of the Euler's Nine-Point Circle bar{S}. Next, we need to show that the feet of the altitudes P, Q, and R also lie on this circle. 3. Extend the altitude AP to meet the circumcircle of triangle ABC at point P_1, then join P_1 to point B. - From considering triangles triangle APC and triangle BQC, we have: [ angle CBQ = angle CAP left(= 90^circ - angle BCA right). ] 4. Additionally, we know: [ angle CAP = angle CBP_1 quad text{(as they subtend the same arc in the circumcircle)}. ] 5. Therefore: [ angle HBP = angle PBP_1, ] which means triangle triangle HBP_1 is isosceles and HP = frac{1}{2}HP_1. 6. Hence, point P_1 maps to point P under a homothety (similarity transformation) with center H and ratio frac{1}{2}. Similarly, the points Q and R map to their respective feet on the altitude AQ and BR under the same transformation. 7. Therefore, points P, Q, and R also lie on the Nine-Point Circle bar{S} formed with center H and radius frac{1}{2} the circumradius of bigtriangleup ABC. 8. To show that the midpoints of the sides A^{prime}, B^{prime}, C^{prime} lie on bar{S}: - The radius of bar{S} is frac{r}{2} (where r is the radius of the circumcircle S of triangle ABC), and the center bar{O} of bar{S} is located at the midpoint of the segment HO (where O is the center of the circumcircle S). - The radius of S' is also frac{r}{2}, and its center O' is located along the line MO such that frac{MO'}{MO} = -frac{1}{2}. - From the results established in Task 50(a), points O, H, and M lie on the same line, with HM = 2MO. Consequently, centers bar{O} and O' coincide, meaning circles bar{S} and S' are the same. 9.

Additionally, the circle s', inscribed in triangle A'B'C', is half-homothetic to s with center of similarity at M and the ratio frac{1}{2}. 4. From the solution to Task 50(b), the midpoint of segment JZ (center of bar{s}) coincides with the center O' of s', lying on the line MZ such that frac{MO'}{MZ} = -frac{1}{2}. 5. Consequently, circles bar{s} and s' coincide. 6.

[ S_0 equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 equiv 10 equiv 0 (text{mod 5}), ] leading to an inconsistency since sums cannot remain solely 1 or 4. **Case 2:** If every (A_i) forms an arithmetic sequence with common difference (2) or (-2), analyzing the equation, [ d_0 = S_1 - S_0 equiv 2 (text{mod 5}), ] would imply ( S_1 equiv 1 ) and alternating between (1) and (-1). This violates the predetermined segment constraints as [ S_5 equiv S_0 (text{mod 5}), ] proving contradiction in sustaining possible (1) and (-1) manipulations.

Given the dimensions of the floor (280 cm by 240 cm) and the dimensions of the tiles (40 cm by 28 cm), we can calculate how many tiles can be placed along each dimension of the floor. For the length of the floor (280 cm): - The number of tiles that can be placed along the length is 280 cm / 40 cm = 7 tiles. For the width of the floor (240 cm): - The number of tiles that can be placed along the width is 240 cm / 28 cm = 8.57 tiles. Since we cannot have a fraction of a tile, we can only place 8 tiles along the width. Now, we need to consider the checkerboard pattern. Since we are alternating tiles with spaces, we can only use half of the available spots for tiles. Therefore, we need to divide the number of tiles by 2. For the length: - 7 tiles / 2 = 3.5 tiles. We can only place 3 tiles along the length because we need to leave space for the checkerboard pattern. For the width: - 8 tiles / 2 = 4 tiles. We can place 4 tiles along the width. Now, we multiply the number of tiles that can be placed along the length by the number of tiles that can be placed along the width to get the total number of tiles that can be accommodated on the floor: 3 tiles (length) * 4 tiles (width) = 12 tiles.

Since the events are mutually exclusive (only one car can win), we can add the probabilities of each car winning to find the total probability that one of them will win: P(X or Y or Z) = P(X) + P(Y) + P(Z) We can plug in the values we know: 0.39166666666666666 = 1/6 + 1/10 + P(Z) First, let's convert the fractions to decimals to make the calculation easier: 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666 1/10 = 0.1 Now, let's substitute these values into the equation: 0.39166666666666666 = 0.16666666666666666 + 0.1 + P(Z) Next, we'll solve for P(Z): P(Z) = 0.39166666666666666 - 0.16666666666666666 - 0.1 P(Z) = 0.39166666666666666 - 0.26666666666666666 P(Z) = 0.125 So, the probability that car Z will win is boxed{0.125} or 12.5%."},{"prompt":"A garage owner wants to fill a 55 gallon drum with a certain percentage winter mixture of antifreeze for his customers.

We already have 6.11 gallons of 100% antifreeze, which means it contains 6.11 gallons of pure antifreeze. Let's denote the volume of the 10% antifreeze mixture that needs to be added as ( V ) gallons. Since it's a 10% mixture, it contains 0.10 * ( V ) gallons of pure antifreeze. The total volume of the mixture in the drum will be 55 gallons, which is the sum of the 6.11 gallons of 100% antifreeze and the ( V ) gallons of 10% antifreeze mixture. So we have: ( 6.11 + V = 55 ) Solving for ( V ), we get: ( V = 55 - 6.11 ) ( V = 48.89 ) gallons Now, the total amount of pure antifreeze in the drum will be the sum of the pure antifreeze from the 100% mixture and the pure antifreeze from the 10% mixture: Total pure antifreeze = 6.11 + (0.10 * 48.89) Let's calculate that: Total pure antifreeze = 6.11 + (0.10 * 48.89) Total pure antifreeze = 6.11 + 4.889 Total pure antifreeze = 10.999 gallons Now, to find the percentage of antifreeze in the final mixture, we divide the total pure antifreeze by the total volume of the mixture and multiply by 100: Percentage of antifreeze = (Total pure antifreeze / Total volume of mixture) * 100 Percentage of antifreeze = (10.999 / 55) * 100 Let's calculate that: Percentage of antifreeze = (10.999 / 55) * 100 Percentage of antifreeze ≈ 19.998% So, the final mixture should have approximately boxed{20%} antifreeze."},{"prompt":"The distance between the two lines 2xy=0 and 2xy+5=0 is ______.","completion":"To solve, the distance between the two lines 2x-y=0 and 2x-y+5=0 is calculated as = dfrac {|0-5|}{ sqrt {2^{2}+(-1)^{2}}} = sqrt {5}.
