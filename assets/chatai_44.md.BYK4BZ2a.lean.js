For both shoes, Rick has 2 stripes/shoe * 2 shoes = 4 stripes. Hortense has double the number of stripes on her shoes as Olga, so she has 3 stripes/shoe * 2 = 6 stripes/shoe. For both shoes, Hortense has 6 stripes/shoe * 2 shoes = 12 stripes. Ethan has two more stripes per shoe than Hortense, so he has 6 stripes/shoe + 2 stripes/shoe = 8 stripes/shoe.

We need to find the distance between the centers of the equilateral triangles constructed outwardly on segments (AD) and (BC) of rhombus (ABCD). 1. **Define Centers and Distances:** Let (P) and (Q) be the centers of the equilateral triangles on segments (AD) and (BC), respectively. For equilateral triangles, the center can be found by moving ( frac{a}{sqrt{3}} ) units perpendicular to the base segment outward. Thus, [ BQ = DP = frac{a}{sqrt{3}} ] Since the lines (BQ) and (DP) are parallel ((BQ parallel DP)), the quadrilateral (DPBQ) forms a parallelogram. 2. **Use of Parallelogram Diagonal Theorem:** The diagonal (PQ) of the parallelogram (DPBQ) passes through the center (O) of the rhombus.

A common year consists of 52 weeks and one extra day, while a leap year consists of 52 weeks and two extra days. 2. We analyze a period of 400 years cycle from 2000 to 2399 because, due to the leap year rule, the calendar patterns repeat every 400 years. 3. If the 13th day of a month is a Friday, then the 1st day of that month is a Sunday. So, we need to determine the frequency with which months start with each day of the week in order to decide if Fridays are more common for the 13th day. 4. We categorize years into 7 types according to the day of the week on which the year starts: - Type 0: Year starts on a Sunday - Type 1: Year starts on a Monday - Type 2: Year starts on a Tuesday - Type 3: Year starts on a Wednesday - Type 4: Year starts on a Thursday - Type 5: Year starts on a Friday - Type 6: Year starts on a Saturday 5. If a common year has type (n), then the next year will have type ((n+1) mod 7). If a leap year has type (n), then the next year will have type ((n+2) mod 7). 6. We analyze the occurrence of each type during a 400-year cycle: - There are 303 common years and 97 leap years in a 400-year cycle. - Each type of year occurs roughly the same frequency, ensuring all day types are distributed relatively uniformly. 7. For each type, we count how often the first day of the month falls on each day of the week: - Common years: Each type occurs once in a 7-year period. - Leap years: Each type also occurs with a similar cyclic pattern. 8. We summarize that in one full cycle of 400 years, each of the days Sunday through Saturday has similar frequencies for the starting day of any month. 9.

Calculate the derivative of f(x): [f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x^{3}-2x^{2}-4x+2) = 3x^{2}-4x-4] 2. Factor the derivative: [f'(x) = 3x^{2}-4x-4 = (3x+2)(x-2)] 3. Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x: [3x^{2}-4x-4 = 0 implies x = -frac{2}{3}, 2] 4. Analyze the sign of f'(x): - For x < -frac{2}{3}, f'(x) > 0, which means f(x) is increasing. - For -frac{2}{3} < x < 2, f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is decreasing. - For x > 2, f'(x) > 0, meaning f(x) is increasing again. Therefore, the intervals where f(x) is monotonically increasing are (-infty,-frac{2}{3}) and (2,+infty).

Evaluate f(x) at the critical points and the endpoints of the interval: - f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) + 2 = 3 - fleft(-frac{2}{3}right) = left(-frac{2}{3}right)^3 - 2left(-frac{2}{3}right)^2 - 4left(-frac{2}{3}right) + 2 = frac{94}{27} - f(2) = 2^3 - 2(2)^2 - 4(2) + 2 = -6 - f(3) = 3^3 - 2(3)^2 - 4(3) + 2 = -1 2. Determine the extreme values: - The local maximum value on the interval is frac{94}{27} at x=-frac{2}{3}. - The local minimum value on the interval is -6 at x=2. - The extreme values of f(x) on the interval [-1,3] range from -6 to frac{94}{27}.

The results are summarized in the table below: [ begin{array}{c|c|c} n & n^2 - n + 1 & text{Pairs} hline 1 & 1 & (2, 1) 2 & 3 & (1, 2), (2, 2), (5, 2) 3 & 7 & 4 & 13 & 5 & 21 & (2, 5), (10, 5) 6 & 31 & 7 & 43 & 8 & 57 & 9 & 73 & 10 & 91 & (5, 10), (17, 10) end{array} ] Notably, pairs like ((5, 2)) and ((2, 5)), as well as ((10, 5)) and ((5, 10)), suggest a pattern. 2. **Conjecture and Lemma 1:** We conjecture that if ((m, n)) is a solution, then ((n, m)) is also a solution. Formally, we need to show that if ( mn - 1 ) divides ( (n^2 - n + 1)^2 ), it also divides ( (m^2 - m + 1)^2 ). We perform algebraic manipulations modulo ( mn - 1 ): [ 0 equiv (n^2 - n + 1)^2 pmod{mn - 1} ] Adding ( mn - 1 ) to the expression inside the square: [ (n^2 - n + 1 + mn - 1)^2 equiv (n^2 + mn - n)^2 equiv n^2(m + n - 1)^2 pmod{mn - 1} ] Since ( n ) is invertible modulo ( mn - 1 ) (its inverse is ( m )), we have: [ (m + n - 1)^2 equiv 0 pmod{mn - 1} ] Similarly, for ( (m^2 - m + 1)^2 ): [ (m^2 - m + 1)^2 equiv (m^2 + mn - m)^2 equiv m^2(m + n - 1)^2 pmod{mn - 1} ] By the preceding, this is zero, proving the conjecture. We call this Lemma 1. 3. **Building a Ladder and Lemma 2:** Using Lemma 1, we build a ladder of solutions. We notice that solutions come in pairs for each ( n geq 2 ), corresponding to complementary divisors. We formalize this as Lemma 2: **Lemma 2:** If ((m, n)) is a solution, then ((m', n)) is also a solution, where ((n^2 - n + 1)^2 = (mn - 1)(m'n - 1)). Moreover, if ( n geq 2 ) and ( m < n ), then ( m' geq n ), and if ( m > n ), then ( m' leq n ). **Proof of Lemma 2:** By hypothesis, (frac{(n^2 - n + 1)^2}{mn - 1}) is a positive integer. Modulo ( n ), this positive integer is (frac{1}{-1} equiv -1), and can be expressed as ( m'n - 1 ) for some ( m' > 0 ). If ( m < n ) and ( n geq 2 ), then: [ mn - 1 leq (n - 1)n - 1 < n^2 - n + 1 ] Thus, ( m'n - 1 > n^2 - n + 1 ), making ( m' geq n ). If ( m > n ) and ( n geq 2 ), then: [ mn - 1 geq n^2 + n - 1 > n^2 - n + 1 ] Thus, ( m'n - 1 < n^2 - n + 1 leq n^2 - 1 ), making ( m' leq n ). 4. **Descending to a Base Case and Lemma 3:** By Lemma 2, if ( m > n ) and ( n geq 2 ), we can find a smaller solution with the same ( n ). By Lemma 1, if ( m < n ), we can find a solution with smaller ( n ). Any solution thus descends uniquely to a solution with ( n = 1 ) (which must be ((2, 1)) by inspection), unless it hits a solution with ( m = n ) somewhere. We close that loophole with Lemma 3. **Lemma 3:** The only solution of the form ((n, n)) is ((2, 2)). **Proof:** Modulo ( n^2 - 1 ): [ (n^2 - n + 1)^2 equiv (-n + 2)^2 equiv n^2 - 4n + 4 equiv -4n + 5 pmod{n^2 - 1} ] For ( n^2 - 1 ) to divide ( 4n - 5 ), we must have: [ n^2 - 1 leq 4n - 5 implies (n - 2)^2 leq 0 ] This makes ( n = 2 ) the only possibility. It is easily confirmed to work. This argument fails where ( 4n - 5 < 0 ), but in that case ( n = 1 ) and ( 0 ) does not divide ( 1 ). 5. **Enumerating the Solutions:** The solution ((2, 2)) stands alone. We also have an infinite family of solutions of the form ((a_{k-1}, a_k)) or ((a_{k+1}, a_k)), where ( a_k ) is the infinite increasing sequence ((1, 2, 5, 10, 17, ldots)).

This method ensures that each row and column have exactly 4 black and 4 white squares. - Let's consider the 4 times 1 tiles. Each 4 times 1 tile covers 4 squares. When placed on this colored grid, a 4 times 1 tile will always cover 2 black squares and 2 white squares, no matter how it is oriented. [ 15 text{ pieces of } 4 times 1 text{ tile} implies 15 times 2 = 30 text{ black squares and } 30 text{ white squares covered} ] - Now consider the 2 times 2 tile.

However, each 2 times 2 tile cannot cover all four colors simultaneously due to overlap. - Thus, if we attempt to place the tiles on the 8 times 8 grid without breaking them, there will always be some colors not fully covered by 2 times 2 tiles despite 4 times 1 coverage. # Conclusion: By using either the checkerboard coloring or the 4-color cyclic pattern, we observe that it is impossible to completely cover an 8 times 8 grid using 15 pieces of 4 times 1 and 1 piece of 2 times 2 tiles without breaking any tiles.

This leads to (13) boys and (12) girls at one table, and vice versa at the other table (i.e., (12) boys and (13) girls). 4. **Neighbors' Configuration in Case of Uneven Split:** - At either of the tables where boys outnumber girls, the arrangement dictates that two boys must sit next to each other. - If comprehensively analyzed, with the seating arrangement split placing every second individual from one round table into another, an arrangement with unequal and alternating seats ensures occurrences of two boys seated next to each other at some point. 5. **Conclusion from Initial Table Arrangement:** - Returning to the initial setting, as we deduced from the split table(s), there must have originally been instances where two boys were sitting adjacent to each other. This implies that during the process of realigning, such configurations must persist due to the overall even split and the inability to segregate into exact equalized gender distributions. Thus, the existence of at least one person with both neighbors being boys is guaranteed. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"The function f(x)=|sin x+cos x|+|sin xcos x| is a (_______) A: an odd function with the smallest positive period of pi B: an even function with the smallest positive period of pi C: an odd function with the smallest positive period of frac{pi}{2} D: an even function with the smallest positive period of frac{pi}{2}","completion":"First, let's check whether f(x) is an odd or even function: f(-x)=|sin (-x)+cos (-x)|+|sin (-x)-cos (-x)|=|-sin x+cos x|+|-sin x-cos x| Since the absolute value of a number is always non-negative, we have: f(-x)=|sin x+cos x|+|sin x-cos x|=f(x) Thus, the function f(x) is an even function.

Note that b_0 = a_0 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10, which has exactly one trailing zero. 6. From the formula b_{k+1} = 3b_k^4 - 8b_k^3 + 6b_k^2, one can inspect whether these powers and coefficients imply that the number of trailing zeros will double. Since (b_0 = 10) has 1 trailing zero, we can analyze the progression. If (b_k) ends with (2^k) zeros: - When k=0, b_0 = 10 ends with 2^0 = 1 trailing zero. - Assuming (b_k) ends with 2^k trailing zeros, (b_k = m cdot 10^{2^k}). 7. As (b_{k+1}) includes a factor b_k^4, the zeros multiply, suggesting: [ b_{k+1} = 3(m cdot 10^{2^k})^4 - 8(m cdot 10^{2^k})^3 + 6(m cdot 10^{2^k})^2. ] By the factor 10^{4 cdot 2^k} emerging from each term: [ b_{k+1} text{ contains } (2^{k+1}) text{ trailing zeros}. ] 8.

Please prove your conclusion.","completion":"To solve this problem, we must determine the number of matches the B team from City A has participated in, given the constraints outlined. Here's a detailed step-by-step approach: 1. **Total Number of Teams:** As there are 16 cities participating and each city sends two teams (Team A and Team B), the total number of teams is: [ 16 times 2 = 32 text{ teams} ] 2. **Maximal Matches Per Team:** Since teams from the same city do not play against each other, each team can compete with every other team once, except with the team from their own city. Therefore, the maximum number of matches each team can play is: [ 32 - 2 = 30 text{ matches} ] 3. **Unique Match Counts:** Excluding A city's Team A, the remaining 31 teams have played different numbers of matches. Since the range of possible match counts is from 0 to 30 and they are all distinct, for simplicity, we can assign match counts as: [ 0, 1, 2, ldots, 30 ] 4. **Pairings of Teams from Same City:** Let ( a_k ) represent the team that has played ( k ) matches. Notice that when eliminating one city's team (like each ( a_{k} )), the sum of the match count for each city eliminates the same range from the total: [ a_{30} text{ and } a_{29}, a_{28}, ldots, a_{15} text{ belong to different cities except ( a_0 )} ] 5. **Analysis for Team Counts:** Since each city's two teams should collectively play matches without playing against each other: - If ( a_{30} ) is paired with ( a_0 ) from the same city, ( a_{29} ) must thus also belong to the same initial city. - Thus, each city’s total spans paired eliminations across matches balance except for A's team B as unique. 6. **Identification for City A:** We identify City A’s Team B by finding matches not shared by maximal match counts: - ( a_{30} ) reached total of 30 matches, having skipped only team ( a_0 ), thus all different city pair counts cascade from this. - Consequently, ( a_{29} - a_{0} ) comparably reduces by missed matches, and balances systematically down to one left match decaying. 7. **Conclusion for A city's Team B:** Solving all possible pairings between city sets: Directly ( a_{0} ) must consistently mirror half-rate matches ( a_{15} ) circumstantially— Hence, [ A text{ city's B team has played } 15 text{ matches } ] [ boxed{15} ] Therefore, the B team from City A has played 15 matches."},{"prompt":"Let ( g : mathbb{R} to mathbb{R} ) be a function such that [ g((x + y)^2) = g(x)^2 + 2xg(y) + y^2 ] for all real numbers ( x ) and ( y ).

Substitute (y = x) into (|x + y| = 99): [ |x + x| = 99 Rightarrow |2x| = 99 Rightarrow 2|x| = 99 Rightarrow |x| = frac{99}{2} ] Therefore, (x = frac{99}{2}) or (x = -frac{99}{2}).

The quantity of type A is 4 boxes less than twice the quantity of type B, which gives us the equation: [x = 2y - 4] Substituting the second equation into the first one, we get: [25(2y - 4) + 30y = 1500] Expanding and simplifying, we find: [50y - 100 + 30y = 1500] [80y = 1600] [y = 20] Substituting y = 20 back into the equation x = 2y - 4, we get: [x = 2(20) - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36] Therefore, the distributor purchased boxed{36} boxes of type A rice dumplings and boxed{20} boxes of type B rice dumplings. Part 2: Let m represent the number of boxes of type B rice dumplings purchased, then the number of boxes of type A rice dumplings purchased is (60 - m). The total profit, denoted by w, is calculated based on the difference between selling and purchase prices for each type of rice dumpling. The condition for purchasing at least twice as many boxes of type A as type B gives us the inequality: [60 - m geq 2m] Simplifying this inequality, we get: [60 geq 3m] [m leq 20] The profit formula is: [w = (32 - 25)(60 - m) + (40 - 30)m = 7(60 - m) + 10m = 420 + 3m] Since the profit increases with m and m is constrained to be leq 20, to maximize profit, we set m = 20. Substituting m = 20 into the profit formula, we get: [w_{text{max}} = 420 + 3(20) = 420 + 60 = 480] Therefore, to maximize the profit after selling, the distributor should purchase boxed{40} boxes of type A rice dumplings and boxed{20} boxes of type B rice dumplings, achieving a maximum profit of boxed{480} yuan."},{"prompt":"the complex plane, let A be the set of solutions to z^4 16 = 0 and let B be the set of solutions to z^3 8z^2 16z + 64 = 0.

In both cases, the products (ab(a^2 - b^2)), (bc(b^2 - c^2)), and (ca(c^2 - a^2)) will always include at least one even term: - If all (a), (b), and (c) are odd, then (a - b), (b - c), and (c - a) will each be even, making (a^2 - b^2), (b^2 - c^2), and (c^2 - a^2) even. - Hence, (a^3 b - a b^3), (b^3 c - b c^3), and (c^3 a - c a^3) are all divisible by 2. 3. Moreover, consider if any of (a), (b), or (c) is a multiple of 5: - If (a) or (b) or (c) is a multiple of 5, say (a) equals (5k) for some integer (k), then each term will be divisible by 5. - Hence, one of the expressions will be divisible by 5. 4. Let’s assume that none of (a), (b), and (c) is divisible by 5. Looking at the possible last digits of squares modulo 10: - If (a), (b), and (c) are not divisible by 5, then their squares will end in 1, 4, 6, or 9 (from (0, 1, 2, ldots, 9)). 5. Calculate the differences of squares modulo 5: - Differences of 1, 4, 6, 9 modulo 10 are (1, -1, 4, -4, 3, -3, 5, -5). 6. Since (1), (4), (6), and (9) modulo 10 are (1, -1, 4, -4, 3, -3, 5, -5), we see that at least one of these differences will be a multiple of 5: - Therefore, this would make the product (a^3 b - a b^3), (b^3 c - b c^3), or (c^3 a - c a^3) divisible by 5. 7. Given that the expressions are divisible by both 2 and 5, they are thus divisible by (2 times 5 = 10). # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{At least one of the numbers } a^3 b - a b^3, b^3 c - b c^3, text{ or } c^3 a - c a^3 text{ is divisible by 10.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Define a new operation T such that a T b = 4a + 6b.

We can choose x_3 = a_3 + d_1. Thus we have: [ x_0 = a_1, quad x_1 = a_2, quad x_2 = a_3, quad x_3 = a_3 + d_1 ] Since x_{i+1} - x_i = d for all i, it follows that x_0 leq a_1 < x_1 leq a_2 < x_2 leq a_3 < x_3.

By the pigeonhole principle again, in each subset ( A_{k,j} ), at least one element must not be in ( A ). 6. Therefore, there are at least 10 subsets ( A_{k,j} ) each missing one element, thus, there are at least ( 9(k) + 100 = 271 ) elements not in ( A ). 7.

The general term in the expansion is given by: [T_{k+1} = binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}(-sqrt{2})^k] First, we identify the second and fourth terms in the expansion: - The second term has k=1, which gives us: [T_2 = binom{n}{1}x^{n-1}(-sqrt{2})^1 = binom{n}{1}(-sqrt{2})x^{n-1}] - The fourth term has k=3, which yields: [T_4 = binom{n}{3}x^{n-3}(-sqrt{2})^3 = binom{n}{3}(-2sqrt{2})x^{n-3}] According to the problem statement, we have: [ frac{binom{n}{1}(-sqrt{2})}{binom{n}{3}(-2sqrt{2})} = frac{1}{2} ] This simplifies to: [ frac{binom{n}{1}}{binom{n}{3}} = 1 ] Using the property of binomial coefficients, we can express this ratio further: [ frac{n!}{1!(n-1)!} cdot frac{3!(n-3)!}{n!} = 1 ] [ frac{n}{3!(n-3)} = 1 ] [ frac{n}{6(n-3)} = 1 ] [ n(n-3) = 6 ] [ n^2 - 3n - 6 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find the possible values for n.

Let's break down the steps to find the solution. 1. **Points on the Same Side of the Rectangle:** - To find a rectangle such that both points lie on the same side, we start by drawing a chord of the circle through these points. - Extend the chord to the endpoints on the circle. Construct diameters through these endpoints. - Connect the endpoints of the chord with the endpoints of these diameters to form the rectangle. This method ensures that the chord is a side of the rectangle, and it is easy to prove that this configuration gives the required rectangle. 2. **Points Lying Symmetrically Relative to the Circle's Center:** - If the points lie on opposite sides of the rectangle, imagine the symmetric points of these given points relative to the center of the circle (label the points A and B, and their symmetric points A1 and B1). - Construct lines connecting A to B1 and B to A1. These lines define the sides of the rectangle. - The resulting lines are symmetric about the center, implying the constructed chords are parallel and equal in length. - Connect the endpoints of these chords to form a rectangle, ensuring the distance and symmetry properties hold and thus proving the rectangle construction. 3. **Points on Adjacent Sides of the Rectangle:** - When constructing a rectangle such that given points lie on adjacent sides, draw a semicircle using the segment AB (connecting the two given points) as the diameter. - If the semicircle intersects the given circle at two points, these intersections form another possible set of solutions. - If it touches the given circle at a single point, we have a unique additional solution. - If the semicircle does not intersect the given circle, no additional solutions exist this way. 4. **Special Cases and Infinite Solutions:** - There are special configurations where multiple solutions or no solutions are possible. - If both points lie on the same diameter but are not symmetric with respect to the center, this forms a unique situation where an infinite number of rectangles can be constructed. - Checking other placements and intersections will reveal all possible solutions. # Conclusion Analyzing the problem with the provided configurations indicates the general steps for constructing necessary rectangles. It highlights the underlying geometric properties that guide the solution's feasibility and uniqueness. This approach leads to multiple solutions based on the position of the given points, providing practical ways to construct the required rectangle using fundamental geometric principles. boxed{} (No boxed answer is provided as the final conclusion mentions various possibilities and configurations rather than a single solution.)"},{"prompt":"Find the error in the following reasoning.

If (p) is a sufficient but not necessary condition for (q), determine the range of the real number (a).","completion":"Let's analyze the given conditions one by one. Starting with condition (p): (log_{2}(1-x) < 0), we know from the properties of logarithms that this implies (1-x) is between (0) and (1) (since a logarithm is only defined for positive numbers and the fact that (log_{2}(1) = 0)). Therefore, we have: 0 < 1-x < 1. Upon simplifying this inequality, we get: 0 < x < 1. Now, consider condition (q): (x > a). Since (p) is a sufficient but not necessary condition for (q), it means that whenever condition (p) holds, condition (q) must also hold, but not vice versa.

We are given that ( X(t) ) is stationary, and we need to show that the correlation function ( k_X(t_1, t_2) ) is an even function, i.e., ( k_X(tau) = k_X(-tau) ). 2. **Correlation Function for Stationary Process**: For a stationary process, the correlation function ( k_X(t_1, t_2) ) depends only on the time difference between ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ). Hence, we can express the correlation function as: [ k_X(t_1, t_2) = k_X(t_1 - t_2) ] Let ( tau = t_2 - t_1 ). This means: [ k_X(t_1, t_2) = k_X(-tau) ] 3. **Permutation of Arguments**: By the definition of the correlation function and the property of stationary processes, we know that changing the order of ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ) should not affect the value of the correlation function. Thus: [ k_X(t_1, t_2) = k_X(t_2, t_1) ] 4. **Expressing the Reversed Time Difference**: Considering ( t_1 = t_2 - tau ), we can rewrite ( k_X(t_2, t_1) ): [ k_X(t_2, t_1) = k_X(t_2, t_2 - tau) = k_X(tau) ] Therefore, from steps 2 and 3, we get: [ k_X(-tau) = k_X(tau) ] In conclusion, the correlation function of a stationary random process is an even function: [ boxed{k_X(tau) = k_X(-tau)} ]"},{"prompt":"Show that for all ((x, y) in mathbb{R}^{2}), (xy leq frac{x^{2} + y^{2}}{2})","completion":"To demonstrate that ( forall (x, y) in mathbb{R}^2, : xy leq frac{x^2 + y^2}{2} ), we proceed as follows: 1. **Start with the basic inequality**: Consider the square of the difference between ( x ) and ( y ): [ 0 leq (x - y)^2 ] 2. **Expand the square**: Expanding the left-hand side, we get: [ (x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 ] Thus, our inequality becomes: [ 0 leq x^2 - 2xy + y^2 ] 3. **Rearrange the terms**: To isolate ( 2xy ), add ( 2xy ) to both sides of the inequality: [ 2xy leq x^2 + y^2 ] 4. **Divide by 2** to obtain the desired form: Divide both sides by 2: [ xy leq frac{x^2 + y^2}{2} ] Thus, we conclude that: [ boxed{xy leq frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Two distinct positive integers u and v are factors of 48.

Therefore, we can write the equation: [ 0.90 times (W + D) = 153 ] Now, we substitute ( D ) with ( W - 30 ): [ 0.90 times (W + (W - 30)) = 153 ] Simplify the equation: [ 0.90 times (2W - 30) = 153 ] Divide both sides by 0.90 to find the original total cost: [ 2W - 30 = frac{153}{0.90} ] [ 2W - 30 = 170 ] Now, add 30 to both sides to solve for ( 2W ): [ 2W = 170 + 30 ] [ 2W = 200 ] Finally, divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of the washing machine before the discount: [ W = frac{200}{2} ] [ W = 100 ] So, the washing machine cost boxed{100} before the discount."},{"prompt":"Completely factor the following expression: [(16x^7 + 32x^5 9) (4x^7 8x^5 + 9).]","completion":"First, combine like terms: [ (16x^7 + 32x^5 - 9) - (4x^7 - 8x^5 + 9) = 16x^7 + 32x^5 - 9 - 4x^7 + 8x^5 - 9 ] [ = 12x^7 + 40x^5 - 18 ] Factor out the greatest common factor which is 4: [ 12x^7 + 40x^5 - 18 = 4(3x^7 + 10x^5 - 4.5) ] To keep integer values: [ 12x^7 + 40x^5 - 18 = 4(3x^7 + 10x^5 - frac{9}{2}) ] However, factoring further cleanly within integer realm is not straightforward here without rational coefficients.

The square root of 441 is 21, which means we can arrange the coins in a 21 by 21 grid to form a square. Now, we need to find the size of one coin to determine the length of the side of the square. We can use the information from the first square containing four 100-won coins. If the perimeter of the square containing four coins is 56 cm, then each side of the square is 56 cm / 4 = 14 cm. Since the coins are laid out to form a 2 by 2 grid (as the square root of 4 is 2), each coin would have a diameter of 14 cm / 2 = 7 cm.

However, we know there are women in the association, so we need to find the minimum number of women such that the condition of 20% of women being homeowners is satisfied. Let's assume that the number of women is the smallest possible integer that allows for 20% homeownership. Since 20% is 1/5, the number of women must be a multiple of 5 for this to be an integer. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5 itself. So let's assume there are 5 women. If there are 5 women, then 20% of them are homeowners, which means 1 woman is a homeowner. The remaining members are men: M = 150 - W M = 150 - 5 M = 145 Now, 10% of these men are homeowners: 10% of 145 = 0.10 * 145 = 14.5 Since the number of homeowners must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 15 men who are homeowners.

The ratio of the distance covered by walking to the distance covered by running is: (frac{d_w}{d_r} = frac{4}{4} = 1) Therefore, the ratio of the distance covered by walking to the distance covered by running is boxed{1:1} ."},{"prompt":"Two parabolas are given by the equations y=4x^2+3x1 and y=x^2+8x+7.

We need to show that all 16 members of ( F ) have exactly one element in common. 2. **Complementary Subsets:** If ( A subseteq K ) and ( A in F ), then ( K setminus A notin F ). This is because if both ( A ) and ( K setminus A ) were in ( F ), their intersection would be empty, contradicting the condition that any three members of ( F ) have at least one element in common. 3. **Counting Subsets:** Since ( F ) contains 16 subsets and there are ( 2^5 = 32 ) subsets of ( K ), exactly one subset from each complementary pair ( {A, K setminus A} ) can be in ( F ). This is because there are 16 pairs of complementary subsets, and ( F ) contains exactly 16 subsets. 4. **Singletons and Complements:** Consider the pairs where ( A ) is a singleton. If one such singleton ( {x} ) is in ( F ), then it must be the only singleton in ( F ), and all sets in ( F ) must contain ( x ). This is because if ( {x} in F ), then ( K setminus {x} notin F ), and any subset in ( F ) must intersect with ( {x} ). 5. **Assumption of Complements of Singletons:** Assume that all complements of singletons are in ( F ). This means ( {a, b, c, d}, {a, b, c, e}, {a, b, d, e}, {a, c, d, e}, {b, c, d, e} in F ). 6. **Doubletons and Tripletons:** Consider the pairs where ( A ) is a doubleton. If two such doubletons ( {a, b} ) and ( {a, c} ) are in ( F ), their intersection is ( {a} ). However, this would imply that ( {a} ) is in ( F ), contradicting our assumption that all complements of singletons are in ( F ). 7. **Contradiction with Tripletons:** Suppose at most one doubleton is in ( F ), say ( {a, b} ). Then all other tripletons but ( {c, d, e} ) are in ( F ). Consider ( {a, c, d} ) and ( {b, c, e} ) in ( F ). Their intersection is ( {c} ), but then the further intersection with ( {a, b, d, e} ) from ( F ) is empty, leading to a contradiction. 8. **Conclusion:** Since any assumption other than all sets in ( F ) having a common element leads to a contradiction, we conclude that all 16 members of ( F ) must have exactly one element in common.

Set A consists of integers (x) that satisfy the inequality -3 < x ≤ 1. Thus, A = {-2, -1, 0, 1}. For set B, we need to find the real numbers (x) that make the inequality x^2 - x - 2 ≥ 0 true. To do this, we can first factor the quadratic expression: x^2 - x - 2 = (x - 2)(x + 1) Then, we find the critical points by setting each factor equal to zero: x - 2 = 0 Rightarrow x = 2 x + 1 = 0 Rightarrow x = -1 Now, we test intervals created by these critical points to determine where the inequality holds true. The intervals are: 1. (-infty, -1) 2. (-1, 2) 3.

Next, we need to find out how much older Trevor's brother is compared to Trevor. Currently, Trevor is 11 years old, and his brother is 20 years old.

The critical case occurs when lines (x_1, x_2, x_3) pass through one point, reducing (X) to a point. 4. **Family of Triangles (S):** - As (x_1, x_2, x_3) rotate with equal angular speed, the intersection points trace circles with centers (O_1, O_2, O_3) respectively. 5. **Maximizing Area:** - Consider the lengths of sides like (X_2 X_3): [ begin{split} & X_2 X_3 = 2K_2K_3, & text{where } K_2, K_3 text{ are points directly related to the central angles}. end{split} ] - The maximum value for side lengths occurs when (X_1 X_2 X_3) sides align parallel to lines connecting (O_1, O_2, O_3). 6. **Constructing the Family:** - The minimal triangle of the family (S) occurs when lines (x_1, x_2, x_3) are perpendicular to corresponding lines of centers of circles (O_2 O_3, O_3 O_1). Thus the triangle degenerates into point (C). 7. **Symmetry and Orientation:** - Reflecting (B) across any line and recreating families (S) and (S') yields similar triangles. - To ensure all triangles are considered, it can be checked if vertices (A_1, A_2, A_3) and (B_1, B_2, B_3) cover all triangles as their (S) families do. 8. **Final Largest Triangle Construction:** - By examining orientations and angles, we confirm the family (S_{123}) where the similarity and orientations agree most efficiently (refer to figures that illustrate these transformations). # Conclusion: After considering all possible transformations and areas of diverse similar triangles, the largest triangle that fits the desired conditions belongs to the family (S_{123}).

[ S = sum_{i=1}^{f} pi (m_i - 2) ] 4. **Simplify the Sum**: We can pull out the common factor (pi) and rearrange the summation: [ S = pi sum_{i=1}^{f} (m_i - 2) ] This can be split into: [ S = pi left( sum_{i=1}^{f} m_i - sum_{i=1}^{f} 2 right) ] Noting that (sum_{i=1}^{f} 2 = 2f), we get: [ S = pi left( sum_{i=1}^{f} m_i - 2f right) ] 5. **Relation to a Previous Problem**: From problem 27, we know that: [ sum_{i=1}^{f} m_i = 2a ] 6. **Substitution**: Substitute this result into our expression for (S): [ S = pi left( 2a - 2f right) ] Factor out the common term (2pi): [ S = 2pi (a - f) ] # Conclusion: The sum of the magnitudes of all the planar angles of the polyhedron is: [ boxed{2pi(a - f)} ]"},{"prompt":"A can do a piece of work in 15 days.

Draw OD to intersect BC at E. Clearly, points A, G (centroid of triangle ABC), and E are collinear. 2. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:** Next, prove that points A, M, O, N are concyclic. The midpoint P of OA will then be the circumcenter of triangle AMN. - As O is the circumcenter of triangle ABC, it follows that O is equidistant from points A, B, and C. 3. **Ratios and Measurements:** Join PI and OI. By the properties of the incenter, we have DI = DB = DC. From the Law of Sines (or power of a point), we have: [ AB cdot BC + AC cdot DB = AD cdot BC ] Given that 2BC = AB + AC, we rearrange to get: [ DI(AB + AC) = AD cdot BC ] Thus: [ frac{AD}{DI} = frac{AB + AC}{BC} = frac{2BC}{BC} = 2 ] This implies that I is the midpoint of AD, so OI perp AD. 4. **Right Triangle Property:** In the right triangle triangle AOI, we have: [ PI = frac{1}{2}OA ] Thus, I lies on the circumcircle of triangle AMN. 5. **Parallel Lines:** It is easy to show that PI is parallel to OD.

The Charging Bull makes 40 rounds in an hour, which is 3600 seconds (since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute). Therefore, the time it takes for the Charging Bull to circle the track once is 3600 seconds / 40 rounds = 90 seconds per round. They meet at the starting point for the second time after 6 minutes, which is 6 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 360 seconds. At this point, the Charging Bull would have completed 360 seconds / 90 seconds per round = 4 rounds. Since they meet at the starting point again, the Racing Magic must have completed an exact number of rounds in the same time. Let's denote the number of rounds the Racing Magic completes as R. So, we have: T seconds/round * R rounds = 360 seconds We know that R must be a whole number because they meet at the starting point, and R must be less than 4 because the Racing Magic is slower than the Charging Bull. The only whole number of rounds that the Racing Magic could have completed in 360 seconds that is less than 4 is 1 round (since 2, 3, or more rounds would imply the Racing Magic is faster or as fast as the Charging Bull, which is not the case).

The amount of work done is directly proportional to the number of workers and the time they work. In this case, the work done is washing a wall, and the workers are the boys.

Since we need (m < n), we count the valid pairs: - If (m = 2), (n) can be any of ({4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}) — giving us 9 pairs. - If (m = 4), (n) can be any of ({6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}) — giving us 8 pairs. - If (m = 6), (n) can be any of ({8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}) — giving us 7 pairs. - Continuing this way, we notice that each time (m) is increased by 2, the number of choices for (n) decreases by 1. The total number of valid pairs is: [ 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45 ] 3. **Counting pairs where both (m) and (n) are odd:** - The odd numbers in the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 20}) are ({1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19}). - There are 10 odd numbers.

According to the problem, the total sales were 10,500, and the price of student tickets was 6, while the price of nonstudent tickets was 9. We can write the following equation based on the total sales: 6S + 9N = 10,500 We are also told that 850 tickets of each type were sold. This means that: S + N = 850 + 850 Now, we can solve for S and N. First, let's find the total number of tickets sold: S + N = 850 + 850 S + N = 1700 Now, let's substitute S = 1700 - N into the first equation: 6(1700 - N) + 9N = 10,500 Expanding the equation: 10,200 - 6N + 9N = 10,500 Combining like terms: 3N = 10,500 - 10,200 3N = 300 Dividing both sides by 3: N = 100 Now that we have the number of nonstudent tickets sold (N = 100), we can find the number of student tickets sold (S): S = 1700 - N S = 1700 - 100 S = 1600 So, 1600 student tickets and 100 nonstudent tickets were sold.

This implies that f(x-1) = f(-(x-1)) = f(1-x). The property of even functions is such that f(x) = f(-x), but since we are dealing with f(x-1), the symmetry is around x = 1, or more accurately, the graph of f(x) is symmetric about x = -1. 2. **Condition ②**: The minimum value of f(x) is 3. This means that no matter what x value we plug into f(x), the smallest output we can get is 3. This is a key property that will help us determine the amplitude of our function if we are considering trigonometric functions. 3. **Condition ③**: f(x) is a function with a period of 2. This tells us that the function repeats its values every 2 units along the x-axis. For trigonometric functions like sine and cosine, their standard period is 2pi. To adjust this to a period of 2, we can use a coefficient in the argument of the trigonometric function that modifies its period accordingly. Given these conditions, we can construct a function that meets all the criteria. A trigonometric function, specifically a cosine function, is a good choice because it is even and can be easily adjusted to have a minimum value of 3 and a period of 2. The general form of a cosine function is Acos(B(x - C)) + D, where: - A is the amplitude, - B adjusts the period, - C shifts the graph horizontally, and - D shifts the graph vertically. To meet condition ②, we set the vertical shift to 3, making the minimum value of the function 3. To satisfy condition ③, we adjust the period to 2 by setting B = pi, because the period of a cosine function is frac{2pi}{B}, and setting B = pi makes the period frac{2pi}{pi} = 2. We don't need to shift the graph horizontally or vertically beyond what's already specified, so we can simplify our function to f(x) = 3cos(pi x). This function is symmetric about x = -1 when considering its periodic nature and the fact that cosine is an even function, thus satisfying condition ①.

Our task is to determine if it's possible for all resulting triangles to be isosceles after several operations of cutting one of the existing triangles along its median into two triangles. Let's break down the solution step-by-step: 1. **Initial State**: We are starting with a given acute-angled, scalene triangle ( triangle ABC ). 2. **Cutting Operation**: The operation allowed is to cut any given triangle along its median. A median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. 3. **Right Triangle and Isosceles Consideration**: Initially, ( triangle ABC ) is neither isosceles nor a right triangle. This is given by the problem's statement: it is an acute-angled scalene triangle. 4. **Median Properties**: The key insight lies in the properties of the median: - Since ( triangle ABC ) is scalene, no side lengths and angles are equal. - Cutting along a median will create two new triangles. But because the original was scalene, the median is not an altitude or angle bisector unless in special configurations which are not generic in scalene cases. 5. **Obtuse Angle Formation**: Consider the step where we cut along the median ( BM ) of ( triangle ABC ), forming two triangles ( triangle ABM ) and ( triangle CBM ). - Because ( B neq text{M} ) (where M is the midpoint of side ( AC )), - The triangle ( triangle ABM ) will be such that angle ( angle AMB ) will be obtuse since ( BM ) is not a perpendicular bisector. 6. **Properties of New Triangles**: For each new triangle formed: - ( angle AMB ) is obtuse, making ( triangle ABM ) an obtuse-angled (and hence not a right-angled triangle). - ( triangle ABM ) will inherit the property of being scalene from ( triangle ABC ). 7. **Iterative Verification**: - Repeating this process, each new obtuse triangle created will continue to be scalene. Cutting any new triangle along hence median preserves the property of having at least one obtuse angle, reinforcing that no triangle can become isosceles by successive median cuts. - Thus, due to the continuous creation of obtuse angles and the scalene nature of consecutive triangle subdivisions, no isosceles triangle will ever appear in the sequence. **Conclusion**: Therefore, no matter how many steps or operations are performed, there will always be a non-isosceles non-right triangle among the resulting figures.

This problem can be approached using graph theory, where cities are represented as vertices and roads as edges.

Since ( G ) is connected, it has a spanning tree ( T ) (a subgraph that includes all vertices and is a tree). - In a tree, every vertex except the leaves has an even degree. However, we need all vertices to have an odd degree. 5. **Adding Edges to Form Odd Degrees**: - To achieve this, we can add edges to the spanning tree ( T ) to form a new subgraph ( H ) where each vertex has an odd degree. - One way to ensure each vertex has an odd degree is to add a perfect matching to the spanning tree. A perfect matching is a set of edges such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the matching. 6. **Existence of Perfect Matching**: - By Hall's Marriage Theorem, a perfect matching exists in a bipartite graph if and only if for every subset ( S ) of one part, the neighborhood of ( S ) in the other part is at least as large as ( S ). - Since we are dealing with a connected graph with an even number of vertices (100), we can always find a perfect matching. 7. **Conclusion**: - By adding the edges of a perfect matching to the spanning tree, we ensure that each vertex has an odd degree. - Therefore, it is possible to repair some of the roads (select some edges) such that each city (vertex) has an odd number of repaired roads (edges).

(The notation leftlfloor x rightrfloor denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.) 1. **Understanding sqrt{2008} and sqrt{2009}**: Let a_1 = sqrt{2008} and a_2 = sqrt{2009}. We know that both a_1 and a_2 are irrational numbers because they are the square roots of non-square integers.

We need to consider the binary representation (after the decimal point) of 2^n a_1 and 2^n a_2 to determine if their sums are odd or even. 4. **Decimal Part Analysis**: For large n, the binary (base-2) decimal expansions of 2^n a_1 and 2^n a_2 are crucial. Since a_1 and a_2 are irrational, their infinite decimal parts in binary are non-repeating and non-terminating. The decimal part affects leftlfloor 2^n a_1 rightrfloor and leftlfloor 2^n a_2 rightrfloor such that: - If the fractional parts of 2^n a_1 and 2^n a_2 are such that their sum is slightly less than 2, then leftlfloor 2^n a_1 rightrfloor + leftlfloor 2^n a_2 rightrfloor will be exact one less than the sum of their integer parts. Hence, the parity will switch. 5. **Conclusion**: - If there existed a finite segment {f_{n} = text{even}} for all subsequent n, this implies the fractional parts of 2^n a_1 and 2^n a_2 after a certain n must align perfectly making the sequence a repeating pattern. This is impossible because a_1 and a_2 are irrational and their binary representations are non-repeating. - Similarly, an infinite sequence {f_{n} = text{odd}} would also imply repeating patterns after some n, which again contradicts the irrational nature of a_1 and a_2.

Let us proceed with a step-by-step proof. 1. **Showing 4 as a Descendant**: If N ends in 4, according to rule (b), removing 4 makes N have no required further transformations. However, since 0 is not a natural number, we interpret our goal as demonstrating that from any natural number, one can ultimately transform it into the descendants of 4 systematically. 2. **Reduction to Smaller Descendants**: We'll show every natural number N has a smaller descendant by reducing N through the transformation rules. This transformation, when applied finitely many times, will ultimately reduce N. 3. **Examples of Different Cases**: - **Case 1: Last digit is 0**: If N ends in 0, applying rule (a) directly reduces N by removing the last digit. - **Case 2: Last digit is 4**: If N ends in 4, applying rule (b) directly reduces N by removing the last digit. - **Case 3: Last digit neither 0 nor 4**: If N ends in any other digit, apply rule (c). We will show finite steps lead to an ending digit of 0 or 4, simplifying to Case 1 or 2. 4. **Transformations and Their Effects**: - **For last digit 5, 7, or 2**: Suppose N = d*10 + k where k in {5, 7, 2}. - Multiplying by 2, the new number has its last digit: - 5 rightarrow 10 Rightarrow last digit 0, - 7 rightarrow 14 Rightarrow last digit 4, - 2 rightarrow 4 Rightarrow last digit 4. These last digits follow the rules to immediate reduction. - **Other Endings**: - Ending 1 or 6: - 1 rightarrow 2 rightarrow 4, - 6 rightarrow 12 rightarrow 4. Both reduce to 0 or 4 in steps. - Ending 3 or 8: - 3 rightarrow 6 rightarrow 12 rightarrow 4 - 8 rightarrow 16 rightarrow 32 rightarrow 64 rightarrow 4. All reduce to 0 or 4 within finite steps. 5. **Special Case for 9 Ending**: - To handle ending with 9: - Example: N = 19 [ 19 rightarrow 38 rightarrow 76 rightarrow 152 rightarrow 304 rightarrow 610 ] By transforming through doubling, apply rule (c) repeatedly until last digit reduces to 0 or 4. 6. **Conclusion on Reduction**: We observe every ending will undergo finite transformation steps, leading naturally to a descendant 0 or 4, where recursive application continues further reduction as needed. Since applying these rules consistently demonstrates reducing any natural number to 4 logically, we see the 4 as inevitably a descendant through transformations of all natural numbers.

Points (B) and (C) are on the circle such that (AB = BC = frac{r}{2}) and (A neq C). 2. **Objective**: Find the ratio (frac{CD}{r}). 3. **Step 1**: Determine the angle (angle BAC). - Since (AB = BC = frac{r}{2}), triangle (ABC) is isosceles with (AB = BC). - Let (angle BAC = angle BCA = x). - Since (AD) is the diameter, (angle BDA = angle BDC = 90^circ) (angles subtended by the diameter in a semicircle are right angles). 4. **Step 2**: Use the sine rule in (triangle ABD). - (sin x = sin angle BDA = frac{AB}{AD} = frac{frac{r}{2}}{2r} = frac{1}{4}). 5. **Step 3**: Apply Ptolemy's theorem to cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD). - Ptolemy's theorem states: (AB cdot CD + AD cdot BC = AC cdot BD). - Given (AB = BC = frac{r}{2}) and (AD = 2r), we need to find (CD). 6. **Step 4**: Express (CD) in terms of (r). - Let (CD = lambda r). - Using Ptolemy's theorem: (frac{r}{2} cdot lambda r + 2r cdot frac{r}{2} = AC cdot BD). - Simplify: (frac{r^2 lambda}{2} + r^2 = AC cdot BD). 7. **Step 5**: Find (AC) and (BD). - Since (angle BAC = x) and (sin x = frac{1}{4}), we use the double angle formula for sine: (sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x). - (cos x = sqrt{1 - sin^2 x} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{1}{4}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{15}{16}} = frac{sqrt{15}}{4}). - (sin 2x = 2 cdot frac{1}{4} cdot frac{sqrt{15}}{4} = frac{sqrt{15}}{8}). 8. **Step 6**: Use the cosine rule to find (AC). - (AC = 2r cos x). - (cos x = frac{sqrt{15}}{4}), so (AC = 2r cdot frac{sqrt{15}}{4} = frac{r sqrt{15}}{2}). 9. **Step 7**: Substitute back into Ptolemy's theorem. - (frac{r^2 lambda}{2} + r^2 = frac{r sqrt{15}}{2} cdot BD). - Since (BD = 2r cos x = 2r cdot frac{sqrt{15}}{4} = frac{r sqrt{15}}{2}), we have: - (frac{r^2 lambda}{2} + r^2 = frac{r sqrt{15}}{2} cdot frac{r sqrt{15}}{2} = frac{15r^2}{4}). 10. **Step 8**: Solve for (lambda). - (frac{r^2 lambda}{2} + r^2 = frac{15r^2}{4}). - Multiply through by 4: (2r^2 lambda + 4r^2 = 15r^2). - (2r^2 lambda = 11r^2). - (lambda = frac{11}{2}). 11. **Step 9**: Find the ratio (frac{CD}{r}). - (frac{CD}{r} = lambda = frac{11}{2}).

For option C, since gamma and beta are perpendicular to the same plane alpha, the intersection line of gamma and beta must be perpendicular to alpha, which is correct. For option D, if alpha parallel beta and m parallel alpha, then m parallel beta or m subset beta, which is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is boxed{text{D}}.

The goal is to determine for what kind of ( n > 3 ), it can be ensured that among any three squares aligned along a diagonal line, at least two are painted black. We will use a detailed case-by-case analysis: 1. **Consider ( n = 3k ) where ( k ) is a positive integer:** - In this case, assume all squares in rows and columns, whose numbers modulo 3 equals 2, are painted black. - For instance, for ( n = 6 ), the squares ((2,i)), ((i,2)), ((5,i)), and ((i,5)) for ( i = 1,2, ldots, 6 ) are black. It can be observed that a knight starting from ( L ) and moving to ( R ) cannot avoid these black squares without ending its path on a black square. However, for any three aligned along a diagonal path, at most only one is necessarily painted black. Therefore, this configuration does not guarantee that our required condition is satisfied. 2. **Consider ( n = 3k + 2 ) where ( k ) is a positive integer:** - Analogously, all rows and columns which are multiples of 3 could be painted black. Here, too, a knight cannot move from ( L ) to ( R ) without crossing a black square. - Again, the condition of at least two out of any three aligned along a diagonal being black is not forcibly met. 3. **Now consider ( n = 3k + 1 ) where ( k ) is a positive integer:** - Here, for simplicity, take ( k = 1 ). Thus, ( n = 4 ). Consider the specific squares ((2,3)) and ((3,2)). If either is not black, a path without stepping on a black square from ( L rightarrow R ) could be found, which contradicts the given constraints. Thus, both ((2,3)) and ((3,2)) must be painted black. 4. **General for ( k > 1 ):** - Use induction or iterative logic: - Assume for smaller ( k ), the condition holds as per configurations already proven. - For larger ( k ), consider squares ((a,b)) and ((a', b')) where ( (a, b) ) represents any square and ((a', b') = (a+3k-3, b+3k-3)) is just the relative position on a larger board. - If none or only one out of ((a,b)) and ((a', b')) is black, movement without hitting a black square is possible, contradicting the constraints. Thus, ensuring our squares on the diagonal are marked black as ( 3k+1 )-pattern will force at least two out of any three diagonal squares to be black based on the configuration layout. # Conclusion: This specific condition of having at least two of any three aligned diagonally black squares holds for: [ n = 3k + 1 ] where ( k ) is a positive integer.

The function f(x) is increasing on the interval (1,+infty). Therefore, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval (1,+infty) and decreasing on the interval (0,1). (2)(i) When 0 < a < 1, according to (1), f(x) is decreasing on [a,1) and increasing on (1,+infty). Therefore, for any xin[a,+infty), we have f(x)geqslant f(1)=-a.

There seems to be a mistake in the information provided. If the team played a total of 75 games, then all of these games are part of the \\"first 100 games\\" since 75 is less than 100. Therefore, we can calculate the number of games won out of the 75 games using the 65% win rate for the first 100 games. Number of games won in the first 75 games = 65% of 75 = 0.65 * 75 = 48.75 Since a team cannot win a fraction of a game, we would round this to the nearest whole number. However, since we are looking for the percentage of games won, we can keep it as a decimal for now. To find the percentage of games won for the entire season (which is just the 75 games in this case), we divide the number of games won by the total number of games played and multiply by 100.

Let ( B_2 ) be the number of blue points and ( G_2 ) be the number of green points in this interval. 3. **Initial conditions:** - Since the total number of points in each interval is ( 3n ), we have: [ B_1 + G_1 = 3n quad text{and} quad B_2 + G_2 = 3n ] - Also, since the total number of blue points is ( 4n ) and the total number of green points is ( 2n ), we have: [ B_1 + B_2 leq 4n quad text{and} quad G_1 + G_2 leq 2n ] 4. **Intermediate value theorem application:** - If the interval covering the leftmost ( 3n ) points has fewer than ( 2n ) blue points (( B_1 < 2n )), then the interval covering the rightmost ( 3n ) points must have more than ( 2n ) blue points (( B_2 > 2n )). - Conversely, if the interval covering the leftmost ( 3n ) points has more than ( 2n ) blue points (( B_1 > 2n )), then the interval covering the rightmost ( 3n ) points must have fewer than ( 2n ) blue points (( B_2 < 2n )). 5. **Transition between intervals:** - As we move the interval from the leftmost ( 3n ) points to the rightmost ( 3n ) points, we do this by incrementing point-by-point. This means we remove one point from the left end of the interval and add one point to the right end of the interval. - During this transition, the number of blue points in the interval will change by at most 1 for each step. 6. **Existence of the desired interval:** - By the discrete intermediate value theorem, as we transition from an interval with fewer than ( 2n ) blue points to an interval with more than ( 2n ) blue points, there must be some intermediate interval where the number of blue points is exactly ( 2n ). - In this interval, since the total number of points is ( 3n ), the number of green points must be ( 3n - 2n = n ). Therefore, there exists a line segment that contains exactly ( 3n ) points from ( S ), with ( 2n ) of them being blue and ( n ) of them being green.

This implies x neq kpi for any integer k. Therefore, the domain is symmetric about the origin, as it excludes integer multiples of pi from both positive and negative sides of the x-axis. 2. **Transformation to a simpler function**: Let sin x = t. This gives us y = f(x) = t + frac{1}{t}, where t in [-1, 0) cup (0, 1]. This transformation helps in analyzing the function without directly dealing with the trigonometric form. 3. **Analysis of the function's value**: From the properties of reciprocal functions, we know that for t + frac{1}{t}, the value of y is either y geq 2 or y leq -2. This directly contradicts option A, which claims the minimum value of f(x) is 2. 4. **Symmetry about the y-axis**: Considering f(-x) = sin(-x) + frac{1}{sin(-x)} = -sin x - frac{1}{sin x} = -f(x), we see that f(x) is an odd function. This implies the graph is symmetric about the origin, not the y-axis, making option B incorrect. 5. **Symmetry about the line x = pi**: We evaluate f(pi + x) and f(pi - x): - f(pi + x) = sin(pi + x) + frac{1}{sin(pi + x)} = -sin x - frac{1}{sin x} - f(pi - x) = sin(pi - x) + frac{1}{sin(pi - x)} = sin x + frac{1}{sin x} Since f(pi + x) neq f(pi - x), the graph is not symmetric about the line x = pi, making option C incorrect. 6. **Symmetry about the line x = frac{pi}{2}**: We evaluate fleft(frac{pi}{2} + xright) and fleft(frac{pi}{2} - xright): - fleft(frac{pi}{2} + xright) = sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + xright) + frac{1}{sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + xright)} = cos x + frac{1}{cos x} - fleft(frac{pi}{2} - xright) = sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - xright) + frac{1}{sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - xright)} = cos x + frac{1}{cos x} Since fleft(frac{pi}{2} + xright) = fleft(frac{pi}{2} - xright), the graph is symmetric about the line x = frac{pi}{2}, making option D correct.

The problem states that any selection of 85 trees will necessarily contain all four types of trees. 2. **Analyze Minimum Requirements**: First, consider if we assume there are no more than 15 trees of one type, say birches. Then, the remaining 100 - 15 = 85 trees must contain all four tree types, according to the problem statement. This would form a contradiction if there were less than 15 birches, implying that there must be at least 16 birches. This logic applies symmetrically to the other types of trees (spruces, pines, aspens). 3. **Illustrate General Conclusion**: Every type of tree (birches, spruces, pines, aspens) must be represented by at least 16 trees. So, in any subset of 85 trees, each type definitely appears. 4. **Bound the Calculation for Three Types**: Now, let’s determine the least number such that among any 69 chosen trees, there are always at least three different types of trees. 5. **Consider Contradiction Approach**: Assume the chosen subset of 69 trees contains only two types of trees. Then, at least 100 - 69 = 31 trees are not part of this subset. These 31 trees must include at least 16 trees of each of the remaining two types.

To demonstrate that ( f ) is injective, we will assume that ( f(a) = f(b) ) for some ( a, b in mathbb{R} ). 3.

Define another function h(x) = -ln x + x - 1, with x geqslant 2. 6. The derivative of h(x) is: [h'(x) = -frac{1}{x} + 1 = frac{-1 + x}{x}] 7. Setting h'(x) = 0 to find critical points, we get x = 1. 8. Analyzing h'(x), we find that h(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, 1) and monotonically increasing on (1, +infty). Therefore, h(x) reaches its minimum at x = 1, which is h(1) = 0. 9. Since h(x) geqslant 0 for x geqslant 2, it follows that g'(x) geqslant 0 on (2, +infty), meaning g(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval. 10. The minimum value of g(x) on [2, +infty) is thus g(2) = 2ln 2. 11. Therefore, we conclude that a leqslant 2ln 2 for the given condition to hold. 12.

Firstly, recall that an affine transformation is uniquely determined by the images of the vertices of any fixed triangle. This follows directly from the properties of affine transformations. (Refer to problem 29.6(b) for a detailed explanation). 2. Therefore, to prove that any affine transformation can be represented as the composition of two stretches and an affine transformation mapping any triangle to a similar triangle, it suffices to show that we can transform any arbitrary triangle into a particular type of triangle using two stretches. 3. Let ( triangle ABC ) be an arbitrary triangle. Consider the angle bisector of the exterior angle at vertex ( B ), adjoining side ( BC ), denoted as ( BN ). 4. We perform a stretch transformation with respect to line ( BN ) with a coefficient ( frac{tan 45^circ}{tan angle CBN} ). This stretch will transform the triangle ( triangle ABC ) into a new triangle ( triangle A'B'C' ) such that ( B' ) forms a right angle. 5. Now we have ( triangle A'B'C' ) as a right triangle with ( angle B' = 90^circ ). 6. Perform another stretch transformation with respect to one of the legs of the right triangle; this can always convert any right triangle into an isosceles right triangle. 7. Therefore, starting from ( triangle ABC ), using two stretches, we can obtain a triangle ( triangle A''B''C'' ) which is an isosceles right triangle. 8. Since any isosceles right triangle can be transformed to any other isosceles right triangle using a similarity transformation, we have essentially shown that any triangle can be transformed to a similar triangle using two stretches and a similarity transformation. 9.

Define ( t_j = (x_j + 1)/2 ). 4. **Construct the polynomial ( Q_n(t) ):** The polynomial ( Q_n(t) = 2^{-2n+1} T_n(2t-1) ) has leading coefficient 1 and oscillates at the ( n+1 ) points ( t_j ). Thus, the polynomial ( R(t) = t^n - Q_n(t) ) is of degree ( n-1 ) and oscillates around ( t^n ) at ({t_j mid j=0,1,ldots,n} ). 5. **Apply Chebyshev equioscillation theorem:** By the Chebyshev equioscillation theorem, ( R(t) ) is the best possible uniform approximation on ([0,1]) of ( t^n ) with polynomials of degree at most ( n-1 ). The error of approximation is ( E_{n-1}(x^n)_{[0,1]} = 2^{-2n+1} ). 6. **Consider a specific function ( f(x) = x^n ):** If we take ( c_n = 1 ) and ( c_m = 0 ) for ( m > n ), we get that the required (inf) is less than or equal to ( 2^{-2n+1} ). 7. **Prove the exact value of the infimum:** We will prove that the infimum is exactly ( 2^{-2n+1} ) and is attained when ( f(x) = x^n ). 8. **Establish a lower bound for ( E_{n-1}(x^m)_{[0,1]} ):** We need to show that ( E_{n-1}(x^m)_{[0,1]} ge 2^{-2n+1} ) for all ( m > n ). Moreover, there exists a polynomial ( P^{(m)} ) of degree ( n-1 ) which equioscillates around ( x^m ) at the points ( t_j ) with error (at these points) greater than ( 2^{-2n+1} ). 9. **Interpolate ( x^m ) with polynomial ( L ):** Interpolate ( x^m ) with a polynomial ( L ) of degree ( n ) at the points ( t_j ), i.e., ( L(t_j) = t_j^m ) for ( j=0,ldots,n ). Denote by ( a ) the leading coefficient of ( L ) and consider the polynomial ( P^{(m)} = L(t) - a Q_n(t) ). 10. **Analyze the polynomial ( P^{(m)} ):** This polynomial is of degree at most ( n-1 ) and equioscillates around ( t^m ), i.e., ( t^m - P^{(m)}(t) ) is alternatively (pm a) at the points ( t = t_j ). 11. **Prove that ( |a| > 1 ):** By Newton interpolation representation, ( a = t^m[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] ), where the last term means the divided difference of the function ( t^m ) at the points ( (t_j) ). We know that ( x^n[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] = 1 ). 12. **Use the Leibniz rule:** Using the Leibniz rule: [ (f cdot g)[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] = f[t_0] cdot g[t_0,ldots,t_n] + f[t_0,t_1] cdot g[t_1,ldots,t_n] + ldots + f[t_0,ldots,t_n] g[t_n] ] and plugging ( g(t) = t ) and ( f(t) = t^n ), we get: [ t^{n+1}[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] = t^n[t_1,t_2,cdots,t_n] > 1 ] 13. **Conclude the inequality:** The last inequality follows from the fact that: [ 1 = t^n[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] = frac{t^n[t_1,ldots,t_n] - t^n[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_{n-1}]}{t_n - t_0} = t^n[t_1,ldots,t_n] - t^n[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_{n-1}] ] and also ( t^n[t_0,ldots,t_{n-1}] = (t^n)^{(n-1)}(xi)/(n-1)! > 0 ), here ( xi in (t_0,t_{n-1}) ). 14. **Generalize for ( m > n ):** In the same way, it follows consecutively that ( t^m[t_0,t_1,ldots,t_n] > 1 ) for all ( m > n ). 15. **Consider a general function ( f = sum_{k=n}^m c_k x^k ):** Consider the polynomial ( sum_{j=n}^m c_j P^{(j)}(t) ), where ( P^{(j)} ) is as above. It is of degree at most ( n-1 ) and oscillates around ( f ) at the points ( t_0, t_1, ldots, t_n ) with error (at these points) ( sum_{j=n}^m c_j text{err}_j ), where ( text{err}_n = 2^{-2n+1} ) and ( text{err}_j > 2^{-2n+1} ) for ( j > n ). 16. **Conclude the infimum:** Hence, if some ( c_j > 0 ) for ( j > n ), we can make the error more than ( 2^{-2n+1} ). According to the Chebyshev equioscillation theorem, ( E_{n-1}(f)_{[0,1]} ge 2^{-2n+1} ). The rest are some routine continuity arguments.

Each player scores at least one goal, and together they score a total of 47 goals. The highest number of goals by a single player is 12. 2. **Assume every player scores differently**: Suppose each of the 9 players scored a different number of goals. Let G_1, G_2, ldots, G_9 represent the number of goals scored by the players, where G_9 = 12 is the highest number of goals. 3. **Identify the distribution**: According to our assumption, let each player score an integer number of goals, and every player scores differently. Hence, the other 8 players scored: [ G_1, G_2, ldots, G_8 ] where ( G_1 < G_2 < ldots < G_8 ). 4. **Sum of goals excluding the top scorer**: If the top scorer scored G_9 = 12, then the sum of the goals scored by the other 8 players should be: [ 47 - 12 = 35 ] 5. **Minimum possible sum for different goals**: The minimum sum of the first 8 positive integers (smallest different set) is: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 8 ] Using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, (sum_{i=1}^n i = frac{n(n+1)}{2}): [ sum_{i=1}^8 i = frac{8(8+1)}{2} = frac{8 times 9}{2} = 36 ] 6. **Contradiction**: We've assumed that all players scored a different number of goals. Yet, the smallest possible sum of the 8 different scores is 36, which is greater than 35. This means the scenario where every player scores a different number of goals leads to a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, it is impossible for all 9 players to have scored a different number of goals. This implies that at least two players must have scored the same number of goals. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Freddy is calling his family on New Year's Eve.

Specifically, we want to find (55^{55} + 15) mod 8. First, let's find the remainder when 55^{55} is divided by 8. To do this, we only need to consider the last digit of the base, which is 5, because the previous digits won't affect the remainder when divided by 8. Now, we know that: 5^1 equiv 5 mod 8, 5^2 equiv 25 equiv 1 mod 8. Since 5^2 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 8, and powers of 5^2 (which are even powers of 5) will follow this cycle, we can conclude that any even power of 5 will have a remainder of 1 when divided by 8. Since 55 is an odd number, we look at the cycle of odd powers of 5: 5^3 equiv 125 equiv 5 mod 8, 5^5 equiv (5^2 cdot 5^3) equiv (1 cdot 5) equiv 5 mod 8. Thus, any odd power of 5 will have the same remainder as 5^1 when divided by 8, which is 5. Therefore, 55^{55} equiv 5^{55} equiv 5 mod 8. Now, consider the 15 in the numerator separately: 15 equiv 7 mod 8.

Solving this, we find (2cos A - 1)(cos A + 1) = 0, which gives us cos A = frac{1}{2} (the solution cos A = -2 is discarded as it is not possible for a cosine value). Since 0 < A < pi, this means A = frac{pi}{3}. (2) According to the given conditions, S = frac{1}{2}bcsin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}bc = 5sqrt{3}. This implies that bc = 20. Given that b = 5, we find c = 4.

The distance from the origin to this line is frac{ab}{2} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot sqrt{a^2+b^2}. By solving the system of equations, we get a = sqrt{3} and b = 1. Thus, the equation of the ellipse is boxed{frac{x^2}{3} + y^2 = 1}. (2) Let the equation of EF be x = my - 1 (m > 0). Substituting into the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{3} + y^2 = 1 gives (m^2+3)y^2 - 2my - 2 = 0. Let the coordinates of E and F be (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), respectively. Because overrightarrow{ED} = 2overrightarrow{DF}, we have y_1 = -2y_2. From the relationships y_1 + y_2 = frac{2m}{m^2+3} and y_1y_2 = frac{-2}{m^2+3}, we find that left(-frac{2m}{m^2+3}right)^2 = frac{1}{m^2+3}.

Let (k) be the number of black points in the first row. By reordering the columns if necessary, we can assume that these (k) black points are located at (P_{11}, P_{12}, ldots, P_{1k}). Due to the balancing condition for (P_{11}), the first column must also have exactly (k) black points.

The speed of the train is given as 72 km/hr. We need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the other units given in the problem (the platform length is in meters and the time is in seconds). We know that: 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, to convert 72 km/hr into meters per second: 72 km/hr * (1000 meters / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 72 * 1000 / 3600 = 20 meters/second Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can calculate the distance covered by the train while crossing the platform.

To completely fit inside the rectangle, the circle must have its center no closer than 0.5 units from any edge (radius equals 0.5 units). 2. **Adjust the rectangular area available for circle placement:** If we imagine cutting strips of width 0.5 units from each side of the original rectangle, we get a smaller rectangle within which the center of any placed circle must lie. The dimensions of this new inner rectangle are: (20 - 2 times 0.5) times (25 - 2 times 0.5) = 19 times 24 3. **Calculate the area of the new inner rectangle:** The area of this new, reduced rectangle is: 19 times 24 = 456 text{ square units} 4. **Calculate area prerequisites for each square and its buffer for circle placement:** Each 1×1 square, to ensure the placed circle does not overlap, must include an additional buffer of 0.5 units on all sides, equating to a total envelope around each small square. The effective area covered by each square and its buffer zone is: 1 + 4 times left(frac{1}{2}right) + frac{pi}{4} = 1 + 2 + frac{pi}{4} = 3 + frac{pi}{4} This formula accounts for the square area itself, the four rectangular strips surrounding it and a quarter circle piece at each corner. 5. **Calculate the total area occupied by the buffered squares:** The total area required to ensure the 120 squares and their respective buffers do not intersect (overlap) other squares or the potential placement area of the circle is: 120 left( 3 + frac{pi}{4} right) 6. **Compare the total buffered area to ensure it fits in the available space in the rectangle:** To finalize our proof, we need to ensure the total buffered area is indeed less than the inner rectangle area: [ 120 left( 3 + frac{pi}{4} right) < 120 times frac{12 + 3.2}{4} = 30 times 15.2 = 456 ] Performing the actual comparison: [ 120 left( 3 + frac{pi}{4} right) approx 120 left( 3 + 0.785 right) = 120 times 3.785 = 454.2 < 456 ] 7. **Conclusion:** Since the total occupied space of the 120 squares and their buffers (454.2) is less than the available inner rectangle space (456 square units), there is still sufficient space left over to place a circle with a diameter of 1 unit without overlapping any of the 120 1×1 squares.

[ S = ldots ABCD(E)BCD(F) ldots ] - Here, the segments in parentheses are determined by the previous blocks, leading to periodicity. 8. **Conclusion:** - Hence, the sequence must be eventually periodic given that having n+1 distinct (n+1)-blocks either results in a deterministic sequence or fewer than (n+1) distinct n-blocks, concluding according to the induction hypothesis. Therefore, the sequence is eventually periodic. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"When two numbers are added, the result is 26. If one of the numbers is 11, what is the other number?

We need to find out the possible values of t. 2. **Setting Up the Equation**: According to the problem, the length of the secant segment divided into two segments of lengths m and n satisfies the equation: [ t^2 = m cdot n ] 3. **Using the Circumference**: Since m and n form the circumference of the circle: [ m + n = 10 ] Thus, we can express n in terms of m: [ n = 10 - m ] 4. **Substitute and Solve**: Substitute n into the equation for t: [ t^2 = m(10 - m) ] Therefore: [ t = sqrt{m(10 - m)} ] 5. **Testing Integer Values of m**: - For (m = 1): [ t = sqrt{1 cdot (10 - 1)} = sqrt{9} = 3 ] - For (m = 2): [ t = sqrt{2 cdot (10 - 2)} = sqrt{16} = 4 ] - For (m = 3): [ t = sqrt{3 cdot (10 - 3)} = sqrt{21} ] Since (sqrt{21}) is not an integer, (t) is not a valid integer. - For (m = 4): [ t = sqrt{4 cdot (10 - 4)} = sqrt{24} ] Since (sqrt{24}) is not an integer, (t) is not a valid integer. - For (m = 5): [ t = sqrt{5 cdot (10 - 5)} = sqrt{25} = 5 ] However, since (m) must equal (n), and it is implied that m and n should be distinct (non-equal), so, (m = 5) is not valid. - For (m = 6): [ t = sqrt{6 cdot (10 - 6)} = sqrt{24} ] Since (sqrt{24}) is not an integer, (t) is not a valid integer. - For (m = 7): [ t = sqrt{7 cdot (10 - 7)} = sqrt{21} ] Since (sqrt{21}) is not an integer, (t) is not a valid integer. - For (m = 8): [ t = sqrt{8 cdot (10 - 8)} = sqrt{16} = 4 ] - For (m = 9): [ t = sqrt{9 cdot (10 - 9)} = sqrt{9} = 3 ] 6. **Conclusion**: From the computations, valid integer values of (t) occur at (m = 1) and (m = 9) for (t = 3), and (m = 2) and (m = 8) for (t = 4).

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert 20 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60. So, the time to ride his bike to work is ( frac{20}{60} ) minutes per block, which simplifies to ( frac{1}{3} ) minutes per block. The time to ride his bike to work is therefore ( frac{1}{3}x ) minutes. According to the problem, it takes him exactly 12 minutes more to walk to work than to ride his bike to work. We can set up the following equation: Walking time = Biking time + 12 minutes ( x = frac{1}{3}x + 12 ) To solve for x, we need to get all the x terms on one side of the equation: ( x - frac{1}{3}x = 12 ) To combine like terms, we need a common denominator, which is 3 in this case: ( frac{3}{3}x - frac{1}{3}x = 12 ) ( frac{2}{3}x = 12 ) Now, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of ( frac{2}{3} ), which is ( frac{3}{2} ), to solve for x: ( x = 12 times frac{3}{2} ) ( x = 18 ) Therefore, Youseff lives boxed{18} blocks from his office."},{"prompt":"A vehicle is driven 12 miles on Monday, some miles on Tuesday, and 21 miles on Wednesday.

What is the exponent of the first number?","completion":"To find the units digit of a number raised to a certain power, we can look at the pattern of the units digits as the power increases. For the number 35, the units digit is 5. Any number ending in 5 raised to any power will always have a units digit of 5 because 5^1 = 5, 5^2 = 25, 5^3 = 125, and so on. So the units digit of 35 raised to any power will always be 5. For the number 93, we need to look at the pattern of the units digit as the power increases. The units digit of 93 is 3, and the pattern for the powers of 3 is as follows: - 3^1 = 3 (units digit is 3) - 3^2 = 9 (units digit is 9) - 3^3 = 27 (units digit is 7) - 3^4 = 81 (units digit is 1) - 3^5 = 243 (units digit is 3) - ... The pattern of the units digit for powers of 3 repeats every 4 powers: 3, 9, 7, 1. So to find the units digit of 93 raised to the 45th power, we can find the remainder when 45 is divided by 4, because the pattern repeats every 4 powers. 45 ÷ 4 = 11 remainder 1 This means that the units digit of 93^45 will be the same as the units digit of 3^1, which is 3. Now we have the units digit of 35 raised to a certain power (which is 5) and the units digit of 93^45 (which is 3). We want the sum of these two units digits to be 8. 5 (from 35 raised to any power) + 3 (from 93^45) = 8 Since the units digit of 35 raised to any power is always 5, and we have already determined that the units digit of 93^45 is boxed{3,} the sum is already 8. Therefore, the exponent of the first number (35 raised to a certain power) can be any positive integer, because the units digit will always be 5, and when added to 3 (from 93^45), the sum will be 8."},{"prompt":"Cyclic quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle k with center O .

Given that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, we know that opposite angles sum to 180^circ.

By the properties of angle bisectors in a circle, angle BKM = angle BDM and angle CLN = angle CDN. 3. **Parallel Lines:** Given that KL parallel MN, we can use this to establish that the angles angle BKL and angle BMN are equal. This is because corresponding angles formed by a transversal with parallel lines are equal. Therefore, angle BKL = angle BMN. 4. **Tangent Lines:** From the angle chasing, we have: [ angle BKL = angle BMN = angle BMC + angle CMN = angle BDC + angle DBN = angle BLC ] This implies that DC is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle AKL. Similarly, DA is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle AKL. 5. **Homothety:** Consider the homothety centered at D that maps K to M and L to N. This homothety also maps AD to the tangent at M to k, say ell_M, and CD to the tangent at N to k, say ell_N. Since AD cap CD = D, the tangents ell_M and ell_N intersect on BD. 6. **Symmedian:** The intersection of the tangents ell_M and ell_N on BD implies that BD is a symmedian in triangle BMN.

Our goal is to show that there exists a rational number ( r ) such that both ( (s_i - s_j) r ) and ( frac{(t_i - t_j)}{r} ) are integers for all ( i ) and ( j ). Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initial Observation**: We first address a trivial edge case. **Claim**: For some indices ( i ) and ( j ), we have ( (s_i - s_j)(t_i - t_j) neq 0 ). **Proof**: Assume the contrary, that for all ( i, j ), ( (s_i - s_j)(t_i - t_j) = 0 ). - If ( s_1 neq s_2 ), then we must have ( t_1 = t_2 ). - Now choose an index ( i ) such that ( t_i neq t_1 = t_2 ). This implies either ( t_i - s_1 neq 0 ) or ( t_i - s_2 neq 0 ), both cases leading to a contradiction. Therefore, it must be that ( (s_i - s_j)(t_i - t_j) neq 0 ) for some ( i, j ). 2. **Assumption without Loss of Generality**: By permuting the sequences, we can assume: [ n = (s_1 - s_2)(t_1 - t_2) neq 0. ] We can further assume by shifting and scaling appropriately that: [ s_1 = t_1 = 0, quad s_2 = 1, quad t_2 = n. ] 3. **Integer Properties Deduction**: We deduce the following properties: [ s_i t_i in mathbb{Z}, quad s_i t_j + s_j t_i in mathbb{Z} quad forall i, j. ] **Claim**: For any index ( i ), it holds that ( t_i in mathbb{Z} ) and ( s_i in frac{1}{n}mathbb{Z} ). **Proof**: - Given ( s_i t_i in mathbb{Z} ) and ( t_i + n s_i in mathbb{Z} ) by the problem condition. - By looking at the ( p )-adic valuation ( nu_p ): - We find that both ( n s_i ) and ( t_i ) must be integers. If either had a negative ( p )-adic value, the product ( s_i t_i ) would no longer be an integer. 4. **Greatest Common Divisor Argument**: **Claim**: If ( d = gcd(t_1, t_2, t_3, ldots) ), then ( d s_i in mathbb{Z} ) for all ( i ). **Proof**: - Consider a prime ( p ) dividing ( n ), and let ( e = nu_p(t_j) ). - We aim to show that ( nu_p(s_i) geq -e ) for any ( i ). This is straightforward for ( i = j ), so assume ( i neq j ) and for contradiction, suppose ( nu_p(s_i) < -e ). - This implies ( nu_p(t_i) > e = nu_p(t_k) ). - As ( nu_p(s_k) geq -e ), thus ( nu_p(s_i t_k) < nu_p(s_k t_i) ). - Therefore, ( nu_p(s_i t_k) geq 0 ), implying ( nu_p(s_i) geq -e ) as needed.

When both pipes are opened together, they fill the cistern at a rate of (1/12 + 1/15) per minute. To find a common denominator, we can use 60 (the least common multiple of 12 and 15): 1/12 = 5/60 1/15 = 4/60 So together, they fill (5/60 + 4/60) = 9/60 of the cistern per minute, which simplifies to 3/20.

Prove that these chords are diameters.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given that three equal chords pass through a single point inside a circle. The task is to prove that these chords are diameters of the circle. 2. **Represent the Circle and Chords**: Let the circle be centered at ( O ) with radius ( R ). Let ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) be the points where each of these three equal chords intersects the circumference of the circle, and ( P ) the common point through which all the chords pass. 3. **Properties of Chords**: Recall that a chord is a segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, and the longest chord of a circle is its diameter. 4. **Symmetry Argument**: Since the chords are equal and symmetrical, let’s denote the length of each chord as ( d ). 5. **Use Diameter Properties**: A key property of a circle is that the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of the circle. Given that all chords are equal and pass through ( P ), the perpendicular bisectors of these chords will coincide at point ( P ). 6. **Determine Chord Length**: Because the chords are equal and pass through point ( P ) within the circle, ( P ) should be equidistant from the points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) where each chord touches the circle. 7. **Consider Chords Intersection at ( P )**: Since ( P ) is the point of intersection and is not the center, we can state that the chords split into segments such that they make an isosceles triangle in the circle. To further elaborate: 8. **Angle Properties**: For a chord to be diameter, the angle subtended by it at the circumference must be ( 90^circ ). Here, since all equal chords intersect at ( P ), the angles formed at ( P ) between any two chords should be equal, hence ( 120^circ) each (sum of angles in a circle being ( 360^circ)). 9. **Visualization**: Because all equal chords cross at point ( P ) and need to form identical angles of ( 120^circ) between each pair, the only way they retain their equal properties and balancing center symmetry is if they are diameters. 10. **Chords being Diameters**: We conclude that since each chord passes through the center ( O ) with ( P ) being on the line of symmetry, each chord splits the circle into two equal halves and thus must be diameters. # Conclusion: The three equal chords in the circle that intersect at point ( P ) are indeed diameters of the circle.

Applying these to our equation gives: [ -sin left(3pi -alpha right)=2cos left(4pi -alpha right), ] because sin is an odd function and cos is an even function. 2. Since sin left(pi - xright) = sin(x) for any angle x, and knowing that cos(x) = cos(-x), we can simplify the equation to: [ -sin left(pi -alpha right)=2cos left(-alpha right). ] 3. Recalling that sin(pi - x) = sin(x), we further simplify the equation to: [ sin(alpha) = -2cos(alpha). ] This gives a relation between sin(alpha) and cos(alpha). Knowing that cos(alpha) neq 0 to avoid division by zero, we substitute sin(alpha) and cos(alpha) in the given expression: [ frac{{sin({pi-alpha})+5cos({2pi-alpha})}}{{2sin({frac{{3pi}}{2}-alpha})-sin({-alpha})}} = frac{sin(alpha) + 5cos(alpha)}{-2cos(alpha) + sin(alpha)} ] Simplifying the fraction: [ = frac{3cos(alpha)}{-4cos(alpha)} = -frac{3}{4}. ] Thus, the value is boxed{-frac{3}{4}}. Part (2) Given sin x + cos x = frac{1}{5}, we square both sides and use sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1: 1. Squaring both sides gives: [ sin^2 x + 2sin xcos x + cos^2 x = frac{1}{25}. ] 2. Since sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1, the equation simplifies to: [ 1 + 2sin xcos x = frac{1}{25}. ] 3. Rearranging for 2sin xcos x: [ 2sin xcos x = frac{1}{25} - 1 = -frac{24}{25}. ] With -frac{pi}{2} < x < 0, we know sin x < 0 and cos x > 0. Therefore, sin x - cos x is negative, and we use the negative square root: [ sin x - cos x = -sqrt{(sin x - cos x)^2} = -sqrt{1 - 2sin xcos x} = -sqrt{1 + frac{24}{25}} = -sqrt{frac{49}{25}} = -frac{7}{5}. ] So, the value is boxed{-frac{7}{5}}."},{"prompt":"Given the set A={x|x^2+2x+1=0}={a}, find the proper subset of the set B={x|x^2+ax=0}.","completion":"According to the problem, we first find the root of the equation x^2+2x+1=0 to determine the value of a, and then we can determine the set B.

This question tests the representation of sets, the concept of subsets, and enumeration is the method to solve this type of problem, which is basic. To solve the given equation x^2+2x+1=0, we find that it can be rewritten as (x+1)^2=0, which means x=-1. Therefore, a=-1. Substituting a=-1 into the equation for set B, we get x^2-x=0, or x(x-1)=0. Thus, the elements of set B are 0 and 1. The proper subsets of set B are emptyset, {0}, and {1}.

At the center of each face of the cube is a number equal to the product of the numbers at the vertices of that face. Can the sum of the resulting 14 numbers be equal to 0?","completion":"1. Let us define the vertices of the cube and assign the numbers (+1) or (-1) to each vertex. 2. Each face of the cube has four vertices and is thus associated with a number equal to the product of the numbers at its vertices. 3. Since the cube has 6 faces, we need to examine these products to determine if their sum can be zero. First, let's consider the product of the numbers at the vertices of one face. Each face of the cube is a quadrilateral formed by 4 vertices, denoted as (a), (b), (c), and (d). The number assigned to the center of this face is (abcd). 4. For the cube, there are a total of 14 unique centers to consider: - 8 centers from the faces. - 6 centers from the pairs of opposite faces. We need to check whether the sum of all these values can be zero. 5. The product of all numbers assigned to the vertices can be calculated. Since each vertex number is either +1 or -1, the product of all the vertex numbers of the cube (total 8 vertices) is ((+1)^a cdot (-1)^b cdot (+1)^ccdot ldots cdot (-1)^{h}). 6. Consider the initial analysis of the behavior of signs: - Due to symmetry of a cube, any configuration that has an equal number of +1's and -1's will return an even number of (-1) values, and thus will not affect the signs essentially changing the result to positive. 7. When each edge center involves a product as + or -, the overall product must again maintain balance to zero net-product summations. 8. If the quantity of +1 and -1 are balanced equally for the surface computations to 14 derivatives, mapping each association on the face-level summarization, it inherently confirms: [ left| sum_{i=1}^{14} product_i (+1, -1)right| ] The product of all 14 face-related numbers relates as ( (+1 text{ or } -1 )^4 ), given they are in higher orders maintaining total group values symmetry. 9. Any summation proving zero requires minus one forms derived themselves equalizing the format to 7 negatives and 7 positives inherently. 10. Due to symmetry in cube configurations, creating such balance forming equal 7 and 7 across cannot directly prove aligning zero summation contradicting structure forms. # Conclusion: Thus it cannot meet an exact configuration returning; - The product of all vertex numbers is inherently positive. - The sum of products of vertices for 14 configurations cannot logically equal zero integrating cube symmetries.

Let A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2) be the coordinates of the intersection points. Since line segment AB is the diameter of circle C, its midpoint must be the center of the circle (2,1).

Since frac{x_1^2}{2b^2} + frac{y_1^2}{b^2} = 1 and frac{x_2^2}{2b^2} + frac{y_2^2}{b^2} = 1, by subtracting these two equations, we obtain (x_1+x_2)(x_1-x_2) + 2(y_1+y_2)(y_1-y_2) = 0.

The remaining pages that need to be typed are P - 3P/5 = 2P/5. Jack's typing rate is 2/5 of John's rate, so Jack types at a rate of (2/5) * (P/5) = 2P/25 pages per hour. To find out how long it will take Jack to type the remaining 2P/5 pages at his rate of 2P/25 pages per hour, we can set up the following equation: Time = Work / Rate Let T be the time it takes for Jack to type the remaining pages. Then: T = (2P/5) / (2P/25) To solve for T, we can simplify the equation: T = (2P/5) * (25/2P) The P's cancel out, and we are left with: T = (2/5) * (25/2) T = 25/5 T = 5 hours So, it will take Jack boxed{5} hours to type the remaining pages alone."},{"prompt":"A train of a certain length can cross an electric pole in 200 sec, and its speed is 18 km/h.
