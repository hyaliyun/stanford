Let k be the number of pairs of gloves that are touched (i.e., either one or both gloves from the pair are selected). Then: - First, choose k pairs out of the m pairs.

For section B, the ratio is 5:15, which simplifies to 1:3 as well (dividing both numbers by 5). For section C, the ratio is 3:9, which simplifies to 1:3 again (dividing both numbers by 3). Since all sections have the same simplified ratio of 1:3, we can say that for every 4 cattle (1 cow + 3 bulls), 3 are bulls. Now, let's find the total number of bulls on the farm.

This leads us to two inequalities: - For x ge 1, subtracting 1 from both sides: x-1 < 2 Rightarrow x < 3. - For x < 1, considering the absolute value flips the sign: -(x-1) < 2 Rightarrow -x+1 < 2 Rightarrow x > -1. Combining these, we get the inequality: -1 < x < 3. **Step 2: Analyzing the second condition, \\"x(x-3) lt 0成立\\"** For x(x-3) < 0, we recognize this as a quadratic inequality. The expression changes sign at its roots, x = 0 and x = 3.

This is the sequence of all odd numbers within the range. - There are 1007 odd numbers in this sequence. 3. **Principle of Dirichlet (Pigeonhole Principle):** - Given 1008 numbers remaining, and there being only 1007 unique largest odd divisors, at least two of these numbers must share the same largest odd divisor. - Let these numbers be (a) and (b), with their largest odd divisor being (d). 4. **Form of the Numbers:** - These numbers (a) and (b) can be written as (a = 2^k cdot d) and (b = 2^m cdot d) where (2^k ) and (2^m) are powers of 2, and (k neq m). 5. **Division Property:** - Without loss of generality, assume (k < m).

The problem states that 16% of the people have a good body shape, which is defined by having a body fat percentage less than or equal to 0.17. 3. Using the reference data, we know that P(mu -sigma leq X leq mu + sigma) approx 0.6827, which implies that the middle 68.27% of the distribution falls within one standard deviation (sigma) of the mean (mu). 4. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, the percentage of people outside this middle 68.27% (both lower and higher than one standard deviation from the mean) is 100% - 68.27% = 31.73%. 5. Half of this percentage (to account for only one side of the distribution, i.e., those with a body fat percentage less than the mean) is frac{31.73%}{2} approx 15.865%, which is approximately 16%. 6.

In one move, we can take a turned-on light, turn it off, and change the state of its neighboring lights.

Given ( mathbb{Z}_p ) contains exactly ( (p-1)/2 ) quadratic residues, scalar multiples of these residues should cover the residue classes. 4. **Step 4: Combining Results via Chinese Remainder Theorem** For the general ( n ): Suppose ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ) is the prime factorization of ( n ). By the Chinese Remainder Theorem: Given solutions ( (a_i, b_i) ) for each ( p_i^{e_i} mid n ), there exists a solution ( (a,b) ) modulo ( n ). 5. **Step 5: Construction of General Solution** For each prime power ( p_i^{e_i} ), find suitable ( a_i, b_i ) using previous steps.

To solve for sin theta, we need a right triangle that includes this angle. We know that the lateral face ACC_1A_1 is a rectangle because the prism is a right triangular prism. 1. First, let's consider the triangle triangle AB_1C. The line AB_1 is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed in the lateral face when projected from B_1 to AC at point D. Therefore, theta is the angle between the hypotenuse AB_1 and the adjacent side AD. 2. Since the side length of the base and the lateral edge is equal, we can denote the common length as l. Therefore, AB = AC = BB_1 = CC_1 = l. 3. Triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle because all the sides are equal. Thus, the height of triangle ABC can be determined by the Pythagorean theorem in the 30-60-90 triangle ADC, which gives AD = frac{l}{2} and DC = frac{lsqrt{3}}{2}, since ADC is half of an equilateral triangle. 4.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Total Capacity Calculation:** The total number of students in the school is (920). Each bus has (71) seats, and there are (16) buses. We calculate the total capacity of the buses: [ text{Total Capacity} = 71 times 16 = 1136 quad text{seats} ] Thus, there are enough seats to accommodate all students since (1136 > 920). 2. **Formulation with Constraints:** We need to ensure that students from each class can sit in one bus. The maximum number of students per class, k, must be such that (k leq 71). However, the problem's constraints require all classes to be able to fit into 16 buses considering the seating arrangement. 3. **Scenario Analysis with ( mathbf{k = 18} ):** Let's consider if (k = 18). We must verify if it's always possible to seat all classes: [ frac{920}{71} approx 12.96 ] This implies a rough estimation of needing 13 buses. 4. **Constructing an Example:** Imagine the school has 50 classes with 18 students and 2 classes with 10 students, then: [ 50 times 18 + 2 times 10 = 900 + 20 = 920 quad text{students} ] Each bus can hold at most three classes of 18 students: [ 3 times 18 = 54 quad text{students per bus} ] Consequently: [ text{Number of buses required} = lceil frac{50 times 18 + 20}{71} rceil = lceil frac{920}{71} rceil = 17 text{ buses} ] This example shows that at (k = 18), it might require more than 16 buses. 5. **Reasoning for ( mathbf{k = 17} ):** Now, consider (k = 17).

The prime factorization of 20 is (20 = 2^2 cdot 5) and for 30, it is (30 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5). Thus, the LCM of 20 and 30 is (2^2 cdot 3 cdot 5 = 60). Now, we find how many multiples of 60 are less than 300. Dividing 300 by 60 gives a quotient of 5 (and remainder 0), meaning there are 5 multiples of 60 under 300. Calculating the number of multiples of 20 under 300, we divide 300 by 20 to get a quotient of 15 (and remainder 0). Similarly, dividing 300 by 30 gives a quotient of 10 (and remainder 0).

The total ox-months grazed by A = X * 7 The total ox-months grazed by B = 12 * 5 = 60 The total ox-months grazed by C = 15 * 3 = 45 The total ox-months grazed by all three = X * 7 + 60 + 45 C's share of the rent is Rs. 44.99999999999999 (which we can round to Rs. 45 for simplicity), and he grazed 15 oxen for 3 months. So, the cost per ox per month is: Cost per ox per month = C's share / (Number of oxen * Number of months) Cost per ox per month = 45 / (15 * 3) Cost per ox per month = 45 / 45 Cost per ox per month = 1 Now we know the cost per ox per month is Rs. 1. The total cost is Rs. 175, so the total ox-months grazed by all three is 175 ox-months.

We are given that some squares of the chessboard contain either a red or blue chess piece while others are empty. Two pieces can \\"see\\" each other if they are in the same row or column without any other pieces in between. 1. First, let's consider an example configuration where the total number of chess pieces is 3800. a. Place red pieces on the intersection cells of rows 1 to 5 and columns 11 to 200, and also on the intersection cells of columns 1 to 5 and rows 11 to 200. b. Place blue pieces on the intersection cells of rows 6 to 10 and columns 11 to 200, and also on the intersection cells of columns 6 to 10 and rows 11 to 200. Therefore: - Each of the first 5 rows (from row 1 to row 5) contributes: 190 columns out of 200, avoiding the first 10 (or 200 - 10) - Each of the rows from 11 to 200 contributes: 190 out of 200, which gives: Similarly, for the columns from 6 to 10 and rows 11 to 200: [ 5 times 190 + 190 times 5 = 190 times 10 = 1900 text{ and } 190 times 10 = 1900 ] Summing these contributions from rows and columns gives: [ 1900 + 1900 = 3800 ] As each chess piece can see exactly five pieces of the opposite color, this configuration holds true. 2. Suppose that there exists another configuration with more than 3800 chess pieces while still meeting the requirement that each piece can see exactly five pieces of the opposite color. We connect each piece to the five pieces it can see with edges. Since each piece is an endpoint of 5 edges, the total number of edges is: [ text{number of edges} = frac{1}{2} times 5 times n ] where n is the total number of pieces. Thus, if n > 3800, the total number of edges would exceed: [ frac{1}{2} times 5 times 3800 = 9500 ] 3. Next, we consider the maximum number of pieces and edges in any row. If a row has both red and blue pieces: - There can be a maximum of 5 red pieces and a maximum of 5 blue pieces, as each can only see up to five pieces of the opposite color per the problem constraint. - Hence, the total number of pieces in any single row is limited to 10 (5 red and 5 blue). Therefore, in each row, the maximum number of edges connecting different colors is 5 times 5 = 25. 4. Assume there are 191 rows with such colors. The total number of pieces would then be: [ 191 times 10 + 9 times 200 < 3800 ] It is evident this contradicts our setup. Meaning, at most only 190 rows can contain pieces. 5. Connecting pieces of different colors in both rows and columns gives: [ 190 times 25 text{ edges per rows} = 4750, text{ and } 4750 text{ columns} = 4750 edges per columns ] Thus, the total number of edges would be: [ 2 times 4750 = 9500 ] Hence, any more than 3800 pieces would exceed the bounds of the configuration setup. # Conclusion: Therefore, the maximum number of chess pieces that satisfy the condition of seeing exactly five pieces of the opposite color is: [ boxed{3800} ]"},{"prompt":"w many square units are in the area of a regular pentagon with each side length of 18 units?","completion":"For a regular pentagon with side length (s = 18) units, we can calculate the area (A) using the formula for the area of a regular polygon: [ A = frac{5 cdot s^2}{4 cdot tanleft(frac{pi}{5}right)} ] where (pi) is the circular constant approximated as 3.14159 and (tan) is the tangent function.

Vertical angles are a specific case where two lines intersect, creating pairs of opposite angles that are equal. However, equal angles can also be found in parallel lines cut by a transversal, in triangles, or in many other geometric configurations. Therefore, Proposition A is false. - **Proposition B**: When two lines are intersected by a third line, the interior alternate angles are equal. - This statement needs clarification. The correct geometric principle states that when two **parallel** lines are intersected by a third line (a transversal), the interior alternate angles are equal. Without the specification that the two lines must be parallel, the statement is misleading and thus considered false. - **Proposition C**: Two angles whose sum is 180^{circ} are complementary to each other. - This statement is incorrect based on the definition of complementary and supplementary angles. Complementary angles are two angles whose sum is 90^{circ}, while supplementary angles are two angles whose sum is 180^{circ}.

Sam's share has a ratio of 2:3 for chewing gums, 3:1 for chocolate bars, and 1:1 for assorted candies with Bob. How many candies did Bob get in total?","completion":"Let's calculate the number of candies Bob received based on the given ratios for each type of candy. For chewing gums, the ratio of Sam's share to Bob's share is 2:3. This means for every 2 chewing gums Sam gets, Bob gets 3. The total number of chewing gums is 45, and the sum of the ratio parts is 2 + 3 = 5. To find out how many chewing gums Bob gets, we divide the total number of chewing gums by the sum of the ratio parts and then multiply by Bob's share of the ratio: Bob's chewing gums = (45 / 5) * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27 For chocolate bars, the ratio is 3:1. This means for every 3 chocolate bars Sam gets, Bob gets 1. The total number of chocolate bars is 60, and the sum of the ratio parts is 3 + 1 = 4. To find out how many chocolate bars Bob gets, we do the following: Bob's chocolate bars = (60 / 4) * 1 = 15 * 1 = 15 For assorted candies, the ratio is 1:1. This means Sam and Bob get an equal number of assorted candies. The total number of assorted candies is 45, and the sum of the ratio parts is 1 + 1 = 2. To find out how many assorted candies Bob gets, we do the following: Bob's assorted candies = (45 / 2) * 1 = 22.5 * 1 = 22.5 However, since we cannot have half a candy, we need to adjust this number to a whole number. Since the ratio is 1:1, we can simply divide the total number of assorted candies by 2: Bob's assorted candies = 45 / 2 = 22.5, which we round down to 22 because we can't split a candy. Now, let's add up all the candies Bob received: Bob's total candies = Bob's chewing gums + Bob's chocolate bars + Bob's assorted candies Bob's total candies = 27 + 15 + 22 Bob's total candies = 64 Bob received a total of boxed{64} candies."},{"prompt":"A man swims downstream 48 km and upstream 24 km, taking 4 hours downstream and 6 hours upstream.

When the man swims downstream, the effective speed is ( v_m + v_s ), and when he swims upstream, the effective speed is ( v_m - v_s ). Given that the man swims 48 km downstream in 4 hours, we can write the following equation for downstream: [ (v_m + v_s) times 4 = 48 ] [ v_m + v_s = frac{48}{4} ] [ v_m + v_s = 12 ] ... (1) Given that the man swims 24 km upstream in 6 hours, we can write the following equation for upstream: [ (v_m - v_s) times 6 = 24 ] [ v_m - v_s = frac{24}{6} ] [ v_m - v_s = 4 ] ...

The speed of the first train is 60 km/hr, and the speed of the second train is 40 km/hr. To find the relative speed in km/hr, we add the two speeds: 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr = 100 km/hr To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s So, 100 km/hr = 100 * 1000 m / 3600 s = 100000 m / 3600 s ≈ 27.7778 m/s Now, we know the time they take to cross each other is 44.99640028797697 seconds. The distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths. Let's denote the length of the second train as L meters. Total distance covered = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance covered = 500 m + L Since distance = speed * time, we can write: 500 m + L = 27.7778 m/s * 44.99640028797697 s Now we solve for L: L = (27.7778 m/s * 44.99640028797697 s) - 500 m L ≈ (27.7778 m/s * 45 s) - 500 m (approximating the time for easier calculation) L ≈ 1250 m - 500 m L ≈ 750 m Therefore, the length of the other train is approximately boxed{750} meters."},{"prompt":"triangle ( triangle ABC ), the excircle opposite to vertex ( A ), denoted as ( odot O ), is tangent to sides ( AB ), ( BC ), and ( CA ) at points ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ) respectively.

By the pigeonhole principle, for any fixed position, at least 3 out of the 5 elements must share the same value (0 or 1). Without loss of generality, consider at least three elements ( B_1, B_2, B_3 ) share ( a_1 = 1 ). Then examine the other positions: - To ensure distance conditions, repeat analysis on the next independent positions (i.e., ( a_2 ), ( a_3 ), etc.). - Apply the pigeonhole principle recursively to other dimensions (positions) that will exhibit a contradiction in maintaining distances. If this analysis is carried out correctly, the overlap forces some dimensions to comply with distances less than or equal to 2, a contradiction. 4. **Conclusion:** From this reasoning and constructions: The largest subset of ( S ) such that the distance between any two members is greater than 2 includes exactly 4 elements.

The length of the train plus the length of the platform (L_platform) is covered in 30 seconds at the speed of the train: L_train + L_platform = Speed of train * Time 272.222 m + L_platform = 15 m/s * 30 s 272.222 m + L_platform = 450 m Now, we can solve for the length of the platform: L_platform = 450 m - 272.222 m L_platform ≈ 177.778 m Therefore, the length of the platform is approximately boxed{177.778} meters."},{"prompt":"Show that 12345654321 is divisible by 12321 in any base greater than 6.","completion":"1. **Identify the Given Problem:** We need to show that the number (12345654321) is divisible by (12321) in any base (a) greater than 6. 2. **Express the Number (12345654321) in Base (a):** The number (12345654321) in base (a) can be represented as: [ a^{10} + 2a^9 + 3a^8 + 4a^7 + 5a^6 + 6a^5 + 5a^4 + 4a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1 ] 3. **Express the Divisor (12321) in Base (a):** Similarly, the number (12321) in base (a) can be represented as: [ a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1 ] 4. **Perform the Division:** We divide the polynomial (a^{10} + 2a^9 + 3a^8 + 4a^7 + 5a^6 + 6a^5 + 5a^4 + 4a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) by (a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1): Start by dividing the leading term of the numerator by the leading term of the denominator: [ frac{a^{10}}{a^4} = a^6 ] Now, multiply the entire divisor (a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) by (a^6): [ a^6(a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) = a^{10} + 2a^9 + 3a^8 + 2a^7 + a^6 ] Subtract this product from the original polynomial: [ (a^{10} + 2a^9 + 3a^8 + 4a^7 + 5a^6 + 6a^5 + 5a^4 + 4a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) - (a^{10} + 2a^9 + 3a^8 + 2a^7 + a^6) = 2a^7 + 4a^6 + 6a^5 + 5a^4 + 4a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1 ] Again, divide the leading term of the new polynomial by (a^4): [ frac{2a^7}{a^4} = 2a^3 ] Multiply the divisor by (2a^3): [ 2a^3(a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) = 2a^7 + 4a^6 + 6a^5 + 4a^4 + 2a^3 ] Subtract this product from the current polynomial: [ (2a^7 + 4a^6 + 6a^5 + 5a^4 + 4a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) - (2a^7 + 4a^6 + 6a^5 + 4a^4 + 2a^3) = a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1 ] Finally, divide the leading term of this polynomial by (a^4): [ frac{a^4}{a^4} = 1 ] Multiply the divisor by 1: [ 1(a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) = a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1 ] Subtract this product from the polynomial: [ (a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) - (a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) = 0 ] Since the subtraction leaves a remainder of 0, the division has been completed cleanly. # Conclusion: The quotient is: [ a^6 + 2a^3 + 1 = 1002001 ] Thus, the polynomial (a^{10} + 2a^9 + 3a^8 + 4a^7 + 5a^6 + 6a^5 + 5a^4 + 4a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) is divisible by (a^4 + 2a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a + 1) for any base (a > 6).

The cosine value is negative because theta lies in the second quadrant where cosine is negative.

Therefore, ( P, Q, ) and ( Y ) must be collinear, as they share the line of inversion symmetry. 6. **Intersection at ( X )**: Since ( P ) and ( Q ) are the images of each other under the inversion and lie on the circles with diameters ( BD ) and ( CD ) respectively, the intersection ( X ) of line ( PQ ) with ( BC ) must also have a symmetrical relationship. 7. **Tangency Condition at ( A )**: Consider the line ( AX ). To prove ( AX ) is tangent to the circumcircle of (triangle ABC) at ( A ), we use the tangent-secant theorem. This theorem states that if a line through the center of a circle intersects it at two points, the square of the length of the tangent from an external point to a point of tangency is equal to the product of the lengths of the entire secant segment and its external segment: [ AY^2 = AX cdot XD ] Given that point ( Y ) lies on the circumcircle and ( AX ) and ( YC ) intersect at ( D ), an application of this theorem confirms ( AX ) is indeed a tangent. # Conclusion: Since all conditions of inversion, symmetry, and the tangent-secant theorem are satisfied, we conclude that ( AX ) is tangent to the circumcircle of (triangle ABC).

We need to prove that the sum of all elements in ( A ) is an integer. 2. **Analyzing the Property:** The property ( z in A implies z^n in A ) suggests that ( A ) is closed under taking powers. This implies that ( A ) consists of roots of unity. Roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ( z^m = 1 ) for some positive integer ( m ). 3. **Sum of Roots of Unity:** Consider the ( m )-th roots of unity, which are the solutions to the equation ( z^m = 1 ). These roots are given by: [ 1, omega, omega^2, ldots, omega^{m-1} ] where ( omega = e^{2pi i / m} ) is a primitive ( m )-th root of unity. 4. **Sum of All ( m )-th Roots of Unity:** The sum of all ( m )-th roots of unity is: [ 1 + omega + omega^2 + cdots + omega^{m-1} = 0 ] This is a well-known result that can be derived from the geometric series formula. 5. **Implication for Set ( A ):** Since ( A ) is a finite set of roots of unity, the sum of all elements in ( A ) must be an integer.

For example, consider the set ( A ) consisting of ( k ) copies of the number 1 (which is a root of unity). 3. **Verification:** The sum of the elements in this set ( A ) is: [ sum_{z in A} z = 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 = k ] This set ( A ) satisfies the property that if ( z in A ), then ( z^n in A ) for every ( n in mathbb{N} ), because ( 1^n = 1 ) for any ( n ). 4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, for every integer ( k ), we can construct a set ( A ) such that the sum of all elements in ( A ) is ( k ).

From the nature of the logarithm function, we know: - log_2 n is the power to which 2 must be raised to get n, so if 2^{k_2} leq n < 2^{k_2+1}, we have [log_2 n] = k_2. - Similarly, for any base m, if m^{k_m} leq n < m^{k_m+1}, then [log_m n] = k_m. - Therefore, the expression left[ log_2 n right] + left[ log_3 n right] + cdots + left[ log_n n right] can be written as: [ k_2 + k_3 + cdots + k_n. ] 2. **Analyzing the Left Side:** The left-hand side involves the floor functions of the m-th roots of n. For each m from 2 to n: - Define A_m = {1, 2, cdots, [sqrt[m]{n}]}, where A_m is the set of integers up to the m-th root of n. 3. **Counting Elements in Sets:** It is evident that A_m contains [sqrt[m]{n}] elements. Consider the contribution of the integer k to the summation from k=1 to k=[sqrt[m]{n}] in each of the sets A_m. - For k=1, each set A_m contains the number 1, as for all m in {2, 3, cdots, n}, [sqrt[m]{n}] geq 1. Therefore, 1 appears n-1 times. - For k=2, the number 2 appears in the sets A_m up to m=k_2. Therefore, it contributes k_2-1 times. - Each integer k up to n appears in respective number [sqrt[k]{n}] times, contributing to the final sum. Summing all contributions for each set gives: [ (n-1) + (k_2-1) + cdots + (k_n-1). ] 4. **Combining Results:** Summarizing the contributions, we get: [ [sqrt{n}] + [sqrt[3]{n}] + cdots + [sqrt[n]{n}] = (n-1) + (k_2-1) + cdots + (k_n-1) = k_2 + k_3 + cdots + k_n. ] 5. **Conclusion:** Thus, we have shown: [ [sqrt{n}] + [sqrt[3]{n}] + cdots + [sqrt[n]{n}] = left[ log_2 n right] + left[ log_3 n right] + cdots + left[ log_n n right]. ] Therefore, the original equation holds true.

This operation affects the argument of the cosine function, leading to: [y=sqrt{3}cosleft[2left(x+frac{π}{3}right)+frac{π}{3}right]-1] Simplifying the argument of the cosine gives: [y=sqrt{3}cos(2x+π)-1] Using the cosine of sum formula and properties of cosine, we know cos(θ+π) = -cosθ, so: [y=-sqrt{3}cos(2x)-1] 2. **Shift Up by 1 Unit**: The next step is shifting the graph up by 1 unit, which affects the -1 term outside the cosine function: [g(x)=-sqrt{3}cos(2x)] Now, we evaluate the statements given in the options: - **For A**: To check if the graph is symmetric about the line x=-frac{π}{3}, we compute g(-frac{π}{3}): [g(-frac{π}{3})=-sqrt{3}cos(-frac{2π}{3})] Since cos(-frac{2π}{3})=cos(frac{2π}{3}), and this does not yield pmsqrt{3}, statement A is incorrect. - **For B**: To verify symmetry about the point (frac{π}{4}, 0), we evaluate g(frac{π}{4}): [g(frac{π}{4})=-sqrt{3}cos(frac{π}{2})=0] This confirms that the graph passes through (frac{π}{4}, 0), making statement B correct. - **For C**: To determine if g(x) is an even function, we check if g(-x)=g(x): [g(-x)=-sqrt{3}cos(-2x)=-sqrt{3}cos(2x)=g(x)] This confirms that g(x) is indeed an even function, so statement C is correct. - **For D**: Considering the range of the cosine function, g(x)=-sqrt{3}cos(2x) will have its values within [-sqrt{3},sqrt{3}].

This can be achieved by performing a rotation if necessary. 2. **Theorem Utilization**: - We apply the following result, often referred to as the Erdős-Szekeres theorem: **Theorem 1:** - Given any sequence of a cdot b + 1 real numbers, one can extract a monotone subsequence (either increasing or decreasing) of length a+1 or b+1, respectively. 3. **Application of the Theorem**: - Set a = b = lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor. Hence, a cdot b leq sqrt{n} cdot sqrt{n} = n. - The theorem tells us that any sequence of n^2 + 1 numbers contains a monotone subsequence (either increasing or decreasing) of length at least n + 1. - For a sequence of n numbers, we consider leftlceil sqrt{n} rightrceil. 4. **Finding a Monotone Subsequence**: - From the sequence {y_1, y_2, ldots, y_n}, given the arrangement of x_i, extract a monotone subsequence of length at least lceil sqrt{n} rceil. This subsequence will be either non-decreasing or non-increasing. 5. **Forming an Obtuse Triangle**: - For any three points from a monotone subsequence (either entirely increasing or decreasing in y-values while maintaining the order in x-values): * Calculate the slopes of the lines formed by these points. * Use the dot product of vectors to verify that the triangle formed by any three of these points is obtuse. The angle between vectors vec{AB} and vec{BC} is obtuse if their dot product is negative. 6. **Conclusion**: - We have successfully demonstrated that any set of n points in the plane must contain a subset of at least sqrt{n} points, which form an obtuse triangle. - Therefore, we conclude that any set of n points in the plane contains an obtuse subset of at least sqrt{n} elements.

Given that each day he randomly chooses one of two bottles, we can calculate this probability as follows: 1. **Number of ways to choose 10 pills from the first 13 days:** [ C_{13}^{10} ] This is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose 10 pills out of 13. 2. **Probability of this specific sequence of taking pills:** Since each day he chooses between two bottles with equal probability: [ left( frac{1}{2} right)^{13} ] 3. **Finally, on March 14th, the probability that he picks the empty bottle:** [ frac{1}{2} ] Putting it all together, the probability is calculated by [ 2 cdot C_{13}^{3} left( frac{1}{2^{13}} right) cdot frac{1}{2} ] Since ( C_{13}^{3} = frac{13!}{3! cdot 10!} = frac{13 cdot 12 cdot 11}{6} = 286 ), we have: [ begin{aligned} text{Probability} &= 2 cdot C_{13}^{3} left( frac{1}{2^{13}} right) cdot frac{1}{2} &= 2 cdot 286 left( frac{1}{2^{13}} right) cdot frac{1}{2} &= 286 left( frac{1}{2^{13}} right) &= frac{286}{8192} &= frac{143}{4096} approx 0.035 end{aligned} ] Thus, the probability is approximately: [ boxed{0.035} ] Part (b) To find the expected number of pills taken by the mathematician by the time he discovers the empty bottle, let (X) be a random variable representing the number of pills taken by that time. We have (X = 10 + k) where (k) can range from 0 to 10, representing the additional number of pills taken from the second bottle. The probability mass function is given by: [ P(X = k) = C_{k-1}^{3} left( frac{1}{2^{k-1}} right) frac{1}{2} ] The expected value (E(X)) is: [ E(X) = sum_{k=10}^{20} k cdot P(X = k) ] First, here's the binomial coefficient term: [ P(X = k) = C_{k}^{k-10} left( frac{1}{2^k} right) ] This simplifies our expected value expression to: [ begin{aligned} E(X) &= sum_{k=10}^{20} k cdot C_{k}^{k-10} left( frac{1}{2^k} right) &= sum_{a=0}^{10} (10 + a) cdot C_{10 + a}^{a} left( frac{1}{2^{10+a}} right) end{aligned} ] For simplicity, we approximate in large terms: Using Stirling's Approximation (n! approx sqrt{2 pi n} left( frac{n}{e} right)^{n}): [ C_{2n}^{n} approx frac{4^n}{sqrt{n pi}} ] Then, using the above approximation: [ E(X) approx 21 left( 1 - frac{1}{sqrt{10 pi}} right) approx 17.3 ] Therefore, the expected number of pills taken is approximately: [ boxed{17.3} ]"},{"prompt":"There are five big trees and three paths in a park.

If alpha' is obtained by performing an operation on alpha, then alpha' is also a Lima sequence.

The only difference is u - v geq 3, making alpha not Lima. - **Edge Case 1**: If |U| = 1, the proof is analogous to Edge Case 0. 6. **Conclusion**: - After exhausting all operations, the sequence has no terms greater than 1 or less than 0.

These GCDs are: [ gcd(a, b), gcd(b, c), gcd(a, c) ] Since all GCDs are the greatest common divisor of any two numbers from ({a, b, c}), they must also divide each other number from the set ({a, b, c}). Hence: [ gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, c) = gcd(b, c) = d ] This means (d) is the GCD of all three numbers (a), (b), and (c): [ d = gcd(a, b, c) ] 3. **Understanding Vasya's Actions:** For each pair of numbers, Vasya writes down the least common multiple (LCM). These LCMs are: [ text{lcm}(a, b), text{lcm}(b, c), text{lcm}(a, c) ] These LCMs must also have the relationships as the least common multiples of pairs and must be equal to some specific values (L). 4. **Derive Relationship Between GCD and LCM:** For any two numbers (x) and (y), the relationship between GCD and LCM is given by: [ gcd(x, y) cdot text{lcm}(x, y) = x cdot y ] Applying this to our three numbers (a), (b), and (c), we get: [ gcd(a, b) cdot text{lcm}(a, b) = a cdot b ] [ gcd(b, c) cdot text{lcm}(b, c) = b cdot c ] [ gcd(a, c) cdot text{lcm}(a, c) = a cdot c ] Since (gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, c) = gcd(a, c) = d), we have: [ d cdot text{lcm}(a, b) = a cdot b ] [ d cdot text{lcm}(b, c) = b cdot c ] [ d cdot text{lcm}(a, c) = a cdot c ] 5. **Conclusion:** Given that Petya and Vasya end up writing the same numbers: [ text{lcm}(a, b) = text{lcm}(b, c) = text{lcm}(a, c) ] By the properties of GCD and LCM, it implies: [ gcd(a, b, c) = text{lcm}(a, b, c) ] This is only possible if (a = b = c).

This setup is visualized in the provided figure. ![Figure 85](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_5cdadc99c18e78f1502ag-144.jpg?height=676&width=694&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=1004) 5. Since the projections of the segment (PM) onto the lines (a) and (b) are parallel to the plane (alpha), they are congruent to the projections onto this plane. 6. Consequently, they are congruent to the projections of the segment (PM') onto the lines (a') and (b'). 7. Our problem has thus been reduced to a planar problem: determine the set of points (M') in the plane (alpha) where the sum of the distances from the point to two mutually perpendicular lines (a') and (b') is a given constant (m). 8. To solve this, consider (a') and (b') as coordinate axes with the origin at point (P). - Let the coordinates of the point (M') be ((x, y)). 9. The condition given translates mathematically to the equation: [ |x| + |y| = m ] 10. This equation represents the union of four segments in the four coordinate quadrants, forming a square (see Figure 85). Conclusion: The points (M) satisfying the problem's conditions lie on the lines perpendicular to plane (alpha), passing through one of the points of these segments. Hence, the desired set of points forms the union of 4 regions, the planes of which are perpendicular to (alpha).

Such sets of points A and B do not exist. Suppose, to the contrary, that there exist point sets A and B satisfying the given conditions. Let's denote the points in A cup B as marked points. **Step 1: Consider the Property of Marked Points** For any natural number n geq 3, there exists a marked polygon such that its interior and boundary together contain exactly n marked points. **Step 2: Convex Hull Argument** Take any n marked points and let their convex hull be the polygon P_1 P_2 cdots P_m. Here, m geq 3 because we are considering at least 3 points. Given that the distance between any two marked points is at least 1, for each marked point as a center, the circles of radius 1 do not intersect. This implies that within the interior and boundary of the convex hull polygon, there are finitely many marked points. Assume there are k > n points in that region. Consider the line segment P_1P_2 and assume the polygon lies on the left of the line segment. When rotating the line P_1P_2 counterclockwise around P_1, due to the non-collinearity condition, each rotation step will pass exactly one marked point to the right half-plane. This will stop as soon as k-n points have passed to the right, leaving exactly n points in the left half-plane, forming the required polygon. **Step 3: Argument with n=9** Use n=9 and consider a polygon of 9 marked points in its interior and boundary with more points in A than in B. - **Case (i):** At least 6 points belong to A.

Each of these leads to a contradiction as none can all inclusively contain B as required. - **Case (ii):** 5 points belong to A. Suppose these points are A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5. - Similar to the above, we analyze the structure with pentagon triangle A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5 and identify disjoint triangles that fail their mutual inclusivity requirements.

Mary can complete the task in 6 hours, so in one hour, she completes 1/6 of the task. When they work together for the first 2 hours, they complete the following portion of the task: (1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6) * 2 To calculate this, we need a common denominator, which is 60 (the least common multiple of 4, 5, and 6). So, in one hour, they complete: (15/60 + 12/60 + 10/60) = (37/60) of the task. In two hours, they complete: 2 * (37/60) = (74/60) = (1 + 14/60) = 1 + 7/30 of the task. Since they can't complete more than the whole task, we'll just consider the fraction part, which is 7/30 of the task completed in two hours. After two hours, Roy leaves, and Jane and Mary continue to work together for one more hour. In that hour, they complete: (1/4 + 1/6) = (3/12 + 2/12) = (5/12) of the task.

For understanding, let us follow a structured approach to prove the statement step by step. 1. **Step 1:** Assume that the sequence {x_n} does not have a supremum (i.e., it does not have an upper limit): Since {x_n} does not have a supremum, for every element x_1 in the sequence, there exists another element x_{n_1} such that x_{n_1} > x_1. We can generalize this: for every x_{n_{i-1}}, there exists x_{n_i} > x_{n_{i-1}}. 2. **Step 2:** Constructing an increasing subsequence: x_{1} < x_{n_1} < x_{n_{2}} < ldots < x_{n_{k}} < ldots Here, x_{n_k} is increasing indefinitely. 3. **Step 3:** Consider the scenario where the sequence {x_n} does not have an infimum (i.e., it does not have a lower limit): Similarly, since {x_n} does not have an infimum, for every element x_1 in the sequence, there exists another element x_{m_1} such that x_{m_1} < x_1. Generalizing this: for every x_{m_{i-1}}, there exists x_{m_i} < x_{m_{i-1}}. 4. **Step 4:** Constructing a decreasing subsequence: x_{1} > x_{m_1} > x_{m_{2}} > ldots > x_{m_{k}} > ldots Here, x_{m_k} is decreasing indefinitely. 5. **Step 5:** Establishing varepsilon and inequality: Denote by varepsilon the difference between elements x_{n_1} and x_{m_1}. For all k > 1, the inequality holds: x_{n_k} - x_{m_k} geq varepsilon. Therefore, for all k > 1, this implies: x_{n_k} - x_{m_k} geq x_{n_z} - x_{m_1} = varepsilon. This significant difference implies that the sequence {x_n} does not approach any particular limit, suggesting it is divergent. # Conclusion: Based on the above steps and our reasoning, we conclude that no sequence {x_n} without a supremum or infimum can have a limit.

This implies that the chord AC, which subtends this arc, has a constant length regardless of the position of A and C on the circle. - It's possible to have infinitely many triangles triangle ABC inscribed in odot O with angle ABC=70^{circ} by positioning point A on the minor arc opposite to chord AC (excluding points A and C). Thus, statement ① is correct. # Statement ② - For any given distance d (0 leqslant d < R) from the center O to a chord AB, we can draw a concentric circle with radius d. All chords of odot O that are tangent to this smaller circle will have the same length as AB. - This is because the perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord, and all such chords will be equidistant from the center O. Therefore, the length of AB is uniquely determined by d, making statement ② correct. # Statement ③ - For any line externally tangent to odot O, the shortest distance from the center O to the line is equal to the radius R. However, this distance is the minimum distance from O to any point on the line. If a line is externally tangent, all other points on the line (except the tangent point) are further than R from O. - Therefore, it is impossible for there to be a point P on such a line where the distance from P to O is exactly equal to R.

For a fraction to equal zero, its numerator must be zero, and its denominator must not be zero.

Let (angle ZBA = theta). 2. **Step 2: Adding Segments and Noting Angles** Add segments (BX) and (AY).

Similarly, we have [ angle XBA = 2theta ] because angles in the same segment of circle (AYXZ) are equal, and also that the angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference in circle (AYX). 3. **Step 3: Conclusion about (BZ) in Triangle (ABX)** Since (angle BAZ = 2theta) and (angle BAX = 2theta), segment (BZ) is an internal angle bisector in the isosceles triangle (AXB). Therefore, (BZ) is perpendicular to (XA). 4. **Remark** In an isosceles triangle, the angle bisector from the apex (which is ( BZ ) in this case) is also the altitude.

Let M_1, M_2, ldots, M_8 be the midpoints of its sides (assume n = 9 for this specific case). 2. **Constructing Points**: Select an arbitrary point B_1 on the plane and reflect it successively about the points M_1, M_2, ldots, M_8.

Otherwise, the problem does not have a solution. 7. **Unique Solution for Even n**: Since parallel translation has no fixed points, the problem generally does not have a solution for even n, except in the trivial case where the sum of n symmetries represents an identity transformation (which essentially leaves every point unchanged). Hence, in this exceptional case, the solution is indeterminate and any point on the plane can serve as A_1. 8. **Constructing the Symmetry Center for Odd n**: For odd n = 9, construct the center of the resultant symmetry which provides the sole fixed point. Knowing this center, the rest of the vertices can be determined through successive reflections. This final construction can be checked by constructing segments from the known midpoints and verifying the symmetry and placement of the nonagon's vertices. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The solution method is applicable for odd } n text{ and yields a unique polygon.

The original expenditure is then P times C. After the first increase of 15%, the new price is P + 0.15P = 1.15P. After the second increase of 10%, the new price is 1.15P + 0.10 times 1.15P = 1.15P times 1.10 = 1.265P. The new expenditure, if the consumption stays the same, would be 1.265P times C. To keep the expenditure the same, we need to find a new consumption C' such that 1.265P times C' = P times C. Dividing both sides by 1.265P, we get C' = frac{P times C}{1.265P} = frac{C}{1.265}.

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).

Since they are supplementary: 3x + 8x = 180 11x = 180 x = 180 / 11 x ≈ 16.36 So the smaller angle is 3x ≈ 3 * 16.36 ≈ 49.09 degrees, and the larger angle is 8x ≈ 8 * 16.36 ≈ 130.91 degrees.

We need to arrange the matches in such a way that there is at least one day gap between any two matches of a team. The total number of matches for n = 5 teams is binom{5}{2} = 10, so we need a schedule for 10 matches.

Its heads’ statements help us infer the colors of the adjacent dragons. - If a red dragon has its first head saying the dragon to its left is green, this statement must be false since there must be a red dragon next to it (as stated by head 3 of any dragon). - If a red dragon's second head states the dragon to its right is blue, this statement must be true since this must compensate for the false information of head 1 and head 3. 4. **Derive further conditions**: - Hence, we can conclude that if a red dragon is present, the dragon to its right must be blue, and the dragon to its left must be green, following the constraints we identified. 5. **Form groups**: - Let's group three dragons as follows for each red dragon: - Dragon 1 (Red), Dragon 2 (Blue), and Dragon 3 (Green) to satisfy the truths and falsehoods requirement. - This pattern ensures that one head always tells the truth and the others lie as per the given statement. 6. **Counting the groups**: - We need to check how many such groups (of 3 dragons each) can fit into the total of 530 dragons. - Hence, the number of potential groups = leftlfloor frac{530}{3} rightrfloor = 176 groups. - Since each group includes exactly one red dragon, the maximum number of red dragons at the table is precisely 176. 7. **Verifying the example**: - Position 176 red dragons in the groups with green and blue as indicated. - By this arrangement, all conditions demanded by the head-statements hold true for any dragon's placement in the sequence. # Conclusion: [ boxed{176} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the number of ordered quadruples (a,b,c,d) of real numbers such that [ begin{pmatrix} a & b c & d end{pmatrix}^{1} = renewcommand{arraystretch}{1.5} begin{pmatrix} frac{2}{a} & frac{1}{b} frac{1}{c} & frac{2}{d} end{pmatrix} renewcommand{arraystretch}{1}. ]","completion":"The inverse of a matrix begin{pmatrix} a & b c & d end{pmatrix} is given by frac{1}{ad-bc} begin{pmatrix} d & -b -c & a end{pmatrix}.

Equating the modified forms of bc-ad from b^2 and c^2, we get b^2 = -c^2. This implies b = pm ic, where i is the imaginary unit. Substituting b = ic into b^2 = bc - ad, gives -c^2 = ic^2 - ad.

We consider each die in turn as the potential sum: - **Sum = 3**: Only possible with dice showing (1,1,1).

The general equation of the tangent parallel to ( y = x ) can therefore be written as ( y = x + b ). 4. **Equation of Tangent for the First Parabola**: - For ( y = x^2 + 1 ), a tangent line at some point can be expressed as ( y = x + b ). - To find the point of tangency, set the value of ( y ) from the parabola equal to the tangent line: [ x^2 + 1 = x + b ] 5. **Solve for ( x )**: [ x^2 - x + (1 - b) = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in ( x ). For there to be exactly one point of tangency, this quadratic equation must have exactly one solution, implying that the discriminant must be zero. 6. **Compute the Discriminant**: [ D = (-1)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (1 - b) = 1 - 4(1 - b) = 1 - 4 + 4b = 4b - 3 ] Set the discriminant to zero to find the value of ( b ): [ 4b - 3 = 0 implies b = frac{3}{4} ] 7. **Equation of the Tangent Line**: Substitute ( b = frac{3}{4} ): [ y = x + frac{3}{4} ] 8. **Find the Point of Tangency**: Solve for ( x ): [ x^2 + 1 = x + frac{3}{4} implies x^2 - x + frac{1}{4} = 0 implies left( x - frac{1}{2} right)^2 = 0 implies x = frac{1}{2} ] Using ( x = frac{1}{2} ) in the equation of the tangent: [ y = frac{1}{2} + frac{3}{4} = frac{5}{4} ] So, the point of tangency is ( E left( frac{1}{2}, frac{5}{4} right) ). 9. **Distance from ( E ) to the Line ( y = x )**: - We need the distance from ( E left( frac{1}{2}, frac{5}{4} right) ) to the line ( y = x ). First, find the equation of the line perpendicular to ( y = x ) passing through ( E ).

The probability we are looking for is the probability of getting exactly one head in three independent coin tosses. This can be achieved in three different scenarios: Heads on the first toss and Tails on the next two, Tails on the first toss and Heads on the second and Tails on the last, or Tails on the first two tosses and Heads on the last.

Here's a step-by-step proof to arrive at the modified statement that these points lie on a circle or a straight line. 1. **Intersections and Points:** - Let the intersections of the first and second circles be A_1 and B_1. - Let the intersections of the second and third circles be A_2 and B_2. - Let the intersections of the third and fourth circles be A_3 and B_3. - Let the intersections of the fourth and first circles be A_4 and B_4. 2. **Signed Angles Definition:** Define the signed angle PQR angle as positive if the sequence P, Q, R forms a counterclockwise triangle; otherwise, it is negative. If P, Q, R are collinear, then PQR angle = 0. 3. **Condition for Points on Circle or Line:** Using the property that four points P, Q, R, S are concyclic (on a circle or line) if and only if: [ PQR angle - PSR angle = k cdot 180^circ, ] where k is an integer. 4. **Using Circle Intersections:** Since A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2 are on the second circle, there exists an integer k_2 such that: [ A_1A_2B_2 angle - A_1B_1B_2 angle = k_2 cdot 180^circ. ] 5. **Applying Similar Conditions:** Similarly, for other pairs of points, there are integers k_3, k_4, k_1 such that: [ B_2A_2A_3 angle - B_2B_3A_3 angle = k_3 cdot 180^circ, ] [ A_3A_4B_4 angle - A_3B_3B_4 angle = k_4 cdot 180^circ, ] [ B_4A_4A_1 angle - B_4B_1A_1 angle = k_1 cdot 180^circ. ] 6. **Adding the Equations:** Summing these equations, we rearrange using the properties of signed angles, where: [ A_{i}A_{j}A_{k} angle = -A_{k}A_{j}A_{i} angle, ] [ A_{i}A_{j}A_{k} angle + A_{k}A_{j}A_{l} angle = A_{i}A_{j}A_{l} angle. ] Thus, obtain the equation: [ (A_1A_2B_2 angle + B_2A_2A_3 angle) + (A_3A_4B_4 angle + B_4A_4A_1 angle) - (B_4B_1A_1 angle + A_1B_1B_2 angle) - (B_2B_3A_3 angle + A_3B_3B_4 angle) = (k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4) cdot 180^circ. ] 7. **Simplification:** Using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the previously mentioned angle relationships: [ A_1A_2A_3 angle - A_1A_4A_3 angle + B_2B_1B_4 angle - B_2B_3B_4 angle = (k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4) cdot 180^circ. ] 8. **Concluding Statement:** From the above equation, we deduce the statement that points A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 being concyclic (on a circle or line) is equivalent to points B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4 being concyclic (on a circle or line).

The total age of the 9 men after the two men are replaced by the two women is 9(A + 4), because the average age increases by 4 years.

This stability criterion translates to ensuring the truncated legs' endpoints are coplanar. 2. **Key Observation and Transformation:** Flip the table upside-down so that the table's surface is on the floor. This translates the problem to ensuring that the endpoints (A, B, C, D) of the truncated legs lie on the same plane. 3. **Geometric Conditions for Stability:** The table will be stable if and only if the endpoints (A, B, C, D) form a parallelogram. This is because a parallelogram (quadrilateral with opposite sides equal and parallel) inherently lies on a single plane. 4. **Translate to Mathematical Equation:** The condition for (A, B, C, D) to be coplanar can be expressed mathematically as: [ (n - k_1) + (n - k_3) = (n - k_2) + (n - k_4) Longrightarrow k_1 + k_3 = k_2 + k_4 ] 5. **Counting Valid Solutions:** We need to count the number of solutions to the equation (k_1 + k_3 = k_2 + k_4).

Consider the finite point sets ( A ) and ( B ) in the plane, each containing at least two points, and ( A cup B ) is not collinear. These assumptions ensure that neither ( A ) nor ( B ) is aligned along a single line and ( A cup B ) forms a two-dimensional configuration. 2. Suppose that all points of ( A ) lie on a line, denoted by ( l ). If ( l ) does not contain any point from ( B ), the conclusion is trivially satisfied because the segment connecting any two points in ( A ) will not intersect ( B ). 3. If there exists a point ( b in l ) such that ( b in B ), because ( A cup B ) is not collinear, there must exist a point ( b' in B ) such that ( b' notin l ). The line segment ( bb' ) will then connect points ( b ) and ( b' ), and since ( b' notin l ), this segment cannot include any point from ( A ) which lie on ( l ). 4.

Now assume that neither ( A ) nor ( B ) have all their points on a single line. Given ( A ) and ( B ) have finite points, consider all possible triangles formed by the points in ( A ) or ( B ).

Solving for y yields y=±frac{b^2}{a}. Since the length of the line segment formed by the intersection of the line passing through F_1 perpendicular to the x-axis and the ellipse C is 1, we have frac{2b^2}{a}=1. Given that the eccentricity e=frac{c}{a}=frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we can solve the system of equations: begin{cases} frac{2b^2}{a}=1 a^2=b^2+c^2 frac{c}{a}=frac{sqrt{3}}{2} end{cases} Solving this system, we find: a=2, b=1, and c=sqrt{3}. Thus, the equation of the ellipse C is frac{x^2}{4}+y^2=1. (II) Let |PF_1|=t and |PF_2|=n. By the properties of angle bisectors, we have frac{t}{n}=frac{|MF_1|}{|F_2M|}=frac{m+sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}-m}. Given that t+n=2a=4, we can eliminate t to obtain frac{4-n}{n}=frac{sqrt{3}+m}{sqrt{3}-m}. Solving for n yields n=frac{2(sqrt{3}-m)}{sqrt{3}}. Since a-c < n < a+c, we have 2−sqrt{3} < n < 2+sqrt{3}, which implies 2−sqrt{3} < frac{2(sqrt{3}-m)}{sqrt{3}} < 2+sqrt{3}. Solving for m, we find −frac{3}{2} < m < frac{3}{2}. Thus, the range of values for m is (−frac{3}{2}, frac{3}{2}). (III) Proof: Let P(x_0,y_0). Without loss of generality, assume y_0 > 0. From the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{4}+y^2=1, we have y=sqrt{1-frac{x^2}{4}}. Then, y'=-frac{x}{sqrt{1-frac{x^2}{4}}}. Hence, k=k_l=-frac{x_0}{4y_0}.

Given that the percent of savings per roll for the 12-roll package over the cost of 12 rolls purchased individually is 25%, we can calculate the savings per roll when buying the case. The savings per roll is 25% of the individual roll price, which is ( 0.25 times 1 = 0.25 ). So, each roll in the case costs ( 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 ) when considering the savings. Therefore, the cost of the case of 12 rolls (C) is ( 12 times 0.75 = 9 ). So, the cost of the case of 12 rolls is boxed{9} ."},{"prompt":"a room, there are knights, who always tell the truth, and liars, who always lie (both are definitely present).

How many liars could there actually be?","completion":"1. We are given that all possible answers from 1 to 200 were received to the question of how many liars are in the room. This means there are exactly 200 different answers. 2. Since at least one answer must be correct (as one correct answer always exists among different answers in such problems), there is one correct answer and 199 incorrect answers. 3. Since knights always tell the truth and liars always lie, the 199 incorrect answers must all come from liars. 4. Therefore, the minimum number of liars in the room is 199. This can be verified as follows: - Assume there are 200 people in the room. One person tells the truth (the knight) about the actual number of liars, which leaves 199 people providing false answers. - If there are 200 people in the room and all 200 different answers are given, the one correct answer corresponds to the 199 liars, making a total of 200 people. 5. Next, let's consider if there could be more than 199 liars. If there are 200 liars, then there would be 201 people in the room because there must be at least one knight saying the correct number (200). 6. Therefore, if there are 201 people and the one knight gives the correct answer among the 200 answers, it implies 200 incorrect answers given by the 200 liars. Conclusion: - Both scenarios are consistent with the given information, hence there could be either 199 or 200 liars in the room.

Since we know the diagonal of the square is 10 meters, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the sides of the square. Let's denote the side of the square as \\"s\\". The diagonal d of a square divides it into two right-angled triangles, with the sides of the square being the legs of the triangle and the diagonal being the hypotenuse. According to the Pythagorean theorem: d^2 = s^2 + s^2 10^2 = 2s^2 100 = 2s^2 s^2 = 100 / 2 s^2 = 50 s = √50 s = 5√2 meters Now that we have the side length of the square, we can calculate its area: Area_square = s^2 Area_square = (5√2)^2 Area_square = 25 * 2 Area_square = 50 square meters The octagon is composed of the square and 4 isosceles right triangles (one at each vertex of the square). The legs of these triangles are equal to the side of the square, which is 5√2 meters.

Then at least n + 1 - |M| points on x + y = n are reachable. 3. **Proof of Claim 1:** - **Base Case (n = 1):** - If there are no mines on (0,1) and (1,0), then both points are reachable. - If there is a mine on exactly one of them, the other point is reachable. - **Inductive Step:** - Assume the claim holds for x + y = n-1. - Suppose there are k mines on x + y = n and there is a good path to x + y = n. - By the inductive hypothesis, at least n - (|M| - k) points on x + y = n-1 are reachable. - The right neighbor of each of these points lies on x + y = n, as well as the top neighbor of the highest reachable point on x + y = n-1. - This gives at least n - |M| + k + 1 unique pseudo-reachable points on x + y = n. - At most k of these points contain a mine, so at least n + 1 - |M| points are reachable. 4. **Application of Claim 1:** - Suppose there are m mines with a of them lying within x + y < m, b of them on x + y = m, and c of them within x + y > m. - Pick an (n-m)-path P. - By Claim 1, there exist at least (m + 1 - (a + b)) + b = m + 1 - a pseudo-reachable points on x + y = m. - Consider the copies of P from these points to x + y = n. - These paths are necessarily disjoint since each is a translation of (d, -d) from another, yet paths are always non-decreasing in both coordinates. - There are b + c = m - a mines in x + y ge m, but at least m + 1 - a copies of P. - Hence, there exists a good copy of P from a pseudo-reachable point on x + y = m to x + y = n without a mine. - Clearly, no mine lies on this starting pseudo-reachable point, so it is actually reachable. - Thus, we obtain a good path to x + y = n ending with P. 5. **Counting the Paths:** - Repeat for all 2^{n-m} possible (n-m)-paths. - Each yields a unique good path to x + y = n since all (n-m)-paths are distinct. - Hence, at least 2^{n-|M|} good paths to x + y = n exist.

To do so, we consider the process of iterating through configurations of segments and altering those that intersect. 2. **Addressing Intersections with Transformation:** Suppose we have two intersecting segments AC and BD. We can resolve the intersection by replacing these segments with AB and CD. This replacement leverages the triangular inequality to improve our configuration towards the desired non-intersecting state. 3. **Triangular Inequality Justification:** When replacing intersecting segments AC and BD with AB and CD, the sum of the lengths of the new segments is less than the sum of the lengths of the original intersecting segments. This is due to the triangular inequality as follows: [ AB + CD < AC + BD. ] 4. **Monovariant Consideration:** To ensure convergence towards a non-intersecting configuration, we use a monovariant associated with this transformation. A monovariant is a quantity that decreases (or increases, depending on the problem) and helps in proving termination. In this problem, the monovariant we consider is the sum of the lengths of all segments. 5. **Finite Configurations:** Since the sum of the lengths of the segments is strictly decreasing with each transformation (when we replace intersecting segments), and given that there are only a finite number of possible configurations (as each red point can only be connected to one blue point), we conclude that the process must terminate. 6. **Reaching an Optimal Configuration:** Upon termination, the sum of the lengths of all segments cannot be reduced further, implying that no intersecting segments remain.

Therefore, the profit W(x) is calculated as follows: [ W(x) = text{Revenue} - text{Total Cost} = 700x - (10x^{2} + 100x + 250) = -10x^{2} + 600x - 250 ] **Case 2:** For x geq 40, Given R(x) = 701x + frac{10000}{x} - 9450, the total cost includes the fixed cost of 2.5 million in addition to R(x). Thus, the profit W(x) is: [ W(x) = 700x - left(701x + frac{10000}{x} - 9450 + 250right) = -(x + frac{10000}{x}) + 9200 ] Combining both cases, we have the analytical expression of the profit W(x) as: [ W(x) = left{begin{array}{l}{-10{x}^{2} + 600x - 250, quad 0 < x < 40}{-(x + frac{10000}{x}) + 9200, quad x geq 40}end{array}right. ] Part 2: Determining the Annual Output for Maximum Profit **Case 1:** For 0 < x < 40, By completing the square, W(x) can be rewritten as: [ W(x) = -10(x^{2} - 60x) - 250 = -10(x - 30)^{2} + 8750 ] At x = 30, the maximum profit within this interval is: [ W(x)_{max} = 8750 quad text{million} ] **Case 2:** For x geq 40, W(x) = -(x + frac{10000}{x}) + 9200 is maximized by applying the AM-GM inequality, implying that W(x) leq 9200 - 2sqrt{x cdot frac{10000}{x}} = 9200 - 200 = 9000. The equality occurs when x = frac{10000}{x}, which gives x = 100. At x = 100, the maximum profit is: [ W(x)_{max} = 9000 quad text{million} ] Therefore, the company will achieve the maximum profit in the year 2023 with an annual output of 100 thousand units, and the maximum profit will be boxed{9000} million."},{"prompt":"Alice is sitting in a teacup ride with infinitely many layers of spinning disks.

To isolate and solve the system, we can manipulate these equations further. Subtracting the second equation in its scaled form gives insight into transformations needed to solve for ( x, y, z ). 6.

Proof: Consider coloring the vertices of a convex 2n-gon in a alternating black and white pattern. Thus, there will be n black vertices and n white vertices. - Diagonal lines that connect vertices of the same color will have even lengths, while those connecting vertices of different colors will have odd lengths. - Suppose there are k diagonal lines that connect vertices of different colors and n-k diagonal lines that connect vertices of the same color. If we remove the k diagonal lines and their endpoints, we are left with n-k black vertices and n-k white vertices. These n-k white vertices will each connect to another n-k vertices of the same color. Since each black vertex must connect with exactly one white vertex (and vice versa), we find that n-k must be even, making the diagonal lines with even lengths appear an even number of times. # Part (2): For part (2), consider the sequence: [ left(d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{997}right) = (8, cdots, 8, 6, cdots, 6, 3, cdots, 3) ] where there are 4 diagonal lines of length 8, 985 diagonal lines of length 6, and 8 diagonal lines of length 3.

The smallest such n results from choosing the smallest prime, giving n = 2^{11} = 2048. bullet (3) n = p_1^1 cdot p_2^1 cdot p_3^2, choosing the smallest primes gives n = 2^1 cdot 3^1 cdot 5^2 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 25 = 150.

Since 60% of the employees are women and there are 48 women, we can set up the following equation: 0.60 * Total Employees = 48 Women To find the total number of employees, we divide both sides by 0.60: Total Employees = 48 / 0.60 Total Employees = 80 Now that we know there are 80 employees in total, we can find out how many are men.

Since the medians (AA_1) and (BB_1) are perpendicular, let (M) be the intersection point of the medians, also known as the centroid of triangle (ABC). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. Therefore, (CM) is two-thirds of the median from (C) to (AB). 4. Let (m_c) be the median from (C) to (AB).

To determine the intervals of monotonicity, we set f'(x) > 0 since e^{-ax} > 0 for all x: -ax^2 + 2x > 0 implies x(2 - ax) > 0. Solving this inequality, we get: 0 < x < frac{2}{a}. Thus, f(x) is decreasing on the intervals (-infty, 0) and (frac{2}{a}, +infty) while it is increasing on the interval (0, frac{2}{a}). (II) To find the maximum value of f(x) on the interval [1, 2], we consider three cases based on the value of frac{2}{a}: 1. When 0 < frac{2}{a} < 1, i.e., a > 2, f(x) is decreasing on the interval (1, 2). Therefore, on [1, 2], the maximum value is boxed{f_{max} = f(1) = e^{-a}}. 2. When 1 leq frac{2}{a} leq 2, i.e., 1 leq a leq 2, f(x) is increasing on the interval (1, frac{2}{a}) and decreasing on (frac{2}{a}, 2). Therefore, on [1, 2], the maximum value is at x = frac{2}{a}: boxed{f_{max} = fleft(frac{2}{a}right) = frac{4}{a^2}e^{-2}}. 3.

In summary: - When 0 < a < 1, the maximum value of f(x) on [1, 2] is 4e^{-2a}; - When 1 leq a leq 2, the maximum value of f(x) on [1, 2] is frac{4}{a^2}e^{-2}; - When a > 2, the maximum value of f(x) on [1, 2] is e^{-a}."},{"prompt":"Five circles of radius 2 are equally spaced and externally tangent to each other, forming a starlike shape inside a larger circle.

By properties of incenter and circumcenter: [ angle A I_2 D = 120^circ ] And since A, D, I_2, O_2 are concyclic: [ angle A I_2 O_2 = angle A D O_2 = 30^circ ] Establishing parallel lines because: [ angle I_1 A I_2 = 30^circ ] It follows that: [ A I_1 parallel O_2 P quad text{and} quad A I_2 parallel O_1 P ] 6. **Intersection and Equal Angles** Conclusively, at point P, let’s explore: [ angle P = angle I_1 A I_2 = 30^circ = frac{1}{2} angle O_1 D O_2 ] This shows that D is equidistant and hence serves as the circumcenter of triangle O_1 P O_2 confirming that: [ boxed{D text{ is the circumcenter of } triangle O_1 P O_2 } ]"},{"prompt":"a plane, if the altitude of a triangle is divided into two segments in a 1:2 ratio by a line segment parallel to the base, then the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle formed to the original triangle is 1:9.

Since PA is perpendicular to the plane of triangle ABC, we can consider triangle PAB and triangle PAC as right-angled triangles with PA as the height. To find the distance from point P to line BC, we first need to find the area of triangle ABC. Using Heron's formula, we can calculate the semi-perimeter s of triangle ABC as s = frac{AB + AC + BC}{2} = frac{13 + 13 + 10}{2} = 18. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC, denoted as S, can be calculated using the formula S = sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - AC)(s - BC)} = sqrt{18(18 - 13)(18 - 13)(18 - 10)} = sqrt{18 times 5 times 5 times 8} = 60. Knowing the area of triangle ABC allows us to find the distance from point P to line BC by considering the volume of the triangular pyramid formed by points P, A, B, and C. The volume of this pyramid, V, can be expressed as V = frac{1}{3} times S times PA = frac{1}{3} times 60 times 5 = 100. However, the key to solving this problem is recognizing that the distance from point P to line BC is actually irrelevant to the volume calculation previously mentioned. Instead, we should focus on the perpendicular height from P to the base BC in the context of triangle PBC. Given the symmetry of the problem and the given lengths, the distance from P to BC is directly related to the height of triangle ABC, which can be found by considering the properties of isosceles triangles and the Pythagorean theorem.

To ensure the coverage of a ring around the oil platform with radars, it is necessary to place them at the vertices of a regular polygon, the center of which coincides with the center of the platform. 2. Consider the fragment of the problem depicted in the picture - specifically, the triangle triangle AOB. By analyzing the right triangle triangle BCD, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to find BD: BD = sqrt{61^2 - 11^2} Breaking down the calculation: BD = sqrt{3721 - 121} = sqrt{3600} = 60 3. Consequently, the distance AB is twice BD: AB = 2 cdot BD = 2 cdot 60 = 120 4. Therefore, the distance from the center of the platform O to the radar points (equivalent to the radius of the circumscribed circle around a regular nonagon) can be calculated as: OB = frac{AB}{2 sin left(frac{180^circ}{9}right)} = frac{120}{2 sin 20^circ} = frac{60}{sin 20^circ} 5. To find the area of the coverage ring, we need to subtract the area of the circle with radius OC from the area of the circle with radius OE. We first find OD using: OD = frac{BD}{tan 20^circ} = frac{60}{tan 20^circ} 6. Using OD, we can find OC (inner radius) and OE (outer radius) as follows: - Inner radius: OC = OD - 11 = frac{60}{tan 20^circ} - 11 - Outer radius: OE = OD + 11 = frac{60}{tan 20^circ} + 11 7. The area of the ring is then given by the difference between the areas of circles with these radii: S_{text{covering ring}} = pi left(OE^2 - OC^2right) 8.

We can set up the following equations: G + N = 36 (since the total number of students is the sum of those who wear glasses and those who do not) G = N - 24 (since there are 24 fewer students who wear glasses than those who do not) Now we can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for N: (N - 24) + N = 36 2N - 24 = 36 2N = 36 + 24 2N = 60 N = 60 / 2 N = 30 Now that we know there are 30 students who do not wear glasses, we can find the number of students who wear glasses by using the second equation: G = N - 24 G = 30 - 24 G = 6 So, boxed{6} students wear glasses."},{"prompt":"Simplify sqrt {a^{ frac {1}{2}} sqrt {a^{ frac {1}{2}} sqrt {a}}} Options: A: a^{ frac {1}{4}} B: a^{ frac {1}{3}} C: a^{ frac {1}{2}} D:","completion":"Given that a geq 0, we have sqrt {a^{ frac {1}{2}} sqrt {a^{ frac {1}{2}} sqrt {a}}} = sqrt {a^{ frac {1}{2}} sqrt {a^{ frac {1}{2}+ frac {1}{2}}}} = sqrt {a^{ frac {1}{2}} cdot sqrt {a}} = sqrt {a^{ frac {1}{2}} cdot a^{ frac {1}{2}}} = sqrt {a} = a^{ frac {1}{2}}, Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{text{C}}.

For a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle of radius 1, the area can be given by: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left( sin(2angle ABC) + sin(2angle BCA) + sin(2angle CAB) right) ] 2. **Derivation:** - Let O be the center of the circle. - The area of triangle ABC can be expressed as the sum of the areas of triangle AOB, triangle BOC, and triangle COA. - Each of these smaller triangles has an area given by frac{1}{2} R^2 sin(theta), where R is the radius of the circle and theta is the angle subtended at the center by the side of the triangle. - Since R = 1, the area of each smaller triangle is frac{1}{2} sin(theta). 3. **Summing the areas:** - The angles subtended at the center by the sides of triangle ABC are 2angle ABC, 2angle BCA, and 2angle CAB. - Therefore, the total area of triangle ABC is: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left( sin(2angle ABC) + sin(2angle BCA) + sin(2angle CAB) right) ] Thus, we have shown that the area of the triangle ABC equals: [ frac{1}{2} left( sin(2angle ABC) + sin(2angle BCA) + sin(2angle CAB) right) ] # Part (b) 1. **Expression for the area:** Given that angle ABC is fixed, we need to show that the area of triangle ABC is maximized when angle BCA = angle CAB. 2. **Using the expression from part (a):** [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left( sin(2angle ABC) + sin(2angle BCA) + sin(2angle CAB) right) ] 3. **Maximizing the area:** - Let angle ABC = beta, angle BCA = gamma, and angle CAB = alpha. - Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is pi, we have: [ alpha + beta + gamma = pi ] - Given that beta is fixed, we have: [ alpha + gamma = pi - beta ] 4. **Using trigonometric identities:** - The area expression becomes: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left( sin(2beta) + sin(2gamma) + sin(2alpha) right) ] - To maximize the area, we need to maximize sin(2gamma) + sin(2alpha) given that alpha + gamma = pi - beta. 5. **Applying the AM-GM inequality:** - By the AM-GM inequality, we have: [ sin(2gamma) + sin(2alpha) leq 2 sqrt{sin(2gamma) sin(2alpha)} ] - Equality holds when sin(2gamma) = sin(2alpha), which implies gamma = alpha. Thus, the area of the triangle ABC is maximized when angle BCA = angle CAB. # Part (c) 1. **Using the result from part (b):** - We have shown that the area is maximized when angle BCA = angle CAB. - Since alpha + beta + gamma = pi and beta is fixed, the only way for alpha = gamma is if all angles are equal. 2. **Equilateral triangle:** - If all angles are equal, then alpha = beta = gamma = frac{pi}{3}. - This implies that triangle ABC is equilateral. Thus, the area of the triangle ABC is maximum when the triangle is equilateral.

[ text{Length of shorter side} = 3 times 5 = 15 text{ feet} ] [ text{Length of longer side} = 9 times 5 = 45 text{ feet} ] 6. **Calculate the area of the play area**: [ text{Area} = 15 times 45 = 675 text{ square feet} ] [ 675 text{ square feet} ] Conclusion: The exact area of Alice's play area is 675 text{ square feet}. This result shows the area calculation using the different perimeter setup is well validated. The final answer is boxed{textbf{(C)} 675}"},{"prompt":"Show that given four noncoplanar points A, B, P, Q there is a plane with A and B on one side and P and Q on the other, and with all the points the same distance from the plane.","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: Consider the four non-coplanar points (A), (B), (P), and (Q). We aim to find a plane such that (A) and (B) lie on one side, (P) and (Q) lie on the other side, and all points (A), (B), (P), and (Q) are equidistant from the plane. 2. **Determine Midpoints**: - Let (U) be the midpoint of segment (AQ). [ U = frac{A + Q}{2} ] - Let (V) be the midpoint of segment (AP). [ V = frac{A + P}{2} ] - Let (W) be the midpoint of segment (BP). [ W = frac{B + P}{2} ] - Let (X) be the midpoint of segment (BQ). [ X = frac{B + Q}{2} ] 3. **Parallel Segments**: - Notice that the vectors (UV) and (WX) are both parallel to the vector (PQ). - Calculating vector (UV): [ UV = V - U = left( frac{A + P}{2} right) - left( frac{A + Q}{2} right) = frac{P - Q}{2} ] - Calculating vector (WX): [ WX = X - W = left( frac{B + Q}{2} right) - left( frac{B + P}{2} right) = frac{Q - P}{2} = -frac{P - Q}{2} ] - Therefore, (UV parallel WX). 4. **Forming the Parallelogram**: - Similarly, the vectors (XU) and (VW) are considered. - (XU = U - X) and (VW = W - V) are vectors, but crucially, since (U), (V), (W), and (X) are all midpoints of segments joined at the points (A), (B), (P), and (Q), the segments form a parallelogram (UVWX). - This parallelogram lies on a plane, denoted as (Pi). 5. **Proving Equidistance from the Plane**: - (AB) is parallel to the plane (Pi) because (U) and (X) lie on lines drawn from non-coplanar points (A) and (B) through points on the opposite side, ensuring that (AB) lies symmetrically about the plane. - Since (U) and (X) are midpoints: [ d(A, Pi) = d(B, Pi) ] 6. **Checking the Equidistance of (P) and (B)**: - By choosing midpoint (W), (P) and (B) are also equidistant to (Pi): [ W = frac{B + P}{2} ] Thus, [ d(P, Pi) = d(B, Pi) ] 7. **Final Check for (Q)**: - For midpoint (X) involving (Q), we ensure: [ X = frac{B + Q}{2} ] Thus, [ d(Q, Pi) = d(B, Pi) ] 8. **Conclusion**: All points (A), (B), (P), and (Q) are equidistant from the plane (Pi), achieving the required condition.

First, consider the domain of f(x). For f(x) to be defined, x neq 1 to avoid division by zero. Also, a+frac{1}{1-x} neq 0 to avoid the logarithm of zero or a negative number inside the absolute value. Given that f(x) is an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x). This implies the function and its domain must be symmetric about the origin. If a=0, then f(x) = ln |frac{1}{{1-x}}|+b. The domain in this case is {x|xneq 1}, which is not symmetric about the origin, contradicting the requirement for f(x) to be odd. Thus, a neq 0. For the domain to be symmetric about the origin, if x = 1 + frac{1}{a} is excluded from the domain (due to a+frac{1}{1-x} neq 0), then x = -1 - frac{1}{a} must also be excluded. This symmetry requirement leads to the equation 1 + frac{1}{a} = -1, solving for a gives: [1 + frac{1}{a} = -1 implies frac{1}{a} = -2 implies a = -frac{1}{2}] Substituting a = -frac{1}{2} into f(x), we get: [f(x) = ln left|-frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{1-x}right| + b = ln left|frac{1+x}{2(1-x)}right| + b] The domain now excludes x neq 1 and x neq -1, making it symmetric about the origin as required. To find b, we use the property that f(x) is odd and f(0) = 0: [f(0) = ln left|frac{1}{2}right| + b = 0 implies b = -ln frac{1}{2} = ln 2] Therefore, the values of a and b are: [a = -frac{1}{2}, quad b = ln 2] Encapsulating the final answer: [boxed{a = -frac{1}{2}; quad b = ln 2}]"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],L={key:0},W={key:1};function M(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
