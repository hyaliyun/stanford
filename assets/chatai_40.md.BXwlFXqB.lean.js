The goal is to prove that if AR parallel BC, then points A, G, M, N are concyclic (i.e., they lie on the same circle). 1. **Identify Key Points and Relationships**: - Let L be the midpoint of BC. - Using properties of secants and angles subtended by the same arc, we know that angle LAB = angle PBQ. - Similarly, since AR parallel BC, we have angle RAC = angle ACB. 2. **Angle Considerations**: - Since AR parallel BC, by alternate interior angles, angle ACR = angle BAC. - From the cyclic quadrilateral properties and alternate segment theorem: [ angle PBQ = angle PCQ = angle PAQ - angle PAC ] - Therefore, angle CAQ = angle CAP - angle PAC. 3. **Using Sine Rule in triangle ABC**: - We use the property of a circumcircle and apply the sine rule. - The incenter I divides the angle bisectors proportionally w.r.t the other sides; thus we form angle relationships: [ frac{sin angle BAC}{sin angle BCA} = frac{c}{b} ] 4. **Median and Angle Bisectors Consideration**: - Since L is the midpoint, we have triangle ALL sim triangle QLD, which provides more geometric relations. - In triangles BGD and CGD, using the sine rule again, [ frac{BG}{CG} = frac{BD sin angle BDG}{CD sin angle CDG}. ] - Here, D being the midpoint, frac{BD}{CD} relates directly to the side lengths. 5. **Calculating Specific Lengths**: - Calculate AM and AN using the angle bisector theorem and trigonometric identities on A, M, I and A, N, I. - Given AM = frac{AF}{cos^2 frac{A}{2}}.

Let's call this new table the \\"reversed table\\". - In this reversed table, instead of natural number cubes like in the original table, the cubes would begin from a new range and proceed similarly in natural increments. 3. **Summing the original and reversed table**: - By adding the values of corresponding cells from both the original and reversed tables, we form pairs in each cell of the resulting table. - The cubes in these pairs can be expressed algebraically. For simplicity, denote the sum of the indices of a cell pair in the original and reversed table as (a) and (b) with ( a + b = 200 ). 4. **Sum of cubes**: The critical property of cubes is used here: (a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)). Given (a + b = 200), the resulting sums become: a^3 + b^3 = 200(a^2 - ab + b^2) This shows that the sum of the cubes for each such pair will always include the factor 200. 5. **Combining the results**: - When adding the original and reversed tables together, each cell (c_{ij}) gets transformed to a sum of cubes that is divisible by 200: (c_{ij} = a^3 + b^3 = 200 cdot k). - Since there are multiple pairs whose sum contains the 200 factor, and all indices (a) and (b) sum up to the necessary conditions that guarantee contributions from each row and column, the whole sum of the table will constitute: sum_{i,j} c_{ij} text{ (mod 200) } equiv 0 6. **Effect on the diagonal**: Any special consideration for numbers on the main diagonal (if visually perceived) remains valid. Especially as symmetric contributing values make the sum even (purely paired structures ensure even sums). 7. **Conclusion**: Since each transformation ensured pair sums divisible by 200, adding them back and modular analysis retains the property: boxed{text{The sum of all numbers in the table divides by 200.}}"},{"prompt":"Prove that overline{A+B}=bar{A} cdot bar{B}.","completion":"To prove the given expression that (overline{A + B} = bar{A} cdot bar{B}), we need to demonstrate two inclusions: 1.

So, her weekday earnings are 30 hours * 10/hour = 300. **Weekend Earnings:** Janice works 25 hours on weekends. The first 40 hours are at a regular rate, and since she has already worked 30 hours on weekdays, she has 10 hours left at the regular weekend rate before hitting overtime. So, her regular weekend earnings are 10 hours * 12/hour = 120. Now, she has 15 hours of weekend overtime (25 weekend hours - 10 regular weekend hours). Her weekend overtime earnings are 15 hours * 18/hour = 270. **Holiday Earnings:** Janice works 5 hours on a holiday that falls on a weekend. The usual weekend rate is 12 per hour, but since it's a holiday, her rate doubles to 24 per hour. However, since she has already worked 40 hours (30 weekdays + 10 weekends), these hours are considered overtime. The usual weekend overtime rate is 18 per hour, but since it's a holiday, this rate also doubles to 36 per hour.

We call these groups of 30 consecutive children \\"platoons\\". 5. **Reduction to a Simpler Problem** (By Means of Extremes): - Let's analyze transitions between different groups: - Consider the number of boys in a group of 30 children as we move from one child to the next child in the line, keeping the group size constant. - When moving from one group of 30 children to the next one (shifting by one child), the number of boys can only change by 1 or remain the same. This is because we remove one child from the beginning of the group and add one child to the end of the group. 6. **Changes in Boys Count**: - Identify a group where the number of boys is more than 15, and another group where the count is less than 15. This is based on the total number of boys and girls (since there are more boys or girls in different consecutive groups). 7. **Intermediate Value Theorem**: - Considering the continuous transition of count (by movement of 1 position at a time around the circle): - As you transition between groups where boys are more than 15 to groups where boys are less than 15, there must be an in-between group where the number of boys is exactly 15 (and hence, the number of girls is also 15). 8. **Conclusion**: - There exist at least two groups of 30 children (since one is given by the problem) that have equal boys and girls. - When considering the circle, breaking at any one of these points and looking at a continuous segment of 70 children between these points (which includes one of these 30-groups with equal boys and girls) will result in a segment of 70 children with equal boys and girls. 9. **Final Verification**: - When unwrapping the circle, at least one segment of 70 consecutive children will have an equal number of boys and girls due to our condition of exactly two groups of 30 children with equal counts. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{We have shown that there is a group of 70 consecutive children with an equal number of boys and girls.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Show that there is a 100digit number in the decimal system, divisible by 2^{100}, which contains only 1s and 2s.","completion":"We need to show that there exists a 100-digit number in the decimal system, which is divisible by ( 2^{100} ) and contains only the digits 1 and 2. 1. **Identify the divisible pattern:** Consider numbers of the form: ( 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{3}, ldots, 2^{100} ). These numbers need to be divisible by ( 2^{100} ), meaning the number we are looking for must accommodate ( 2^{100} ) as a factor. 2. **Determine the digits of the number:** - The last digit of our number can only be 2, as it must be even (from the set {1, 2}). - The tens digit must be 1 because if it were 2, the number \\"22\\" isn't divisible by ( 2^2 ). - Similarly, the hundreds digit must be 1 since \\"212\\" isn't divisible by ( 2^3 ). 3. **Continuing the pattern:** Through trial and error, let's consider the following digits: - ( 1112 ) (four digits, setting it in the context of powers of 2). - We check divisibility: ( 1112 div 16 neq text{integer} ) (it gives a remainder of 8). 4. **Building higher powers:** - Let's add another digit and change the previous digit appropriately: - ( 2112 ) (moving the pattern forward): ( 2112 div 16 = 132 ) (integer). 5. **Generalizing the method:** We now observe that if our number which is formed entirely of 1's and 2's is divisible by ( 2^n ), by examining the division steps, if the quotient ( q ) is odd, prepend 1; if ( q ) is even, prepend 2.

There are 2016 teams, so ( G ) has 2016 vertices. An edge exists between two vertices ( A ) and ( B ) if there is a match between the teams represented by ( A ) and ( B ). The edge points from the winner to the loser. - If the match ends with extra time, color the edge red. - If the match ends in regulation time, color the edge blue. 2. **Counting Total Matches and Points:** Since each team plays every other team exactly once, there are a total of: [ binom{2016}{2} = frac{2016 times 2015}{2} = 2031120 text{ matches} ] 3. **Maximum Red Edges:** We need to find the maximum number of matches that ended in extra time, denoted as ( N ). 4. **Graph Lemma:** We will consider the distribution of points in the tournament to understand the structure of the graph ( G ): - Blue edges contribute 3 points (to the winner). - Red edges contribute 2 points to the winner and 1 point to the loser. Observe that: The total number of match points in the tournament is: [ 3 text{ matches} = 3 times 2031120 = 6093360 text{ points} ] 5. **Analyzing Groups in the Tournament:** We introduce groups of 4 teams and analyze the results between them.

Thus, in each group, teams A and B would gather 7 points each, and teams C and D would gather 2 points each. 6. **Points and Edges in Each Group:** Every 4-team group has exactly 3 extra time matches. The sum of the points in each 4-team group confirms this structure: [ 7+7+2+2 = 18 text{ points} text{ per group of 4 teams} ] Since there are 504 such groups, the total number of matches that end in extra time across all groups is: [ 3 times 504 = 1512 text{ matches} ] 7. **Conclusion:** The largest possible number of matches that could end in extra time in this 2016-team tournament, ensuring that the point distribution is consistent with all tournament rules, is: [ boxed{1512} ]"},{"prompt":"Compute the determinant of the sum of two matrices: [ begin{vmatrix} 5 & 2 3 & 4 end{vmatrix} + begin{vmatrix} 1 & 3 1 & 2 end{vmatrix}. ]","completion":"First, perform the matrix addition: [ begin{bmatrix} 5 & -2 3 & 4 end{bmatrix} + begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 -1 & 2 end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 5+1 & -2+3 3-1 & 4+2 end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} 6 & 1 2 & 6 end{bmatrix}. ] Next, compute the determinant of the resulting matrix: [ begin{vmatrix} 6 & 1 2 & 6 end{vmatrix} = (6)(6) - (1)(2) = 36 - 2 = boxed{34}. ]"},{"prompt":"For an operations manager job at a company, a person with a degree earns three times the amount paid to a diploma holder for the same position.

Specifically, for any (a_i) in an arithmetic progression, (a_1 + a_9 = a_2 + a_8 = cdots = 2a_5). Similarly, for (b_i), we have the same symmetry. 5. **Symmetry in polynomials:** Considering the symmetry in the coefficients, we can pair the polynomials as follows: [ P_i(x) + P_{10-i}(x) = x^2 + a_i x + b_i + x^2 + a_{10-i} x + b_{10-i}. ] 6. **Finding the sum equalities:** Since (a_i + a_{10-i} = 2a_5) and (b_i + b_{10-i} = 2b_5), we observe: [ P_i(x) + P_{10-i}(x) = 2(x^2 + a_5 x + b_5). ] 7. **Sum of all polynomials:** Given this symmetry in pairing each of the (P_i(x)), the entire sum (P(x)) is: [ P(x) = 9(x^2 + a_5 x + b_5) = 9P_5(x). ] 8. **Root condition:** The problem states that the sum (P(x)) has at least one root. Therefore, ( 9P_5(x) ) must have at least one root. Simplifying, it implies that (P_5(x)) has at least one root. 9. **Root implications in pairs:** If we consider (x_0) as a root of (P_5(x)), then: [ P_i(x_0) + P_{10-i}(x_0) = 2P_5(x_0) = 0. ] This means at least one of (P_i(x_0)) or (P_{10-i}(x_0)) must be zero or both must be zero. Hence, in each pair among ((P_1, P_9), (P_2, P_8), (P_3, P_7), (P_4, P_6)), at least one polynomial must have a root. 10. **Counting the polynomials without roots:** If we can assert at least one polynomial in each of 4 pairs must have roots, this covers 4 pairs or (P_1 text{ to } P_8). Therefore, at most four of the nine polynomials might not have roots. 11. **Conclusion:** Thus, the greatest possible number of polynomials among the initial nine trinomials that do not have roots is: [ boxed{4} ]"},{"prompt":"A reduction of 30% in the price of oil enables a housewife to obtain 3 kgs more for Rs. 700.

The inequality x(x-a) < 0 implies that the product of x and (x-a) is negative. This means one of them is positive and the other is negative. Since we are looking for x values in the set M that are also in N, we focus on positive x values (since x=0 does not satisfy the inequality and x=-1 is not in the intersection). 4. Given that M cap N = {1,2}, we know that for these x values, x(x-a) < 0 must hold. This implies 0 < x < a because for x=1 and x=2 to satisfy the inequality, a must be greater than 2. 5.

Time = Distance / Relative speed Time = 1386 km / 990 km/h To convert km/h to km/min, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 990 km/h ÷ 60 = 16.5 km/min Now we can calculate the time in minutes: Time = 1386 km / 16.5 km/min Time ≈ 84 minutes So, if the projectiles manage to collide in mid-air, they will meet approximately boxed{84} minutes after they were launched."},{"prompt":"Lana and her friends go to a theater on the weekend to watch a new play.

According to the information given, there were two times more vehicles at the back than in the front, which means there were 2F cars in the back parking lot. The total number of cars at the theater when they arrived would be the sum of the cars in the front and the back parking lots, which is F + 2F = 3F. We are told that at the end of the play, the total number of cars was 700, and during the play, 300 more cars packed into the parking lot. This means that before the additional 300 cars arrived, there were 700 - 300 = 400 cars already at the theater. So, the total number of cars when Lana and her friends arrived (3F) must be equal to the number of cars before the additional 300 arrived: 3F = 400 To find the number of cars in the front parking lot (F), we divide both sides of the equation by 3: F = 400 / 3 F = 133.33 Since the number of cars cannot be a fraction, we round down to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a car in a parking lot.

Solar Panel: The car uses 75% as much fuel as it does now, so the fuel efficiency increases by 1 / 0.75 = 1.333... times. 2. Regenerative Braking: This reduces fuel consumption by an additional 15%, so the fuel efficiency increases by 1 / (1 - 0.15) = 1 / 0.85 = 1.17647 times. 3. Hybrid System: This contributes a 10% increase in overall fuel efficiency, so the fuel efficiency increases by 1 / (1 - 0.10) = 1 / 0.90 = 1.11111 times. Now, let's multiply these increases together to find the total increase in fuel efficiency: Total increase = 1.333... * 1.17647 * 1.11111 = 1.74216 times (approximately) The original fuel efficiency is 33 miles per gallon.

Prove that if the line ( MN ) is parallel to the diagonal of the quadrilateral, then either the quadrilateral can be circumscribed by a circle or two opposite angles of the quadrilateral are equal.","completion":"1. We start by noting the given condition: The line segment ( MN ), formed by the intersections of the angle bisectors of opposite sides of a convex quadrilateral, is parallel to one of the diagonals of the quadrilateral. 2. According to the given condition, we have: [ frac{AM}{MD} = frac{AN}{NB} ] 3. We can exploit the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the two segments created by the angle bisector is proportional to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle: [ frac{AM}{MD} = frac{AE}{DE} quad text{and} quad frac{AN}{NB} = frac{AF}{FB} ] 4. Thus, from the two equality relations derived from the Angle Bisector Theorem, we get: [ frac{AE}{DE} = frac{AF}{FB} ] 5. Expressing this proportionality as: [ frac{AE}{AF} = frac{DE}{FB} ] 6. We note that in triangles, sides opposite to equal angles are proportional. Specifically, in triangles ( AEF ) and ( DEF ), the sides are inversely proportional to the respective heights. Therefore: [ frac{VE}{FU} = frac{DE}{FB} ] Here, ( VE ) and ( FU ) are the heights of the areas from the vertices to the opposite sides in respective triangles. 7. Following this, we can derive: [ frac{VE}{DE} = frac{FU}{FB} ] 8. This implies that the angles subtended by these sides are equal. Hence, [ alpha = beta ] Or equivalently, the external angle formed by these is supplementary: [ alpha + beta = 180^circ ] 9. From these angle relations, we can deduce: [ angle B = angle D ] or [ angle B + angle D = 180^circ ] 10. Conclusion: The condition given implies that the quadrilateral either has opposite angles that are equal, or the sum of angles ( B ) and ( D ) equals ( 180^circ ).

Initially, with no lines (( n = 0 )), the plane is just one region: [ R(0) = 1 ] 3. **Adding the First Line:** Adding the first line ( (n=1) ) divides the plane into 2 regions because it simply cuts the plane into two halves: [ R(1) = 2 ] 4. **Adding the Second Line:** Adding the second line (( n = 2 )) can intersect the first line, dividing the plane into up to 4 regions: [ R(2) = 4 ] 5. **Observing the Pattern:** When a new line is added, it can intersect all previously drawn lines. Each intersection potentially creates a new segment, dividing the plane further: [ R(n+1) = R(n) + (n+1) ] 6. **Mathematical Induction for General Formula:** If we assume that ( R(n) ) follows the formula: [ R(n) = frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 ] We verify our induction: - Base case: [ R(0) = frac{0(0+1)}{2} + 1 = 1 ] - Inductive step: Assume ( R(k) = frac{k(k+1)}{2} + 1 ) holds.

Define: - ( A ): The subset of ( S ) formed by the primitive roots modulo ( p ). - ( B ): The subset of ( S ) formed by integers that are coprime with ( p-1 ). 2. **Function ( f ) and primitive roots:** Define the function ( f: S to S ) by ( f(n) = p - n ). Notice that ( f ) is a permutation of ( S ). We first verify that if ( a ) is a primitive root modulo ( p ), then ( p - a ) is also a primitive root. If ( a ) is a primitive root modulo ( p ), then ( a^r equiv 1 mod p ) implies ( r = p-1 ), the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo ( p ). If ( (p - a)^r equiv 1 mod p ), then: [ (p - a)^{2r} equiv 1 mod p ] Since ( 4 mid (p-1) ), it implies ( r ) must be even, thus ensuring that ((p-a)) maintains the same order, confirming it is a primitive root. Therefore, ( f(A) = A ). 3. **Counting intersections:** From our initial definitions and Euler's totient function, we have: [ |S| = p - 1, quad |A| = |f(A)| = varphi(p-1) ] 4. **Odd and Even counting:** Given ( p equiv 1 pmod{4} ), ( p-1 ) is even. Elements of ( B ) will be odd, and elements of ( f(B) ) will be even. Let's consider the intersections of these sets: [ |B cap f(B)| = 0 ] 5. **Union of subsets and Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Using the inclusion-exclusion principle for the union of sets ( A, B, f(B) ): [ |A cup B cup f(B)| = |A| + |B| + |f(B)| - |A cap B| - |A cap f(B)| - |B cap f(B)| + |A cap B cap f(B)| ] Since ( |B cap f(B)| = 0 ) and ( |A cap B cap f(B)| = 0 ), we get: [ |A cap f(B)| = |A cap B| ] Hence, [ |A cup B cup f(B)| = 3varphi(p-1) - 2|A cap B| ] 6. **Bounding intersections:** Since we know ( |S| geq |A cup B cup f(B)| ), we can derive: [ p - 1 geq 3varphi(p-1) - 2|A cap B| ] Simplifying this inequality: [ 2|A cap B| geq 3varphi(p-1) - (p - 1) ] Thus, [ |A cap B| geq frac{3varphi(p-1) - (p - 1)}{2} ] 7. **Conclusion:** Thus, there are at least ( frac{3varphi(p-1) - (p-1)}{2} ) integers ( k ) such that ( k ) is a primitive root modulo ( p ) and ((k, p-1) = 1), which completes the proof.

Let N be the second intersection of the diagonal AC with the circle passing through points B, M and the center of the circle inscribed in triangle BCM. 2. We need to prove that AN cdot NC = CD cdot BN. 3. First, note that since ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to 180^circ. Therefore, angle BDA = angle BCA. 4. Consider the circle passing through points B, M, and the center of the circle inscribed in triangle BCM. Let this circle intersect AC at N. 5. Since N lies on the circle passing through B, M, and the center of the circle inscribed in triangle BCM, we have angle BNM = 180^circ - angle BIM. 6. The angle angle BIM is given by 90^circ + frac{angle BCA}{2} because I is the incenter of triangle BCM. Therefore, [ angle BNM = 180^circ - (90^circ + frac{angle BCA}{2}) = 90^circ - frac{angle BCA}{2}. ] 7. Since angle BNM = 90^circ - frac{angle BCA}{2}, it follows that angle CNB = frac{angle BCA}{2}, implying that CN = BC. 8. Now, since angle BCA = angle BDA, triangles BDA and BCN are similar by AA similarity criterion. 9. From the similarity of triangles BDA and BCN, we have: [ frac{BN}{AB} = frac{NC}{BD}. ] 10. Rearranging the above equation, we get: [ BN = frac{NC}{BD} cdot AB. ] 11. Substituting BN into the equation AN cdot NC = CD cdot BN, we get: [ AN cdot NC = CD cdot left( frac{NC}{BD} cdot AB right). ] 12.

Find ( k ) and show that if ( frac{r}{h} = k ), then the body is in equilibrium if any point of the cap is in contact with the table.","completion":"1. **Definition and Setup**: Let ( S ) be a solid consisting of a circular cylinder with radius ( r ) and height ( h ), and a hemispherical cap attached to one end. The solid is placed such that the center of the hemispherical cap rests on the table, with the cylinder's axis being vertical. 2. **Determining the Vertical Displacement**: Define ( O ) as the center of the base of the hemispherical cap. As the solid rolls, ( O ) remains at a height ( r ) above the table. Consider a point ( P ) on the axis of the cylinder at a distance ( d ) from ( O ), inside the cap. When the solid rolls, the axis of the cylinder is tilted by an angle ( theta ) relative to the vertical. For a point ( P ) below ( O ) (inside the cap): [ text{Vertical displacement of } P = d cos theta. ] Hence, its height increases by ( d cos theta ). For a point above ( O ): [ text{Vertical displacement of } P = -d cos theta. ] Hence, its height decreases by ( d cos theta ). 3. **Condition for Stable, Neutral, and Unstable Equilibrium**: The equilibrium of the solid depends on the position of its center of mass relative to ( O ). Specifically: - **Stable Equilibrium** if the center of mass is below ( O ). - **Unstable Equilibrium** if the center of mass is above ( O ). - **Neutral Equilibrium** if the center of mass is at ( O ). 4. **Center of Mass Calculation**: The solid ( S ) consists of two parts: - The **hemispherical cap**. - The **cylindrical portion**. Assume the density of the material of the solid is (rho). - **Moment about the x-axis for the hemispherical cap**: The volume of the hemisphere is (frac{2}{3} pi r^3). The x-coordinate of the center of mass of a hemisphere (with respect to its base) is a distance (frac{3r}{8}) from the flat circular base. Therefore, the moment about an axis perpendicular to the x-axis passing through (O) is: [ int_0^r pi (r^2 - x^2) rho x , dx. ] This simplifies to: [ pi rho int_0^r x(r^2 - x^2) , dx = pi rho left[ frac{r^4}{4} right] = frac{pi rho r^4}{4}. ] - **Moment about the x-axis for the cylindrical portion**: The volume of the cylinder is (pi r^2 h). The center of mass of the cylindrical portion is at (frac{h}{2}) from ( O ). So, the moment due to the cylindrical portion is: [ (pi rho r^2 h) frac{h}{2} = frac{pi rho r^2 h^2}{2}. ] 5. **Equating the Moment to find ( k )**: For neutral equilibrium, the center of mass of the entire solid coincides with ( O ). Thus, balancing the moments of the hemispherical cap and the cylindrical portion: [ frac{pi rho r^4}{4} = frac{pi rho r^2 h^2}{2}. ] 6. **Solve for ( r/h )**: [ frac{r^4}{4} = frac{r^2 h^2}{2} ] [ r^4 = 2 r^2 h^2 ] [ r^2 = 2 h^2 ] [ left( frac{r}{h} right)^2 = 2 ] [ frac{r}{h} = sqrt{2}. ] 7. **Conclusion**: Thus, the constant ( k ) such that the equilibrium is neutral is ( sqrt{2} ). For stable, unstable, and neutral equilibrium: - Stable: ( frac{r}{h} > sqrt{2} ). - Unstable: ( frac{r}{h} < sqrt{2} ). - Neutral: ( frac{r}{h} = sqrt{2} ). Therefore, [ k = boxed{sqrt{2}} ] Additionally, if ( frac{r}{h} = sqrt{2} ), the center of mass is always at the same height above the table, ensuring the body is in equilibrium wherever it is tilted."},{"prompt":"ain is 700 meter long is running at a speed of 21 km / hour . in what time will it pass a bridge of 130 meter length ?","completion":"To calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge, we first need to determine the total distance the train needs to cover.

Length of the train = 700 meters Length of the bridge = 130 meters Total distance to cover = 700 meters + 130 meters = 830 meters Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the distance. Speed of the train = 21 km/h To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, 21 km/h = 21 * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) 21 km/h = 21 * (1000 / 3600) m/s 21 km/h = 21 * (5 / 18) m/s 21 km/h = 5.8333 m/s (approximately) Now we have the speed in meters per second and the distance in meters.

Since a and b are both positive numbers that satisfy the equation ab = a + 9b + 7, we can rearrange the equation to isolate a: a = frac{9b + 7}{b - 1} 2.

Consider each integer point ((x, y, z)). Define the function ( r(a) ) which gives the remainder when integer ( a ) is divided by 3. Thus, ( r(x) ), ( r(y) ), and ( r(z) ) are the remainders of ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) respectively when divided by 3. 2. Since each of ( r(x) ), ( r(y) ), and ( r(z) ) can take any value from ({0, 1, 2}), we are dealing with a total of (3 times 3 times 3 = 27) different combinations of ((r(x), r(y), r(z))). 3. Using the pigeonhole principle, if we have 37 points, there must be at least one combination of remainders ((r(x), r(y), r(z))) that corresponds to at least leftlceil frac{37}{27} rightlceil = 2 text{ points}. Actually, because 37 is greater than (2 times 27), there must be at least leftlceil frac{37}{3} rightlceil = 13 text{ points} that share the same (r(x)). 4. From these 13 points, applying the pigeonhole principle again to the ((r(y), r(z))) coordinates, one of the pairs must repeat at least leftlceil frac{13}{3} rightlceil = 5 text{ points}. Hence, there are at least 5 points sharing the same ( (r(x), r(y)) ). 5. Among these 5 points, again using the pigeonhole principle on the (r(z)) coordinate, there must be at least ( leftlceil frac{5}{3} rightlceil = 2 ) points to share the same (r(z)). 6. Therefore, if 5 is greater than (2 times 3), then we need at least leftlceil frac{5}{3} rightlceil = 2. More precisely, three points share the same ((r(x), r(y), r(z))). So, we found 3 points having the same remainders modulo 3. Denote these points by ((x_1, y_1, z_1)), ((x_2, y_2, z_2)), and ((x_3, y_3, z_3)). 7. Finally, evaluating the centroid (center of mass) of the triangle formed by these points: Cx = frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, quad Cy = frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3}, quad Cz = frac{z_1 + z_2 + z_3}{3}. Since (x_1 equiv x_2 equiv x_3 pmod{3}), (y_1 equiv y_2 equiv y_3 pmod{3}), and (z_1 equiv z_2 equiv z_3 pmod{3}), the sums (x_1 + x_2 + x_3), (y_1 + y_2 + y_3), and (z_1 + z_2 + z_3) are multiples of 3. Therefore, (Cx), (Cy), and (Cz) are all integers. Conclusively, the centroid is also an integer point. Thus there exists at least one such combination among the 37 points. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A shooter is conducting shooting practice. The probability of hitting the target each time is frac{2}{3}.

Let's denote this angle as ( alpha ): [ angle(l, AP) = alpha ] 3. **Geometry of Circle Intersections**: Considering the angles subtended in different parts of the second circle, we note that ( angle(AQ, PQ) ) is the same as ( angle(BC, PB) ) because both these angles are enclosed in the same segment formed by the second circle (where (P) and (Q) are the endpoints): [ angle(AQ, PQ) = alpha quad text{(corresponding angles in the second circle)} ] 4. **Transitivity and Conclusion**: Therefore, the angle between line ( BC ) and ( PB ) is equal to the angle between the tangent ( l ) and ( AP ): [ angle(BC, PB) = alpha = angle(l, AP) ] 5. **Parallel Lines**: By the converse of the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, if two lines intersected by a transversal form equal alternate interior angles, then the two lines are parallel. Hence, line ( l ), the tangent at ( A ), must be parallel to line ( BC ): [ l parallel BC ] In conclusion, the tangent line at point (A) to the first circle is parallel to the line (BC).

Find the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC if the radius of the inscribed circle is 15.","completion":": 1. Given a triangle ( ABC ) with ( AB = 40 ), and the incenter ( I ) of the triangle divides the angle bisector ( AL ) in the ratio ( 5:3 ). We need to find the circumradius ( R ) of the triangle if the radius of the inscribed circle ( r ) is 15. 2. By the property of angle bisectors, in the triangle ( ALB ), we have: [ frac{AI}{IL} = frac{AB}{BL} = frac{5}{3} ] From this ratio, we get: [ BL = frac{3 times AB}{5} = frac{3 times 40}{5} = 24 ] 3. We know that the area of the triangle can also be expressed as: [ AB times BL times sin angle B = 2 times text{Area of } triangle ALB ] 4. However, the area can also be decomposed as: [ 2 times text{Area of } triangle AIB + 2 times text{Area of } triangle BIL ] Using the known radius ( r ): [ 2 (text{Area of } triangle AIB + text{Area of } triangle BIL) = AB cdot r + BL cdot r = (AB + BL) cdot r ] 5. Therefore, [ AB times BL times sin angle B = (AB + BL) cdot r ] Plugging in the known values: [ 40 times 24 times sin angle B = (40 + 24) times 15 ] Simplifying: [ 960 times sin angle B = 64 times 15 = 960 Rightarrow sin angle B = 1 Rightarrow angle B = 90^circ ] 6. Since (angle B = 90^circ), (ABC) is a right triangle. By the property of angle bisectors in right triangles, we can determine the sides divided by ( C I ): [ frac{AC}{CL} = frac{AI}{IL} = frac{5}{3} ] Let (CL = 3x), then (AC = 5x). 7. According to the Pythagorean theorem: [ AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 Rightarrow 40^2 + (24 + 3x)^2 = (5x)^2 ] 8.

So, the amount of water in the new mixture is 20% of 45 liters, which is (20/100) * 45 = 9 liters. Now, we can set up an equation with the initial amount of water and the added water to equal the total amount of water in the new mixture: Initial amount of water + Added water = Total amount of water in the new mixture (P/100) * 40 + 5 = 9 Now, we solve for P: (P/100) * 40 = 9 - 5 (P/100) * 40 = 4 P * 40 = 4 * 100 P * 40 = 400 P = 400 / 40 P = 10 Therefore, the initial percentage of water in the mixture was boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"Vanessa wants to buy a dress she saw at the mall, which costs 120, and she already has 25 in savings.

Let the number on the blackboard be denoted by N. 2. **Strategy for Leading Zeros**: If player B writes a leading 0, player A also writes a leading 0. This process continues until B writes a non-zero digit. 3. **Non-Leading Zero Case**: When B writes a non-zero digit, there must exist a digit i < 9 such that: [ 10N + i equiv 2 pmod{4} quad text{and} quad 10N + (i + 1) equiv 3 pmod{4} ] Player A will then write a terminal i or (i + 1) on N to create 10N + i or 10N + (i + 1) respectively. 4. **Quadratic Residues Modulo 4**: The only quadratic residues modulo 4 are 0 and 1.

This means that at most one of 10N + i and 10N + (i + 1) will allow B to create a perfect square. Player A simply chooses the one of these two numbers which does not allow B to create a perfect square.

There is a way to travel between any two cities either via a direct flight or via a sequence of connecting flights. 2. For every pair (A, B) of cities that are connected by a direct flight, there is another city C such that (A, C) and (B, C) are connected by direct flights. Step-by-step solution: Consider a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices representing the ( n ) cities, such that two vertices are connected by an edge if there is a two-way flight between them. We need to ensure this graph is connected and every edge in ( G ) belongs to a triangle. We will prove that if ( G ) is connected and every edge in ( G ) belongs to a triangle, then ( G ) must have at least ( leftlfloor frac{3n - 2}{2} rightrfloor ) edges. We call such a graph a ( T )-graph. Let ( a_n ) be the minimum number of edges of a ( T )-graph with ( n ) vertices and ( b_n = leftlfloor frac{3n - 2}{2} rightrfloor ). Step 1: Show that ( a_n leq b_n ) for ( n geq 3 ). We will use explicit construction: - For ( n = 3 ), it is clear that ( a_3 = b_3 = 3 ). - If ( n = 2m + 1 ) is odd, we form ( m ) triangles sharing one common vertex. This configuration results in ( 3m ) edges. Therefore, ( a_n leq 3m = b_n ). - If ( n = 2m ) is even, we first construct the above ( T )-graph with ( 2m - 1 ) vertices, which has ( 3(m - 1) ) edges. Then, we add a new vertex and connect it to the vertices of one edge from the ( T )-graph, adding 2 more edges. This totals to ( 3(m - 1) + 2 = 3m - 1 ) edges. Therefore, ( a_n leq 3m - 1 = b_n ). Step 2: Show that ( a_n geq b_n ) for ( n geq 3 ). This is done via strong induction: - Base cases for ( n = 3 ) and ( n = 4 ) can be easily verified and match the configurations leading to ( a_n = b_n ). - **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume ( a_k = b_k ) for all ( k < n ). Consider a ( T )-graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices and assume it has fewer than ( b_n ) edges, ( a_n < b_n ). Then: - By induction assumption, ( a_{n-1} = b_{n-1} ). - **Claim**: There is a vertex in ( G ) of degree 2. Suppose not. - Given ( G ) is connected, each vertex has degree at least 1, which includes every edge forming triangles, resulting in every vertex having degree at least 3. - Sum of degrees ( geq 3n ). - However, sum of degrees ( = 2 times text{number of edges} < 2b_n < 3n ) (since ( b_n = leftlfloor frac{3n-2}{2} rightrfloor )), leading to a contradiction. By this verification, assume ( v ) is a vertex of degree 2 in ( G ), part of a triangle ( u,v,w ): - If the edge ( uw ) is in another triangle, delete ( v ) and edges ( uv, vw ) leading to a ( T )-graph with ( n - 1 ) vertices, at ( a_n - 2 < b_n - 2 leq b_{n-1} ), a contradiction. Therefore, ( uw ) belongs to no other triangles. - Contract edge ( uw ) resulting in new vertex ( x ), in ( G^prime ) with ( n - 2 ) vertices, reducing edges by 3. Thus, ( G^prime ) contradicts inductive hypothesis: [ a_n - 3 < b_n - 3 leq b_{n-2} ] This guarantees ( a_n geq b_n ). Combining both steps confirms ( a_n = b_n ).

For ( Q(x) = x^0 = 1 ), we need to show: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} frac{!i cdot P_0(i)}{i!(n-i)!} = 1 ] Since ( P_0(i) = 1 ) for all ( i ), this simplifies to: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} frac{!i}{i!(n-i)!} ] Recognizing that ( binom{n}{i} = frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!} ), we rewrite the sum as: [ frac{1}{n!} sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{n}{i} !i ] The term ( binom{n}{i} !i ) counts the number of permutations of ( n ) elements with exactly ( n-i ) fixed points. Summing over all ( i ) gives the total number of permutations of ( n ) elements, which is ( n! ). Thus: [ frac{1}{n!} sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{n}{i} !i = frac{n!}{n!} = 1 ] This proves the base case. 3. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for all polynomials of degree less than ( k ). We need to show it holds for ( Q(x) = x^k ). 4. **Double Counting ( S_k ):** Let ( S_i ) be the number of ( i+1 ) tuples of the form ( (sigma, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_i) ) where ( sigma ) is a permutation with at most ( n-i ) fixed points of ( [n] ) and ( a_1, ldots, a_i ) are non-fixed points in ( sigma ). 5. **Counting ( S_k ):** We count ( S_k ) in two ways: - First, by summing over all ( i ): [ S_k = sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{n}{i} !i P_k(n) ] - Second, by inclusion-exclusion principle: [ S_k = (n(n-1)cdots (n-k+1)) left( n! - k(n-1)! + cdots + (-1)^j binom{k}{j} (n-j)! + cdots + (-1)^k (n-k)! right) ] 6. **Simplifying the Expression:** Dividing by ( n! ), we get: [ frac{1}{n!} sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{n}{i} !i P_k(n) = frac{1}{(n-k)!} left( n! - k(n-1)! + cdots + (-1)^j binom{k}{j} (n-j)! + cdots + (-1)^k (n-k)! right) ] This is a polynomial in ( n ) with integer coefficients and degree ( k ) with leading coefficient 1. 7. **Combining Results:** Since ( x^{k-1}, ldots, 1 ) can all be written as a linear combination of ( P_0(x), ldots, P_{k-1}(x) ), we can write: [ frac{1}{n!} sum_{i=0}^{n} binom{n}{i} !i (P_k(x) + R(n)) = n^k ] where ( R(n) ) can be written as a linear combination of ( P_0(n), ldots, P_{k-1}(n) ). 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, ( n^k ) can be written using a linear combination of ( P_0(n), ldots, P_k(n) ).

Consider a parallelepiped with a circumscribed sphere. The sphere intersects a plane of any face of the parallelepiped in a circle such that the vertices of the face lie on this circle. This means each face of the parallelepiped is a cyclic quadrilateral (quadrilateral inscribed in a circle). For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, its opposite angles must be supplementary; that is, they must add up to 180^circ. In a parallelogram (which is the shape of the faces of a general parallelepiped), the opposite angles are equal and thus must both be 90^circ to add up to 180^circ. Therefore, each face of the parallelepiped must be a rectangle. Since all faces of the parallelepiped are rectangles, the parallelepiped is indeed a rectangular parallelepiped or a cuboid. **Step 2**: Show that if a cuboid has an inscribed sphere, then it must be a cube. A cuboid has an inscribed sphere if the distance between opposite faces is the same for all three pairs of opposite faces. This is because the radius of the inscribed sphere must be the same in all directions inside the cuboid. For a cuboid, the distance between opposite faces is determined by the lengths of the edges perpendicular to these faces. Therefore, the condition for having an inscribed sphere is that all three edge lengths must be equal.

For the vase: The discount is 35% of 200, so: Discount = 35/100 * 200 = 70 Sale price = Original price - Discount = 200 - 70 = 130 For the set of teacups: The discount is 20% of 300, so: Discount = 20/100 * 300 = 60 Sale price = Original price - Discount = 300 - 60 = 240 The decorative plate has no discount, so its sale price remains 500. Now, let's calculate the sales tax for each item. For the vase: Sales tax = 10% of 130 = 10/100 * 130 = 13 For the set of teacups: Sales tax = 8% of 240 = 8/100 * 240 = 19.20 For the decorative plate: Sales tax = 10% of 500 = 10/100 * 500 = 50 Now, let's add up the sale prices and the sales taxes for each item to find the total amount Donna paid. Total amount paid = (Sale price of vase + Sales tax for vase) + (Sale price of teacups + Sales tax for teacups) + (Sale price of decorative plate + Sales tax for decorative plate) Total amount paid = (130 + 13) + (240 + 19.20) + (500 + 50) Total amount paid = 143 + 259.20 + 550 Total amount paid = 952.20 Donna paid a total of boxed{952.20} for all three porcelain items."},{"prompt":"The Ponde family's Powerjet pumps 350 gallons of water per hour.

For x in [1, e], we have g'(x) geqslant 0, indicating that g(x) is monotonically increasing on this interval. - The maximum value of g(x) on [1, e] is at x = e, so g(e) = e - 1. 2. **Analyze f(x):** - The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 1 - frac{a^2}{x^2}. Setting f'(x) = 0 gives x = a, assuming a > 0. 3. **Case Analysis for a:** - **Case 1:** When 0 < a < 1, f(x) is monotonically increasing on [1, e]. The minimum value of f(x) on this interval is f(1) = 1 + a^2. For f(x_1) geqslant g(x_2) to hold for any x_1, x_2 in [1, e], we need 1 + a^2 geqslant e - 1.

The cost of running the ice maker per cube: Since it takes 1 hour to make 10 cubes and every hour costs 1.50, the cost of running the ice maker for one cube is 1.50 / 10 = 0.15.

Based on these scenarios, the largest number of acute angles an octagon can effectively sustain, without exceeding partial evaluations, can be extended to four.

For simplicity, we assume the side length of the larger square is 2 units. Consequently, the side length of the smaller square is 2x units, where x is a positive number we need to find. 2. **Determine Lengths Using Geometry**: The distance OA is the radius of the circle plus half the side of the smaller square, which gives us OA = 1 + 2x. The length AB is simply the half side length of the smaller square, so AB = x. The length OB, being a radius of the circle, can be determined by the diagonal of the larger square. Since the larger square has a side length of 2, its diagonal length is 2sqrt{2}, and thus the radius of the circle (half the diagonal) is OB = sqrt{2}. 3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**: In the right triangle triangle OAB, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between OA, AB, and OB: [ OA^2 + AB^2 = OB^2 ] Substituting the lengths we have: [ (1+2x)^2 + x^2 = (sqrt{2})^2 ] Simplifying this equation: [ 1 + 4x + 4x^2 + x^2 = 2 ] Which simplifies further to: [ 5x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. 4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**: Solving this quadratic equation, we find: [ (5x-1)(x+1) = 0 ] This gives us two possible solutions for x: x = -1 or x = frac{1}{5}.

The area of the smaller square is then (frac{2}{5})^2 = frac{4}{25}. The area of the larger square, with side length 2, is 2^2 = 4. The ratio of the area of the smaller square to the larger square is: [ frac{frac{4}{25}}{4} = frac{1}{25} ] Converting this ratio into a percentage gives us 4%.

We are interested in finding the range of x for which f(x) increases as x increases. To do this, we examine the first derivative of f(x) with respect to x: f'(x)=frac{1}{2x+1}-frac{1}{200} Simplifying this expression gives us: f'(x)=frac{199-2x}{200(2x+1)} For f(x) to be increasing, f'(x) geq 0. Thus, we have: frac{199-2x}{200(2x+1)} geq 0 This inequality is satisfied when: 199-2x geq 0 Solving for x gives: x leq 99.5 Since x > 0, we conclude that the range of x for which the actual processing fee increases with the increase of x is: x in left(0,99.5right] So, the enterprise's processing fee increases continuously with x when the amount of the processing product order x is within this range.

Since h'(x) < 0 for x in [10,20], h(x) is monotonically decreasing in this interval. This implies g(x) is also monotonically decreasing in [10,20].

To convert the given polar coordinate equation rho^2costheta - rho = 0, we factor out the rho term: rho(rhocostheta - 1) = 0. This yields two cases: 1. rho = 0, which corresponds to the origin in rectangular coordinates. 2. rhocostheta = 1, which in rectangular coordinates (where x = rhocostheta) corresponds to x = 1. So the rectangular coordinate equation can be written as x^2 + y^2 = 0 or x = 1. Since x^2 + y^2 = 0 only holds true for x = y = 0, we can omit this as it represents a single point (the origin), which is also included in the equation x = 1.

This gives us: - a + b > c - a + c > b - b + c > a Step 2: Analyze the given expression. We are given the expression |a-b-c|-|c-a+b|. To simplify this, we need to consider the signs of the expressions inside the absolute value symbols based on the properties of triangle side lengths. Step 3: Determine the sign of a-b-c and c-a+b. From the triangle inequality theorem: - a < b + c implies a - b - c < 0. - Similarly, c < a + b implies c - a + b > 0. Step 4: Simplify the expression based on the signs.

We need to construct a straight line that divides the triangle into two polygons with equal circumscribed circle radii. Step 1: Assume the problem is solved. There are two primary scenarios to consider: 1. **Case 1: The sought line BD divides the triangle into two smaller triangles (see Figure a).** - Consider the triangles ABD and BDC. Since the angles formed are equal, i.e., sin angle ADB = sin angle BDC, and the radii of the circumscribed circles around the triangles ABD and BDC are equal, it implies that the sides AB and BC must also be equal. - Therefore, such a division is possible only for an isosceles triangle. 2. **Case 2: The sought line ML divides the triangle into a triangle and a quadrilateral (see Figure a).** - The quadrilateral AMLC being cyclic implies angle MAL = angle MCL. Since the radii of the circumscribed circles are equal, angle ABC = angle MAL = angle MCL. This situation can occur only if angle ABC is the smallest angle of the triangle. Step 2: From these considerations, for an arbitrary triangle ABC, one potential construction approach is outlined as follows: - Let angle ABC be the smallest angle of the triangle (see Figure a). - Construct rays AL and CM such that angle BAL = angle BCM = angle ABC = alpha. Points M and L should lie on the sides of the triangle. - The line MK is the required line. Conclusion: If the triangle is not isosceles, the solution is unique.

The formula for the volume of a cone is: [ V_{cone} = frac{1}{3} pi r^2 h ] where r = 10 inches is the radius and h = 10 inches is the height of the cone.

What is the weight he uses?","completion":"Let's assume the cost price of the goods is 1 per kilogram. Since the shopkeeper makes a 25% profit, he sells the goods at 1.25 per kilogram. However, he is actually using a different weight instead of a kilogram to make this profit. Let's call the weight he uses \\"x\\" kilograms. So, when he sells what he claims to be 1 kilogram of goods, he is actually selling x kilograms, and he is making a profit of 25%. This means that the cost of x kilograms of goods should be 1 (the cost price), and the selling price of x kilograms of goods should be 1.25. The profit can be calculated as: Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price 0.25 = 1.25 - 1 Now, we need to find the value of x that would make the cost price of x kilograms equal to 1. Since the shopkeeper is making a 25% profit, the actual weight he is giving for 1.25 must be less than 1 kilogram. We can set up the equation: Cost Price / Actual Weight = Cost Price per Kilogram 1 / x = 1 Solving for x: x = 1 But we know that x must be less than 1 kilogram for the shopkeeper to make a profit. Since the profit is 25%, the actual weight x must be such that when sold at the cost price per kilogram, it results in a 25% increase when sold as 1 kilogram. So, we can set up the equation: 1.25 = 1 / x Solving for x: x = 1 / 1.25 x = 0.8 Therefore, the weight the shopkeeper uses is boxed{0.8} kilograms instead of 1 kilogram.

We need to consider the critical points where the maximum occurs. 3. **Analyzing the Critical Points:** Examine if there are points of tangency (critical points) near c, on both sides. - If we move c slightly towards the side where there are more points of tangency (local minima), let's denote this side as the side with higher density of these points. - Increase c if there are more local minima on the right side. - Conversely, if there are more local minima on the left side, decrease c. 4. **Effect of Shifting:** After shifting c, if necessary, the element c still remains the maximum in the set A_P, as the critical points and the interaction patterns (crossings) do not change significantly in their nature. 5. **Parity Consideration:** Analyze the nature of the intersections and their corresponding counts. Specifically, look at the even and odd properties of these counts.

Find the smallest positive integer n such that if E contains at least n elements, then E must include 908 twoelement subsets, each consisting of two line segments sharing a common endpoint, and no two subsets have any common elements.","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to find the minimum integer n such that if the set E of line segments between 2019 points in space has at least n elements, then E must contain at least 908 pairs of adjacent line segments, where each pair has a common endpoint, and any two pairs are disjoint. We start by introducing a lemma: **Lemma**: If G = (V, E) is a simple connected graph, then G contains at least leftlfloor frac{|E|}{2} rightrfloor pairs of adjacent edges (angles) such that the pairs do not share any edges. To prove this lemma, we use induction on the number of edges |E|: 1. **Base Cases**: - For |E| = 0, 1, 2, or 3, it's easy to verify the lemma holds as there are trivially leftlfloor frac{|E|}{2} rightrfloor = 0 or 1 pairs. 2. **Inductive Step**: - Suppose |E| geq 4, and the lemma holds for all graphs with fewer than |E| edges. - Consider the longest path P = v_1v_2 cdots v_k in G. Since G is connected, k geq 3. **Case 1**: deg(v_1) geq 2: - Assume v_1 has neighbors among v_2, ldots, v_k. - Let v_1 v_i be an edge, 3 leq i leq k. - Then {v_1 v_2, v_1 v_i} form an angle. - Deleting these two edges, test if the remaining graph is connected: It either remains connected or makes v_1 isolated, leaving the rest connected. Thus, there's a connected component with |E|-2 edges. **Case 2**: deg(v_1) = 1 and deg(v_2) = 2: - Here, {v_1 v_2, v_2 v_3} form a valid angle. - By removing these edges, v_1 and v_2 become isolated. - The remaining graph is still connected, containing |E|-2 edges. **Case 3 and 4**: - These cases similarly show consistency with the above process of edge removal, confirming the remaining graph maintains a connected component of |E|-2 edges. Thus, the theorem is proven by induction. Returning to the original problem: 1. **Estimate the lower bound for n**: - There are 2019 vertices, and we construct a graph G = (V, E). - Use combinatorial methods to distribute edges such that they comply with the given conditions. 2. **Construct a test graph**: - Let V be {v_1, v_2, ldots, v_{2019}}. - Connect the first 61 vertices in pairs, forming 1815 edges, maintaining the connectivity. Remove 15 edges arbitrarily. - For the remaining 1958 vertices, pair them, yielding 979 edges. This setup totals 1815 + 979 = 2794 edges. Given our constraints and constructions: n geq 2795: - Ensure all angle pairs are covered. - Verification through combinatorial principles confirms leftlfloor frac{2795}{2} rightrfloor = 907, satisfying our designed setup minimally.

Hence, ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ) are not solutions. - We consider ( n > 2 ). 2. **Key Step**: - We need to show that for all primes ( p leq sqrt{n} ), ( p mid n ). Suppose otherwise, i.e., there exists a prime ( p < sqrt{n} ) such that ( p nmid n ). - Since ( gcd(p^2, n) = 1 ) and ( p^2 < n ), ( p^2 in A_n ). This contradicts the fact that ( A_n ) consists only of primes. Therefore, for all primes ( p leq sqrt{n} ), ( p mid n ). 3. **Sufficiency of the Condition**: - We need to show that if ( p mid n ) for all primes ( p leq sqrt{n} ), then all elements of ( A_n ) are prime. - Pick any ( t in A_n ). We will show that ( t ) is prime. - Clearly, ( t > sqrt{n} ) because ( p mid n ) for all ( p leq sqrt{n} ). - If ( t ) is not prime, then let ( q ) be its smallest prime factor. Since ( q leq sqrt{t} < sqrt{n} ), ( q mid n ), which contradicts ( q in A_n ). Hence, ( t ) must be prime. 4. **Finding ( n )**: - We need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that for all primes ( p leq sqrt{n} ), ( p mid n ). - For ( n > 40 ), we have ( n < pi(sqrt{n})! ). This is because ( n! > left(frac{n}{2}right)^{frac{n}{2}} ) and ( pi(n) > frac{n-1}{2 ln n} ). - Therefore, it is not possible to have all primes ( p < sqrt{n} ) dividing ( n ) for ( n > 40 ), as otherwise ( n geq prod_{p leq sqrt{n}} p > pi(sqrt{n})! > n ), a contradiction. - Thus, ( n leq 40 ). 5. **Checking ( n leq 40 )**: - We check each ( n leq 40 ) to see if all elements of ( A_n ) are prime. - The solutions are ( n = 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30 ).

We can express a as 2k + 1 where k is a natural number. To represent a as a sum of three numbers whose product is a perfect square, consider the sum: [ a = k + k + 1 ] Here, the three numbers are k, k, and 1. The product of these three numbers is: [ k cdot k cdot 1 = k^2 ] Since k^2 is a perfect square, we see that any odd natural number a starting from 3 can be represented in the desired form (i.e., a = k + k + 1). 2. **Case 2: Even Natural Number a** Suppose the natural number a is even. We can express a as 2k where k is a natural number. To represent a as a sum of three numbers whose product is a perfect square, consider the sum: [ a = (k-2) + (k-2) + 4 ] Here, the three numbers are (k-2), (k-2), and 4. The product of these three numbers is: [ (k-2) cdot (k-2) cdot 4 = (k-2)^2 cdot 4 ] Given that 4 itself is 2^2, we have: [ (k-2)^2 cdot 4 = ((k-2) cdot 2)^2 ] Therefore, the product is a perfect square. This logic holds for even numbers where k > 2. So, for k leq 2 (i.e., a = 2 or a = 4), we need to analyze these values separately. Special Cases: - If k = 1 (i.e., a = 2), the sum would be: [ a = 1 + 1 + 0 ] But 0 is not a natural number. - If k = 2 (i.e., a = 4), the sum would be: [ a = 2 + 2 + 0 ] Again, 0 is not a natural number. Checking a = 1: - For a = 1, it is clear that: [ 1 = 1 + 0 + 0 ] But 0 is not a natural number, so 1 cannot be represented as required.

This implies ( C_iB ) is the only diameter with ( C_i ) as an endpoint. 5. **Counting Endpoints**: Each point ( B ) that is an endpoint of ( k geq 2 ) diameters can be associated with ( k-2 ) points that are endpoints of exactly one diameter, thereby significantly limiting the number of pairs. 6. **Inequality Involving Diameters**: Assume that each point ( A_i ) is an endpoint of exactly ( k_i geq 0 ) diameters, with ( k_1, k_2, ldots, k_s geq 2 ), and ( k_{s+1}, ldots, k_n leq 1 ) where ( s ) represents the number of points that are endpoints of at least 2 diameters. 7. **Summing Up Endpoints**: The total number ( D ) of diameters must satisfy the inequality: [ 2D leq k_1 + k_2 + cdots + k_s + (n-s) ] Considering the earlier association, we get: [ (k_1 - 2) + (k_2 - 2) + cdots + (k_s - 2) leq n - s ] Thus: [ k_1 + k_2 + cdots + k_s leq n + s ] 8. **Combining Inequalities**: [ 2D leq (n+s) + (n-s) = 2n ] This implies that the total number of diameters (and thus the number of pairs of points at distance ( d )) is at most ( n ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{The , number , of , pairs , of , points , whose , distance , is , equal , to , d , is , less , than , or , equal , to , n} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the sequence of positive terms {a_n} that satisfies a_{n+1}(a_{n+1}2a_{n})=9a_{n}^{2}, and a_{1}=1, find the value of a_{10}.","completion":"From a_{n+1}(a_{n+1}-2a_{n})=9-a_{n}^{2}, we have a_{n+1}^{2}-2a_{n+1}a_{n}+a_{n}^{2}=9, which simplifies to (a_{n+1}-a_{n})^{2}=9, so a_{n+1}-a_{n}=±3.

Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. 2. There are 6 jaguars in the forest. 3. Therefore, the total number of snakes eaten by all jaguars per day is 6 jaguars * 5 snakes/jaguar = 30 snakes per day. 4.

We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain all four balls. 2. **Geometric Configuration:** The centers of the four balls form a regular tetrahedron with side length equal to twice the radius of the balls, i.e., 2 units. This is because each ball touches the other three, and the distance between the centers of any two balls is the sum of their radii (1 + 1 = 2). 3. **Finding the Center of the Tetrahedron:** The center of the smallest sphere containing all four balls will be the centroid of the tetrahedron. The centroid of a regular tetrahedron is equidistant from all its vertices. 4. **Distance from a Vertex to the Centroid:** To find the radius of the sphere, we need the distance from a vertex of the tetrahedron to its centroid. For a regular tetrahedron with side length ( a ), the distance from a vertex to the centroid is given by: [ d = frac{a sqrt{3}}{3} ] Here, ( a = 2 ), so: [ d = frac{2 sqrt{3}}{3} ] 5. **Height of the Tetrahedron:** The height ( h ) of the tetrahedron (distance from a vertex to the opposite face) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the triangle formed by the height, the centroid, and the midpoint of a side: [ h = sqrt{a^2 - left(frac{a sqrt{3}}{3}right)^2} = sqrt{4 - frac{4}{3}} = sqrt{frac{8}{3}} ] 6. **Distance from the Centroid to the Center of the Sphere:** The distance from the centroid of the tetrahedron to the center of the sphere is half the height of the tetrahedron: [ OP = frac{sqrt{frac{8}{3}}}{2} = frac{sqrt{6}}{2} ] 7. **Radius of the Sphere:** The radius of the sphere containing all four balls is the distance from the centroid to a vertex plus the radius of one ball: [ R = frac{sqrt{6}}{2} + 1 ] 8. **Simplifying the Expression:** [ R = frac{sqrt{6}}{2} + frac{2}{2} = frac{sqrt{6} + 2}{2} ] Therefore, the radius of the smallest sphere containing all four balls is: [ boxed{frac{sqrt{6} + 2}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"For any set of points A_1, A_2,...,A_n on the plane, one defines r( A_1, A_2,...,A_n) as the radius of the smallest circle that contains all of these points.

This is because the smallest circle containing all points must also contain any subset of those points. 2. **Define ( M )**: Let ( M = max_{1 le i < j < k le n} r(A_i, A_j, A_k) ). This ( M ) represents the maximum radius of the smallest circle that can be formed by any three points from the set ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n} ). 3. **Claim**: We claim that ( r(A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n) = M ). 4. **Construct Discs**: For each ( 1 le i le n ), let ( Omega_i ) denote the closed disc of radius ( M ) centered at ( A_i ). 5. **Common Intersection**: By the definition of ( M ), we know that for any three points ( A_x, A_y, A_z ) from the set, the radius of the smallest circle containing these three points is at most ( M ). Therefore, any three of the discs ( Omega_i ) must have a common intersection point. 6. **Helly's Theorem**: By Helly's theorem, if in a finite collection of convex sets in (mathbb{R}^2), every three of them have a common intersection, then all the sets have a common intersection. Applying this theorem, we conclude that all the discs ( Omega_i ) share a common point ( O ). 7. **Circle Centered at ( O )**: The circle centered at ( O ) with radius ( M ) contains all the points ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ). Hence, ( r(A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n) le M ). 8. **Equality**: Since ( r(A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n) ) is the radius of the smallest circle containing all points, it must be at least ( M ). Therefore, ( r(A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n) ge M ). 9. **Conclusion**: Combining the inequalities, we get ( r(A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n) = M ).

Here's how we can do it: 1. Divide the 30 horses into 6 groups of 5 horses each. Race each group, which will take 6 races. After these races, we'll have the fastest horse from each group, but we won't know how they compare to the fastest horses from the other groups. 2. Take the winners of each of the 6 groups and race them against each other. This will be the 7th race. The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall. Now, we need to determine the 2nd to 5th fastest horses. The 2nd to 5th fastest horses could be among the following: - The 2nd and 3rd place horses from the race of group winners (since the 1st place is the fastest overall). - The 2nd to 5th place horses from the group of the overall fastest horse (since they could be faster than the winners of the other groups). - The 2nd and 3rd place horses from the group of the 2nd fastest horse in the race of group winners (since they could be faster than the 3rd fastest horse's group members and the other groups' winners). We don't need to consider the horses from the groups of the 4th, 5th, and 6th place horses in the race of group winners because they cannot be in the top 5 overall (they were beaten by horses that were beaten by the top 3). So, we have the following horses to race: - 2 horses from the group of the overall fastest horse (2nd and 3rd place in that group). - 2 horses from the group of the 2nd fastest horse in the race of group winners (2nd and 3rd place in that group). - 1 horse from the group of the 3rd fastest horse in the race of group winners (2nd place in that group).

Consider a segment of the 13-segment closed polygonal chain. This segment can be intersected by at most 10 other segments, as there are a total of 13 segments and 3 of them (the segment itself and its two neighboring segments) cannot intersect it. 2. Therefore, the number of intersection points on our segment cannot exceed 10. 3. Each intersection point is counted twice when considering it from the perspective of both intersecting segments. Thus, the total number of intersection points is calculated by: [ text{Total intersection points} = frac{13 cdot 10}{2} = 65 ] This represents the 65 points of self-intersection. 4. It is possible for a 13-segment closed polygonal chain to achieve this maximum number of intersections. For example, if we imagine a star-shaped regular 13-gon, where each pair of non-adjacent segments intersect, we can achieve this maximum number. 5. Therefore, the maximum number of self-intersection points for a 13-segment closed polygonal chain is: [ boxed{65} ] Part b) Determining the maximum number of self-intersection points for a 1950-segment closed polygonal chain 1.

However, for even n, while it similarly adheres to: [ frac{n(n-3)}{2} ] the structure of the intersections changes slightly, allowing an additional point when n is even. Therefore, for even n, the formula becomes: [ frac{n(n-4)}{2} + 1 ] 4. Applying this to our case where n = 1950: [ text{Maximum number of self-intersection points} = frac{1950 cdot 1946}{2} + 1 ] 5.

The possible distributions are either 2 people in one office and 1 person in each of the other two offices, or all 4 people in one office. However, the latter violates the condition that each office must have at least one person. Therefore, we only consider the scenario where 2 people are in one office and 1 person in each of the other two offices. For the scenario where 2 people are in one office and 1 person in each of the other two offices, we first select 2 people out of 4 to be in the same office, which can be done in binom{4}{2} = 6 ways. Then, we assign these 2 people to one of the three offices, which can be done in 3 ways. The remaining 2 people will each go to one of the remaining two offices, but since each of these people must go to a different office, there is only 1 way to assign them (ignoring the order of assignment, as it does not create a different distribution). Therefore, the total number of different assignments is 6 times 3 = 18. However, this calculation does not match any of the given options, indicating a mistake in the reasoning or calculation. Reevaluating the distribution method, we realize that after selecting 2 people to be in the same office, and assigning them to one of the three offices, the remaining 2 people can actually be distributed in 2! = 2 different ways to the remaining two offices, not just 1 way as previously considered.

The longer side of each rectangle is the side of the square that is not covered by the smaller square of side x, and the shorter side is the side of the smaller square itself. Let's denote the longer side of the rectangle as l. Since the entire side of the larger square is y units and consists of a part that is x units (the side of the smaller square) plus the longer side of the rectangle, we can express l as y - x. However, for the perimeter calculation, we need to recognize that the longer side of the rectangle is actually the same as the side of the smaller square, x, and the shorter side of the rectangle is the difference between the larger square's side and the smaller square's side, which is y - x. This was incorrectly identified in the initial explanation; the correct identification should be that the longer side of the rectangle is x and the shorter side is y - x. Given this correction, the perimeter of one of the rectangles can be calculated as the sum of twice the longer side and twice the shorter side. However, since the longer side of the rectangle is actually x, and we are asked to express the answer in terms of y, we need to correctly identify the terms based on the figure's description. The figure and the problem statement guide us to express everything in terms of y, so we focus on the dimensions that relate directly to y. The correct approach is to see that each rectangle is composed of two sides that are part of the larger square and two sides that are part of the smaller square. The perimeter of one of the rectangles is thus the sum of twice the length of each type of side. Since the problem asks for the expression in terms of y, and considering the geometry of the square and rectangles, we see that each rectangle's longer side is actually part of the larger square's side, and the shorter side is the difference between the larger square's side and the smaller square's side, which is also directly related to y. Therefore, the perimeter of one of the rectangles, considering the correction and focusing on expressing the answer in terms of y, without introducing the unnecessary variable l, is directly calculated as follows: [2(y-x) + 2x] Given that x and y-x represent the sides of the rectangles, and recognizing that the problem simplifies to a direct relationship with y, the correct expression for the perimeter, focusing solely on the terms provided and the request to express the answer in terms of y, simplifies to: [2y] Thus, the perimeter of one of the four congruent rectangles, expressed in terms of y, is: [boxed{2y}]"},{"prompt":"an infinite grid of white cells, ( n ) cells are colored black.

Combining this with the point M, we can write the point-slope form of the equation. This problem can also be solved by the conventional method, which involves setting the equation of the line containing the chord as y-1 = k(x+1), substituting it into the ellipse equation to eliminate y, and obtaining a quadratic equation in x. Using Vieta's formulas, we find the value of x_{1}+x_{2}, and since the midpoint of AB is (-1, 1), we have x_{1}+x_{2} = -2, which allows us to solve for the value of k.

The total area of the pool is 30 times 20 = 600 , text{m}^2. The area where the dolphin can swim without being within 2 m of the edge is the area of a rectangle that is reduced by 4 m in both length and width (since 2 m from each edge is not allowed), which is (30-4) times (20-4) = 26 times 16 = 416 , text{m}^2.

We need to prove that the condition s_1^2 + s_2^2 + cdots + s_n^2 < frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} is a sufficient condition for the existence of three participants A, B, C such that A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A. 1. Define ( U(T) ) for any tournament result ( T ) as: U(T) = s_1^2 + s_2^2 + cdots + s_n^2 2. **Transmission Tournament:** If no such cyclic condition exists (i.e., ( A ) beats ( B ), ( B ) beats ( C ), and ( C ) beats ( A )), such a tournament is labeled as transmissible. In this case, we can arrange the participants in such an order ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ) that if ( i > j ), then ( P_i ) beats ( P_j ). Consequently, the scores would then be: 0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1 3. Compute ( U(T) ) for a transmissible tournament: begin{aligned} U(T) &= 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + cdots + (n-1)^2 &= frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} end{aligned} 4. Since ( U(T) = frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} ) for a transmissible tournament, any ( U(T) ) equal or greater than this indicates a non-cyclic (transmissible) result. 5. **Non-Transmissible Tournament:** Consider now a non-transmissible tournament where the cyclic condition exists with three participants, say A, B, and C, such that ( A ) beats ( B ), ( B ) beats ( C ), and ( C ) beats ( A ). We assume without loss of generality that ( s_A leq min { s_A, s_B, s_C } ). 6. By our assumption, ( s_A leq s_B ). We can swap the result between A and B to form a new tournament where A's score changes to s_A - 1 and B's score changes to s_B + 1. All other scores remain unchanged: begin{aligned} Delta U(T) &= left( (s_A-1)^2 - s_A^2 right) + left( (s_B+1)^2 - s_B^2 right) &= left( s_A^2 - 2s_A + 1 - s_A^2 right) + left( s_B^2 + 2s_B + 1 - s_B^2 right) &= -2s_A + 1 + 2s_B + 1 &= 2(s_B - s_A) + 2 end{aligned} 7. Since ( s_B geq s_A ), we conclude: 2(s_B - s_A) + 2 > 0 8. Therefore, ( U(T) ) increases by changing any non-transmissible tournament into a transmissible one, implying ( U(T) ) of a non-transmissible tournament is less than ( frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} ). 9. Thus, the condition s_1^2 + s_2^2 + cdots + s_n^2 < frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} is indeed necessary for ensuring that a non-transmissible tournament (one with a cyclic condition) exists.

We need to find ( x ). Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Identification of Basic Properties:** Since the number ( x = 9^n - 1 ) is given and 9 raised to any power is an even number, one of the prime divisors of ( x ) must be 2 because ( x ) is one less than an even number (hence ( x ) is odd). 2. **Factorization of ( x = 9^n - 1 ):** Consider the prime factorization of ( x ): [ x = 9^n - 1 = (3^2)^n - 1 = (3^n)^2 - 1^2 = (3^n - 1)(3^n + 1) ] 3. **Divisibility by 13:** Since ( x ) has three distinct prime factors, and one of them is 13, we need to ensure that either ( 3^n - 1 ) or ( 3^n + 1 ) is divisible by 13. This is achieved if ( n ) is a multiple of 3 because ( 3^3 equiv 1 pmod{13} ).

According to the definition of a parabola, points on a parabola are equidistant from a fixed point called the focus and a straight line called the directrix.

For a parabola opening to the right with its vertex at the origin, the standard equation is: y^2 = 4px where p is the distance between the vertex and focus (which is also the same as the distance between the vertex and directrix). Since the focus (3,0) is 3 units to the right of the vertex (0,0) and 6 units to the right of the directrix x = -3, the value of p is 3, and hence 4p = 12.

This indicates a decreasing trend on the left side of the axis of symmetry. - Since the function values at x = 0 and x = 3 are the same, and considering the point (1, -6), it implies that the function starts increasing after x = 1, which is to the right of the axis of symmetry. 3. **Direction of Opening and Intersection with the X-axis:** - The decreasing trend to the left of the axis of symmetry and the increasing trend to the right, along with the given points, suggest that the parabola opens upwards. - Since the function has both positive and negative values, it must intersect the x-axis. Therefore, options A (opens downwards) and B (does not intersect the x-axis) are incorrect. 4. **Minimum Value of the Function:** - The axis of symmetry at x = frac{3}{2} suggests that this is where the parabola achieves its vertex, and since it opens upwards, this point represents the minimum value of the function. - Given that the function passes through (1, -6) and the trend of the function around the axis of symmetry, the minimum value of the function is expected to be less than -6 at x = frac{3}{2}. 5. **Behavior of the Function for x > -1:** - The function decreases until it reaches its minimum value and then starts increasing. Since the minimum is achieved at x = frac{3}{2}, for x > -1, the function first decreases to its minimum and then increases. This contradicts option D which suggests a continuous increase for x > -1.

Assuming AD > DC, we define H as the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. The angle bisectors of angle ABC and angle ADC meet AC at points B_1 and D_1, respectively. Given that BD_1 parallel DB_1, these points should be separated by H, leading to a contradiction.

Given BD_1 parallel DB_1, we have h(D_1) = B_1. 5. **Tangents Intersection Analysis:** Let the tangents to Omega at B and D meet AC at L_B and L_D, respectively.

The powers of L_B with respect to Omega and gamma_D are: [ L_B B^2 = L_B B_1^2 ] Hence, L_B lies on the radical axis T_D D of these circles. Similarly, L_D lies on the radical axis T_B B of Omega and gamma_B. 6. **Application of Sine Rule:** Applying the sine rule to triangle BHL_B, we get: [ frac{H L_B}{sin angle H B L_B} = frac{B L_B}{sin angle B H L_B} = frac{B_1 L_B}{sin angle B H L_B} ] Similarly, [ frac{H L_D}{sin angle H D L_D} = frac{D L_D}{sin angle D H L_D} = frac{D_1 L_D}{sin angle D H L_D} ] 7. **Proving Parallelism and Homothety:** We observe that angle B H L_B = angle D H L_D. Since tangents B L_B and D L_D form equal angles with BD, sin angle H B L_B = sin angle H D L_D.

Let a be the last digit of the number (2^n). We aim to show that the product of (a) and the sum of all the digits of (2^n) except the last digit is divisible by 3. Essentially, we need to prove that (a left(2^n - aright)) is divisible by 3. 2. We will consider two cases based on the parity of (n). Case 1: (n) is odd. When (n) is odd, - (2^n mod 3 = 2). This follows from the properties of modular arithmetic since (2^1 equiv 2 (mod 3)) and this pattern continues with odd exponents. - The last digit (a) of (2^n) will be among the digits 2, 4, 8, 6, etc. Thus, considering (2^n equiv 2 (mod 3)): - If the last digit (a = 2), then (2^n - a = 2 - 2 = 0), which is divisible by 3. - If the last digit (a = 8) (another possibility), then [ 2^n - a = 2^n - 8 ] Since (2^n equiv 2 (mod 3)) and 8 is (2 (mod 3)), [ 2^n - 8 equiv 2 - 2 equiv 0 (mod 3) ] which is also divisible by 3. Therefore, (a(2^n - a)) is divisible by 3 when (n) is odd. Case 2: (n) is even. When (n) is even, - (2^n mod 3 = 1). This is because (2^2 = 4 equiv 1 (mod 3)), and this pattern repeats with even exponents. - The last digit (a) of (2^n) includes possibilities such as 4 or 6. Considering (2^n equiv 1 (mod 3)): - If the last digit (a = 4), then [ 2^n - a = 2^n - 4 ] Since (2^n equiv 1 (mod 3)) and 4 is (1 (mod 3)), [ 2^n - 4 equiv 1 - 1 equiv 0 (mod 3) ] which is divisible by 3. - If the last digit (a = 6), then: [ 2^n - a = 2^n - 6 ] Since (2^n equiv 1 (mod 3)) and 6 is (0 (mod 3)), [ a = 6 equiv 0 (mod 3) ] making (a) itself divisible by 3. Therefore, in both sub-cases, (a(2^n - a)) is divisible by 3 when (n) is even. # Conclusion: Since in both cases, whether (n) is even or odd, the expression (a(2^n - a)) is consistently divisible by 3.

We need to find the probability that the weight X is between 9.8 kg and 10.2 kg. We can standardize the values by converting our variable X into the standard normal variable Z. This is done by the formula Z = frac{X - mu}{sigma}. So for 9.8 kg and 10.2 kg, we get: Z_1 = frac{9.8 - 10}{0.1} = -2, Z_2 = frac{10.2 - 10}{0.1} = 2. The probability that Z is between Z_1 and Z_2 can be found using the standard normal distribution table, also known as the Z-table. P(9.8 < X < 10.2) = P(-2 < Z < 2). From the Z-table, we find that: P(Z < 2) = 0.9772, P(Z < -2) = 0.0228.

The caterpillar travels 4 meters in 2 minutes, so its speed is: Speed of caterpillar = Distance / Time Speed of caterpillar = 4 meters / 2 minutes Speed of caterpillar = 2 meters/minute The cicada larva travels 4 meters in 3 minutes, so its speed is: Speed of cicada larva = Distance / Time Speed of cicada larva = 4 meters / 3 minutes Speed of cicada larva = 4/3 meters/minute Now, let's find the relative speed at which the caterpillar is gaining on the cicada larva. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the cicada larva from the speed of the caterpillar to get the relative speed.

Also given that A alone can do the work in 12 days, A's work rate is 1/12 of the job per day. We can express the combined work rate of A and B as the sum of their individual work rates: A + B = 1/6 We already know A's work rate: A = 1/12 Now we can solve for B's work rate by substituting A's work rate into the combined work rate equation: 1/12 + B = 1/6 To find B, we subtract A's work rate from the combined work rate: B = 1/6 - 1/12 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case: B = (2/12) - (1/12) B = 1/12 Now we know B's work rate is 1/12 of the job per day. To find out how many days B alone can do the work, we take the reciprocal of B's work rate: Days for B to do the work alone = 1 / (B's work rate) Days for B to do the work alone = 1 / (1/12) Days for B to do the work alone = 12 Therefore, B alone can do the work in boxed{12} days."},{"prompt":"To make a lasagna Martha needs some amount of cheese and 500 grams of meat.

The circles are defined by the equations |z - a| = 1 and |w - b| = 3. 2. **Use the Triangle Inequality:** By applying the Triangle Inequality, we have: [ |a - z| + |z - w| + |w - b| ge |a - b|, ] which simplifies to: [ |z - w| ge |a - b| - |a - z| - |w - b|. ] 3. **Calculate Distances:** - The distance between a and b is calculated as: [ |a - b| = |(-1 - 3i) - (7 + 8i)| = |-8 - 11i| = sqrt{(-8)^2 + (-11)^2} = sqrt{64 + 121} = sqrt{185}. ] - Since |a - z| = 1 (the radius of the circle where z lies) and |w - b| = 3 (the radius of the circle where w lies), we substitute these values into our inequality: [ |z - w| ge sqrt{185} - 1 - 3 = sqrt{185} - 4. ] 4. **Determine the Condition for Equality:** Equality occurs when z and w are exactly on the line connecting a and b, and are the intersections of this line with their respective circles. This configuration minimizes the distance |z - w|. Therefore, the smallest possible value of |z - w| is boxed{sqrt{185} - 4}."},{"prompt":"A snake of length k is an ordered group of k cells left(S_{1}, S_{2}, cdots, S_{k}right) in an n times n grid.

Is there a positive integer n > 1 such that there exists a snake of length at least 0.9 n^{2} in an n times n grid that can turn around?","completion":"1. **Existence of such a snake**: We first confirm that there exists an integer n > 1 such that in an n times n grid, there exists a snake of length at least 0.9n^2 that can undergo the \\"switch head\\" operation. 2. **General Form of the Snake**: To make it easy to understand, we provide an example of an 11 times 11 grid with a snake of length 89 that can perform switch head. 3. **Generalization**: It's not hard to generalize this to any odd number n. In an n times n grid, there always exists a snake of length (n-1)(n-2) - 1 capable of switching head. 4. **Inequality Verification**: We verify that when n is sufficiently large: (n-1)(n-2) - 1 > 0.9 n^2 We can calculate: [ (n-1)(n-2) - 1 = n^2 - 3n + 1 ] and [ n^2 - 3n + 1 > 0.9 n^2. ] Subtract 0.9n^2 from both sides of the inequality: [ n^2 - 3n + 1 - 0.9n^2 > 0. ] Simplify the inequality: [ 0.1n^2 - 3n + 1 > 0. ] This is a quadratic inequality in n, and solving this will provide the threshold value of n for which the inequality holds true. 5. **Coordinate-based Explanation**: Define the bottom-left corner of the grid as (1,1). Initially, we position the snake as shown in the figure. The grid configuration begins as the snake moving in a specific pattern, which can generalize from this smaller representation. - Snake head moves successively to (2,1),(3,1), ldots, (n, 1), (n, 2), ldots,(n, n-1). - Then, snake head moves successively to (n, n),(n-1, n), cdots,(1, n),(1, n-1), (2, n-1), cdots, (n-3, n-1),(n-3, n-2), (n-4, n-2), cdots, (1, n-2), cdots, (1,3), and so forth. - Due to the tail’s movement, the snake head can continue on. 6. **Further Movements**: - Continue to move the snake head sequentially in this manner until it reaches (n-4,4). - Move the snake head successively through (n-4,3),(n-5,3), cdots, (1,3),(1,2),(2,2) cdots,(n-1,2), (n-1,3),(n-2,3) (n-2,4), etc. 7. **Repeated Steps**: Repeat these movements, gradually turning left-side protrusions into right-side protrusions until the final condition is achieved. 8. **Conclusion**: By following these movement steps, the snake ends up being transformable into the position (S_k, S_{k-1}, ldots, S_1).

Thus, nests in positions 0, 2, and 4 are black while nests in positions 1, 3, and 5 are white. 2. **Initial Coloring**: - Each bird will have the color of the nest it initially occupies. So, we start with three birds in black nests and three birds in white nests. 3. **Nesting Property**: - Each night, every bird flies to one of the neighboring nests. Since neighboring nests have opposite colors in the alternating coloring, each bird will change its color each night. 4. **Conservation of Color**: - Therefore, after every night, there will still be three birds in black nests and three birds in white nests. 5. **Conclusion**: - Since at any time there will always be three black and three white, it is impossible for all six birds to be in the same nest (which would mean all birds are the same color). Thus, it is impossible for all birds to end up in the same nest after any number of nights. # Approach 2: 1. **Number Assignment**: - Assign numbers to the nests from 0 to 5. Thus, nest k is between nests k-1 and k+1 modulo 6. 2. **Numbering Birds**: - Initially, assign each bird the same number as the nest it occupies. 3. **Movement and Parity**: - Each night, a bird moves to a neighboring nest, changing its number by pm 1. This movement changes the parity (odd/even nature) of the bird's number. 4. **Parity Invariance**: - Consider the sum of the birds’ numbers: Initially, this sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is odd. - Since each move of each bird changes parity, the total number's parity remains unchanged. 5. **Reachability Check**: - If all birds were to end up in the same nest x, their sum would be 6x, which is always even (since multiplying by 6, an even number, results in an even number). - However, the sum of the bird numbers is always odd (it started odd and parity is unchanged by the birds’ moves). 6. **Conclusion**: - Thus, all birds cannot end up in the same nest, as their total number would need to become even, which contradicts the invariant odd sum. Hence, in both approaches, it is concluded that it is impossible for all birds to end up in the same nest after any number of nights. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"f the tangent line of the curve y=ln x at point P(x_{1}, y_{1}) is tangent to the curve y=e^{x} at point Q(x_{2}, y_{2}), then frac{2}{{x_1}1}+x_{2}=____.","completion":"To solve the problem, we first find the equations of the tangent lines for both curves at their respective points. 1. **For y=ln x:** - The derivative is y'=frac{1}{x}. - At point P(x_{1}, y_{1}), the equation of the tangent line is derived as follows: [ y-y_{1}=frac{1}{x_{1}}(x-x_{1}) implies y-ln x_{1}=frac{1}{x_{1}}(x-x_{1}). ] 2. **For y=e^{x}:** - The derivative is y'=e^{x}. - At point Q(x_{2}, y_{2}), the equation of the tangent line is: [ y-y_{2}=e^{x_{2}}(x-x_{2}) implies y-e^{x_{2}}=e^{x_{2}}(x-x_{2}). ] Given that these tangent lines coincide, we equate their slopes and intercepts: - Equating slopes gives us frac{1}{x_{1}}=e^{x_{2}}. - Equating the intercepts (or the y-part of the equations when x=0) gives us ln x_{1}-1=e^{x_{2}}(1-x_{2}).

We calculate n^2 mod 100 for n = 0 to 99, as this will cover all possible outcomes for the second to last digit due to periodicity in the last two digits in sequences of squares: - Compute each n^2 and take it modulo 100. - Extract the tens digit of each result. This is done by taking integer division of the modulo result by 10. - Collect all distinct digits encountered among these calculations. For example: - 0^2 = 0quad (0 mod 100 = 0) Rightarrow 0/10 = 0 - 1^2 = 1quad (1 mod 100 = 1) Rightarrow 1/10 = 0 - 2^2 = 4quad (4 mod 100 = 4) Rightarrow 4/10 = 0 ... - 10^2 = 100quad (100 mod 100 = 0) Rightarrow 0/10 = 0 ...

Therefore, one of the sides OO_1 or OO_2 must be at least as long as O_1O_2. 5. **Distance Comparison**: Without loss of generality, assume O_1 O_2 leq O_1 O. 6. **Radius Consideration**: Because O lies within the circle centered at O_1 with radius r_1, we have: [ O_1 O < r_1 ] 7. **Combining the Inequalities**: It follows that: [ O_1 O_2 leq O_1 O < r_1 ] Hence, O_2 is at a distance less than r_1 from O_1. 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the center O_2 of the circle with radius r_2 lies within the circle centered at O_1 with radius r_1. Thus, by our assumption, we have shown that one of the circles contains the center of another circle. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"f e^{i gamma} + e^{i delta} = frac{5}{8} + frac{9}{10} i, find e^{i gamma} + e^{i delta}.","completion":"We can use the Euler's formula to rewrite [ cos gamma + i sin gamma + cos delta + i sin delta = -frac{5}{8} + frac{9}{10} i, ] thus cos gamma + cos delta = -frac{5}{8} and sin gamma + sin delta = frac{9}{10}.

To solve this problem, we will examine the billiard table dynamics by reflecting the table upon each collision with a wall. This method helps us simplify the problem by transforming the trajectory of the ball into a straight line on an extended grid. 2. Consider the billiard table with sides (1) and (sqrt{2}) units. The ball is initially shot from one corner at an angle of (45^circ) to the side. 3. Reflect the billiard table along all walls it touches. In this setup, the table will form a grid of repeated rectangular cells with heights (1) unit and widths (sqrt{2}) units. 4. The movement of the ball through this repeated rectangular cells grid can be simplified to a straight line with the slope equal to the ratio of the sides' lengths, which in this case is (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}). 5. Since the slope is (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}), the line passes through coordinates that satisfy (sqrt{2}y = x) in an extended, reflective grid of the billiard table. 6. The important observation here is that the equation (sqrt{2}y = x) never leads to both (x) and (y) simultaneously being integers. This follows because (1) and (sqrt{2}) are not commensurable, meaning there are no common multiples that are integers. In mathematical terms, (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}) is an irrational number. 7. Therefore, the ball on the billiard table, reflected in this manner, will move along the grid but never hit the lattice points (which corresponds to the pockets located at the corners of the table) where both coordinates are integers. 8.

Here’s a step-by-step detailed analysis: 1. **Analyzing the Net**: - The net consists of six faces arranged in a cross-like pattern. - We denote the symbols on each face as follows: - Let the faces be numbered 1 to 6. - Assume face 1 is the central square. - Faces 2 to 6 surround face 1. 2. **Determining Neighboring Faces**: - When folded into a cube: - Face 1 touches faces 2, 3, 4, and 5. - Face 2 touches faces 1, 3, and 6. - Face 3 touches faces 1, 2, and 4. - Face 4 touches faces 1, 3, and 5. - Face 5 touches faces 1, 4, and 6. - Face 6 touches faces 2 and 5. 3. **Matching with Options**: - Analyze option (a): - It shows certain pairs of faces next to each other. - Check if any pairs can be adjacent in the cube (net configuration). - Analyze option (b): - Similar analysis for option (b). - Analyze option (c): - Check face adjacency. - Analyze option (d): - Check face adjacency. - Analyze option (e): - Check face adjacency. 4. **Conclusion from Analysis**: - From careful examination: - We can see that options (a) and (e) are the same because they show the same adjacency. - Options (c) and (d) similarly show the same adjacency. - Correct folding maintaining circle and star formations leads to option (b) being the suitable one based on neighbor checks and correct face adjacencies when the net is folded.

Consequently, the distance covered by the circumference of both circles in one complete revolution of the smaller circle will be the same. 3. **Equating the Circumferences:** - The circumference of the smaller circle is 2pi R. - For the smaller circle to roll inside the larger circle without slipping, the distance it covers will be equal to the arc length on the circumference of the larger circle it has rolled over, which amounts to 2pi R. 4. **Revolving Points:** Every fixed point on the circumference of the smaller circle traces out a path as it rolls. When the smaller circle completes one full revolution inside the larger circle, the point K returns to its initial position on the smaller circle. 5. **Deduction of the Trajectory:** Since K is tracing a path relative to the fixed circle where O is the center and R is the radius of the smaller circle: - The point K is at a constant distance R from O_1. - O_1 rotates around O at a constant distance R as the smaller circle rolls. - This means that K will trace a path known as a *hypocycloid*. 6. **Special Case Analysis:** - For the specific case where the radius of the fixed circle is exactly twice that of the rolling circle (R_{fixed} = 2R), the trajectory traced by K forms a more specific curve. - Given these specific radii, the path traced is known as a *diameter* of the fixed circle, and the pattern repeats every second rotation. # Conclusion [ boxed{text{Diameter of the fixed circle}} ]"},{"prompt":"A total of 17 teams play in a singleelimination tournament.

In this case, fleft( x right) is monotonically decreasing on left( 0,{{x}_{2}} right) and monotonically increasing on left( {{x}_{2}},+infty right). If a > 0, then {{x}_{1}} > 0. Thus, when xin left( 0,{{x}_{1}} right), {f}'left( x right) > 0, when xin left( {{x}_{1}},{{x}_{2}} right), {f}'left( x right) < 0, and when xin left( {{x}_{2}},+infty right), {f}'left( x right) > 0. In this case, fleft( x right) is monotonically increasing on left( 0,{{x}_{1}} right), monotonically decreasing on left( {{x}_{1}},{{x}_{2}} right), and monotonically increasing on left( {{x}_{2}},+infty right). In summary, when aleqslant 0, the function fleft( x right) is monotonically decreasing on left( 0,{{x}_{2}} right) and monotonically increasing on left( {{x}_{2}},+infty right). When 0 < a < 1, the function fleft( x right) is monotonically increasing on left( 0,{{x}_{1}} right), monotonically decreasing on left( {{x}_{1}},{{x}_{2}} right), and monotonically increasing on left( {{x}_{2}},+infty right). When ageqslant 1, the function fleft( x right) is monotonically increasing on left( 0,+infty right). (II) From (I), we know that the function fleft( x right) has two extreme points left({{x}_{1}}right), left({{x}_{2}}right), which is equivalent to the equation {{x}^{2}}-2x+a=0 having two distinct real roots in left( 0,+infty right). Thus, 0 < a < 1. {{x}_{2}}=1+sqrt{1-a}, and 1 < {{x}_{2}} < 2. Let gleft( t right)=t-2ln t-1, where 1 < t < 2. Then, {g}'left( t right)=1-frac{2}{t}=frac{t-2}{t}. Since 1 < t < 2, we have {g}'left( t right) < 0. Thus, gleft( t right) is monotonically decreasing on left( 1,2 right). Therefore, gleft( t right) < gleft( 1 right)=1-2ln 1-1=0. Consequently, fleft( {{x}_{2}} right)-{{x}_{2}}+1=gleft( {{x}_{2}} right) < 0. Hence, boxed{fleft( {{x}_{2}} right) < {{x}_{2}}-1}."},{"prompt":"There are some consecutive integers with an average of 20.5. The 10th integer is 25.

Since the integers are consecutive, the second integer would be \\"x+1\\", the third would be \\"x+2\\", and so on. Given that the 10th integer is 25, we can write the following equation: x + (10 - 1) = 25 Solving for x: x + 9 = 25 x = 25 - 9 x = 16 So, the first integer is 16. Now, we know that the average of these consecutive integers is 20.5. The average of a set of consecutive integers is the middle number when there is an odd number of terms, or the average of the two middle numbers when there is an even number of terms. Since we have an average that is not an integer (20.5), we know that there must be an even number of terms, and 20.5 is the average of the two middle numbers. Let's call the total number of integers \\"n\\". The middle two numbers would then be the (n/2)th and the (n/2 + 1)th integers in the sequence. Since the average of these two middle numbers is 20.5, we can write the following equations: x + (n/2 - 1) = 20 x + (n/2) = 21 We already know that x = 16, so we can substitute that into the equations: 16 + (n/2 - 1) = 20 16 + (n/2) = 21 Solving the first equation for n: n/2 - 1 = 20 - 16 n/2 - 1 = 4 n/2 = 5 n = 10 Solving the second equation for n: n/2 = 21 - 16 n/2 = 5 n = 10 Both equations give us the same result: n = 10.

This means both a and b are positive, and a is greater than b. 2. **Transforming the Given Condition**: - From a gt b, we can multiply both sides by frac{1}{ab} (since ab > 0, this operation is valid and does not change the inequality's direction). This gives us frac{a}{ab} gt frac{b}{ab}. - Simplifying both sides, we get frac{1}{b} gt frac{1}{a}, or equivalently, frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{b}. 3. **Exploring the Reverse Condition**: - When we have frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{b}, it implies that a and b could be in different positions relative to 0. Specifically, it could mean b lt a lt 0 or a lt 0 lt b, aside from the original condition a gt b gt 0. - This means that having frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{b} does not necessarily imply a gt b gt 0. 4. **Conclusion**: - Since \\"a gt b gt 0\\" guarantees \\"frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{b}\\", but \\"frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{b}\\" does not necessarily guarantee \\"a gt b gt 0\\", we conclude that \\"a gt b gt 0\\" is a sufficient condition for \\"frac{1}{a} lt frac{1}{b}\\", but it is not a necessary condition. - Therefore, the correct answer is that this is a **Sufficient but not necessary condition**.

Let's consider a natural number of the form (10a + b), where (a) represents the integer part (tens place) and (b) is the last digit (units place). 2. We square the number ((10a + b)^2): [ (10a + b)^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2 ] 3. We need to analyze the last two digits of this expansion. The entire expansion can be split as follows: - (100a^2) contributes (00) in the last two digits (since (100a^2) is always a multiple of 100). - (20ab) contributes (20ab mod 100). - (b^2) contributes (b^2 mod 100). So, the significant part is the last two digits combined from (20ab) and (b^2). 4. According to the problem, the last digit is odd. Hence, we consider all odd possibilities for (b) which are (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). - When (b = 1): [ b^2 = 1^2 = 1 ] - When (b = 3): [ b^2 = 3^2 = 9 ] - When (b = 5): [ b^2 = 5^2 = 25 ] - When (b = 7): [ b^2 = 7^2 = 49 ] - When (b = 9): [ b^2 = 9^2 = 81 ] In each scenario, the units place is odd ((1, 9, 25, 49, 81)). 5. The second-to-last digit falls into these specific calculations for (b): - For (1^2): The second-to-last digit is (0) (even). - For (3^2): The second-to-last digit is (0) (even). - For (5^2): The second-to-last digit is (2) (even). - For (7^2): The second-to-last digit is (4) (even). - For (9^2): The second-to-last digit is (8) (even). 6.

The relative speed is the difference in speed between the two trains since they are moving in the same direction. The faster train is moving at 46 km/hr and the slower train at 36 km/hr, so the relative speed is: Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 46 km/hr - 36 km/hr Relative speed = 10 km/hr To work with meters and seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. We use the conversion factor that 1 km/hr is equal to 5/18 m/s. Relative speed in m/s = 10 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr Relative speed in m/s = (10 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed in m/s = 50/18 m/s Relative speed in m/s = 2.777... m/s (approximately) Now, we need to find out how long it takes for the faster train to pass the slower train completely.

The left side of the equation is a multiple of ( n ) minus 1, and the right side is a multiple of ( n ) plus 5. For these two to be equal, the difference between them must be a multiple of ( n ). This means that 6 (the difference between -1 and 5) must be a multiple of ( n ). The only positive integer ( n ) that satisfies this condition and is less than 6 (since the remainders when dividing by ( n ) must be less than ( n )) is 6 itself.

Sometimes a person sits on one of the free chairs. In such cases, exactly one of their neighbors (if any) stands up and leaves. What is the maximum number of people that can be sitting simultaneously if all the chairs were initially empty?","completion":": To find the maximum number of people that can be sitting simultaneously under the given conditions, we need to carefully analyze the placement and movement of people onto the chairs. We will provide a step-by-step solution to illustrate why it is not possible to have more than 11 people sitting at the same time. Step 1: Understand the Constraints - There are 12 chairs in a row. - A person can sit on an empty chair, causing one of their neighbors to stand up and leave if there are any. Our task is to maximize the number of people sitting simultaneously while adhering to the above constraints. Step 2: Proving that not all 12 chairs can be occupied simultaneously - If all 12 chairs were occupied, each time a new person sits, one of the neighboring people must stand up and leave. Consider the scenario where seating progresses to the last chair: 1. When the last person sits on the 12th chair, they will force one of their immediate neighboring chairs (either the 11th or the 11th chair) to be vacated. 2. Therefore, it is impossible to have all 12 chairs occupied simultaneously under these rules. Thus, the maximum number of chairs that can be occupied simultaneously is strictly less than 12. We hypothesize that the number is 11 and then prove this by construction. Step 3: Construction to achieve maximum seating of 11 people We will incrementally construct a scenario where we can successfully seat 11 people. 1. **Labeling the Chairs:** Number the chairs from 1 to 12. 2. **Initial Occupation:** - Place the first person on chair 1: ( P_1 ). 3. **Sequential seating with neighbor displacement:** - To place the second person in a manner that maintains a maximum number of people seated, the following specialized sequence is followed: - Seat the second person on chair 3 (( P_2 rightarrow C_3 )). No displacement occurs as chair 2 is empty. - Then seat another person on chair 2 (( P_3 rightarrow C_2 )). This will cause ( P_2 ) on chair 3 to stand up. Continue this iterative process: - For seated chairs 1 to k: - First, sit a person on chair ( k+2 ). - Then displace someone by sitting on chair ( k+1 ). - Applying this process for ( 1 leq k leq 10 ): Example steps from 4th person onwards: - Seat 4th person on 5th chair (( P_4 rightarrow C_5 )): ( P_4 ) seats without anyone to displace. - Seat 5th person on the 4th chair (( P_5 rightarrow C_4 )): ( P_5 ) sits, causing ( P_4 ) to vacate. - Extend this similar steps for subsequent seating till the 11th person. Through this process: - You will iteratively get up to the 11th chair occupied without violating the rules, finally: - ( P_i ) on chairs ( 1 leq i leq 11 ). One chair will always remain empty since the last seated person's presence will always displace the adjacent.

This means that for every unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units. This is because the slope k = 2 > 0, indicating a positive relationship between x and y. Given that x_1 < x_2, we want to determine the relationship between y_1 and y_2. Since the slope of the line is positive (k = 2 > 0), as x increases, y also increases. This is a fundamental property of linear functions with a positive slope. Therefore, since x_1 < x_2, it follows that y_1 < y_2. This is because moving from x_1 to x_2 along the x-axis (with x_1 < x_2), the corresponding y values increase due to the positive slope of the line. Thus, the relationship between y_1 and y_2 is y_1 < y_2. Final Answer: boxed{<}"},{"prompt":"one galaxy, there exist more than one million stars.

Denote these spheres as (b_{i1}, b_{i2}, ldots, b_{ik}). 3. **Analyze the intersection of spheres:** - Each of the other stars lies on the intersection of three spheres (b_{1m}, b_{2p}, b_{3q}) for some (1 le m, p, q le k). - Since the centers (s_1, s_2, s_3) are not collinear, any three spheres (b_{1m}, b_{2p}, b_{3q}) can have at most two common points. 4. **Calculate the maximum number of stars:** - The number of stars is at most (2 cdot k cdot k cdot k + 3). The term (2 cdot k cdot k cdot k) accounts for the maximum number of intersections of the spheres, and the (+3) accounts for the three centers (s_1, s_2, s_3). - Therefore, we have: [ 2k^3 + 3 geq 1,000,000 ] 5. **Solve for (k):** - Ignoring the (+3) for simplicity, we get: [ 2k^3 geq 1,000,000 ] - Dividing both sides by 2: [ k^3 geq 500,000 ] - Taking the cube root of both sides: [ k geq sqrt[3]{500,000} ] - Approximating the cube root: [ k approx 79.37 ] - Since (k) must be an integer, we have: [ k geq 79 ] Thus, the set (M) has at least 79 members.

Substituting in the identity gives us: [ (2^{2^{n-2}})^4 + (2^{2^{n-2}})^2 + 1 = left((2^{2^{n-2}})^2 + 1 - 2^{2^{n-2}}right) left((2^{2^{n-2}})^2 + 1 + 2^{2^{n-2}}right) ] Simplifying, we get: [ 2^{2^n} + 2^{2^{n-1}} + 1 = (2^{2^{n-1}} + 2^{2^{n-2}} + 1)(2^{2^{n-1}} - 2^{2^{n-2}} + 1) ] 3. **Check for mutual primality of factors**: Notice that both factors 2^{2^{n-1}} + 2^{2^{n-2}} + 1 and 2^{2^{n-1}} - 2^{2^{n-2}} + 1 are odd numbers.

However, since both numbers are odd, the only power of 2 that can divide them is 1. Thus, these two numbers are coprime. 5. **By induction**: - Base Case (n = 1): For n = 1, the number is: [ 2^{2^1} + 2^{2^0} + 1 = 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 7 ] Which has only 1 distinct prime factor (itself). - Inductive Step: Assume for some k= 1, 2, ldots, n that the number 2^{2^k} + 2^{2^{k-1}} + 1 has at least k distinct prime divisors. We need to show that 2^{2^{k+1}} + 2^{2^k} + 1 also has at least k+1 distinct prime divisors. From the factorization provided: [ 2^{2^{k+1}} + 2^{2^k} + 1 = (2^{2^k} + 2^{2^{k-1}} + 1)(2^{2^k} - 2^{2^{k-1}} + 1) ] Each of the factors 2^{2^k} + 2^{2^{k-1}} + 1 and 2^{2^k} - 2^{2^{k-1}} + 1 are mutually coprime and thus have distinct sets of prime factors. By the induction hypothesis, 2^{2^k} + 2^{2^{k-1}} + 1 has at least k distinct prime divisors. Since 2^{2^k} - 2^{2^{k-1}} + 1 is coprime to it, it provides at least one more distinct prime divisor. Thus, 2^{2^{k+1}} + 2^{2^k} + 1 has at least k+1 distinct primes. **Conclusion**: We have successfully shown by induction that the given number has at least n distinct prime divisors for any natural number n. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=2xln x.

On one hand, k=frac{2x_{0}ln x_{0}-(-2)}{x_{0}-0}, and on the other hand, k=f'(x_{0})=2ln x_{0}+2. Hence, frac{2x_{0}ln x_{0}-(-2)}{x_{0}-0}=2ln x_{0}+2, which simplifies to x_{0}=1.

By Vieta's theorem, x_{1}+x_{2}=frac{2}{lambda}>0 and x_{1}cdot x_{2}=1>0, so x_{1} and x_{2} are both positive, and x_{1}<1<x_{2}. Thus, h(x)=0 has a unique real root x_{2} in (1,+infty). From the graph, we know: When xin(1,x_{2}), h(x)>0, i.e., g'(x)>0. Therefore, g(x) is increasing on (1,x_{2}), and g(x)>g(1)=0 for xin(1,x_{2}), which does not satisfy the requirement.

We know that profit is calculated on the cost price (CP), so we can write the following equation: SP = CP + Profit 150 = CP + (25% of CP) 150 = CP + (0.25 * CP) 150 = 1.25 * CP Now, we can solve for CP (Cost Price) of Item A: CP = 150 / 1.25 CP = 120 So, the cost price of Item A is Rs. 120. Next, let's calculate the cost price for Item B: The selling price (SP) of Item B is Rs. 200, and the profit is 20%. Using the same method as above: SP = CP + Profit 200 = CP + (20% of CP) 200 = CP + (0.20 * CP) 200 = 1.20 * CP Solving for CP of Item B: CP = 200 / 1.20 CP = 166.67 (rounded to two decimal places) So, the cost price of Item B is Rs. 166.67.

Since there are 5 days, the total sum of the temperatures for those days is: 40 degrees/day * 5 days = 200 degrees We know the lowest temperature is 30 degrees. To maximize the range, we would want the other four days to have the highest possible temperatures. Since we don't have any other constraints, we can assume that the lowest temperature occurred only once. Therefore, the sum of the temperatures for the other four days would be: 200 degrees (total sum) - 30 degrees (lowest temperature) = 170 degrees To maximize the range, we would want these 170 degrees to be as concentrated as possible in a single day, which would mean the highest temperature would be on one day, and the remaining three days would have the lowest temperature (30 degrees). So for three days, the temperature would be: 3 days * 30 degrees/day = 90 degrees Subtracting this from the remaining sum of temperatures, we get the highest possible temperature for the remaining day: 170 degrees - 90 degrees = 80 degrees Therefore, the highest possible temperature to achieve the maximum range, given the average and the lowest temperature, would be 80 degrees. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values, so the maximum range would be: 80 degrees (highest possible temperature) - 30 degrees (lowest temperature) = 50 degrees The possible maximum range of the temperatures is boxed{50} degrees."},{"prompt":"costs 7 cents to copy 3 pages.

This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Given sides of lengths 5 and 6 units, the sum of these two sides is 5 + 6 = 11 units. Therefore, for the triangle to exist, the length of the third side x must be less than 11 units but more than 6 - 5 = 1 unit (to satisfy the triangle inequality theorem from the other direction). Since x is an integer, the largest possible value for x is 10 units. This ensures that all three sides (5 units, 6 units, and 10 units) satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, making a valid triangle.

The instantaneous power ( N ) is given by the product of the force ( F ) and the speed ( v ): [ N = F cdot v ] Substituting the expression for ( F ) into the equation for ( N ), we get: [ N = left( frac{B S rho (v_0 - v)^2}{2} right) v ] [ N = frac{B S rho}{2} (v_0 - v)^2 v ] Expanding ( (v_0 - v)^2 ), we have: [ (v_0 - v)^2 = v_0^2 - 2v_0v + v^2 ] Therefore, the expression for ( N ) becomes: [ N = frac{B S rho}{2} (v_0^2 - 2v_0v + v^2) v ] [ N = frac{B S rho}{2} (v_0^2 v - 2v_0v^2 + v^3) ] To find ( N_{text{max}} ), we need to set the first derivative of ( N ) with respect to ( v ) to zero: [ frac{dN}{dv} = 0 ] First, let's compute the derivative ( frac{dN}{dv} ): [ frac{dN}{dv} = frac{B S rho}{2} frac{d}{dv} (v_0^2 v - 2v_0v^2 + v^3) ] [ frac{dN}{dv} = frac{B S rho}{2} (v_0^2 - 4v_0v + 3v^2) ] Setting this derivative to zero: [ frac{B S rho}{2} (v_0^2 - 4v_0v + 3v^2) = 0 ] [ v_0^2 - 4v_0v + 3v^2 = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in ( v ). Solving the quadratic equation: [ 3v^2 - 4v_0v + v_0^2 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula ( v = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) where ( a = 3 ), ( b = -4v_0 ), and ( c = v_0^2 ): [ v = frac{4v_0 pm sqrt{(4v_0)^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot v_0^2}}{2 cdot 3} ] [ v = frac{4v_0 pm sqrt{16v_0^2 - 12v_0^2}}{6} ] [ v = frac{4v_0 pm sqrt{4v_0^2}}{6} ] [ v = frac{4v_0 pm 2v_0}{6} ] This gives us two solutions: [ v_1 = frac{4v_0 + 2v_0}{6} = frac{6v_0}{6} = v_0 ] [ v_2 = frac{4v_0 - 2v_0}{6} = frac{2v_0}{6} = frac{v_0}{3} ] Since ( v_1 = v_0 ) is not typically realistic in practical scenarios where the sailing ship cannot match the wind speed ( v_0 ), we accept: [ v = frac{v_0}{3} ] Given ( v_0 = 6.3 , text{m/s} ): [ v = frac{6.3 , text{m/s}}{3} = 2.1 , text{m/s} ] # Conclusion: The speed of the sailing ship when the instantaneous power of the wind reaches its maximum value is given by: [ boxed{2.1 , text{m/s}} ]"},{"prompt":"Suppose h(x) is a polynomial of degree 3 and k(x) is a polynomial of degree 6.

Let's denote the radius ( OA ). By the property of tangents, the tangent at any point of the circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. Therefore, the tangent at point ( A ), which includes point ( C ), is perpendicular to ( OA ). 3. **Establish perpendicularity relations:** Because ( OA ) is a radius and ( AB ) is the diameter, ( AB ) extends through the center ( O ). Hence, ( AB ) is a straight line. We know ( CD ) is a tangent from point ( C ) and touches the circle at point ( D ).

Here's an example arrangement: | | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| | R1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | | R2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | | R3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | | R4 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | | R5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | | R6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | | R7 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | | R8 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Ensure that each row sums to the same value, ( x = 4 ). Column sums: ( [4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5] ). **Step 7: Verify uniqueness and correctness.** - Each row sum is 4. - Column sums are ({4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 2, 1}) all different and none equaling 4. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Yes, it is possible.}} ]"},{"prompt":"yerin folded 16 cranes a day for 7 days, and Taeyeong folded 25 cranes a day for 6 days.

Each fuel station has a certain amount of fuel stored, and the fuel is nonrenewable. It is known that a car with an initially empty (but infinitely large capacity) fuel tank can start from any fuel station and, by selecting an appropriate route, refuel at each station it passes and reach the fuel station that is symmetric to the starting point. The car's fuel consumption rate per unit distance is constant. Under these conditions, find the value of n such that the car can traverse all the fuel stations on the planet by some route (the starting and ending points are not restricted).","completion":"To determine the value of n such that the car can traverse to all fueling stations on the spherical surface under the given conditions: 1. **Notation and setup:** Let X' represent the fueling station diametrically opposite to station X on the spherical surface. 2. **Case n=1:** - Here, there are 2 cdot 1 = 2 stations. - The stations are opposing each other, so starting at one station allows the car to reach the diametrically opposite station directly. - Hence, the requirements are easily satisfied. 3. **Case n=2:** - We have 2 cdot 2 = 4 stations, denoted as A, A', B, and B'. - Given that AB = A'B' represents the shortest distance between two stations. Considering the route: - The car starts from station A and can reach station A' either by traveling through B' or station B: - Route A rightarrow B' rightarrow A' - Alternatively, route A rightarrow B rightarrow A' Since station B has sufficient fuel storage for the car to travel from B to the nearest station A, the feasible route is: - B rightarrow A rightarrow B' rightarrow A' 4. **Case n=3:** - We have 2 cdot 3 = 6 stations labeled as A, A', B, B', C, and C'. - Let AB = A'B' be the shortest distance between two stations. - Assume station B is closest to station C. Partition the fuel stations into two groups: [ S={A, B, C} quad text{and} quad S'={A', B', C'} ] - The car can start at any station and reach another set: - If a car starts from A and cannot reach set S', it implies: - Route A rightarrow B cannot reach set S' - Similarly, route A rightarrow C cannot reach set S' - If it can, then the route A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow S' is feasible (since BC leq AC). Thus, the valid route can be: [ A rightarrow B rightarrow C rightarrow A' rightarrow B' rightarrow C' ] - This explanation applies similarly to a car starting from A' set.

Since we are assuming 4 weeks in each month, the total number of weeks in 6 months is: 6 months * 4 weeks/month = 24 weeks The total savings over 6 months is: 560/week * 24 weeks = 13,440 The couple decides to divide half of their savings among their children. So, the amount to be divided is: 13,440 / 2 = 6,720 Each child receives 1680.

Let t be the sum of the x such that g(x) = 10. Then by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the x such that g(x) = -10 is also equal to t. Therefore, [2t = (-1) + 0 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 8 = 18,] so t = 9.
