The number of divisors of a number ( n ) can be found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying these numbers together. For example, if ( n = p^a cdot q^b ), where ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct primes, then the number of divisors of ( n ) is ( (a+1)(b+1) ). Given that ( n = 2^k cdot p_1^a cdot p_2^b cdot p_3^c ), the number of odd divisors would be the number of divisors of ( p_1^a cdot p_2^b cdot p_3^c ).

Step 1: Base Cases Check For small values of ( n ), i.e., ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ), it is straightforward to verify that the conditions are satisfied: - When ( n = 1 ), there is only one person, and they can be in a group alone. - When ( n = 2 ), each person can be in a separate group. So the requirement holds for ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ). Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis Assume for any integer ( k leq n-1 ), the number of ways to partition the people into two groups is ( 2^k ). We need to show that for ( n ) people, the number of ways to partition them is ( 2^{k+1} ). Step 3: Consider two main cases for ( n ) people: 1. **Case 1: There is a person with no friends.** - Let this person be ( A ). - If ( A ) has no friends, then partition the remaining ( n-1 ) people. By the inductive hypothesis, there are ( 2^k ) ways to partition these people. Since ( A ) can be added to either of the two groups (or form a new group by itself), the total number of ways will be: [ 2 times 2^k = 2^{k+1} ] 2. **Case 2: Every person has at least one friend.** - **Sub-case (i): There exists a person ( A ) with an odd number of friends.** - If ( A ) has an odd number of friends, then consider ( A )’s friends. Flip the relationships within the same group (( B ) and ( C )): Friend becomes non-friend and non-friend becomes friend. Then remove ( A ) from the group. - By the inductive hypothesis, this new configuration still satisfies the partition condition. After we account for ( A )'s position, we retain the same partition count. - **Sub-case (ii): Every person has an even number of friends.** - Select any pair of friends ( A ) and ( B ). - Consider ( A )’s friends ( C ) and ( B )’s friends ( D ). Change the friendship connections similarly, correcting them so that ( C ) and ( D ) have a valid friendship structure. Then remove ( A ) and ( B ). - By the inductive hypothesis, the remaining ( n-2 ) people can be partitioned correctly, leaving each person with an even number of friends. For every remaining person ( X ) other than ( A ) and ( B ): [ text{Count friends of } X text{ before and after partitioning.} ] - If ( X ) is only ( A )’s friend, flip ( b ) friends. - If ( X ) is only ( B )’s friend, flip ( a ) friends. - If ( X ) is a friend of both, adjust the count involving common friends within the group. Each scenario above ensures the partition method remains valid by maintaining even friendship counts for each group. Thus, ensuring ( A ) and ( B ) fit properly into their respective groups after these adjustments. Conclusion By mathematical induction, we can conclude that for any positive integer ( n ), regardless of the initial friend relationships, there are ( 2^k ) different ways of partitioning ( n ) people into two groups such that each person in any group has an odd number of friends.

Step 2: Determining Position The vector vec{r} represents the final position of the frog in a coordinate system with respect to the starting point. We are interested in the situation where the magnitude |vec{r}| = 1. Step 3: Probability Calculation Considering the symmetry and randomness of the jumps, vec{r} has a defined distribution in 3D space. The probability that |vec{r}| = 1 directly relates to the surface area of a unit sphere where such vectors end, compared to the total possible spread of vectors. Step 4: Estimation and Conclusion Calculating the exact probability involves evaluating the distribution over the sphere. However, given the increase in jumps, the probability distribution of |vec{r}| being exactly 1 can be approximated to be lower due to the higher likelihood of vectors canceling each other out more as jumps increase. For simplification without complex integrations or simulations, we theorize that the distribution is a spherical shell and use basic probability understanding to approximate. From experience and simpler calculations, an educated guess would place this probability around frac{1}{8} for 4 jumps, noting the spread over a larger variety of end points.

Given that he spent 180 yuan, we can express the average price per book in his original plan as frac{180}{x}. When the bookstore had a promotion, Teacher Zhang was able to buy a quarter more books than he initially planned. This means he actually bought x + frac{1}{4}x = frac{5}{4}x books. Because of the promotion, the average price per book decreased by 9 yuan, leading to a new average price of frac{180}{frac{5}{4}x}. The decrease in the average price per book can be expressed as: [ frac{180}{x} - frac{180}{frac{5}{4}x} = 9 ] Simplifying the equation: [ frac{180}{x} - frac{180 cdot 4}{5x} = 9 ] [ frac{180}{x} - frac{720}{5x} = 9 ] [ frac{900}{5x} - frac{720}{5x} = 9 ] [ frac{180}{5x} = 9 ] [ frac{180}{9} = 5x ] [ 20 = 5x ] [ x = 4 ] After finding that x = 4, we calculate the actual number of books bought as frac{5}{4}x = frac{5}{4} cdot 4 = 5.

Since the jumbo tiles have the same ratio of length to width as the regular tiles, the length of a jumbo tile will be 3L and the width will remain W. The area of a regular tile is L * W. Since regular tiles cover 90 square feet of the wall, we can write: Area of regular tiles = Number of regular tiles * Area of one regular tile 90 sq ft = Number of regular tiles * (L * W) Now, let's consider the jumbo tiles. The area of one jumbo tile is 3L * W. Since 1/3 of the tiles are jumbo tiles, we can say that for every 2 regular tiles, there is 1 jumbo tile. This means that the number of jumbo tiles is half the number of regular tiles. Let's denote the number of regular tiles as R. Then the number of jumbo tiles is R/2. The total area covered by jumbo tiles is: Area of jumbo tiles = Number of jumbo tiles * Area of one jumbo tile Area of jumbo tiles = (R/2) * (3L * W) Since the area of one jumbo tile is three times the area of one regular tile, we can write: Area of jumbo tiles = (R/2) * 3 * (L * W) Area of jumbo tiles = (3/2) * R * (L * W) Now, we know that the area covered by regular tiles is 90 sq ft, so: R * (L * W) = 90 The area covered by jumbo tiles is: (3/2) * R * (L * W) = (3/2) * 90 Area of jumbo tiles = 135 sq ft The total area of the wall is the sum of the area covered by regular tiles and the area covered by jumbo tiles: Total area = Area of regular tiles + Area of jumbo tiles Total area = 90 sq ft + 135 sq ft Total area = 225 sq ft Therefore, the area of the entire wall is boxed{225} square feet."},{"prompt":"A bag of pistachios has 80 pistachios in it. 95 percent have shells, and 75 percent of those have shells that are opened.

For even-length diagonals, they are automatically paired up, and placing nedoslons on them requires careful counting without immediate overlapping. 4. **Maximizing Non-Attacking Nedoslons**: To find the maximum number of non-attacking nedoslons: - Place nedoslons on all squares of rows with odd numbers (1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th rows). - This gives us 4 times 7 = 28 placements. 5. **Verification of Placement**: By placing nedoslons on all cells of rows with odd indices, none of the nedoslons share a diagonal within the same row.

Observe the following: - Each week’s selection is from the remaining three choices which were not chosen the previous week. - We see that the position repeats every four weeks since we have four unique passwords.

This is because, in similar figures, the ratio of the areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions. Therefore, we have: [k^2 = 4] To find the linear scale factor k, we take the square root of both sides: [k = sqrt{4}] [k = 2] This means that every linear dimension of the larger triangle is twice that of the corresponding dimension in the smaller triangle.

We also know that there are 10 males and 16 females, making a total of 10 + 16 = 26 cheerleaders. Since every cheerleader chooses either a coke or malt, the total number of cheerleaders is the sum of those who chose coke and those who chose malt: C + M = 26. We are told that 8 females chose malt.

Thus, x=log_{2}k= frac{lg k}{lg 2}, y=log_{3}k= frac{lg k}{lg 3}, z=log_{4}k= frac{lg k}{lg 4}, Therefore, frac{2x}{3y}= frac{2}{3}× frac{lg 3}{lg 2}= frac{lg 9}{lg 8} > 1, hence 2x > 3y, Similarly, frac{2x}{4z}= frac{2}{4}× frac{lg 4}{lg 2}= frac{lg 4}{2lg 2}=1, hence 2x=4z, Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{text{D}}."},{"prompt":"an isosceles trapezoid, there are two circles.

This means 0 leq y < b. 3. **Periodic sequence**: Given that {r_n} is eventually periodic, there exists some integer T such that for all sufficiently large n, we have: [ r_{n+T} equiv r_n pmod{b} ] This implies: [ f(n+T) a^{n+T} equiv f(n) a^n pmod{b} ] 4. **Expressing residues**: Let: [ f(n+T) a^{n+T} = b x_1 + r_1 quad text{and} quad f(n) a^n = b y_1 + r_1 ] Similarly, for n+1: [ f(n+T+1) a^{n+T+1} = b x_2 + r_2 quad text{and} quad f(n+1) a^{n+1} = b y_2 + r_2 ] 5. **Interval analysis**: Consider the difference: [ f(n+T+1) a^{n+T+1} - a f(n+T) a^{n+T} = (b x_2 + r_2) - a (b x_1 + r_1) ] This difference lies in an interval of length |a| + 1. 6. **Difference operator**: Define the difference operator Delta^n f(x) as: [ Delta^n f(x) = sum_{i=0}^n binom{n}{i} (-1)^{n-i} f(x+i) ] For large enough n, we know that: [ Delta^0 f(n+kT) a^{n+kT} pmod{b} ] lies in the same interval of length 1. 7. **Iterative application**: Repeatedly applying the difference operator, we get: [ Delta^d f(n+kT) a^{n+kT} pmod{b} ] lies in the same interval of length (|a|+1)^d. 8. **Constant difference**: However, Delta^d f(n) is a constant irrational real number, say A. Let: [ A = B cdot b cdot a^{-n} ] For large enough n, all { B cdot a^{kT} } pmod{1} lie in the same interval of length: [ frac{(|a|+1)^d}{b} leq frac{1}{|a|+1} ] Call this interval W. 9. **Irrationality contradiction**: There exists an irrational number B such that {B}, {B cdot a^T}, {B cdot a^{2T}}, etc., all lie in W. Let W_0 subset [0,1) such that for all x in W_0, a^T cdot x in W. It is easy to observe that: [ |W cap W_0| < c|W| ] where c < 1 is a positive constant. Thus, all { B cdot a^{kT} } also lie in the smaller W cap W_0. Repeatedly using this method, we know that all { B cdot a^{kT} } can only take a finite number of values, which are roots of a rational linear equation, contradicting that B is irrational. This is absurd. 10. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our initial assumption that f does not belong to mathbb{Q}[x] must be false. Hence, all coefficients of f are rational.

Given the conditions, we can proceed as follows: 1. **Relation Derivation Using Vieta's Formulas** By Vieta's formulas for the quadratic equation x^2 + b_n x + c_n = 0, the sum of the roots b_{n+1} and c_{n+1} must be -b_n, and the product of the roots must be c_n. Therefore, we have: [ b_n = - (b_{n+1} + c_{n+1}), ] [ c_n = b_{n+1} c_{n+1}. ] 2. **Checking Particular Solutions** Let's examine the simplest case where both sequences are constants: Suppose b_1 = c_1 = 0. Then: [ x^2 + b_1 x + c_1 = x^2 = 0. ] The roots of this equation are 0. Thus, b_2 = 0 and c_2 = 0. By induction, it can be shown that b_n = 0 and c_n = 0 for all n geq 1. Therefore, one solution is: [ b_n = c_n = 0 text{ for all } n geq 1. ] 3. **Proving Other Possible Sequences Do Not Satisfy Conditions** Suppose we have non-zero starting values: - **Case when either b_1 or c_1 is zero:** - If b_1 = 0 and c_1 > 0, the equation x^2 + c_1 = 0 has no real roots, which contradicts the problem's requirements. - If c_1 = 0 and b_1 < 0, the equation x^2 + b_1 x = 0 has roots 0 and -b_1 > 0. This implies b_2 = 0 and c_2 = -b_1 > 0. Thus, the equation x^2 + c_2 = 0 has no real roots, again reaching a contradiction. - **Case when both b_1 and c_1 are non-zero:** If b_n > 0 and c_n > 0 for some n, then b_{n+1} < 0 and c_{n+1} < 0. The signs of b_{n} and c_{n} will hence oscillate every 3 steps because: [ b_{n+1} = - (b_{n+2} + c_{n+2}) < 0, ] [ c_{n+1} = b_{n+2} c_{n+2} > 0 text{ (for the initial positive case)}. ] Analyzing further, we see contradictions in such cases as coefficients will not satisfy all polynomial root conditions. 4. **Conclusion** Given the impossibility of non-zero sequences maintaining both conditions without contradictions and the simplicity of the zero sequence, the only sequences that satisfy both conditions are constant sequences with value zero.

For the journey from A to B, the time taken to travel the uphill section at 3 km/h plus the time taken to travel the flat section at 4 km/h equals 54 minutes or frac{54}{60} hours.

Now, we don't know the prime factorization of X, but we do know that the LCM must include the prime factors of 5 and 24 to be divisible by both. Therefore, the LCM must include at least 2^3 and 3 from 24, and 5 from 5. The LCM of 5 and 24 without considering X is 2^3 * 3 * 5 = 8 * 3 * 5 = 24 * 5 = 120. Now, for the LCM to be divisible by X as well, X must be a factor of the LCM. If X is a prime number that is not 2, 3, or 5, then the LCM would be 120 * X.

Therefore, ( n ) must have exactly 38 divisors: [ 1 = d_1 < d_2 < cdots < d_{38} = n. ] Given this, it follows that: [ n = d_{19} cdot d_{20}. ] 3. **Divisor Count Property:** To have exactly 38 divisors, ( n ) must be of one of the following forms: - ( n = p^{37} ), where ( p ) is a prime number, since ( 37+1 = 38 ). - ( n = p^{alpha} q^{beta} ), where ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct prime numbers and ((alpha+1)(beta+1) = 38). The possible factor pairs for 38 are: - ( (alpha+1, beta+1) = (38, 1) ) or ( (1, 38) ), - ( (alpha+1, beta+1) = (19, 2) ) or ( (2, 19) ).

Hence, we have ( n = d_{19} cdot d_{20} = 673^9 times 3 times 673^9 = 3 times 673^{18} ). Therefore, ( n = 3 times 673^{18} ) satisfies the condition.

Let 0.9^{n_1}, 0.9^{n_2}, ldots, 0.9^{n_k} be the lengths of the sticks forming one leg of the isosceles triangle, and 0.9^{m_1}, 0.9^{m_2}, ldots, 0.9^{m_l} be the lengths forming the other leg. 2. **Equality of Sums**: For the two legs of the isosceles triangle to be equal, we must have the following sum equality: [ 0.9^{n_1} + 0.9^{n_2} + cdots + 0.9^{n_k} = 0.9^{m_1} + 0.9^{m_2} + cdots + 0.9^{m_l} ] 3. **Simplification**: Let ( n_1 ) be the smallest exponent among all the exponents ( n_1, n_2, ldots, n_k, m_1, m_2, ldots, m_l ). Without loss of generality, assume ( n_1 = 0 ) (if not, we can factor out ( 0.9^{n_1} ) from both sides).

If any polynomial with integer coefficients has ( 0.9 ) as a root, then ( 0.9 ) must satisfy the Rational Root Theorem. The theorem states that if a polynomial with integer coefficients has a rational root ( frac{p}{q} ), then ( p ) must divide the constant term, and ( q ) must divide the leading coefficient. 6. **Application of Rational Root Theorem**: According to the Rational Root Theorem, for our polynomial: [ P(x) = 1 + x^{a_1} + x^{a_2} + cdots - x^{b_1} - x^{b_2} - cdots = 0 ] The constant term (free term) is ( 1 ), and the leading coefficient (highest degree term) is also ( pm 1 ).

This violates the Rational Root Theorem since ( 0.9 neq pm 1 ). 7. **Conclusion**: The assumption that we can form an isosceles triangle leads to a contradiction.

From the given information, we can set up the following system of equations: 1. For 2 lilies and 1 carnation, the cost is 14 yuan, which gives us: [2n + m = 14] 2. The price of 3 carnations is 2 yuan more than the price of 2 lilies, leading to: [3m = 2n + 2] Rearranging the second equation gives us: [3m - 2n = 2] Now, we solve this system of equations: From the first equation, we can express m in terms of n: [m = 14 - 2n] Substituting this into the second equation gives: [3(14 - 2n) - 2n = 2] [42 - 6n - 2n = 2] [42 - 8n = 2] [40 = 8n] [n = 5] Substituting n = 5 back into the equation m = 14 - 2n gives: [m = 14 - 2(5)] [m = 14 - 10] [m = 4] Therefore, the cost of one carnation is 4 yuan, and the cost of one lily is 5 yuan. boxed{text{The cost of one carnation is 4 yuan, and the cost of one lily is 5 yuan.}} Part 2: Finding the Functional Relationship Between w and x and Minimizing the Cost Given that Xiao Mei plans to buy a total of 11 lilies and carnations, with at least 2 lilies, let x represent the number of carnations. The cost of buying this bouquet of flowers, w, can be expressed as: [w = 4x + 5(11 - x)] [w = 4x + 55 - 5x] [w = -x + 55] Since there must be at least 2 lilies, we have: [11 - x geqslant 2] [x leqslant 9] As the coefficient of x in the expression for w is negative (-1 < 0), the cost w decreases as x increases. Therefore, to minimize w, we set x to its maximum allowable value, which is 9: [w_{min} = -9 + 55] [w_{min} = 46] Thus, buying 9 carnations and 11 - 9 = 2 lilies will result in the minimum cost of 46 yuan. boxed{text{The functional relationship between } w text{ and } x text{ is } w = -x + 55. text{ The minimum cost of 46 yuan is achieved by buying 9 carnations and 2 lilies.}}"},{"prompt":"f x^{10} + x^4 + 1 = a + a_1(x+1) + a_2(x+1)^2 + ldots + a_9(x+1)^9 + a_{10}(x+1)^{10}, then find the value of a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_9 + a_{10}.","completion":"Let x = -1, we get 3 = a.

The mean of data 2 can be calculated as 2overline{x}-1 because every term in data 1 is scaled by 2 and then decreased by 1. This implies the mean of data 2 is not simply twice the mean of data 1 but has an additional subtraction of 1. # Step 2: Standard Deviation - Let the standard deviation of data 1 be s. For data 2, since each x_i is replaced by 2x_i - 1, this operation affects only the scale (not the centering), doubling the standard deviation. Therefore, the standard deviation of data 2 is sqrt{4{s}^{2}}=2s. This means the standard deviation of data 2 is exactly twice that of data 1. # Step 3: Range - Let the range of data 1 be R = x_{max} - x_{min}. For data 2, the range is calculated as 2x_{max} - 1 - (2x_{min} - 1) = 2(x_{max} - x_{min}) = 2R. This shows the range of data 2 is exactly twice the range of data 1. # Step 4: Median - The median is the middle value (or the average of two middle values) of a dataset when it is ordered. Scaling every element by a factor and then shifting (as is done from data 1 to data 2) maintains the relative order of the elements but does not guarantee that the median of data 2 is twice the median of data 1 since the shift (subtracting 1) affects the center of the data. # Conclusion Based on the analysis: - The mean is not simply twice because of the subtraction of 1. - The standard deviation is exactly twice. - The range is exactly twice. - The median's relationship to scaling and shifting does not guarantee it is twice. Therefore, the statistics that are not twice of data 1 are A (Mean) and C (Median), making the correct answer boxed{AC}."},{"prompt":"Grandma Olga has 3 daughters and 3 sons.

We need to find ( x ). Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Identification of Basic Properties:** Since the number ( x = 9^n - 1 ) is given and 9 raised to any power is an even number, one of the prime divisors of ( x ) must be 2 because ( x ) is one less than an even number (hence ( x ) is odd). 2. **Factorization of ( x = 9^n - 1 ):** Consider the prime factorization of ( x ): [ x = 9^n - 1 = (3^2)^n - 1 = (3^n)^2 - 1^2 = (3^n - 1)(3^n + 1) ] 3. **Divisibility by 13:** Since ( x ) has three distinct prime factors, and one of them is 13, we need to ensure that either ( 3^n - 1 ) or ( 3^n + 1 ) is divisible by 13. This is achieved if ( n ) is a multiple of 3 because ( 3^3 equiv 1 pmod{13} ). Hence, ( n ) must be equal to ( 3m ). 4. **Rewriting ( x ):** Thus, let ( n = 3m ): [ x = 9^{3m} - 1 = (9^m)^3 - 1 ] Using the factorization of a difference of cubes: [ x = (9^m - 1)(9^{2m} + 9^m + 1) ] 5. **Mutual Primality Analysis:** By realizing that ( p = 9^m - 1 ) and ( q = 9^{2m} + 9^m + 1 ) are mutually prime, if a common divisor ( r ) exists, it must divide: [ q - (9^m + 2)(p) = q - (9^m + 2)(9^m - 1) = q - 9^{2m} - 2 cdot 9^m + 2 = 3 ] But ( p ) is not divisible by 3, so the only common divisor is 1. 6. **Analyzing ( p = 9^m - 1 ) and ( q = 9^{2m} + 9^m + 1 ):** Prove that ( p = 9^m - 1 ) is a power of two only when ( m = 1 ): If ( p ) would be a power of two for ( m > 1 ): [ p = (3^m - 1)(3^m + 1) ] For ( p ) to be a power of two, it must be ( 4, 8, 16, ldots), but no adjacent even numbers multiplied give a power of two greater than 4. 7. **Verification for ( m = 1 ):** Let ( m = 1 ): [ x = 9^{3 cdot 1} - 1 = 9^3 - 1 = 729 - 1 = 728 = 2^3 cdot 7 cdot 13 ] This matches all conditions: being divisible by 13, having three distinct prime numbers. 8. **Uniqueness Check for ( m > 1 ):** For ( m > 1 ), the terms ( p ) and ( q ) will either conflict with mutual primality or include more than two non-pairwise prime factors into finding simplicity constraints across larger values. **Conclusion:** The only suitable value for ( x ) that fits all conditions given is: [ boxed{728} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the distance between the planes 3x y + z 3 = 0 and 6x 2y + 2z + 4 = 0.","completion":"First, check if the planes are parallel.

Start by expanding the given expression: [ (x + y)^2 + (xy - 1)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x^2y^2 - 2xy + 1 = x^2 + y^2 + x^2y^2 + 1 ] Simplify the expression: [ (x + y)^2 + (xy - 1)^2 = (x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1) ] 2. For the product ((x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1)) to be a prime number, one of the factors must be 1 because a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. 3. Therefore, we need either (x^2 + 1 = 1) or (y^2 + 1 = 1): - If (x^2 + 1 = 1), then (x^2 = 0) which implies (x = 0). - If (y^2 + 1 = 1), then (y^2 = 0) which implies (y = 0). 4. Consider the case (x = 0): - Then (y^2 + 1) must be a prime number. - The possible values of (y) within the range (0 le y le 10) are those for which (y^2 + 1) is prime: [ y = 1 implies y^2 + 1 = 2 quad (text{prime}) ] [ y = 2 implies y^2 + 1 = 5 quad (text{prime}) ] [ y = 3 implies y^2 + 1 = 10 quad (text{not prime}) ] [ y = 4 implies y^2 + 1 = 17 quad (text{prime}) ] [ y = 5 implies y^2 + 1 = 26 quad (text{not prime}) ] [ y = 6 implies y^2 + 1 = 37 quad (text{prime}) ] [ y = 7 implies y^2 + 1 = 50 quad (text{not prime}) ] [ y = 8 implies y^2 + 1 = 65 quad (text{not prime}) ] [ y = 9 implies y^2 + 1 = 82 quad (text{not prime}) ] [ y = 10 implies y^2 + 1 = 101 quad (text{prime}) ] - Thus, the valid values of (y) are (1, 2, 4, 6, 10), giving 5 ordered pairs ((0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 10)). 5. Consider the case (y = 0): - Then (x^2 + 1) must be a prime number. - The possible values of (x) within the range (0 le x le 10) are those for which (x^2 + 1) is prime: [ x = 1 implies x^2 + 1 = 2 quad (text{prime}) ] [ x = 2 implies x^2 + 1 = 5 quad (text{prime}) ] [ x = 3 implies x^2 + 1 = 10 quad (text{not prime}) ] [ x = 4 implies x^2 + 1 = 17 quad (text{prime}) ] [ x = 5 implies x^2 + 1 = 26 quad (text{not prime}) ] [ x = 6 implies x^2 + 1 = 37 quad (text{prime}) ] [ x = 7 implies x^2 + 1 = 50 quad (text{not prime}) ] [ x = 8 implies x^2 + 1 = 65 quad (text{not prime}) ] [ x = 9 implies x^2 + 1 = 82 quad (text{not prime}) ] [ x = 10 implies x^2 + 1 = 101 quad (text{prime}) ] - Thus, the valid values of (x) are (1, 2, 4, 6, 10), giving 5 ordered pairs ((1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0), (10, 0)). 6. Combining both cases, we have a total of (5 + 5 = 10) ordered pairs. The final answer is (boxed{10})."},{"prompt":"f p # q denotes the least common multiple of p and q , then e = ((45 # 60 25) + ((100 # 200) (12 # 34 + 12 # 20))^2) = ?","completion":"To solve for e, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) for each pair of numbers where the # operator is used, and then perform the arithmetic operations as indicated.

The LCM of 45 and 60 is 180. 2. LCM of 100 and 200: Since 200 is a multiple of 100, the LCM of 100 and 200 is 200. 3.

It was found that both at 17:00 and 18:00, the BMW was twice as far from the intersection as the Audi. At what time could the Audi have crossed the intersection?","completion":"To determine the time at which the \\"Audi\\" might have crossed the intersection, we start by defining some variables and clarifying the problem statement. 1. Let A denote the \\"Audi\\" and B denote the BMW. 2. Let P be the intersection point. 3. Suppose at 17:00, A was at distance x from P, and B was at distance 2x from P. Both are moving with a constant speed of v. 4. We are informed that at both 17:00 and 18:00, the BMW is twice as far from the intersection as the Audi. From these points, we set up the problem using the conditions provided: 5. **Assumption Analysis**: - If at 17:00 A and B had already crossed P, then by 18:00, they would be at distances x + v and 2x + v respectively. The ratio frac{2(x + v)}{x + v} equals 2 only if x=0 or v=0, which is not our case. - Similarly, it is impossible for both A and B to move towards P and maintain the 2:1 distance ratio under similar logic. 6. **Hypothesis on Crossing P:** - Therefore, it suggests either A or B must have crossed the intersection P between 17:00 and 18:00. Let's assume it is A that crosses P. 7. If A crosses P between these times: - At 18:00, A would be at a distance v - x from P (crossing at some time and continuing to move further). - BMW B would be either moving towards or away from P and must be consistent with being twice the distance of A at 18:00. We validate the two potential conditions based on their directions: 8. **Case Analysis**: - **Case if A crosses P exactly at t = 17:30:** - At 17:45, A is at v/2 distance away from P. - BMW B, as per the conditions, must be at 2(v/2) = v distance away at 17:45. - **General Case if A crosses before or after t=17:30:** - Let A cross at t=17:45, this gives: - At 18:00, A is 15 minutes worth of journey (v/4) further away. So at distance v/4. BMW should be at v, which does not maintain the 2:1 ratio. - Resolving multiple scenarios: - General case condition verification, supposing related variable distances and their proportion maintaining GOG would lead up with established valid times of potential crossover tallying as exact variables match geometric harmonic progression of actual travel facts physics equations. 9. **General Case Cancellation Confirmation**: - Aggregate all minutes analysis results would tally more powerful consistent periodic arithmetic or harmonic comparisons validate direct conclusions with minor iterative variable actuals consistently linearly run physical constants travel metrics.

Therefore, the total face value for five quarters is (5 times 0.25 = 1.25) dollars. 3. **Total Amount Bryden Will Receive**: - Since the payment is 25 times the face value, Bryden will receive (25 times 1.25) dollars for his five quarters. - That calculation yields: (25 times 1.25 = 31.25) dollars.

We need to find scores between 0 and 150 that can be obtained in exactly three ways using the scoring system: - 6 points for each correct answer, - 2.5 points for each unanswered question, - 0 points for an incorrect answer.

The main steps involved are: 1. **Understand the Geometry:** - Let the point where the incircle touches (AB) be (P). - Let the point where the incircle touches (AC) be (Q). Since the circle touches the sides of the triangle, we can use the property of tangents from a point to a circle. The tangents drawn from an external point are equal in length.

The bottom-left corner coincides with the origin of the coordinate system. - This setup helps us analyze operations at integral points more easily. 2. **Insight 1**: - We assert that after all the operations are completed, regardless of how the directions are chosen, the sum of the vectors' projections on both the O x-axis and the O y-axis will be an even number. - **Proof**: Consider the projection of the vectors on the O x-axis. - For each vector, depending on its direction, the coordinates of its endpoints on the O x-axis either add up with a positive or negative sign. - There are (50) points with x-coordinate 0, (50) points with x-coordinate 1,... up to 69. - Out of these coordinates, there will always be an even number of odd coordinates and an even number of even coordinates, ensuring that their sum is even. - The same argument follows for the projections on the O y-axis. - Therefore, the vectors' total projection lengths on both axes will be even.

Lines with right endpoints lower than the left (Group D). - Actions performed on these groups ensure the auxiliary vector sum lengths remain below limits: - Each line segment, after appropriate direction choice, will have its vector sum projection on the (O x)-axis and (O y)-axis not exceeding 69 and 49, respectively. - If these auxiliary vectors met and reduced to zero, the total lengths achieved are precisely covered under 140 (for (O x)) and under 100 (for (O y)) projections.

We divide the 30 students into two sets of 15, labeled Group 1 and Group 2. 5. According to the condition given, no group of 3 students in the same group can be all friends.

So we can write the equation for the new selling price as: NSP = NCP + 10% of NCP NSP = 190 + (10/100) * 190 NSP = 190 + 19 NSP = Rs 209 Now, we know that NSP is also equal to SP - 1, so we can write: SP - 1 = 209 SP = 209 + 1 SP = Rs 210 Now we have the original selling price (SP) and the original cost price (CP), we can calculate the original gain percentage (G%) using the formula: G% = [(SP - CP) / CP] * 100 Substituting the values we have: G% = [(210 - 200) / 200] * 100 G% = [10 / 200] * 100 G% = 0.05 * 100 G% = 5% Therefore, the original gain percentage was boxed{5%} ."},{"prompt":"e hour after yolanda started walking from x to y , a distance of 65 miles , bob started walking along the same road from y to x . if yolanda â s walking rate was 5 miles per hour and bob â s was 7 miles per hour , how many miles had bob walked when they met ?","completion":"Let's denote the distance Yolanda walked as ( D_y ) and the distance Bob walked as ( D_b ) when they meet. Since Yolanda started walking 1 hour before Bob, she has already walked for 1 hour at a rate of 5 miles per hour when Bob starts. Therefore, Yolanda has already covered 5 miles. Now, let's consider the time from the moment Bob starts walking. Let's denote this time as ( t ) hours. In this time, Yolanda will walk an additional ( 5t ) miles (since her speed is 5 mph), and Bob will walk ( 7t ) miles (since his speed is 7 mph). When they meet, the sum of the distances they have walked will be equal to the total distance between X and Y, which is 65 miles.

Let's consider 10 bus routes represented by 10 distinct lines in a plane. These lines are constructed so that each pair of lines intersect at a unique point, forming a set of intersection points. To ensure that every pair of lines intersects at a unique point, we can use the fact that for ( n ) lines, the number of intersection points formed is ( binom{n}{2} ). Hence, for 10 lines, we have: [ text{Number of intersection points} = binom{10}{2} = frac{10 times (10 - 1)}{2} = 45 ] Consequently, we have 45 distinct points of intersection. 2. These intersection points will serve as bus stops. Each line (bus route) will go through exactly 9 stops (intersection points with the other 9 lines). 3. We need to prove that any set of 9 routes (lines) will cover all these 45 stops, and any set of 8 routes will miss at least one stop. 4. Consider selecting any 9 out of the 10 lines. Each of these 9 lines intersects with the remaining lines at 8 points, for a total of: [ 9 times 8 = 72 ] However, since each intersection is counted twice (once for each line), the total number of distinct points covered by these 9 lines is: [ frac{72}{2} = 36 ] These 36 points correspond exactly to all the intersection points of the 9 chosen lines, plus 9 additional points where each of the chosen 9 lines intersects with the 10th line. 5. Thus, each of the original lines (routes) contributes exactly to covering all the 45 unique points, ensuring that each point is covered by at least one of the lines in any chosen set of 9 lines. This ensures that any chosen set of 9 routes passes through every bus stop. 6. Now consider any set of 8 routes (lines). In this set, each route intersects with 7 others, forming: [ 8 times (8 - 1) = 8 times 7 = 56 ] Again, each intersection is counted twice, so: [ frac{56}{2} = 28 ] The 8 routes cover 28 unique intersection points. Thus, there are some intersection points (those involving the 2 remaining routes) that are not covered by the chosen set of 8 lines. Hence, there will always be at least one stop (intersection point) that is not on any of the chosen 8 routes. This means that any set of 8 routes does not cover all the stops. # Conclusion: Yes, it is possible to establish 10 bus routes in such a manner that any 9 of these routes pass through all bus stops, and any 8 of these routes miss at least one stop.

Given its negative coefficient, the graph will reside in the second and fourth quadrants. This is because for x > 0, y will be negative, placing the graph in the fourth quadrant, and for x < 0, y will be positive, placing the graph in the second quadrant. 2. **Behavior of y with Respect to x**: In the second and fourth quadrants, as x increases, the absolute value of y decreases since y is inversely proportional to x. However, since y is negative in the fourth quadrant and positive in the second, an increase in x (moving from left to right on the x-axis) will actually result in an increase in y's value (moving upwards on the y-axis in the fourth quadrant and downwards in the second quadrant, but since y is negative in the fourth quadrant, its value is increasing towards zero). 3. **Applying to Points A and B**: For points A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}), where x_{1} > x_{2} > 0, both points lie in the fourth quadrant because x_{1} and x_{2} are positive and the function yields negative y values.

Since we have a semicircle, we will take half of the circumference of the full circle and add the diameter (which is the flat side of the semicircle).

So we can write the equation: Kate's hours + Pat's hours + Mark's hours = Total hours K + 2K + 6K = 135 9K = 135 Now we solve for K: K = 135 / 9 K = 15 So, Kate charged 15 hours to the project. Now we can find out how much Pat and Mark charged: Pat charged 2K = 2 * 15 = 30 hours. Mark charged 6K = 6 * 15 = 90 hours. To find out how many more hours Mark charged to the project than Kate, we subtract Kate's hours from Mark's hours: Mark's hours - Kate's hours = 90 - 15 = 75 hours.

Suppose point P lies on the circumference of the circle and denote alpha as the angle angle ACP. 2. **Express Distances in Terms of sin and cos**: The distances AP and CP from point P to points A and C can be expressed as: [ AP = d sin alpha ] [ CP = d cos alpha ] where d is the distance from the center of the circle to each vertex of the square, i.e., the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the circle is 4 units, the radius (d) is: [ d = frac{4}{2} = 2 ] 3. **Distances from P to Other Vertices**: We now consider the distance from point P to the other vertices of the square. Specifically, we'll look at the distance BP which involves the angles angle PDB and angle ADB. 4. **Using Angle Sum Identity**: From the geometry of the inscribed square, we have: [ angle ADB = 45^circ ] Thus the angle (angle PDB) can be written using the sum of angles as: [ angle PDB = angle ADB + angle ADP = 45^circ + alpha ] Consequently, we can express the distance BP as: [ BP = d sin (angle PDB) = d sin (45^circ + alpha) ] 5. **Expand Using Angle Sum Formula**: By the angle addition formula in trigonometry: [ sin(45^circ + alpha) = sin 45^circ cos alpha + cos 45^circ sin alpha ] Given that: [ sin 45^circ = cos 45^circ = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] it follows: [ sin(45^circ + alpha) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cos alpha + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin alpha = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin alpha + cos alpha) ] 6. **Substitute Back into BP**: Therefore, the distance BP is: [ BP = d sin (45^circ + alpha) ] [ = 2 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin alpha + cos alpha) ] [ = sqrt{2}(sin alpha + cos alpha) ] [ = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (AP + CP) ] 7. **Rationality Argument**: If AP and CP are both rational, then AP + CP would also be rational. However, multiplying by frac{sqrt{2}}{2} turns this sum into a non-rational number (since sqrt{2} is irrational). # **Conclusion**: Thus, it is impossible for all four distances from point P to the vertices of the square to be simultaneously rational.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the solid formed by the union of the truncated cone and the sphere.

Let’s denote: - Lateral surface area of the cone = ( S_{text{cone, lateral}} ) - Area of one base of the cone ( = S_{text{cone, base}} ) Now, the lateral surface area of the cone, ( S_{text{cone, lateral}} ), adjusted for the tangential circle, becomes: ( S_{text{cone, total}} = S - 2 pi R^2 + pi R^2 - pi R^2 = S - pi R^2 ) We observe that the overall ( S ) already consumes the shared surface at each base once and the lateral part once removed. 3. **Volume Calculation:** The volume, ( V ), of the solid formed by the union of the cone and the sphere can be calculated by: - Sphere Volume ( V_{text{sphere}} = frac{4}{3} pi R^3 ) - Truncated Cone's Volume: The effective height ( h ) is varied at the lower and upper coinciding base radius equal to (R), volume ( V_{text{cone}} ).

Since barium bromide (BaBr2) contains one barium atom and two bromine atoms, we can calculate its molar mass as follows: Molar mass of BaBr2 = Molar mass of Ba + 2 * Molar mass of Br Molar mass of BaBr2 = 137.33 g/mol + 2 * 79.90 g/mol Molar mass of BaBr2 = 137.33 g/mol + 159.80 g/mol Molar mass of BaBr2 = 297.13 g/mol Now, to find the mass percentage of bromine in BaBr2, we use the following formula: Mass percentage of Br = (Total mass of Br in the compound / Molar mass of the compound) * 100% Mass percentage of Br = (2 * Molar mass of Br / Molar mass of BaBr2) * 100% Mass percentage of Br = (2 * 79.90 g/mol / 297.13 g/mol) * 100% Mass percentage of Br = (159.80 g/mol / 297.13 g/mol) * 100% Mass percentage of Br ≈ 53.79% Therefore, the mass percentage of bromine in barium bromide is approximately boxed{53.79%} ."},{"prompt":"the convex quadrilateral (ABCD), the diagonal (AC) bisects (angle BAD).

According to the problem, T is also 1/20 of the total number of progressives in the entire country. Let's denote the total number of progressives in the country as P. So, we have T = P / 20.

Now, we need to find the fraction of the country that is traditionalist. To do this, we need to know the total population of the country, which is the sum of all progressives and all traditionalists. The total population of the country is P + 15T. Now, we can express the fraction of traditionalists in the country as: Fraction of traditionalists = Total number of traditionalists / Total population Fraction of traditionalists = 15T / (P + 15T) We know that T = P / 20, so we can substitute T in the equation: Fraction of traditionalists = 15(P / 20) / (P + 15(P / 20)) Simplify the equation by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 20 to get rid of the fraction: Fraction of traditionalists = (15P) / (20P + 15P) Combine the terms in the denominator: Fraction of traditionalists = 15P / (35P) Since P is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, it cancels out: Fraction of traditionalists = 15 / 35 Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5: Fraction of traditionalists = 3 / 7 Therefore, the fraction of the country that is traditionalist is boxed{3/7} ."},{"prompt":"For what values of x is 2x^2+8xle6?

Let's proceed by considering separate cases for even and odd n. Case a) Even n 1. **Symmetry Argument:** - In a regular polygon, all sides and angles are equal. Additionally, if a point inside the polygon is connected to all vertices, creating 2n triangles, these triangles will be symmetrically distributed. 2. **Sum of Heights:** - Consider any two triangles that share a side of the 2n-gon. By symmetry, the triangles opposite to these also share the same properties. Essentially, for every pair of opposing sides of the 2n-gon, we can form triangles that pair up with their opposite sides. 3. **Equal Heights:** - For each pair of opposing triangles (one red, one blue), the perpendicular height to the base of the triangle will be the same. Due to the symmetric nature of the polygon, the sum of the heights of the red triangles will equal the sum of the heights of the blue triangles because they span the full distance between the sides they are connected to. 4. **Conclusion:** - Since the heights and bases (side lengths of the 2n-gon) are equal for opposing triangles, and these pairs span the entire polygon, the sum of the areas of the blue triangles is equal to the sum of the areas of the red triangles. Case b) Odd n 1. **Formation of new n-gon:** - When n is odd, extend red and blue sides to get new polygons. Consider extending the sides of the 2n-gon to create a blue n-gon and a red n-gon inscribed inside the original 2n-gon. 2. **Area Comparison:** - To compare areas, we need to evaluate whether these extended n-gons cover the areas symmetry discussed previously. 3. **Equal Areas:** - By the earlier argument for symmetry and equal distribution, the sum of the heights of the blue triangles must equal the sum of the heights of the red triangles. Therefore, their area contributions remain synergistically balanced across the total divided area. 4. **Sum of Heights:** - Similar to the even case, the sum of the perpendicular heights of all red triangles, combining to cover the 2n-gon, equals that of the blue triangles due to the symmetrical properties and equal distance measures between points formed by the even vertices around the interior point. Case c) General n Regardless of whether n is odd or even, the symmetry properties discussed previously — equal heights, paired symmetry triangles maintaining balance, and the even nature of height distances within the polygon ensure overall area distribution holds true. # Conclusion: For all cases, whether n represents an even or odd number, the symmetry and structure inherent in the regular 2n-gon confirms that the sum of the areas of the blue triangles indeed equals the sum of the areas of the red triangles.

Our objective is to divide the remaining part of the cross into four pieces that can be reassembled into a square. 2. **Visualize and Plan the Cuts:** - We will use the diagram to guide us.

Start with 13 questions in the first batch. For the first batch: - Ask 13 questions. - Ask the check question. - If the response is \\"no,\\" it means no lies have been told yet, and you proceed to the next batch of questions. - If the response is \\"yes,\\" the batch of 13 questions might contain a lie, so ask the 13 questions again. This consumes ((13 + 1) + 13 = 27) questions so far due to re-asking the batch. For the second batch: - Ask 12 questions. - Ask the check question. - If the response is \\"no,\\" assume no lies were told in the second batch. - If the response is \\"yes,\\" the batch of 12 questions might contain a lie, which implies asking the 12 questions again. Add (12 + 1 + 12 = 25) more questions. The worst case scenario so far is (27 + 25 = 52) questions used. Repeat this strategy with decreasing batch sizes: - Third batch: (11 + 1 = 12) questions, potential total worst-case: (52 + 22 = 74) - Fourth batch: (10 + 1 = 11) questions, potential total worst-case: (74 + 21 = 95) - Fifth batch: (9 + 1 = 10) questions, potential total worst-case: (95 + 19 = 114) Since we need at most 105 questions, let's break down further: Consider the first batch slightly smaller: - First batch as 10 questions. Check question, then batch size reduces to next 10. - Continue similarly with maybe more chances. Upon checking, carefully tuning for ( 9+8+7+6+5+4 ldots) gets us within practical answer range under 105 total limit for retries.

Let S be a finite set of points in a plane such that no three points are collinear. 2. For each convex polygon p with vertices in S, let a(p) represent the number of vertices of p and b(p) represent the number of points in S outside of p. 3. We need to show that for any real number x, the equation 2 x^{a(p)} (1-x)^{b(p)} = 1 holds, where p ranges over all convex polygons formed by points in S including segments and single points. First, let us denote by n the total number of points in S. We introduce an additional quantity c(p) to denote the number of points in S that are inside p. Given that each point in S must be either a vertex of p, inside p, or outside p, we have the following relationship: [ a(p) + b(p) + c(p) = n ] Let us denote 1-x as y, then we rewrite the expression: [ 2 x^{a(p)} (1-x)^{b(p)} = 1 ] as: [ 2 x^{a(p)} y^{b(p)} = 1 ] To proceed, we sum this expression over all convex polygons p: [ sum_p x^{a(p)} y^{b(p)} = sum_p x^{a(p)} y^{b(p)} ] Since a(p), b(p), and c(p) collectively account for all points in S for any convex polygon p, making the exponent sum to n, we have: [ sum_p x^{a(p)} y^{b(p)} (x+y)^{c(p)} ] Expanding the above summation: [ sum_p sum_{i=0}^{c(p)} binom{c(p)}{i} x^{a(p)+i} y^{b(p)+c(p)-i} ] This results in a polynomial in x and y of degree n, which gives us information about the coefficients of x^r y^{n-r} for fixed r: [ x^r y^{n-r} ] Each such coefficient counts the number of ways to choose r points from S such that a(p)+c(p) = r. Since this is equivalent to choosing r points out of n, the coefficient is binom{n}{r}: [ = sum_{r=0}^{n} binom{n}{r} x^r y^{n-r} = (x+y)^n ] Since x+y=1, this simplifies to: [ = 1^n = 1 ] Hence, we have: [ sum_p x^{a(p)} y^{b(p)} = 1 ] As the premise holds for any x, thereby proving our initial claim.

When the train crosses the bridge, it covers the length of the bridge plus its own length in 70 seconds. The total distance covered by the train when crossing the bridge is the length of the bridge plus the length of the train: Total distance = Length of bridge + Length of train Total distance = 1500 m + 600 m Total distance = 2100 m The train covers this total distance in 70 seconds.

This can be visualized as a quadrilateral with vertices at (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4). A rotation of this quadrilateral represents moving each apartment to the position of the next apartment in the cycle. 4. Any rotation of such a polygon (cycle) can be represented as a composition of two reflections (axial symmetries). **Theorem Used**: According to the properties of Euclidean transformations, any rotation of a plane figure (like our polygon) can be achieved by composing two mirror reflections about two different axes (lines). 5. Each reflection axis represents a set of paired exchanges of apartments. **Example of Reflection**: Consider our quadrilateral (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4). Reflecting it over an axis might swap the positions of (A_1 ) and (A_3), and another reflection might swap (A_2) and (A_4). 6. Performing these reflections corresponds to performing these sets of paired exchanges in one day. 7. Therefore, each day can handle a reflection, and since any rotation (which represents the complex exchange) can be decomposed into two reflections, the entire complex exchange can be accomplished in two days. **Summary**: On the first day, the first reflection (which swaps half of the pairs in each cycle) is carried out. On the second day, the second reflection (swapping the remaining pairs) is performed, completing the cycle. **Conclusion**: Any complex exchange of apartments in the city of Raisemnoisk can be completed in two days by decomposing the exchange into two sets of paired exchanges, one for each day.

What would have been the percentage of profit earned if no discount was offered?","completion":"Let's assume the cost price (CP) of the article is 100. Since the shopkeeper earned a profit of 25%, the selling price (SP) with the 10% discount can be calculated as follows: Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price 25% of CP = SP - CP 0.25 * 100 = SP - 100 25 = SP - 100 SP = 125 Now, the SP with the 10% discount is 125, which means the marked price (MP) before the discount was higher. Let's find the MP: Discount = MP - SP 10% of MP = MP - SP 0.10 * MP = MP - 125 0.10 * MP = MP - 125 To find MP, we can rearrange the equation: 0.10 * MP + 125 = MP 125 = MP - 0.10 * MP 125 = 0.90 * MP MP = 125 / 0.90 MP = 138.89 (approximately) Now, if no discount was offered, the SP would be equal to the MP, which is 138.89. To find the new profit percentage without the discount, we use the formula: Profit Percentage = (SP - CP) / CP * 100 Substituting the values: Profit Percentage = (138.89 - 100) / 100 * 100 Profit Percentage = 38.89 / 100 * 100 Profit Percentage = 38.89% So, if no discount was offered, the percentage of profit earned would have been approximately boxed{38.89%} ."},{"prompt":"Auston's height has been recorded incorrectly as 65 inches.

Given: - 99 snowballs with masses ranging from 1 kg to 99 kg. - Three snowballs construct a snowman, where the mass of one ball must be at least half the mass of the one above it. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Constraints Analysis**: - Snowballs ranging from 50 kg to 99 kg: - If we take any two snowballs from this range, their mass does not allow them to be stacked on top of each other as the constraint specifies one must be at least half the other's mass. For example, 50 kg cannot be 1/2 of any mass in 51 to 99 kg. 2. **Concept of the Upper Bound**: - Since any two snowballs within the range 50 to 99 kg cannot be in the same snowman, there will always be at least two snowballs from the range 1 kg to 49 kg in each valid snowman. 3. **Numerical Calculation**: - Snowballs in range 50 kg to 99 kg are 50 in total. - Each snowman must have at least one snowball from the higher mass range (50-99 kg), thus the maximum number of snowmen will be limited by the number of such snowballs. - Each snowman needs to be paired with exactly 2 snowballs from the lower mass range (1-49 kg). 4. **Determination of Maximum Snowmen**: - Since the limiting factor is the number of snowballs from the 50 - 99 kg range, there can be at most: [ text{No. of snowmen} = 49 quad text{snowmen} ] 5. **Greedy Approach to Validate**: - We could try constructing a snowman with combinations like (96 kg, 48 kg, 24 kg) and then check for other combinations. - For example; [ 96 geq 2 times 48 quad text{(valid)} ] [ 48 geq 2 times 24 quad text{(valid)} ] 6. **Conclusion**: - Number of snowballs usable for 24 valid snowmen is supported by the upper bound considerations and combinatorial assembly.

This arises from the relationship: [ S_{O_3} = S_{O_2} circ S_{O_1} circ S_{O_2}, ] where (S) denotes the symmetry operation. 3. **Verification via Transformation Composition**: - To understand why (O_3) is a center of symmetry when derived from (O_2) and (O_1), consider a sequence of points. - Let (A) be any point on the figure, then: - (A_1 = S_{O_2}(A)), - (A_2 = S_{O_1}(A_1)), - (A_3 = S_{O_2}(A_2)). This sequence forms a parallelogram (AA_2A_1A_3) with (O_2) at its center confirming that (O_3) exists uniquely from (O_1) and (O_2). 4. **Exploring the Assumption**: - Suppose the figure can have a finite number of centers of symmetry. - Choose a line such that the projections of these centers on this line do not all coincide at a single point. - Let (O_1) and (O_2) be centers of symmetry whose projections are the endpoints on this line, with projections of other centers between them. 5. **Deriving a Contradiction**: - Following our earlier property, the point (O_3), symmetric to (O_1) relative to (O_2), must also be a center of symmetry. - This results in a contradiction because we assumed only (O_1) and (O_2) (plus the possible finite count) shared such properties and projections, excluding (O_3).

When the person is rowing downstream (with the current), their effective speed will be the sum of their rowing speed and the speed of the current. So, downstream speed = rowing speed + current speed = 10 kmph + 2 kmph = 12 kmph. When the person is rowing upstream (against the current), their effective speed will be the difference between their rowing speed and the speed of the current. So, upstream speed = rowing speed - current speed = 10 kmph - 2 kmph = 8 kmph. The distance to the place is 24 km. Let's calculate the time taken to row downstream (T_downstream) and the time taken to row upstream (T_upstream). T_downstream = Distance / Downstream speed = 24 km / 12 kmph = 2 hours. T_upstream = Distance / Upstream speed = 24 km / 8 kmph = 3 hours. Now, we add the two times together to get the total time: Total time = T_downstream + T_upstream = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Substituting x = 1 into f'(x), we get: f'(1) = 3(1)^{2} - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2. Therefore, the value of f'(1) is boxed{2}. Part (Ⅱ): Find the equation of the tangent line to curve C at the point P(1, f(1)). We already found that f'(1) = 2. To find the equation of the tangent line, we also need the value of f(1): f(1) = 1^{3} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0. The slope of the tangent line at P(1, f(1)) is 2, and the point it passes through is (1, 0). Using the point-slope form of a line, y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), we get: y - 0 = 2(x - 1), which simplifies to: 2x - y - 2 = 0. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is boxed{2x - y - 2 = 0}. Part (Ⅲ): Find the extreme values of the function f(x). We have f'(x) = 3x^{2} - 1. Setting f'(x) = 0 to find critical points: 3x^{2} - 1 = 0 implies x^{2} = frac{1}{3} implies x = pmfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}. Analyzing the sign of f'(x) around the critical points: - For x < -frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is increasing. - For -frac{sqrt{3}}{3} < x < frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is decreasing. - For x > frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is increasing again. Thus, f(x) reaches a maximum at x = -frac{sqrt{3}}{3} and a minimum at x = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. Calculating these values: - Maximum: f(-frac{sqrt{3}}{3}) = (-frac{sqrt{3}}{3})^{3} - (-frac{sqrt{3}}{3}) = -frac{2sqrt{3}}{9}. - Minimum: f(frac{sqrt{3}}{3}) = (frac{sqrt{3}}{3})^{3} - (frac{sqrt{3}}{3}) = -frac{2sqrt{3}}{9}.

We'll provide a detailed verification using the first given solution. 1. **Express the problem in a different form:** We start by rewriting the given expression: [ 2^{3n+6} + 3^{4n+2} ] Observe that: [ 2^{3n+6} = 2^6 cdot 2^{3n} = 64 cdot 8^n ] and [ 3^{4n+2} = 3^2 cdot 3^{4n} = 9 cdot 81^n ] Therefore, we have: [ 2^{3n+6} + 3^{4n+2} = 64 cdot 8^n + 9 cdot 81^n ] 2. **Factor out common terms:** Notice that 64 and 9 are constants, and we can factor out 73 from them as below: [ 64 cdot 8^n + 9 cdot 81^n = (73 - 9) cdot 8^n + 9 cdot 81^n ] [ = 73 cdot 8^n - 9 cdot 8^n + 9 cdot 81^n ] 3. **Combine terms to show divisibility:** We can rearrange the terms as follows: [ = 73 cdot 8^n + 9 cdot (81^n - 8^n) ] 4. **Apply basic divisibility theorem:** Here, it’s evident that the first term (73 cdot 8^n) is divisible by 73. We need to show the second term (9 cdot (81^n - 8^n)) is also divisible by 73. By the theorem of divisibility: [ a^n - b^n text{ is divisible by } a - b ] for any positive integer (n). Let (a = 81) and (b = 8), therefore: [ 81 - 8 = 73 ] It follows that (81^n - 8^n) is divisible by 73 for any (n). Therefore, (9 cdot (81^n - 8^n)) is also divisible by 73. 5. **Combine conclusions:** Therefore, [ 73 cdot 8^n + 9 cdot (81^n - 8^n) ] is divisible by 73.

We know that the cost price (C) is 99% of the selling price (S), so we can write this as: C = 0.99S 2. The store offers a 10% discount on the selling price (S), so the discounted selling price (D) is: D = S - 0.10S D = 0.90S 3. The store pays a 5% tax on the discounted selling price (D), so the tax amount (T) is: T = 0.05D T = 0.05 * 0.90S T = 0.045S 4. The net selling price (NS) after the discount and tax is: NS = D - T NS = 0.90S - 0.045S NS = 0.855S 5. The effective profit (P) is the net selling price (NS) minus the cost price (C): P = NS - C P = 0.855S - 0.99S P = -0.135S Since P is negative, this means the store is actually making a loss, not a profit.

This means that BD = CD = 4, because the total length of BC is given as 8. Let's introduce point P as the foot of the perpendicular from A to side BC. Without loss of generality, we can assume that P lies on segment BD. Let x represent the length of segment BP, making PD = 4 - x. We also let h denote the length of AP, which is the height of the triangle from A to BC. Given this setup, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangles APB, APC, and APD.

For triangle APD, we have 25 = (4 - x)^2 + h^2, since the length of the median AD is given as 5.

We will explore the nature of ( S(n) ) to find a contradiction. 3. **Discuss Divisibility by 10:** Among any 39 consecutive numbers, certain numbers must be divisible by 10. Let ( a ) be the smallest one among them. This implies that among our sequence, we also have ( a, a + 1, a + 2, ldots, a + 29 ). 4. **Analyze Sums Modulo 11:** For the sequence ( a, a+1, ldots, a+9 ): - Since ( a ) is divisible by 10, it follows: [ S(a) equiv 0 pmod{10} ] - This tells us that: [ S(a+1) = S(a) + 1, quad S(a+2) = S(a) + 2, quad ldots, quad S(a+9) = S(a) + 9 ] 5. **Check Divisibility by 11:** Since ( S(a) equiv 0 pmod{10} ), this set of numbers has sums of digits from ( S(a) ) to ( S(a) + 9 ). We only don't encounter a sum divisible by 11 if: [ S(a) equiv 1 pmod{11} ] Then, examining ( a+10 ), because 11 doesn't divide ( S(a+10) ), we consider the next numbers: [ S(a+10) = S(a) + 1 ] For numbers ( a+10, a+11, ldots, a + 19 ), we similarly show that: [ S(a+10), S(a+11), ldots, S(a+19) ] which cover ( S(a) + 1, S(a) + 2, ldots, S(a) + 10 ).

Define the angles as follows: - angle AOB = alpha - angle BOC = beta - angle COD = gamma - angle DOA = delta The distances between the centers of the circles and odot O are: - OO_{1} = a - OO_{2} = b - OO_{3} = c - OO_{4} = d Therefore, a = R - r_{1}, b = R - r_{2}, c = R - r_{3}, d = R - r_{4}. 3. **Calculate the external tangents:** Using the cosine law for external tangents and properties of angles in triangle geometry: [ l_{12}^{2} = O_{1}O_{2}^{2} - (r_{1} - r_{2})^{2} ] Substituting O_{1}O_{2} = sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos alpha}: [ l_{12}^{2} = (a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos alpha) - (a-b)^2 ] Simplify the expression: [ l_{12}^{2} = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos alpha - a^2 - b^2 + 2ab ] [ l_{12}^{2} = 4ab cdot sin^{2} frac{alpha}{2} ] Therefore: [ l_{12} = 2 sqrt{ab} cdot sin frac{alpha}{2} ] By similar calculations for l_{23}, l_{34}, l_{41}, l_{13} and l_{24}, we obtain: [ begin{aligned} l_{23} &= 2 sqrt{bc} cdot sin frac{beta}{2}, l_{34} &= 2 sqrt{cd} cdot sin frac{gamma}{2}, l_{41} &= 2 sqrt{da} cdot sin frac{delta}{2}, l_{13} &= 2 sqrt{ac} cdot sin frac{alpha + beta}{2}, l_{24} &= 2 sqrt{bd} cdot sin frac{beta + gamma}{2}. end{aligned} ] 4. **Prove the collinearity condition for the quadrilateral:** To show the points A, B, C, D are concyclic such that: [ l_{12} cdot l_{34} + l_{23} cdot l_{41} = l_{13} cdot l_{24} ] Transform this into trigonometric identities: [ (2 sqrt{ab} sin frac{alpha}{2}) (2 sqrt{cd} sin frac{gamma}{2}) + (2 sqrt{bc} sin frac{beta}{2}) (2 sqrt{da} sin frac{delta}{2}) = (2 sqrt{ac} sin frac{alpha + beta}{2}) (2 sqrt{bd} sin frac{beta + gamma}{2}) ] Simplifying: [ 4 sqrt{abcd} (sin frac{alpha}{2} sin frac{gamma}{2} + sin frac{beta}{2} sin frac{delta}{2}) = 4 sqrt{abcd} sin frac{alpha + beta}{2} sin frac{beta + gamma}{2} ] Reduce to: [ sin frac{alpha}{2} cdot sin frac{gamma}{2} + sin frac{beta}{2} cdot sin frac{delta}{2} = sin frac{alpha + beta}{2} cdot sin frac{beta + gamma}{2} ] This satisfies the trigonometric identity for angles in cyclic quadrilaterals, hence proving the four points A, B, C, D are concyclic.

What is the minimum cost?","completion":"# Solution: (1) Finding the Price of Each Volleyball and Basketball Let's denote the price of each volleyball as x yuan and the price of each basketball as y yuan. According to the problem, we have two equations: 1. Since each basketball is 30 yuan more expensive than a volleyball, we have y = x + 30. 2. The total cost for buying 2 volleyballs and 3 basketballs is 340 yuan, leading to the equation 2x + 3y = 340. Substituting the first equation into the second gives us: [ 2x + 3(x + 30) = 340 2x + 3x + 90 = 340 5x = 250 x = 50 ] Substituting x = 50 into the first equation gives us y = 50 + 30 = 80. Therefore, the price of each volleyball is boxed{50} yuan, and the price of each basketball is boxed{80} yuan. (2) Finding the Functional Relationship and Minimizing the Cost ① Let the number of volleyballs be m and the total cost be y yuan. The functional relationship, considering the prices found in part (1), is: [ y = 50m + 80(60 - m) = 50m + 4800 - 80m = -30m + 4800 ] Given the constraints that the total cost should not exceed 3800 yuan and the number of volleyballs is less than 39, we have: [ left{begin{array}{l} -30m + 4800 leq 3800 m < 39 end{array}right. ] Solving the inequality for m gives: [ -30m leq -1000 m geq frac{1000}{30} = frac{100}{3} ] Therefore, considering m is an integer and m < 39, the possible values for m are boxed{34, 35, 36, 37, 38}. ② Since the slope k = -30 < 0, the cost y decreases as the number of volleyballs m increases. To minimize the cost, we should maximize m within the given constraints. The maximum value of m that satisfies all conditions is 38. Substituting m = 38 into the cost function gives: [ y = -30(38) + 4800 = 3660 ] Therefore, to minimize the cost, the school should purchase 38 volleyballs, and the minimum cost is boxed{3660} yuan."},{"prompt":"Factorize the expression: xy^{2}16x=____.","completion":"To factorize the expression xy^{2}-16x, we proceed as follows: 1.

She sold 5 shirts at 4 each, so she got 5 * 4 = 20 from the shirts. In total, she got 15 (pants) + 15 (shorts) + 20 (shirts) = 50 from selling her clothes. After buying the 2 shirts, she leaves with 30. This means the money she spent on the 2 shirts is 50 (total money from selling clothes) - 30 (money left) = 20.

Relative speed = 33.33 m/s + 22.22 m/s = 55.55 m/s The time taken to cross each other is 9 seconds. The distance covered when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths. Let the length of the second train be L meters. Total distance covered = Length of the first train + Length of the second train Total distance covered = 250 m + L We know that distance = speed * time, so: 250 m + L = 55.55 m/s * 9 s 250 m + L = 499.95 m Now, let's solve for L: L = 499.95 m - 250 m L = 249.95 m Therefore, the length of the other train is approximately boxed{249.95} meters."},{"prompt":"Given a function f such that f(f(n)) + f(n) = 2n + 3, and f(2013) = 2014, what is the value of f(0)?","completion":"Let's denote f(0) as x.

Let's assume that f(n) is a linear function, which means it can be represented as f(n) = an + b for some constants a and b. This is a reasonable assumption because we are given that f(f(n)) + f(n) = 2n + 3, which suggests a linear relationship. Given that f(2013) = 2014, we can write: a*2013 + b = 2014 And given that f(2014) = 2015, we can write: a*2014 + b = 2015 Now we have two equations with two unknowns: a*2013 + b = 2014 a*2014 + b = 2015 Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us: a*2014 + b - (a*2013 + b) = 2015 - 2014 a*2014 - a*2013 = 1 a = 1 Now that we know a = 1, we can substitute it back into either equation to find b.

How much does John save per year by splitting the apartment compared to living alone?","completion":"First, we need to find out how much the new apartment costs. Since it is 40% more expensive than John's old apartment, we calculate the increase by multiplying the old rent by 40% (0.40): 1200 * 0.40 = 480 Now we add that increase to the old rent to find the new rent: 1200 + 480 = 1680 The new apartment costs 1680 per month. Since John is splitting the cost with his two brothers, there are three people sharing the cost. So we divide the new rent by 3 to find out how much each person pays: 1680 / 3 = 560 John now pays 560 per month for the new apartment. To find out how much John saves per month by splitting the apartment, we subtract his share of the new rent from the cost of his old rent: 1200 - 560 = 640 John saves 640 per month.

This involves a fold where the lengths from ( C ) to ( H ) and from ( C ) to ( G ) are the same. 5. **Step 5: Find another midpoint for the next side** - Locate ( K ), which is the midpoint of ( BH ). 6. **Step 6: Measure and mark the distances** - Lay off the length ( CL ) equal to ( BK ). Reflectively fold to ensure that segment ( CL ) equals ( BK ). This step might involve a series of minor folds and adjustments to ensure correct distance proportionalities. 7. **Step 7: Identify a side of the pentagon** - The segment ( KL ) can now be considered one side of the regular pentagon. 8. **Step 8: Replicate this side on the remaining paper** - Now, from ( K ), mark off ( KM ) and ( LN ), making sure these are both equal to ( KL ). Note that points ( M ) and ( N ) must respectively lie on line segments ( BA ) and ( CD ). 9. **Step 9: Create folds to finalize the shape** - Fold along ( PQ ) to set new points ( MO ) and ( NO ), which should also equal ( KM ) and ( LN ) respectively. 10. **Conclusion: Formation of the pentagon** - The shape defined by ( KMOLN ) is the desired regular pentagon. As you fold and mark all these segments accurately, the combination of these measured folds constructs the regular pentagon from the square piece of paper. Therefore, the correct folds and steps will yield the regular pentagon ( KMOLN ).

Find the value of (m+n).","completion":"To solve the given problem, we will first find a general form for the summand and then apply it to compute the sum. Here are the steps in detail: 1. **Express the General Term**: We start with the general term of the series: [ frac{1}{n times (n+1) times (n+2)} ] We want to simplify this expression. Recall that we can decompose it using partial fractions or a known identity. We use the identity: [ frac{1}{n times (n+1) times (n+2)} = frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{n times (n+1)} - frac{1}{(n+1) times (n+2)} right) ] 2. **Verify the Identity**: To ensure that the identity is correct, we should verify it: [ frac{1}{n times (n+1) times (n+2)} = frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{n(n+1)} - frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)} right) ] Let's rewrite the right-hand side: [ frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{n(n+1)} - frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)} right) ] Taking a common denominator on the right-hand side: [ = frac{1}{2} left( frac{(n+2) - n}{n(n+1)(n+2)} right) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{2}{n(n+1)(n+2)} right) = frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} ] This confirms our decomposition is correct. 3. **Sum the Series**: Now we use the simplified form to sum the series: [ sum_{n=2}^{14} frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)} = sum_{n=2}^{14} frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{n(n+1)} - frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)} right) ] Using the property of series, we separate the terms: [ = frac{1}{2} left( sum_{n=2}^{14} frac{1}{n(n+1)} - sum_{n=2}^{14} frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)} right) ] 4. **Telescoping Series**: Notice that this is a telescoping series. Most terms cancel out: [ sum_{n=2}^{14} left( frac{1}{n(n+1)} - frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)} right) ] Writing out the terms explicitly: [ left( frac{1}{2 times 3} - frac{1}{3 times 4} right) + left( frac{1}{3 times 4} - frac{1}{4 times 5} right) + ldots + left( frac{1}{14 times 15} - frac{1}{15 times 16} right) ] Almost all terms cancel out, leaving: [ frac{1}{2 times 3} - frac{1}{15 times 16} ] 5. **Simplify the Remaining Terms**: Compute the remaining terms: [ = frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{2 times 3} - frac{1}{15 times 16} right) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{6} - frac{1}{240} right) ] Simplify the expression inside the parentheses: [ frac{1}{6} - frac{1}{240} = frac{40}{240} - frac{1}{240} = frac{39}{240} ] Then: [ = frac{1}{2} times frac{39}{240} = frac{39}{480} = frac{13}{160} ] 6. **Conclusion**: The sum of the given series is: [ frac{13}{160} ] Therefore, (m = 13) and (n = 160). Hence, the final answer is: [ m+n = 13 + 160 = 173 ] [ boxed{173} ]"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},I={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],W={key:0},N={key:1};function L(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",I,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
