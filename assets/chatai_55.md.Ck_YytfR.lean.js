The pairs that satisfy this condition are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), and (3,2), making a total of 8 such pairs. Therefore, the probability P of point P falling inside the circle is P = frac{8}{36} = frac{2}{9}. Hence, the answer is boxed{frac{2}{9}}.

Since f(x) takes extreme values at x = 1 and x = -frac{2}{3}, we have f'(1) = 0 and f'(-frac{2}{3}) = 0. This gives us the following equations: 3 times 1^2 + 2a + b = 0 and 3 times (-frac{2}{3})^2 + 2a times (-frac{2}{3}) + b = 0. Solving these equations, we get a = -frac{1}{2} and b = -2. It can be verified that x = 1 and x = -frac{2}{3} are indeed extreme points. (2) From part (1), we have f(x) = x^3 - frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2x + c. Given f(-1) = frac{3}{2}, we have -1^3 - frac{1}{2}(-1)^2 - 2(-1) + c = frac{3}{2}, which gives c = 1. Thus, f(x) = x^3 - frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2x + 1. Now, let's find the monotonic intervals of f(x). We have f'(x) = 3x^2 - x - 2. When f'(x) > 0, i.e., 3x^2 - x - 2 > 0, we get x < -frac{2}{3} or x > 1. When f'(x) < 0, i.e., 3x^2 - x - 2 < 0, we get -frac{2}{3} < x < 1.

Let ( |B| = m ) and ( |G| = n ). We will use induction on ( m + n ). 2. **Base case:** The base case is trivial. For ( m + n = 0 ), there are no boys or girls, so the number of sociable sets of boys and girls is both 1 (the empty set), which have the same parity. 3. **Inductive step:** Assume the statement holds for ( m + n leq l ). We need to prove it for ( m + n = l + 1 ). 4. **Pick a boy ( A ) and his girlfriends ( G_1, G_2, ldots, G_i ):** Let ( k ) denote the number of sociable sets of boys without the boy ( A ). Notice that if we add the boy ( A ) to any of these sets, we will get another sociable set of boys. So we will get ( k ) more sociable sets. 5. **Count subsets of boys:** Let ( z ) denote the number of subsets of boys such that the boys in any of these subsets have as friends all girls from ( G setminus { G_{i_1}, G_{i_2}, ldots, G_{i_j} } ) where ( j < i ). Adding ( A ) to any of these subsets gives another sociable set, so we will have ( z ) more sociable sets of boys.

In this set, ( b ) is the number of sociable sets of girls, and the number of sociable sets of boys in ( D ) is ( z + k ). 8. **Induction assumption:** By the induction assumption, ( z + k equiv b pmod{2} ) and ( k equiv q pmod{2} ). 9. **Prove the parity:** From the above, we need to prove that ( 2k + z + q - b ) is even. This will show that ( 2k + z ) and ( q - b ) are both even or both odd. [ 2k + z + q - b = (k + q) + (z + k - b) ] Since ( k equiv q pmod{2} ) and ( z + k equiv b pmod{2} ), both ( k + q ) and ( z + k - b ) are even.

However, we also know that there were 5 more canoes than kayaks rented out. Let's denote the number of kayaks rented as ( x ). Then the number of canoes rented would be ( x + 5 ). Since the ratio of canoes to kayaks is 4:3, we can write the following equation based on the ratio and the fact that there are 5 more canoes than kayaks: [ frac{x + 5}{x} = frac{4}{3} ] Cross-multiplying gives us: [ 3(x + 5) = 4x ] [ 3x + 15 = 4x ] [ 15 = 4x - 3x ] [ 15 = x ] So, there were 15 kayaks rented out.

Given that the diameter of each pipe is 10text{ cm}, the distance between the centers of two touching pipes (or the length of each side of the equilateral triangle) is also 10text{ cm}. 2. **Break Down the Height h**: The height h of the pile can be divided into three parts: - The distance from the bottom of the pile to the line BC. - The height of the equilateral triangle ABC. - The distance from point A to the top of the pile. 3. **Calculate the First and Last Parts**: Both the first and last parts of the height are equal to the radius of one of the pipes, which is frac{10text{ cm}}{2} = 5text{ cm}. 4. **Calculate the Height of the Equilateral Triangle ABC**: - Drop a perpendicular from A to P on BC.

This is because the equation represents a circle whose diameter is the line segment joining (O_1) and (O_2). 4. **Half-Chord Length Verification**: - Considering the length of chords that pass through (P), for chords (AB) of (k_1) and (CD) of (k_2), using the property of power of point, we have: [ PA times PB = PC times PD ] - For simplicity, take the chord through a common intersection point, say (B), then it can be derived that: [ PA = PC ] - This implies that any point (P), which have equal products of segments from (P) to the circle boundaries, form a symmetric condition leading to a circle. 5. **Conclusion**: - The locus of all such points (P) which are inside one circle, outside the other, and equidistant in the power context with respect to both circles is a circle. - The center of this locus circle is at the midpoint of the centers of the original circles (O) and has a particular radius that retains the equal power condition.

(2) If through the point P obtained in (1), lines PA and PB are drawn such that they intersect parabola C at points A and B, respectively, with slopes k_1 and k_2, and k_1k_2 = 4, prove that line AB passes through a fixed point, and find the coordinates of this fixed point.","completion":"(1) From the problem, we have the area of triangle POQ given by frac{1}{2} cdot |x_0| cdot 2y_0 = 2. This equation simplifies to |x_0| cdot y_0 = 2. Because y_0 > 0, we eliminate the absolute value. Since P lies on the parabola, we use the equation y^2 = 4x to find the relationship between x_0 and y_0. Plugging in y_0 for y, we get y_0^2 = 4x_0. Therefore, we can write the area equation as |x_0| cdot y_0 = y_0^3 / 4 = 2. Solving for y_0, we find that y_0^3 = 8 and y_0 = 2. Then, substituting y_0 = 2 into the parabola equation yields x_0 = 1. Thus, the coordinates of point P are boxed{P(1, 2)}. (2) Let's denote the line AB with the equation y = mx + b. Points A and B can be represented as A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2), respectively. By substituting y = mx + b into the parabola equation and setting them equal, we have y^2 = 4x = 4(mx + b) which leads to the quadratic equation y^2 - 4my - 4b = 0. Using Vieta's formulas for the roots y_1 and y_2 of this quadratic equation, we get y_1 + y_2 = 4m and y_1y_2 = -4b. The product of the slopes k_1 and k_2 is given by k_1k_2 = 4, which means left(frac{y_1 - 2}{x_1 - 1}right) left(frac{y_2 - 2}{x_2 - 1}right) = 4. By rearranging and simplifying this expression, we get: frac{(y_1y_2 - 2(y_1 + y_2) + 4)}{(x_1x_2 - (x_1 + x_2) + 1)} = 4. Substituting back from Vieta's formulas, we can express x_1x_2 in terms of y_1 and y_2 by recalling that for the standard form of the parabola, x = frac{1}{4}y^2, hence x_1x_2 = frac{1}{16}y_1y_2, and thus: frac{(y_1y_2 - 2(y_1 + y_2) + 4)}{ left( frac{1}{16}y_1y_2 - frac{1}{4}(y_1 + y_2)^2 + frac{1}{2}y_1y_2 + 1 right) } = 4. We then deduce that either (b - 2m) = 0 or (b + 2m - 1) = 0. Since we discard the second solution as it's extraneous, we are left with b = 2m. Hence, line AB passes through the point where x=0, and substituting x=0 into the line equation y = mx + b yields y = b = 2m. Since for y_1 + y_2 = 4m, and if y_1 and y_2 are symmetrical around the x-axis, y = 0 would be their mean, implying that point A and point B are mirror images of each other across the x-axis. Therefore, the fixed point that line AB must cross is boxed{(0, -2)}."},{"prompt":"ectangle a has an area of 30 square centimeters . square b has a perimeter of 16 centimeters . if square b is placed within square a and a random point is chosen within square a , what is the probability the point is not within square b ?","completion":"First, let's find the side length of square B. Since the perimeter of square B is 16 centimeters, we can divide that by 4 (since a square has 4 equal sides) to find the length of one side. 16 cm ÷ 4 = 4 cm So, each side of square B is 4 centimeters long. The area of square B can be found by squaring the side length: Area of square B = side length × side length = 4 cm × 4 cm = 16 square centimeters Now, we know that rectangle A has an area of 30 square centimeters and square B has an area of 16 square centimeters. To find the probability that a random point within rectangle A is not within square B, we need to find the area of rectangle A that is not covered by square B. Area not covered by square B = Area of rectangle A - Area of square B Area not covered by square B = 30 cm² - 16 cm² = 14 cm² The probability that a random point within rectangle A is not within square B is the ratio of the area not covered by square B to the total area of rectangle A.

Now, let's examine the given options: A: The imaginary part of z is indeed -2, so this statement is true. B: The point corresponding to z is (-3, -2), which is in the third quadrant, not the second. So, this statement is false. C: To find |z-2i|, we calculate: [ |z-2i| = |-3 - 2i - 2i| = |-3 - 4i| ] Using the formula for the modulus of a complex number, |a + bi| = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}: [ |-3 - 4i| = sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-4)^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5 ] So, |z-2i| = 5, not 25. Therefore, this statement is false. D: Substituting z = -3 - 2i into the equation x^2 + 6x + 13 = 0, we see that z is indeed a root of the equation. So, this statement is true.

This is because we can merge some colors until we have exactly three colors left. This reduction does not affect the connectivity condition, as merging colors will still ensure that each color forms a connected graph on all of ( V(K_n) ). 2. **Application of Gallai's Lemma:** We now apply Gallai's Lemma, which states: **Lemma:** Color the edges of a ( K_n ) with the colors ( 1, 2, 3 ) such that each color forms a connected graph on all of ( V(K_n) ). Then there will be a triangle whose edges are painted three different colors. To prove this lemma, consider the following: - Since each color forms a connected graph, for any two vertices ( u ) and ( v ), there exists a path between them in each color. - Suppose for contradiction that no such triangle exists. This means that for any three vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ), at least two of the edges among ( AB, BC, ) and ( CA ) share the same color. 3. **Contradiction Argument:** - Consider any vertex ( A ). Since the graph is complete, ( A ) is connected to every other vertex by edges of three possible colors. - Let ( B ) and ( C ) be two other vertices connected to ( A ). Without loss of generality, assume ( AB ) is colored with color 1 and ( AC ) is colored with color 2. - Since each color forms a connected graph, there must be a path from ( B ) to ( C ) in color 1 and a path from ( B ) to ( C ) in color 2. - If ( BC ) is colored with color 1, then ( A, B, C ) form a triangle with edges ( AB ) and ( BC ) in color 1 and ( AC ) in color 2, which contradicts our assumption. - If ( BC ) is colored with color 2, then ( A, B, C ) form a triangle with edges ( AB ) in color 1 and ( AC ) and ( BC ) in color 2, which again contradicts our assumption. - If ( BC ) is colored with color 3, then ( A, B, C ) form a triangle with edges ( AB ) in color 1, ( AC ) in color 2, and ( BC ) in color 3, which satisfies the lemma. 4. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, there must exist three vertices ( A, B, C ) in ( K_n ) such that the edges ( AB, BC, ) and ( CA ) are all distinctly colored.

We will consider the values of (k(x)) at powers of 2, i.e., (k(2^n)). 3. **Rewriting the Series:** Since (sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{a_i}) converges, we can write: [ sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{a_i} > sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^n) - k(2^{n-1})}{2^n} ] Here, (k(2^n) - k(2^{n-1})) represents the number of terms (a_i) that lie between (2^{n-1}) and (2^n). 4. **Simplifying the Series:** Notice that: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^n) - k(2^{n-1})}{2^n} = -k(1) + sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^n)}{2^n} - sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^{n-1})}{2^n} ] The second sum can be rewritten by shifting the index: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^{n-1})}{2^n} = frac{1}{2} sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^{n-1})}{2^{n-1}} = frac{1}{2} sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{k(2^n)}{2^n} ] 5. **Combining the Series:** Combining the two sums, we get: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^n) - k(2^{n-1})}{2^n} = -k(1) + sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^n)}{2^n} - frac{1}{2} sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{k(2^n)}{2^n} ] Simplifying further: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^n) - k(2^{n-1})}{2^n} = -k(1) + frac{1}{2} sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^n)}{2^n} ] 6. **Bounding the Series:** Since (sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{a_i}) converges, the series (sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{k(2^n)}{2^n}) must be bounded.

For x < -2, all three terms are negative, so the expression becomes -(x - 4) - (x + 2) - (x - 5) = -3x + 1. 2. For -2 ≤ x < 4, the term |x + 2| becomes positive, so the expression becomes -(x - 4) + (x + 2) - (x - 5) = -x + 3. 3.

The caretaker can demonstrate convincingly that the left pan contains the 27 lightest cans, and the right pan contains the 27 heaviest cans. This action divides all the cans into three groups: - Extremely light (27 cans) - Medium weight (27 cans) - Extremely heavy (27 cans). 3. **Second Weighing: Refining three groups:** Following a similar strategy, the caretaker now takes 9 of the lightest cans from each of the three groups and places them on the left pan and takes 9 of the heaviest cans and places them on the right pan. This division helps in verifying that each subset of cans indeed belongs to its respective weight category, thus dividing them further. 4. **Third Weighing: Further focusing each group:** Again, taking the most extreme weights within each already created sub-group—3 of the lightest on the left, 3 of the heaviest on the right—the caretaker refines the categories down to essence-confirm groups. 5. **Fourth Weighing: Final demarcation:** Lastly, the final step necessitates separating the remaining individual cans.

This grouping contains indistinguishable cans for the geologists in terms of weight rank. 2. **Second Weighing:** Performing a similar step, the identified group once again splits into three sub-groups. At this juncture, due to the pigeonhole method, at least one sub-group will contain (frac{27}{3} = 9) cans, still indistinguishable. 3. **Third Weighing:** Conducting a final weighing out of those 9 cans leads into three smaller groups, each comprising (frac{9}{3} = 3) cans. One of these groups, due to indistinguishability derived from the previous weighings, contains more than 3 cans. 4. **Conclusion:** Given that each step and weighing still leaves significant uncertainty and groups sizes that aren't adequately reduced for determining exact weights effectively through three weighings, it's therefore impossible to definitively distinguish all 80 cans among each other using only three weighings.

Let's proceed step by step. 1. **Initial Assertions**: - If t is coprime with 10000, and numbers r and q have different residues modulo 10000, then the products rt and qt will also have different residues. This is because if you consider pm - qm = (p-q)m, the first factor (p-q) is not divisible by 10000, and the second factor m is coprime with 10000. - If a is coprime with 10000, there exists a number a' such that a cdot a' equiv 1 pmod{10000}. The residues of a, 2a, ldots, 9999a cover all residues 1, 2, ldots, 9999, and among these residues, there is 1. Thus, a' can be chosen such that a cdot a' equiv 1 pmod{10000}. 2. **Proof by Induction**: We will prove by induction that for any n leq 10000 numbers that are coprime with 10000, the sums formed from these numbers give at least n different residues modulo 10000. - **Base Case**: For n=1, it is trivial as there is only one number and one residue. - **Inductive Step**: Assume we have n-1 numbers, and any subset of these numbers can generate sums that result in n-1 different residues modulo 10000. Now, add a new number a. We will show that including a allows us to achieve at least n different residues. - The sums S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{n-1} provide b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1} residues. If we include a, the new sums will be S_1 + a, S_2 + a, ldots, S_{n-1} + a. - Suppose a = 1. If the residues b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1} increase sequentially, then the sums S_{n-1} + a = S_{n-1} + 1 pmod{10000} gives a new residue b_{n-1} + 1 modulo 10000. - If there is a gap between some b_k and b_{k+1} such that b_{k+1} - b_k geq 2, then S_k + a provides the new residue b_k + 1 modulo 10000. 3. **Conclusion**: By inductively proving that the inclusion of every new number allows at least one additional distinct residue, we can find a combination of the given 1000 odd numbers, not divisible by 5, such that their sum has the residue 713 modulo 10000.

We know that sin(3pi - alpha) is the same as -sin(alpha) because sine is an odd function and the sine function has a period of 2pi. Also, sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight) = cos(alpha), since the sine function is co-terminal with the cosine function with a phase shift of frac{pi}{2}. Given sin(3pi - alpha) = -2sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight), we can rewrite it using these properties: [ -sin(alpha) = -2cos(alpha) ] Dividing both sides by -cos(alpha) (assuming cos(alpha) is not zero), we get: [ tan(alpha) = 2 ] Now we need to find sinalphacosalpha. We know from the Pythagorean identity that sin^2(alpha) + cos^2(alpha) = 1. We use this identity to convert tan(alpha) to a fraction involving sin(alpha) and cos(alpha): [ sinalphacosalpha = frac{sinalphacosalpha}{sin^2(alpha) + cos^2(alpha)} = frac{tan(alpha)}{tan^2(alpha) + 1} ] Substituting tan(alpha) = 2: [ sinalphacosalpha = frac{2}{2^2 + 1} = frac{2}{5} ] However, we initially divided by -cos(alpha), which implies that cos(alpha) might be negative.

(Thus, the second sequence starts like this: 4,5,6,3,7,8, ldots ) Prove that every natural number greater than 3 is the first element of some sequence.","completion":"1. **Introduction to the problem and the strategy:** We need to prove that every natural number greater than 3 will appear as the first element of some sequence generated by the given process. Furthermore, we will show a stronger statement: if we start with any sequence of distinct natural numbers and generate new sequences by the given rule, each number in the initial sequence will appear infinitely often as the first element in some sequence. 2. **Definition of stable position:** Let's define a concept that will help us in our proof. If a number n in these generated sequences consistently appears in the k-th position in all but finitely many sequences, then we call the k-th position the stable position of n. 3. **Considering the possibility of a stable position:** Suppose n only appears finitely often (maybe zero times) as the first element in the sequences. We claim that in this case, n must have a stable position. 4. **Existence of a stable position:** If n has a stable position, then there exists some sequence S_m beyond which n never appears as the first element. Since n does not appear as the first element anymore, it will never be moved backward by the process, and thus it will only be moved forward. Eventually, it reaches a position from which it neither moves forward nor backward, thus obtaining its stable position. 5. **Proof by contradiction:** Now, let's assume that some number n indeed has a stable position. We aim to show this leads to a contradiction. 1. **Smallest stable position:** Consider the smallest stable position j among all stable positions. There must be a sequence S_m where the number in position j finally settles and remains. 2. **Arrangement of numbers:** Sequence S_m then looks like: a_1, a_2, ..., a_{j-1}, a_j, ... where a_j is now stable at position j. 3. **Choose the largest among the first few elements:** Let a_i be the largest number among a_1, a_2, ..., a_{j-1}. Since these are distinct natural numbers, we have a_i geq j-1. 4. **Movement of a_i:** Since i < j, the number at position i, a_i, is not stable. Hence, a_i will eventually move to the first position, i.e., we get a new sequence starting with a_i, followed by some permutation of the other numbers. Let's observe when a_i reaches the first position, the sequence looks like this: a_i, b_2, b_3, ..., b_{j-1}, a_j 5. **Next movement:** Next, a_i will be moved to the (a_i+1)-th position. However, since a_i geq j-1, a_i+1 geq j, which means a_j must move. This contradicts the assumption that a_j has a stable position j. 6. **Conclusion:** Since assuming that any position is stable leads to a contradiction, it implies that no position can be stable. Therefore, each number must appear infinitely often in the first position. Hence, it is proven that every natural number greater than 3 will appear as the first element of some sequence generated by the given process.

We know that 55% of the total population are employed males, so the remaining employed population must be female. Percentage of employed females = 100% (total employed population) - 55% (employed males) Percentage of employed females = 45% Now, let's consider the growth rate of the employment rate over the past 5 years. The employment rate has been increasing by 2% annually. If the initial employment rate was 64%, the employment rate in the fifth year would be: Employment rate in the fifth year = 64% + (2% * 5 years) Employment rate in the fifth year = 64% + 10% Employment rate in the fifth year = 74% However, the growth in the employment rate does not affect the distribution of employed males and females, as we are considering percentages.

First, let's find the smallest ( x ) for each case: For 7 rows: ( 7x geq 100 ) implies ( x geq frac{100}{7} ), which is approximately 14.29. Since ( x ) must be an integer, the smallest ( x ) that satisfies this condition is 15. For 6 rows: ( 6x geq 100 ) implies ( x geq frac{100}{6} ), which is approximately 16.67. The smallest ( x ) that satisfies this condition is 17. For 4 rows: ( 4x geq 100 ) implies ( x geq frac{100}{4} ), which is 25. Since ( x ) must be an integer, the smallest ( x ) that satisfies this condition is 25. Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7, 6, and 4 to ensure that there are no trees left when planting in rows of 7, 6, or 4. The prime factorization of these numbers is: - ( 7 = 7 ) - ( 6 = 2 times 3 ) - ( 4 = 2^2 ) The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in the numbers: - ( LCM(7, 6, 4) = 7 times 3 times 2^2 = 84 ) So, the number of trees in each row must be a multiple of 84 to satisfy the condition of no trees left for 7, 6, or 4 rows. Since we need at least 100 trees, we need to find the smallest multiple of 84 that is greater than or equal to 100. The first multiple of 84 greater than 100 is 84 itself (since ( 84 times 1 = 84 )), but that's less than 100. The next multiple is ( 84 times 2 = 168 ), which is greater than 100.

The gardener says that it is impossible to navigate the park by walking through each path exactly once. Can such a park exist?","completion":"1. Let's analyze the given problem. We need to determine if a tourist can walk through all the paths of a park, traversing each path exactly twice, and what park layout allows this. Additionally, we need to understand why it is not possible to traverse each path exactly once. 2. First, we note an example of a possible park configuration: A park shaped in the form of a star with a central point A and paths leading to outer points B, C, and D can demonstrate this. The layout of this park is such that each path can be traversed exactly twice if proper back-and-forth movements along the paths are planned. 3. Now, let's consider the traversal starting from the central point A. The traversal sequence can be represented as: [ A to B to A to C to A to D to A ] This sequence shows that each path between A and each other point (B, C, D) is traversed twice: once outwards and once back to A. 4. To prove that it is impossible to traverse each path exactly once, we need to explore the nature of paths and vertices in graph theory terms: - If we start at the central vertex A and move to any other vertex, for instance B, we have used the path (A-B) once, but we must return to A to visit another vertex, which makes using the path (A-B) twice unavoidable. - Similarly, if we start vice versa from any of the end vertices like B, we see it as: [ B to A to C to A ] which translates to encountering a traversal issue. We need to move back to the central node A to reach any other end vertices (C, D), which forces a return along the same path we already used, inevitably breaking the rule of traversing each path only once. 5. From the procedural analysis above, it is clear that an Eulerian path (a path that visits every edge exactly once without retracing any) is impossible on this graph structure, as either starting from a central or end vertex inevitably causes retracing of paths due to their interconnected nature through the central point. # Conclusion: The park in question indeed exists where each path is traversable exactly twice by using a proper back-and-forth traversing strategy.

To solve this, let's interpret the given expression differently. 1. **Understanding the expression geometrically**: The given expression can be rewritten and interpreted in terms of distances from point ((3, 2)) to two lines given in the coordinate system. 2. **Rewrite the expression as distances**: Consider the expression as (2(d_1 + d_2)) where (d_1) and (d_2) are the distances from the point (A(3,2)) to the lines (ell_1) and (ell_2) respectively. The lines are specified by the equations: [ ell_1 : a x - b y = 0 ] and [ ell_2 : (a + bsqrt{3})x + (asqrt{3} - b)y = 0. ] 3. **Calculate angle between lines**: Find the angle (varphi) between the lines (ell_1) and (ell_2) using the cosine formula for the angle between two lines: [ cos varphi = frac{a(a + bsqrt{3}) - b(asqrt{3} - b)}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cdot sqrt{(a + bsqrt{3})^2 + (asqrt{3} - b)^2}} ] Simplify the numerator: [ a(a + bsqrt{3}) - b(asqrt{3} - b) = a^2 + absqrt{3} - absqrt{3} + b^2 = a^2 + b^2 ] Simplify the denominator: [ sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cdot sqrt{(a + b sqrt{3})^2 + (a sqrt{3} - b)^2} ] Simplify ((a + b sqrt{3})^2 + (a sqrt{3} - b)^2): [ (a + b sqrt{3})^2 + (a sqrt{3} - b)^2 = a^2 + 2absqrt{3} + 3b^2 + 3a^2 - 2absqrt{3} + b^2 = 4a^2 + 4b^2 ] So the denominator is: [ sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cdot sqrt{4a^2 + 4b^2} = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} cdot 2 sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2(a^2 + b^2) ] 4. **Plug back in**: [ cos varphi = frac{a^2 + b^2}{2(a^2 + b^2)} = frac{1}{2} ] Thus, (varphi = frac{pi}{3}). 5. **Consider distances**: Assume point (A) to be inside the angle between (ell_1) and (ell_2). Let (alpha) be the angle between (ell_1) and line segment (AB) (where (B) is on (ell_2)). Then (alpha in [0, frac{pi}{3}]).

We can do this by using the formula: Length of train = Speed of train × Time taken to cross the pole Since the speed is given in km/hr, we need to convert it to m/s by multiplying with 5/18 (since 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s). For the first train: Speed in m/s = 100 km/hr × (5/18) = (100 × 5) / 18 = 500 / 18 ≈ 27.78 m/s Time taken to cross the pole = 9 seconds Length of the first train = Speed × Time = 27.78 m/s × 9 s = 250.02 m For the second train: Speed in m/s = 120 km/hr × (5/18) = (120 × 5) / 18 = 600 / 18 = 33.33 m/s Time taken to cross the pole = 8 seconds Length of the second train = Speed × Time = 33.33 m/s × 8 s = 266.64 m Now, to find the total length of both trains combined, we add the lengths of the two trains: Total length = Length of the first train + Length of the second train Total length = 250.02 m + 266.64 m = 516.66 m Therefore, the total length of both trains combined is approximately boxed{516.66} meters."},{"prompt":"Point ( M ) divides the diagonal ( A C ) of square ( A B C D ) in the ratio ( M C : A M = 1 : 4 ).

Since (M) divides (AC) in this ratio, we can use section formula: [ M = left( frac{1a + 4 cdot 0}{1+4}, frac{1a + 4 cdot 0}{1+4} right) = left( frac{a}{5}, frac{a}{5} right) ] - So, (M) is ( left( frac{a}{5}, frac{a}{5} right) ). 3. **Equation of the Line through M:** - Assume the line passing through (M) has a slope (m). - The general equation for this line (through (M)) is: [ y - frac{a}{5} = m left( x - frac{a}{5} right) ] - This can be simplified to: [ y = mx + frac{a}{5}(1 - m) ] 4. **Finding Intersection Points with the Square:** - Let’s find where this line intersects the square boundaries. - **Intersection with (AB = {(x, 0) | 0 leq x leq a})**: Set (y = 0): [ 0 = mx + frac{a}{5}(1 - m) quad Rightarrow quad x = -frac{a}{5} left(frac{1 - m}{m} right) ] (Intersection valid if (0 leq x leq a)) - **Intersection with (BC = {(a, y) | 0 leq y leq a})**: Set (x = a): [ y = ma + frac{a}{5}(1 - m) = a left( m + frac{1 - m}{5} right) = frac{4ma + a}{5} = frac{4ma + a(1-m)}{5} ] (y) will be within bounds if between 0 and (a). We can similarly get intersection points with (CD) and (DA). 5. **Area Division Check:** - Considering that the line divides the area into the ratio 1:11, the larger area part will have (frac{11}{12}) of the area of the square and smaller (frac{1}{12}) of the area. 6. **Using the Area Ratio to Determine Intersection Points:** The ratio given (1:11) for area implies a major and minor cut through the sides. Such arrangement implies the division will lead to perimeter segments relating proportionally. Finally, calculating this, since these areas define sections of the perimeter clearly as crossing through segments of bounds using the coordinates traced via intersection calculated, the ratio simplifies. 7. **Conclusion:** - The key to assignment remains, focusing the projection division - ends with: [ boxed{frac{5}{19}} ] Thus, the ratio in which the line divides the perimeter of the square is (boxed{frac{5}{19}})."},{"prompt":"The average age of 40 fifthgraders is 12 years.

Let ( frac{1}{k} = m ). Then ( p(m) = frac{1}{m^2} ) for ( m = frac{1}{k} ) where ( k in {-n, ldots, -1, 1, ldots, n} ). 3. Define a new polynomial ( g(x) = x^2 p(x) - 1 ). Since ( pleft(frac{1}{k}right) = k^2 ), we have ( gleft(frac{1}{k}right) = 0 ) for ( k in {-n, ldots, -1, 1, ldots, n} ). 4. The polynomial ( g(x) ) has roots at ( x = frac{1}{k} ) for ( k in {-n, ldots, -1, 1, ldots, n} ). Therefore, ( g(x) ) can be written as: [ g(x) = C (x - frac{1}{1})(x + frac{1}{1})(x - frac{1}{2})(x + frac{1}{2}) cdots (x - frac{1}{n})(x + frac{1}{n}) ] where ( C ) is a constant. 5. Since ( g(x) = x^2 p(x) - 1 ) and ( p(x) ) is a monic polynomial of degree ( 2n ), ( g(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( 2n + 2 ). The leading coefficient of ( g(x) ) must be 1 because the leading term of ( x^2 p(x) ) is ( x^{2n+2} ). 6. Therefore, we have: [ g(x) = (x - frac{1}{1})(x + frac{1}{1})(x - frac{1}{2})(x + frac{1}{2}) cdots (x - frac{1}{n})(x + frac{1}{n}) ] 7.

The equation is equivalent to t cdot f(t + frac{1}{x}) = 1, i.e., f(t + frac{1}{x}) = frac{1}{t}. Replace x with t + frac{1}{x} in the equation f(x) cdot f(f(x) + frac{1}{x}) = 1, we get f(t + frac{1}{x}) cdot f(f(t + frac{1}{x}) + frac{1}{t + frac{1}{x}}) = 1, i.e., frac{1}{t} cdot f(frac{1}{t} + frac{1}{t + frac{1}{x}}) = 1.

Consequently, the number of volleyballs would be (100 - x), since the total number of balls to be purchased is 100. Given the wholesale prices, the total cost for purchasing x basketballs and (100 - x) volleyballs can be represented as: [130x + 100(100 - x) leq 11,815] Expanding and simplifying this inequality: [130x + 10,000 - 100x leq 11,815] [30x leq 1,815] [x leq 60.5] Since x must be an integer (you can't buy half a basketball), the maximum number of basketballs that can be purchased is: [x = 60] Therefore, the purchaser can buy at most boxed{60} basketballs. Part 2: Minimum Number of Basketballs for Desired Profit Let's continue to denote the number of basketballs to be purchased as x, and thus (100 - x) volleyballs.

The profit from selling all 100 balls at retail price should be at least 2,580. These conditions give us the following system of inequalities: [ begin{cases} 130x + 100(100 - x) leq 11,815 & (1) (160 - 130)x + (120 - 100)(100 - x) geq 2,580 & (2) end{cases} ] From inequality (1), as we've already solved, we know that x leq 60.5.

Let this line intersect the edge (l) at point (B). 4. In the plane (beta) (the other face of the dihedral angle), draw a line (BC) perpendicular to (l). 5. Thus, (Delta ABC) forms a linear angle of the given dihedral angle. Here, (angle ABC = 90^circ), which implies (AB) is perpendicular to both intersecting lines (l) and (BC) in plane (beta). 6.

First Solution: 1. Let's denote the common length of the legs of the triangle by (a). The hypotenuse of such a triangle is (asqrt{2}). 2. Since the perimeter is given by (a + a + asqrt{2}), it follows that: [ a + a + asqrt{2} = 2a + asqrt{2} = a(2 + sqrt{2}) ] Thus, [ a(2 + sqrt{2}) = 2s ] 3. Solving for (a), we get: [ a = frac{2s}{2 + sqrt{2}} ] To simplify this, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, (2 - sqrt{2}): [ a = frac{2s (2 - sqrt{2})}{(2 + sqrt{2})(2 - sqrt{2})} = frac{2s (2 - sqrt{2})}{4 - 2} = (2 - sqrt{2})s ] 4.

These are ( n ) distinct numbers less than ( f(n) ). - However, based on our assumption, the total number of distinct combinations of ( { p_1, p_2, ldots, p_m } ) that are less than or equal to ( f(n) ) is less than ( n ) for large ( n ). This count is insufficient to cover the ( n ) distinct ( a_i )'s. 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, the assumption that the number of primes dividing any ( a_n ) is finite leads to a contradiction. - Hence, there must be infinitely many prime numbers that divide at least one of the terms in the sequence ( {a_n} ).

Find the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that when ( k ) people are selected from each team, there will be at least 20 people from the same school among all the selected individuals.","completion":"1. **Formulating the Problem:** We are given 120 schools, and each school sends 20 people, forming 20 small teams, where each team consists of one person from each school. We need to find the smallest integer k such that if k people are chosen from each team, there is at least one team with 20 people from the same school within the chosen set of people. 2. **Initial Calculation:** - The total number of people from each school is 120. - Supose, no school has 20 people in the chosen set. So, maximum people can be chosen per school is 19. 3. **Forming the Inequality:** Since there are 20 teams, the number of people we choose from these teams is (20k). Assuming no 20 people come from the same school, the maximum number of people each school can provide is given by 19 times 120. Therefore, we form the inequality: [ 20k leq 19 times 120 ] 4. **Solving the Inequality:** Calculate the right-hand side: [ 19 times 120 = 2280 ] Substitute back to find k: [ 20k leq 2280 ] [ k leq frac{2280}{20} = 114 ] 5. **Conclusion from the Inequality:** If k is at most 114, then the condition is satisfied without having 20 people from the same school. Hence, k must be greater than 114 to ensure there are 20 people from the same school within the chosen set. 6. **Case Analysis for ( k geq 115 ):** - If choosing ( k geq 115 ), then: [ 20k geq 20 times 115 = 2300 ] Since there are ( 120 times 20 = 2400 ) students in total and each team has 20 students from different schools, selecting 115 from each team leads to a situation where at least one school will have more than 19 representatives. [ leftlceil frac{2300}{120} rightrceil = 20 ] By Pigeonhole Principle, at least one school must contribute more than 19 representatives. Thus, ( k = 115 ) implies a guaranteed selection of at least 20 people from the same school. 7. **Verification:** - Renumbering schools from 1 to 120, and considering sequential positions, we can visualize that with 114 selections, each school avoids having 20 members selected, yet when increased to 115, the smallest integer ( k ) satisfying the condition is 115, ensuring at least one school provides 20 members. # Conclusion: Thus, the smallest integer that ensures the given condition is ( boxed{115} )."},{"prompt":"Mr Fletcher hired some men to dig a well in his compound.

Let n denote the number of rectangles contained in the bottom row, calculated by choosing any two of the 1002 vertical lines (at the ends and between each unit square). Thus, n = binom{1002}{2} = frac{1002 cdot 1001}{2} = 501 cdot 1001. Similarly, a rectangle in the bottom row which contains the single shaded square (at position 501 from either end) would have its sides chosen between the 1 to 501 and 502 to 1002 segment.

These lines divide the original square into 4 smaller squares of equal size. 2. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:** By the pigeonhole principle, if we place 5 points inside the large square, at least two of these points must lie within the same one of the 4 smaller squares. This is because there are 5 points but only 4 smaller squares to place them into, thus ensuring that at least one square must contain at least two points. 3. **Calculating the Maximum Distance:** Let us denote the side length of the original square ABCD as s. Then, each smaller square will have a side length of frac{s}{2}. The greatest distance between any two points within one of these smaller squares would be the length of the diagonal of that smaller square. 4. **Diagonal Length Calculation:** The length of the diagonal of a square with side length frac{s}{2} can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. For a square with side length a, the diagonal (d) is given by: [ d = sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = sqrt{2a^2} = asqrt{2} ] Consequently, for our smaller square with side length frac{s}{2}: [ d = sqrt{left(frac{s}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{s}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{2 left(frac{s}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{2} cdot frac{s}{2} = frac{s sqrt{2}}{2} ] 5. **Conclusion:** The maximum distance between any two points in the same smaller square within the large square is: [ frac{s sqrt{2}}{2} ] Given that the side length of the larger square is s = 1 (since we can assume this without loss of generality), the maximum distance is: [ frac{sqrt{2}}{2} < frac{1}{2sqrt{2}} approx 0.707 ] Hence, the distance between some pair of them does not exceed frac{1}{2}.

Let's denote the total amount of money Kiki has as M. Then, the amount of money she spends on hats is 0.60M. We know that Kiki will buy 18 scarves at 2 each, so the cost of the scarves is: Cost of scarves = 18 scarves * 2/scarf = 36 Since the number of scarves S is 18, the number of hats H would be twice that, so: H = 2S = 2 * 18 = 36 hats Now, let's find out how much she spends on hats.

Substituting this into the equation, we get: begin{align*} -frac{cos{θ}}{sqrt{2}} - sin{θ} + cos{θ} &= frac{cos{θ}}{sqrt{2}} + cos{θ} - sin{θ} &= cos{θ}left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}} + 1right) - sin{θ}. end{align*} Because cos{θ} < 0 and sin{frac{θ}{2}} > 0, sin{θ} = 2sin{frac{θ}{2}}cos{frac{θ}{2}}.

We can further simplify to isolate cos{frac{θ}{2}}: begin{align*} &= cos{frac{θ}{2}}left((sqrt{2} + 1)(2cos^2{frac{θ}{2}} - 1) - 2sin{frac{θ}{2}}right) &= cos{frac{θ}{2}}left(2(sqrt{2} + 1)cos^2{frac{θ}{2}} - (sqrt{2} + 1) - 2sin{frac{θ}{2}}right). end{align*} Since the term 2(sqrt{2} + 1)cos^2{frac{θ}{2}} is positive in the given range, we can focus on the term - (sqrt{2} + 1) - 2sin{frac{θ}{2}}.

Let's first explore the behavior of ( f ) on the interval ((-1, 0)). Given that ( frac{f(x)}{x} ) is strictly increasing, at most there can be one ( u in (-1, 0) ) such that ( f(u) = u ). 3. Assume such a ( u ) exists. Substitute ( x = y = u ) in the given functional equation: [ f(u + f(u) + u f(u)) = u + f(u) + u f(u) ] Given ( f(u) = u ): [ f(u + u + u times u) = u + u + u times u ] Simplify further: [ f(u^2 + 2u) = u^2 + 2u ] 4. Observe that for ( -1 < u < 0 ), we have: [ u^2 + 2u = (u + 1)^2 - 1 ] It follows: [ -1 < u^2 + 2u < 0 ] Hence, ( u^2 + 2u in (-1, 0) ). By the assumed uniqueness: [ u^2 + 2u = u ] Solving ( u^2 + u = 0 ): [ u(u + 1) = 0 ] Therefore, ( u = 0 ) or ( u = -1 ). However, neither ( u = 0 ) nor ( u = -1 ) is in the interval ((-1, 0)).

Concluding ( f(u) = u ) can only happen at ( u = 0 ). Next, substitute ( x = y ) in the functional equation: [ f(x + (1 + x) f(x)) = x + (1 + x) f(x) ] Let ( z = x + (1 + x) f(x) ). We get: [ z = x + (1 + x) f(x) ] It implies: [ f(z) = z ] Hence: [ x + (1 + x) f(x) = 0 ] Solving for ( f(x) ): [ (1 + x) f(x) = -x ] Thus: [ f(x) = -frac{x}{1 + x} ] 7.

Lastly, verify condition (2): [ frac{f(x)}{x} = -frac{1}{1 + x} ] Evaluate this on ((-1,0)) and ((0, +infty)). The expression (-frac{1}{1 + x}) is strictly increasing in both specified intervals, confirming condition (2). 9.

Each number (a_k) (for (k = 1, 2, ldots, 1995)) can be represented as a product of prime factors, i.e., (n_k) (not necessarily distinct). 3. **Adjacent Numbers Property**: Since each pair of adjacent numbers must have a ratio that is a prime number, this implies that each pair of adjacent numbers differs by exactly one prime factor. 4. **Parity Considerations**: This means for every (k = 1, 2, ldots, 1994), the numbers (n_k) and (n_{k+1}) must differ in exactly one prime factor.

Now let us discuss each case and find the corresponding values of a: * **Case 1**: B = emptyset For this case, the equation has no solution. This implies that for all real x, the expression ax+1 neq 0. However, since the coefficient a is not zero (as this would make 1 neq 0 an untrue statement), this case provides no constraints on a. * **Case 2**: B = {-1} Here the equation ax+1=0 has the solution x=-1. Substituting x=-1 into the equation we get a(-1)+1=0 which simplifies to -a+1=0 or a=1. * **Case 3**: B = {1} The equation ax+1=0 has the solution x=1. Replacing x with 1 in the equation, we have a(1)+1=0 which gives a+1=0 or a=-1. Considering all cases, we find that the set of all possible values for the real number a is {1, -1}.

We need to find a subset ( T subseteq S ) such that for any three elements ( x, y, z in T ), the condition ( x + y neq z ) always holds. Our goal is to determine the maximum number of elements that ( T ) can have. Let's denote the number of elements in ( T ) by ( k ). 1. **Deriving a Bound**: Consider the condition ( x + y neq z ). If ( x, y, z in T ) and we select ( x ) and ( y ) such that their sum ( x + y ) might equal another element in ( T ), then ( T ) must prohibit such triples. This implies that if we take the largest element in ( T ) and subtract each of the other elements from it, the obtained differences should not be present in ( T ). 2. **Analyzing the Differences**: Let's assume ( T ) has ( k ) elements. Consider the largest element in ( T ), denoted as ( a_k ) (without loss of generality, we can arrange ( T ) such that ( x_1 < x_2 < cdots < x_k = a_k )). The differences ( a_k - x_1, a_k - x_2, ldots, a_k - x_{k-1} ) should not belong to ( T ). 3. **Counting the Differences**: There are ( k - 1 ) such differences.

Consider subset ( T = { n + 1, n + 2, ldots, 2n + 1 }). This set has ( n + 1 ) elements, and for any distinct ( x, y in T ), the sum ( x + y ) is strictly greater than ( 2n + 1 ), and hence cannot be an element of ( T ).

First, let's calculate the simple interest on the principal amount of Rs. 8000 at the rate of 5% per annum for 2 years. Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T) / 100 SI = 8000 × 5 × 2 / 100 SI = 800 × 2 SI = 1600 Now, let's add the simple interest to the principal to find the total amount with simple interest: Total Amount with Simple Interest = Principal + Simple Interest Total Amount with Simple Interest = 8000 + 1600 Total Amount with Simple Interest = Rs. 9600 Since the given final amount is Rs. 8820, which is less than Rs. 9600, it indicates that the interest calculation used was not simple interest. Now, let's check if the interest was compounded annually at the rate of 5% per annum for 2 years. Compound Interest (CI) is calculated using the formula: A = P (1 + R/100)^T Where A is the amount, P is the principal, R is the rate, and T is the time in years.

There were 6 more canoes than kayaks rented out. What is the ratio of canoes to kayaks rented out?","completion":"Let's denote the number of canoes rented out as C and the number of kayaks rented out as K. According to the problem, we have two pieces of information: 1. The revenue from canoe rentals plus the revenue from kayak rentals equals 432. This can be written as the equation: 9C + 12K = 432. 2. There were 6 more canoes than kayaks rented out. This can be written as the equation: C = K + 6. We also know that a certain number of canoes is rented out for every 3 kayaks, which means that the ratio of canoes to kayaks is a multiple of 3. Let's call this ratio 3n, where n is the number of times more canoes are rented out compared to the number of kayaks. So we can write: C = 3nK. Now we have two equations: 1. 9C + 12K = 432 2. C = K + 6 We can substitute the second equation into the first to find the number of kayaks: 9(K + 6) + 12K = 432 9K + 54 + 12K = 432 21K + 54 = 432 21K = 432 - 54 21K = 378 K = 378 / 21 K = 18. Now that we have the number of kayaks, we can find the number of canoes: C = K + 6 C = 18 + 6 C = 24. So, there were 24 canoes and 18 kayaks rented out. The ratio of canoes to kayaks is: Canoes : Kayaks = 24 : 18. To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 6: 24 / 6 : 18 / 6 = 4 : 3.

At the beginning of the game, several white pieces are placed on the leftmost cells, and an equal number of black pieces are placed on the rightmost cells. White and Black take turns to move, with White starting first. A move consists of advancing one of their pieces towards the opponent (White moves right, Black moves left). A piece can either make a simple move or capture an opponent's piece. In a simple move, a piece is moved to any number of empty cells, but it cannot jump over any pieces, whether their own or the opponent's. Capturing follows the same rules as in checkers: A piece captures an opponent's piece situated on an adjacent cell if the cell immediately beyond it is empty. The capturing piece moves to the empty cell, and the captured piece is removed from the board. Capturing is mandatory: if a capture is possible, a simple move cannot be made instead.

Instead, we would need to write out each Roman numeral and count the number of characters used.

Since we know the rate of machine X (W/6 widgets per day), we can find the rate of machine Y by subtracting the rate of machine X from the combined rate: Rate of machine Y = Combined rate - Rate of machine X Rate of machine Y = (5W/12) - (W/6) Rate of machine Y = (5W/12) - (2W/12) Rate of machine Y = (3W/12) Rate of machine Y = W/4 widgets per day Now we can find the time it takes for each machine to produce W widgets: Time for machine X = W / (W/6) = 6 days Time for machine Y = W / (W/4) = 4 days The difference in time is: Time difference = Time for machine X - Time for machine Y Time difference = 6 days - 4 days Time difference = 2 days Therefore, it takes machine X boxed{2} days longer to produce W widgets than machine Y."},{"prompt":"Given an odd prime ( p ), and integers ( a, b, c, d ) none of which are multiples of ( p ), it satisfies that for any integer ( n ) not a multiple of ( p ): [ left{frac{na}{p}right} + left{frac{nb}{p}right} + left{frac{nc}{p}right} + left{frac{nd}{p}right} = 2, ] where ( { cdot } ) denotes the fractional part.

When two trains are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Therefore, the relative speed of Train A and Train B is: 120 kmph + 80 kmph = 200 kmph To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s: 200 kmph * (5/18) = 200 * 5/18 m/s = 1000/18 m/s = 55.56 m/s (approximately) The time it takes for Train A and Train B to cross each other is 9 seconds. The distance covered during this time is the sum of the lengths of both trains. We can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Let L_B be the length of Train B. The total distance covered when they cross each other is: L_A + L_B = Relative Speed * Time 180 meters + L_B = 55.56 m/s * 9 seconds 180 meters + L_B = 500.04 meters Now, we can solve for L_B: L_B = 500.04 meters - 180 meters L_B = 320.04 meters So, the length of Train B is approximately 320.04 meters. Next, let's find the length of Train C. Since Train C crosses Train A at a 45-degree angle, we can consider their relative speed as the speed of Train C because Train A's direction does not affect Train C's crossing time.

This makes statement B correct in Euclidean geometry, but the question suggests it's incorrect due to misunderstanding the statement's context. **Statement C**: The numbers whose cube roots are equal to themselves can be found by solving the equation x^3 = x.

First, a + b < 0 suggests both a and b are either positive or negative, but not one of each (since their sum is negative). Second, ab > 0 indicates that a and b have the same sign (both positive or both negative). Combining these, since their sum is negative, both a and b must be negative.

We can use the concept of \\"cow-months\\" to represent the product of the number of cows and the number of months they grazed. Let's calculate the cow-months for each milkman except C (since we don't know the number of cows C grazed yet): For A: 24 cows * 3 months = 72 cow-months For B: 10 cows * 5 months = 50 cow-months For D: 21 cows * 3 months = 63 cow-months Let's denote the number of cows C grazed as x. Then the cow-months for C would be: For C: x cows * 4 months = 4x cow-months Now, we know that A's share of the rent is Rs. 720, and the total rent is Rs. 3250. Since A's share is based on the cow-months he used, we can find the cost per cow-month by dividing A's share by his cow-months: Cost per cow-month = A's share / A's cow-months Cost per cow-month = Rs. 720 / 72 cow-months Cost per cow-month = Rs. 10 per cow-month Now we can calculate the total cow-months used by all milkmen and equate it to the total rent to find the number of cows C grazed: Total cow-months = A's cow-months + B's cow-months + C's cow-months + D's cow-months Total cow-months = 72 + 50 + 4x + 63 We know the total rent is Rs. 3250, and the cost per cow-month is Rs. 10, so: Total rent = Total cow-months * Cost per cow-month Rs. 3250 = (72 + 50 + 4x + 63) * Rs. 10 Now we can solve for x: Rs. 3250 = (185 + 4x) * Rs. 10 Rs. 3250 = Rs. 1850 + Rs. 40x Rs. 3250 - Rs. 1850 = Rs. 40x Rs. 1400 = Rs. 40x x = Rs. 1400 / Rs. 40 x = 35 So, C grazed boxed{35} cows."},{"prompt":"An engineer is constructing a structure that involves placing vertical pillars on the vertices of a horizontal equilateral triangle ABC.

Part (a) 1. **Initial Condition and Setup**: - Let S_{0} be a circle intersecting all n given lines. 2. **Reduction Process**: - If S_{0} does not touch any of our lines, we can replace it with a concentric smaller circle S_{1} that touches the farthest line from the center of S_{0} (see Figure 179, a). 3. **Reducing Intersection Radius**: - If S_{1} touches only one of our lines a, we can further reduce S_{1} by maintaining its point of contact with a and moving the center of S_{1} perpendicular to a until the new circle S_{2} touches another line b (see Figure 179, b). 4. **Continuation of Reduction**: - If S_{2} touches only two non-parallel lines a and b, or if it touches more lines but contains an arc limited by points of contact a and b, we can continue to reduce the intersection circle by moving its center along the angle bisector of lines a and b until it contacts a third line c (see Figure 179, b). 5. **Existence of the Intersecting Circle**: - Hence, we have a circle S that intersects all lines. It either touches two parallel lines a and b or touches three lines a, b, and c that form a triangle circumscribed around S. 6. **Radius Determination**: - If there are two parallel lines a and b, the radius of any intersecting circle can’t be less than half the distance between these lines. Therefore, the distance between a and b is at most 2, thus the radius of our circle S is at most 1. 7. **General Case**: - If there are three lines a, b, and c forming a triangle around S, the radius r must be at most 1, as no point can be farther than r from all three lines (otherwise, no intersecting circle could exist). 8. **Conclusion**: - In all scenarios described, the initial assertion holds true. Therefore, all lines can be intersected by a circle of radius 1.

Let theta be the measure of each of the two congruent (acute) angles at the base, and phi be the measure of the vertex angle, which is obtuse. 2. **Use the given condition**: The problem states that the product of the lengths of the two congruent sides is equal to the product of the base and twice the triangle's height to the base. This can be expressed as: [ a^2 = b cdot 2h ] where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height. 3. **Express base and height in terms of a and theta**: In an isosceles triangle, the base can be split into two equal segments each of length a cos theta. Therefore, the base b = 2a cos theta. The height h from the vertex angle to the base can be expressed as a sin theta. Substituting these into the equation gives: [ a^2 = (2a cos theta) cdot (2a sin theta) ] Simplifying, we get: [ a^2 = 4a^2 cos theta sin theta ] Dividing both sides by a^2 (assuming a neq 0), we have: [ 1 = 4 cos theta sin theta ] 4. **Use the double angle identity**: Recall the double angle identity for sine, sin 2theta = 2 sin theta cos theta.

Since the triangle is obtuse, phi = 180^circ - 2theta must be greater than 90^circ. Thus, if 2theta = 30^circ, then phi = 150^circ. If 2theta = 150^circ, then phi = 30^circ, which is not obtuse. 6. **Conclusion**: The only valid solution for the obtuse angle phi is when 2theta = 30^circ, leading to phi = 150^circ.

If the store makes an average daily profit of 2000, what should be the selling price of each shirt?","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables based on the information given: - Let x be the selling price of each shirt. - The cost price of each shirt is given as 80, so the profit per shirt is (x - 80) dollars. - Initially, the store sells 30 shirts per day. For every 1 reduction in price, 2 additional shirts are sold. Therefore, if the price is reduced by (x - (80 + 50)) = (x - 130) dollars, the number of additional shirts sold is 2(x - 130). The total number of shirts sold per day becomes 30 + 2(130 - x) = 290 - 2x. Given that the store wants to make an average daily profit of 2000, we can set up the equation based on the profit per shirt and the number of shirts sold per day: [ (x - 80)(290 - 2x) = 2000 ] Expanding and simplifying this equation: [ x^2 - 225x + 12600 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we look for the roots: [ x^2 - 225x + 12600 = 0 ] The solutions to this equation are x_1 = 105 and x_2 = 120.

Therefore: [ h(x+pi) = h(x) quad text{for all } x in mathbb{R}. ] 2. **Analyze the sum ( g(x) + h(x) )**: - We need to find out if the function ( f(x) = g(x) + h(x) ) is also periodic. 3. **Check for a common period**: - Assume ( f(x) ) has a period ( T ): [ f(x+T) = f(x) quad text{for all } x in mathbb{R}. ] - This means we need: [ g(x+T) + h(x+T) = g(x) + h(x). ] - Given the properties of ( g ) and ( h ), this must hold: [ g(x+T) = g(x) quad text{and} quad h(x+T) = h(x). ] 4. **Periods and least common multiple**: - For ( g ), which has a period 1, we have: [ g(x+T) = g(x) implies T text{ must be a multiple of } 1. ] - For ( h ), which has a period ( pi ), we have: [ h(x+T) = h(x) implies T text{ must be a multiple of } pi. ] - Thus, ( T ) must be a common multiple of both 1 and ( pi ). The least common multiple of 1 and ( pi ) is ( pi ) because ( pi ) is irrational. 5. **Verify if ( pi ) can be a period**: - Suppose ( T = pi ), then: [ f(x + pi) = g(x + pi) + h(x + pi). ] - Given ( h(x + pi) = h(x) ) and because ( pi ) is not generally a period for ( g(x) ), typical non-trivial periodic functions (like trigonometric or other functions found in mathematics that are periodic at non-rational intervals) do not repeat at irrational multiples. 6. **Conclusion**: - No combination of such functions ( g ) and ( h ) with periods 1 and ( pi ) will form a function ( g + h ) which is periodic for all ( x ) since there is no common rational multiplier that satisfies both periodic conditions unless constructed functions are trivial (i.e., constant functions).

The probability of selecting X=2 from these points is P(X=2) = frac{3}{9} = frac{1}{3}, since for each x value, there are 3 possible y values, making 3 points where x=2. For Y=3 given X=2, we solve the system: [ begin{cases} X=x=2 Y=x+y=3 end{cases} ] This gives us x=2 and y=1, which corresponds to a single point (2,1). Thus, P(X=2, Y=3) = frac{1}{9}. Therefore, P(Y=3|X=2) = frac{P(X=2, Y=3)}{P(X=2)} = frac{1/9}{1/3} = frac{1}{3}.

Therefore, P(X+Y=8) = frac{2}{16} = frac{1}{8}, which contradicts the statement in option B.

The problem states that the sales grew from 100 vehicles in January to 121 vehicles in March. Since there are two months between January and March, we can model the growth as follows: 1. The sales in February would be 100(1+x), where x is the monthly growth rate. 2. The sales in March, then, would be 100(1+x)^2 because the growth rate applies again to the February sales. Given that the sales in March are 121 vehicles, we set up the equation: [100(1+x)^2 = 121] Dividing both sides by 100 gives us: [(1+x)^2 = 1.21] Taking the square root of both sides, we find two possible values for 1+x: [1+x = pmsqrt{1.21}] [1+x = pm1.1] This gives us two possible values for x: [x_1 = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1] [x_2 = -1.1 - 1 = -2.1] Since a negative growth rate would imply the sales decreased, which contradicts the information given, we discard x_2 = -2.1.

We are tasked with finding the positive integer pairs left(a_1, a_2right) such that the sequence is periodic. 2. **Analyzing the gcd Sequence**: Let d_n = (a_{n}, a_{n+1}). This leads to d_{n+1} mid a_{n+1} and d_{n+1} mid a_{n+2} by definition. Therefore, d_{n+1} must also divide any linear combination of a_{n+1} and a_{n+2}. Specifically, d_{n+1} divides: [ d_{n} cdot a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_n ] Thus, d_{n+1} divides both a_{n} and a_{n+1}, implying d_{n+1} mid d_n. 3. **Monotonicity of the gcd Sequence**: Since d_{n+1} mid d_n, it follows that: [ d_{n+1} leq d_n ] for all n, meaning the sequence left(d_nright) is monotonically decreasing and must eventually stabilize at a constant value if the original sequence is periodic. 4. **Periodicity of gcd**: Assume left(a_kright) is periodic. Then the sequence of gcd values left(d_kright) also needs to be periodic. Since left(d_kright) is monotonically decreasing, a periodic left(d_kright) implies left(d_kright) is constant: [ d_1 = d_2 = ldots = d = text{constant} ] 5. **Evaluating the gcd Values**: Consider the scenarios for the constant gcd d: - **Case 1: d = 1**: If d = 1, then: [ a_{n+2} = a_{n} + a_{n+1} ] This leads to an increasing sequence because a_{n+2} > a_{n+1} for all n. Such a strictly monotonically increasing sequence cannot be periodic. - **Case 2: d geq 3**: If d geq 3, then each term in the sequence evolves as: [ a_{n+2} = frac{a_{n+1} + a_{n}}{d} ] Consider: [ a_{n+3} = frac{a_{n+2} + a_{n+1}}{d} = frac{frac{a_{n+1} + a_{n}}{d} + a_{n+1}}{d} = frac{1}{d^2} a_{n} + left(frac{1}{d^2} + frac{2}{d}right) a_{n+1} ] Simplifying and summing: [ a_{n+3} + a_{n+2} = frac{1}{d^2} a_{n} + left(frac{1}{d^2} + frac{2}{d}right) a_{n+1} < a_{n+1} + a_{n} ] This results in a subsequence that is strictly decreasing, contradicting the periodic nature of left(a_kright). 6. **Case 3: d = 2**: If left(a_nright) is periodic, and d = 2, this implies: [ a_{n+2} = frac{a_{n} + a_{n+1}}{2} ] This form suggests each term is the arithmetic mean of the preceding two. Crucially, if a_1 neq a_2, [ |a_{n+2} - a_{n+1}| = left|frac{a_{n+1} - a_n}{2}right| ] implying that for large n: [ |a_{n+2} - a_{n+1}| = frac{|a_{2} - a_{1}|}{2^n} rightarrow 0 ] For left(a_nright) consisting of positive integers, eventually, the difference between terms becomes non-integer, contradicting the integer condition.

The sum of the smallest seven numbers involving (a_{1}) must be positive: [ a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{7} > 0. ] Since (a_{8} < frac{4}{3}), the sum of the remaining terms (excluding (a_{1})) must adjust accordingly: [ a_{1} + 6 cdot frac{4}{21} = frac{c + 8}{7} > 0. ] Rearranging, we find: [ a_{1} > -6 cdot frac{4}{3} = -8. ] 5. **Example Construction:** To validate that (a_{1}) can take any value within the derived range, we consider: [ a_{2} = a_{3} = cdots = a_{8} = frac{4}{21} - frac{a_{1}}{7}. ] Check for correctness: begin{align*} a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{8} & = a_{1} + 7 left(frac{4}{21} - frac{a_{1}}{7}right) & = a_{1} + frac{28}{21} - a_{1} = frac{28}{21} = frac{4}{3}. end{align*} We also ensure: [ a_{1} leq frac{4}{21} - frac{a_{1}}{7} Rightarrow 8a_{1} leq frac{4}{3}. ] Rearranging gives: [ c leq frac{1}{6}. ] Finally: [ a_{1} + cdots + a_{7} = a_{1} + 6 left( frac{4}{21} - frac{a_{1}}{7} right) = frac{c+8}{7} > 0. ] # Conclusion: The possible values for (a_{1}) are: [ boxed{-8<a_{1} leq frac{1}{6}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a sequence (left{a_{n}right}) that satisfies the condition (a_{1}=frac{21}{16}) and [ 2a_{n} 3a_{n1} = frac{3}{2^{n+1}}, quad n geqslant 2, ] let (m) be a positive integer with (m geqslant 2).

In such a case, any arrangement of four distinct digits results in a unique four-digit number. The total number of arrangements for four distinct digits is calculated using the formula for permutations, which is 4! (4 factorial). The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Therefore, 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24. However, in our specific case, we do not have four distinct digits; we have two pairs of identical digits (two 2s and two 9s). This means that each arrangement of these digits will be counted multiple times if we simply use 4!. To correct for this overcounting, we divide by the factorial of the number of times each digit is repeated. Since both 2 and 9 are repeated twice, we divide by 2! for the two 2s and another 2! for the two 9s. The factorial of 2, 2!, is equal to 2 times 1 = 2. Putting it all together, the corrected formula to calculate the number of unique four-digit integers that can be formed is frac{4!}{2!cdot 2!}. Substituting the values we have: frac{4!}{2!cdot 2!} = frac{24}{2 times 2} = frac{24}{4} = 6 Therefore, there are boxed{6} different positive, four-digit integers that can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9, and 9."},{"prompt":"Prove that if there is a perfect square in an infinite arithmetic sequence of positive integers, then there are infinitely many perfect squares in it.","completion":"1. **Define the Arithmetic Sequence and Properties**: Consider a positive integer arithmetic sequence with a common difference ( d ).

For if ( d leq 0 ), the sequence would not consist solely of positive numbers. If ( d = 0 ), the sequence is constant, ( a, a, a, ldots ). If there exists a square number in the sequence, then all terms of the sequence are square numbers.

Let E and G denote the points where the tangent line touches the two circles. Since the line is tangent to both circles, the segments DE and FG will be perpendicular to the tangent line at points E and G. The distance between the centers D and F is calculated as: DF = |3 - 7| = 4. Place a coordinate system with D at (3,0) and F at (7,0). Let FC = u, and let AB = y be the y-intercept of the tangent line. By the tangency condition and the Pythagorean Theorem, we have: DE^2 + (3+u)^2 = 3^2, quad FG^2 + (4-u)^2 = 2^2. This simplifies to: 9 + (3+u)^2 = 9, quad 4 + (4-u)^2 = 4. Solving these equations, we get: (3+u)^2 = 0, quad (4-u)^2 = 0, 3+u = 0, quad 4-u = 0, u = -3, quad u = 4.

Let's denote the given vectors as (mathbf{x}_1, mathbf{x}_2, ldots, mathbf{x}_{1980}). 1. **Step 1: Define the Sum of All Vectors** Let the sum of all the vectors be (mathbf{S}).

These diagonals intersect at a single point. **Step 1: Understanding the Construction of ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 )** - Let's assume ( T_2 ) is a triangle inscribed in a circle with vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ). - Triangle ( T_1 ) has its vertices ( P, Q, ) and ( R ), such that each vertex corresponds to the midpoint of the arcs ( BC, AC, ) and ( AB ) respectively that do not contain the opposite vertices. **Step 2: Properties of Midpoints and Parallelism** - The midpoints ( P, Q, ) and ( R ) divide the circumference into equal segments not containing the opposite vertices. - Since each side of ( T_1 ) connects midpoints of arcs, the sides of ( T_1 ) are each parallel to one of the sides of ( T_2 ) (by properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and equal arcs). **Step 3: Intersection Hexagon ( T_1 cap T_2 )** - The hexagon ( T_1 cap T_2 ) is formed by the intersection of the two triangles. - The diagonals connecting opposite vertices in this hexagon segment each triangle side twice. - Due to the symmetry and construction properties of cyclic quadrilaterals (each side of the hexagon can be seen as part of symmetrical path in the circle), the diagonals naturally align parallel to the sides of ( T_1 ). **Step 4: Concurrency of Diagonals** - By properties of inscribed figures and symmetry, the diagonals in ( T_1 cap T_2 ) intersect in the center of the circumcircle. - Using properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we can deduce that opposite angles formed by the intersections are equal and thus the lines meet at one point. Therefore, we have shown that in the hexagon ( T_1 cap T_2 ), the diagonals connecting opposite vertices are parallel to the sides of triangle ( T_1 ) and intersect at a single point. Let's conclude: **Conclusion for Part (a):** blacksquare Part (b): We are required to prove the vertices ( A, D, K, ) and the center ( O ) of the inscribed circle of triangle ( ABC ) form a rhombus. **Step 1: Understanding the Configuration** - Given a triangle ( ABC ). - Let ( odot ABC ) be the circumcircle of triangle ( ABC ). - ( D ) and ( K ) are midpoints of the arcs ( AB ) and ( AC ) respectively. - ( O ) is the center of the inscribed circle of triangle ( ABC ). **Step 2: Proving Point Configuration** - The midpoint of an arc on the circumcircle creates equal angles with the arc's endpoints. - The line segment from the vertex to this midpoint is thus a median. **Step 3: Perpendicular and Bisectors** - Points ( D ) and ( K ) being midpoints mean that they lie on the perpendicular bisectors of ( AB ) and ( AC ) respectively. - Since both lines ( AD ) and ( AK ) subtend an equal angle with respect to the center ( O ), and thanks to the symmetrical properties, ( ADOK ) shares symmetrical angles making it a rhombus. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles hence preserving the shape. Therefore, **Conclusion for Part (b):** blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A grasshopper lives on a coordinate line.

This is because 1 and 5 are both odd. - If the grasshopper starts at an odd coordinate (which is 1), every jump it makes will toggle the coordinate from odd to even or even to odd. 4. **Number of Jumps and Final Parity**: - The grasshopper makes 2003 jumps. - An odd number of jumps results in a coordinate with different parity from the starting coordinate, since 2003 is odd. - Starting at 1 (odd coordinate), after 2003 jumps, the grasshopper will land on an even coordinate (because an odd number of jumps changes the parity from odd to even). 5. **Target Coordinate Parity**: - The target coordinate, 3, is odd. - From step 4, we know that after 2003 jumps, the grasshopper will be at an even coordinate.

Since cos a = -cos beta, we have cos beta = -frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}. Now, we apply the cosine difference identity, cos(a - beta) = cos a cos beta + sin a sin beta. Substituting the values we found, we get cos(a - beta) = (frac{2sqrt{2}}{3})(-frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}) + (frac{1}{3})(frac{1}{3}) = -frac{7}{9}.

Objective: - Partition the cities into the smallest number of groups, k, such that no group has cities reachable from each other within 28 flights. **Step 2: Establishing Lower Bound for k** First, let's show that at least 57 groups are necessary. Suppose G has a directed cycle of length 57: - In a cycle of 57 cities, any city can reach any other city in the same cycle with possibly fewer than 57 flights (specifically, the maximum distance is 28 flights if we could use 28 or fewer flights). Thus: - No two cities in the same cycle can be in the same group since it is possible to reach each other within 28 flights. Conclusion: - Every cycle of length 57 necessitates at least 57 distinct groups, implying k geq 57. **Step 3: Establishing that 57 Groups Suffice** We need to construct an auxiliary directed graph H such that: - Vertices in H are the cities of Dreamland. - There exists an arrow from city u to city v if u can be reached from v using at most 28 flights in G. In H: - Each city has at most 28 outgoing edges (because each city can connect to up to 28 other cities within 28 flights). Our goal: - Partition H into 57 groups such that no two cities in each group are connected by an arrow in H. **Step 4: Inductive Proof** We'll use induction to prove the following lemma: Suppose we have a directed graph on n geq 1 vertices such that each vertex has an out-degree of at most 28. Then, we can partition the vertices into 57 groups, ensuring no two vertices in the same group are connected by an edge. **Base Case:** For n = 1, a single vertex can trivially be placed in one group. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for any graph with fewer than n vertices. Now consider a graph H with n vertices. 1. **Vertex Removal Considerations:** Each vertex in H has an out-degree of at most 28. Thus, there exists a vertex, say v, with an in-degree of at most 28 as well. 2. **Graph After Vertex Removal:** Removing v from H gives us a graph with n-1 vertices. By the inductive hypothesis, we can partition these n-1 vertices into 57 groups where no two vertices in the same group are connected. 3. **Re-inserting the Removed Vertex:** Now, add v back to H. Since v has at most 28 in-neighbors and at most 28 out-neighbors (total at most 56 neighbors), there is at least one group among the 57 that does not contain any of v's neighbors. Place v in that group. This completes the inductive step, ensuring we can always partition the vertices into 57 groups as required. **Step 5: Conclusion** From the induction, we deduce: - It is possible to partition the cities into at most 57 groups such that no two cities in the same group can reach each other using at most 28 flights.

Therefore, the probability (w) that a number n chosen at random from this set is divisible by 3 is the number of favorable outcomes (numbers divisible by 3) divided by the total number of outcomes (total two-digit prime digit numbers). w = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes w = 4 / 12 w = 1 / 3 So, the probability w that n is divisible by 3 is boxed{1/3} ."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],I={key:0},R={key:1};function L(n,e,h,m,o,s){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",N,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
