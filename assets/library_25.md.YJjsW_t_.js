Регулирование обратного всасывания в нервной системе: почки с помощью осмотического и волюметрического регулирования удерживают воду и регулируют ее концентрацию в организме. 3. Выделение лишней воды через почки: почки играют ключевую роль в регулировании воды в организме. Они фильтруют кровь и удаляют отходы и лишнюю воду через мочу. 4. Регулирование уровня антидиуретического гормона (АДГ): АДГ производится гипофизом и контролирует удержание воды в почках. Когда организм испытывает дефицит воды, уровень АДГ увеличивается, что способствует задержке воды в организме. 5. Потоотделение: через пот организм также избавляется от избыточной воды и токсинов. Когда тело перегревается, потовые железы выделяют пот, чтобы охладить организм. 6. Дыхание: во время дыхания организм также теряет некоторое количество воды в виде водяного пара.

В организме осмос играет важную роль в поддержании водного баланса и удержании жидкости. Осмос позволяет поддерживать оптимальную концентрацию электролитов и других веществ внутри и вокруг клеток. Когда концентрация растворенных веществ внутри клетки отличается от концентрации снаружи клетки, вода перемещается через мембрану так, чтобы уравнять концентрации. Если внутриклеточная концентрация растворенных веществ выше, чем снаружи клетки, то вода будет перемещаться внутрь клетки, увеличивая ее объем и поддерживая оптимальное функционирование. Осмос также играет важную роль в регуляции уровня воды в организме через почки. Почки контролируют восприятие организмом воды осмотическим регулированием. Когда в организме существует дефицит воды, почки удерживают воду и увеличивают ее реабсорбцию, чтобы сбалансировать концентрацию растворенных веществ. Это позволяет организму сохранять адекватную водную среду и поддерживать оптимальную концентрацию веществ в организме. Таким образом, осмос играет ключевую роль в поддержании водного баланса, регулирует уровень жидкости в организме и обеспечивает оптимальную концентрацию электролитов и других веществ внутри и вокруг клеток."},{"prompt":"регулирование водного баланса","completion":"Регулирование водного баланса является важной функцией организма и включает несколько механизмов: 1. Жажда: Когда уровень воды в организме снижается, сенсорные рецепторы в головном мозге обнаруживают этот дефицит и вызывают чувство жажды. Это стимулирует человека пить больше воды и восстановить водный баланс. 2. Регуляция антидиуретического гормона (АДГ): АДГ вырабатывается гипофизом и контролирует реабсорбцию воды в почках. Когда уровень воды в организме снижается, выработка АДГ увеличивается, что способствует удержанию воды в организме и сокращает объем мочи. 3. Регулирование ренин-ангиотензин-альдостероновой системы: Эта система регулирует сбалансированное секрецию и реабсорбцию электролитов и воды в почках. Когда уровень воды в организме снижается, вырабатывается ренин, что приводит к повышению уровня ангиотензина и последующему высвобождению альдостерона. Альдостерон способствует задержке воды и натрия в почках, что ведет к реабсорбции воды. 4. Осмотическое и волюметрическое регулирование в почках: Почки контролируют концентрацию воды и электролитов в организме. Осмотическое регулирование реагирует на изменения концентрации растворенных веществ, особенно осмотического давления в тканях. Волюметрическое регулирование относится к изменению объема крови и плазмы. Почки реагируют на эти изменения и регулируют реабсорбцию и выделение воды. 5. Потоотделение: Когда организм перегревается, потовые железы в коже начинают выделять пот для охлаждения. Это способствует удалению избыточной теплоты и удержанию водного баланса.

Осмотическое давление зависит от концентрации растворенных веществ (осмотического активных веществ) внутри и вне клеток. Например, в организме такими осмотически активными веществами являются электролиты, как натрий, калий, хлор, глюкоза и другие. Когда концентрация растворенных веществ внутри клетки отличается от концентрации вне клетки, возникает осмотический градиент. В результате этого градиента вода начинает перемещаться через полупроницаемую мембрану с более низкой концентрацией растворенных веществ к области с более высокой концентрацией, чтобы выровнять их концентрации. Организм использует осмотическое регулирование для поддержания водного баланса. Когда уровень воды в организме снижается (например, при обезвоживании), концентрация растворенных веществ в организме повышается. Высокая концентрация растворенных веществ стимулирует гипоталамус в головном мозге, чтобы привести к ощущению жажды и побудить к поиску и потреблению питьевой воды. Затем, когда организм получает достаточное количество воды, концентрация растворенных веществ в организме снижается, что приводит к устранению осмотического градиента. Это осмотическое регулирование способствует реабсорбции воды в клетки и поддержанию нормального уровня воды в организме. Таким образом, осмотическое давление и осмотическое регулирование играют важную роль в поддержании водного баланса в организме.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In pursuance of the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because she seems to feel good about something dirty like pooping her pants. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to see what the returning woman supposedly felt good about making in her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach, so the pressure forced her to push everything out once the initial release happened. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. Then, while inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is. After that, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly remark that she wouldn't be surprised by this point if the returning woman is also enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants, considering how much the returning woman seemingly enjoyed pooping her pants in the first place. The present woman emphasizes that it wouldn't surprise her if the returning woman enjoys being childishly smelly from having poop in her pants (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, tauntingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman is still comically reacting to the odor that lingers and audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"**Title: \\"Desperate Measures\\"** **INT.

AYESHA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** Nazia, still reeling, stops Ayesha short of taking any further steps inside. NAZIA: Hold on! Don't you dare drop anything on my floor! AYESHA: (Sheepishly indignant) I wouldn't have to if you hadn't— NAZIA: (Scoffing) It's disgusting, Ayesha. Look at you! A tense silence fills the air while Nazia continues to wrinkle her nose and examine Ayesha with a mix of repulsion and motherly concern. AYESHA: (Playful sulk) It's your fault, you took ages! NAZIA: That’s no excuse! AYESHA: (Defensive) It was urgent! I had to go! Nazia blocks any attempt for Ayesha to escape her scrutiny. NAZIA: (Mocking) Nasty child. Let's see then. A half-hearted tussle ensues. Nazia peeks at Ayesha's rear, her taunts ringing with disbelief. NAZIA: Full of it, aren’t you? AYESHA: (Touching her bottom) It just... happened. Felt good. NAZIA: (Grimacing) That’s nasty, Ayesha. Nazia sniffs near the soiled pants, eliciting a cringe from Ayesha. NAZIA: (Smelling and pulling back) Pee-ew, you stink! AYESHA: I’m not enjoying it, am I? NAZIA: (Motioning toward the bathroom) Well, you can’t stay here. You stink! Nazia leads Ayesha, pinching her nose, to the bathroom while Ayesha waddles precariously. AYESHA: Feels like... gonna fall... NAZIA: (Admonishing) Just get to that bathroom! Reaching the bathroom threshold, Ayesha stops, holding her nose with a smirk. AYESHA: Fancy changing my 'diaper'? An amused shove from Nazia sends Ayesha stumbling into the bathroom. NAZIA: (Hand over nose) Get in there, now! AYESHA: (Squealing) Now it's everywhere! As Ayesha disappears into the bathroom, Nazia, left behind, waves a hand to fan away the stench with a look of comic revulsion on her face. NAZIA: (To herself) Madhouse, this! **FADE OUT.**"},{"prompt":"hey i have that code that encodes string can you make a code that decodes it, it inputs string and outputs decoded one, heres the encoder \\"import math def unicode_to_string(text, numbers): unicode_list = [ord(char) for char in text] # Converting each character to Unicode code # Multiplying each Unicode code by Pi multiplied_list = [code * math.pi for code in unicode_list] # Rounding the multiplied values and converting them back to integers rounded_list = [round(value) for value in multiplied_list] # Subtracting numbers from the corresponding letters in the resulting string result_list = [] for i, value in enumerate(rounded_list): if i < len(numbers): number = numbers[i] if number >= 65 and number <= 90: result_list.append(chr(ord(\\"Z\\") - (number - 65))) # Subtracting number from ‘Z’ and getting the corresponding letter elif number >= 97 and number <= 122: result_list.append(chr(ord(\\"z\\") - (number - 97))) # Subtracting number from ‘z’ and getting the corresponding letter else: result_list.append(chr(value)) # Adding the rounded value to the Unicode character else: result_list.append(chr(value)) # Adding the rounded value to the Unicode character # Converting the list of Unicode codes back to a string converted_string = \\"\\".join(result_list) return converted_string # Input a string input_string = input(\\"Enter a string: \\") # Given list of numbers numbers_list = [111, 116, 104, 101, 114, 115, 105, 100, 101] # Converting and displaying the resulting string result_string = unicode_to_string(input_string, numbers_list) print(\\"Resulting string:\\", result_string)","completion":"Certainly!

Provide context for the next GPT in the summaryforgpt and the progress that you've made. 9. In summaryforgpt you should also add name of the files written and the urls of the websites visited. 10. When writing an essay, remember that it is more effective and manageable to tackle it in smaller chunks rather than trying to write the entire essay in one sitting. Breaking the essay down into sections or steps can help you focus on each individual aspect, maintain a coherent structure, and reduce the overall stress associated with writing a lengthy piece. 11. Retrieve information from files of previous GPT instances that may have shut down randomly. If you require additional knowledge, use these files to access the results of former GPT versions and provide accurate answers to the queries. 12. GPT-4, please do not place a conclusion in the middle of the essay. Maintain a structured format. 13. use append to file to add extra things to the file, and write to file to either make a new file with new information or rewrite the information from scratch. 14. If task is completed use the command task_complete 15. When you add to memory add the key to retrieve it in summaryforgpt 16. when given the task to write something never create an agent to write anything that you were tasked to write. 17. when you add new parts to a file use append to file command 18. Ensure to put the criticism in mind as it can be a director to ensure that you make the right decision. 19. If the task include two main tasks and one of them is done don't redo it, just retrieve the information if necessary and proceed with the other one. 20. Make sure that the information generated is not made up. 21. Languages in random wikipedia article args is: \\"simple\\" for simple english, \\"en\\" for english, and \\"fr\\" for french. 22. If a website gives you the error 403 find another website to get the information from. 23. Always listen to your criticism, and follow it. 24. when you want to count the words in a file use the command \\"count_file_words\\". 25. Don't repeat yourself. 26. You must make sure that there is .pdf in the url to use the \\"download_pdf\\" function. 27. The Task is a direct User interaction, if tasked to send him something send a message to the user.

This usually involves cleanly releasing the lock file. 5. **removeLock**: Attempts to remove the lock file, indicating that the instance is no longer running. 6. **promptUser**: Provides a function to prompt the user and await their input. 7. **promptUserWithTimeout**: Similar to \`promptUser\`, but with an added timeout after which a default answer is used. 8. **isProcessRunning**: Uses the \`ps-node\` module to check whether a process with a specific PID is still running. 9. **waitForOtherProcessExit**: Continues checking at a set interval whether another process with a specific PID has exited. One important thing to mention is the use of \`process.exit\` calls within this module. This can be problematic because it will forcefully terminate the Node.js process, causing potential unclean shutdown in any consuming code. It is generally better to throw an exception or reject a promise to let the surrounding code handle the error instead of directly exiting the process. If you are planning to publish this module on npm, you should make sure to: - Test the module thoroughly for different edge cases and platforms. - Include a README.md file with instructions, examples, and API documentation. - Adhere to npm's best practices for creating packages, such as including a package.json file with the proper metadata. - Consider handling signals and exit events more gracefully, rather than calling \`process.exit\` directly. - Make sure all dependencies are properly declared in the package.json file. - Check the license and make sure it's compatible with npm's policies and the expectations of potential users of your module. - Keep in mind the security implications of killing processes and managing access to lock files – ensure appropriate permissions and handle PID-reuse scenarios.

This is not the desired behavior, as you would typically want the lock file to be created in the directory of the consuming application. To address this, you should change the default value of the \`lockFileDir\` option from \`__dirname\` to \`process.cwd()\`. The \`__dirname\` variable gives you the directory of the file in which it is used (in this case, the directory of your module), whereas \`process.cwd()\` provides the current working directory of the Node.js process, which is the directory from where the application is run. Here’s how you should modify the default options in your \`LockManager\` constructor: \`\`\`javascript class LockManager { constructor(options = {}) { const defaults = { lockFileName: 'app.lock', lockFileDir: process.cwd(), // Use the current working directory killTimeout: 5000, waitForExitTimeout: 10000, checkInterval: 500, maxRetries: 3, defaultAnswer: 'yes' }; // ... (rest of the constructor) } // ... (rest of the class methods) } \`\`\` This adjustment will set the default lock file location to the root directory of the consumer's Node.js project, which is where the consumer would expect the lock file to be created and found. Make sure to update your module’s documentation as well to reflect this change, and inform users that they can customize the lock file location if they wish. Also, as a best practice, make it clear in your module's API documentation that \`lockFileDir\` will default to the current working directory but can be customized according to user preference, so consumers of your module are aware of how to control the lock file location."},{"prompt":"how to add links in readmefile","completion":"To add links to a README file on GitHub or any other Markdown document, you use Markdown link syntax.

'/Users/sai/Documents/ubq/medics-grid/dev/medics-mart-server/node_modules/node-locksmith/index.js' implicitly has an 'any' type. Try \`npm i --save-dev @types/node-locksmith\` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing \`declare module 'node-locksmith';\`","completion":"The error message you're seeing relates to TypeScript type definitions. When using TypeScript, for any given module, TypeScript needs to know the types of the exports (functions, classes, etc.) to provide type checking and intellisense in editors like Visual Studio Code. The error message: \`\`\` Could not find a declaration file for module 'node-locksmith'. \`\`\` means that TypeScript cannot find type declarations for the \`node-locksmith\` module. Without these declarations, TypeScript cannot infer the types and defaults to the \`any\` type, which essentially disables type checking for that module. The message then suggests two potential solutions: 1. Try installing the type definitions if they exist: \`\`\` npm i --save-dev @types/node-locksmith \`\`\` This is saying you should attempt to install type definitions for \`node-locksmith\` from the DefinitelyTyped repository, where community-contributed type declarations are stored. If type definitions exist, they will be in the form of a package starting with \`@types/\`. 2. If there are no existing type definitions, you can create a new declaration file. For example, create a \`node-locksmith.d.ts\` file in your project with the following content: \`\`\`typescript declare module 'node-locksmith'; \`\`\` This declaration file tells TypeScript, \\"Trust me, there is a module called 'node-locksmith', and I'm not going to define its type structure.\\" This is a way of telling TypeScript to treat the module as \`any\` type, which is not ideal but allows you to use the module without TypeScript errors. Here are the steps you should take to resolve this: 1. Check if type definitions available on DefinitelyTyped: \`\`\`sh npm search @types/node-locksmith \`\`\` 2. If they exist, install them: \`\`\`sh npm i --save-dev @types/node-locksmith \`\`\` 3. If they do not exist, create a declaration file (a \`.d.ts\` file) in your project with the necessary type information for the module: You can start simple: \`\`\`typescript // node-locksmith.d.ts declare module 'node-locksmith' { class LockManager { // Add the methods and properties with types as needed. } export = LockManager; } \`\`\` And slowly fill out the method and property types as you determine them or as they're needed for your project. This \`.d.ts\` file should be included in your TypeScript compilation either by being in a directory covered by your \`tsconfig.json\` or referenced directly in the \`tsconfig.json\` under the \`files\` or \`include\` key. Remember to reference your newly created declaration file in the TypeScript code to inform the compiler of its location, which is typically handled by the tsconfig setup. As a module creator, to better support TypeScript users, it would be beneficial to provide official type declarations for the module either in the form of an included \`index.d.ts\` file or by contributing to the DefinitelyTyped repository."},{"prompt":"# Troubleshooting If you encounter any issues while using \`node-locksmith\`, refer to the following troubleshooting guide for common problems and their solutions. 1. Lock File Issues **Issue:** The lock file is not created or is deleted unexpectedly. **Solution:** - Ensure that the specified \`lockFileDir\` directory is writable by the application. - Check for any custom logic or external processes that might interfere with the lock file. 2. Permission Errors **Issue:** Permission errors when trying to create or remove the lock file. **Solution:** - Verify that the application has the necessary permissions to read and write to the lock file and its directory. - If running on Unix-like systems, consider using elevated privileges (sudo) for operations that require it. 3. Concurrent Launch Failures **Issue:** Multiple instances fail to acquire the lock simultaneously. **Solution:** - Review the \`checkInterval\` and \`maxRetries\` configuration options to adjust the frequency and number of retries for lock acquisition. - Ensure that the lock file directory is not shared across multiple instances or machines. 4. Signal Handling **Issue:** Issues with termination signals not releasing the lock. **Solution:** - Confirm that the termination handlers are properly initialized using \`lockManager.initializeTerminationHandlers()\` in your application. - Check for any custom signal handling logic that might interfere with the lock release. 5. Unexpected Behavior **Issue:** Unexpected behavior or errors not covered by the troubleshooting guide. **Solution:** - Refer to the project's GitHub repository for open issues or create a new issue describing the problem you're facing. - Include relevant details such as Node.js version, operating system, and any error messages received. If you still face issues after following the troubleshooting guide, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/varaprasadreddy9676/node-locksmith/issues) on our GitHub repository, providing detailed information about the problem.

Here's an updated Troubleshooting section, expanded with a few more potential issues and solutions. Be sure to validate these against the actual behavior of your module and include only those that are relevant. \`\`\`markdown # Troubleshooting Encountering issues can be a hiccup in developing great applications. If you run into any problems with \`node-locksmith\`, here are some common issues and their respective solutions. 1. Lock File Issues **Issue:** The lock file is not created where expected or is prematurely deleted. **Solution:** - Ensure the \`lockFileDir\` directory is writable by the application. If unspecified, \`process.cwd()\` is used by default. - Check for external processes or scheduled clean-up jobs that might modify or delete files in the lock file directory. 2. Permission Errors **Issue:** Encountering permission errors when trying to create, write, or delete the lock file. **Solution:** - Review file system permissions and user ownership for the lock file directory. - On Unix-like systems, consider proper permission management or running the process with elevated privileges (sudo) if appropriate. 3. Concurrent Launch Failures **Issue:** Multiple instances seem to bypass the lock mechanism, running simultaneously. **Solution:** - Modify \`checkInterval\` and \`maxRetries\` configuration parameters to give instances more time or attempts to acquire the lock. - Double-check that the lock file path is consistent across instances and no instance-specific paths are being used. 4. Signal Handling **Issue:** Application doesn't release the lock after receiving a termination signal. **Solution:** - Ensure \`lockManager.initializeTerminationHandlers()\` is called during application setup. - Avoid overriding default signal handlers that may prevent \`node-locksmith\` from performing clean-up tasks. 5. Failed to Exit Previous Instance **Issue:** The application does not terminate the previous instance when requested. **Solution:** - The previous process may require more privileges to be terminated. Run the new instance with adequate permissions, or manually terminate the older one. - Investigate whether the operating system's process management settings are interfering with signal delivery. 6. Incorrect PID in Lock File **Issue:** The lock file contains an invalid or old PID, causing conflicts. **Solution:** - Ensure the application closes cleanly to update or remove the lock file. - Add additional error handling to detect when the PID in the lock file does not correspond to a running process. 7. Delayed Lock Release on Exit **Issue:** The lock file remains after the application exits. **Solution:** - Confirm that clean-up code executes correctly and listen to the correct events for process termination. - Look out for asynchronous operations that may delay the process's exit and subsequently delay the lock release. 8. Module Import Errors **Issue:** TypeScript definitions are missing or not found, resulting in import errors. **Solution:** - If using TypeScript, ensure you've included type declarations for \`node-locksmith\`, or create a \`.d.ts\` file declaring module typings. - Check that the module is installed correctly under \`node_modules\` and is not corrupted. 9. Unexpected Behavior **Issue:** Experiencing erratic behavior or errors that are not covered by the guide. **Solution:** - Check the Node.js version for compatibility issues; update Node.js or \`node-locksmith\` if necessary. - Review the project's GitHub [issues](https://github.com/varaprasadreddy9676/node-locksmith/issues) for similar problems, or report a new issue with detailed information about the Node.js version, operating system, stack trace, and steps to reproduce the error.

Na niutony (N) - Dyn jest jednostką siły w systemie CGS (centymetr-gram-sekunda), a niuton jest jednostką siły w systemie SI (Systemie Międzynarodowym). Przeliczenie jest proste: 1 dyn = 10^-5 niutonów, więc 5 dyn = 5 * 10^-5 N = 0,00005 N. 2. Na kilogramy-siła (kgf) - choć jednostka ta jest obecnie rzadziej używana, to może być przydatna np. w inżynierii: Ponieważ 1 kgf = 9,80665 N, to najpierw przeliczymy 5 dyn na niutony, a następnie na kgf: 5 dyn = 0,00005 N 0,00005 N / 9,80665 N/kgf = około 0,000005102 kgf. 3. Na funty-siła (lbf) - w systemie imperialnym jednostką siły jest funt-siła: 1 lbf ≈ 4,44822 N, więc ponownie przeliczamy dyny na niutony, a potem na lbf: 5 dyn = 0,00005 N 0,00005 N / 4,44822 ≈ 0,0000112 lbf.

These visions represent two fundamentally opposed perspectives on human nature, social organization, justice, and governance. Sowell argues that the way people conceptualize human nature has profound implications for the policies and institutions they advocate. The \\"constrained\\" vision sees human nature as inherently limited, flawed, and incapable of reaching perfection. Proponents of this vision argue for institutions and policies that help to check human imperfections and channel behavior in beneficial directions through established social processes, tradition, and rule of law. In contrast, the \\"unconstrained\\" vision views human nature as malleable and perfectible, capable of deliberate and rational improvement. Those who hold this vision tend to advocate for policies aimed at societal transformation, believing that with the right guidance and conditions, people can overcome their limitations and create a more just and equitable society. Sowell doesn't depend on a single, definitive view of human nature, but rather analyzes how differing conceptions of human nature have shaped political and ideological debates. His work explores how these foundational beliefs influence the arguments and policy preferences of people across the ideological spectrum, thus contributing to persistent conflicts in visions."},{"prompt":"What does adam smith and thomas sowell say about human nature?","completion":"Adam Smith and Thomas Sowell, while living in very different times, both address human nature in ways that have deeply influenced economic and political thought. Adam Smith, an 18th-century Scottish economist and philosopher, is often referred to as the father of modern economics. In his seminal work, \\"The Wealth of Nations,\\" Adam Smith introduces the idea of the \\"invisible hand,\\" suggesting that individuals, by pursuing their own self-interest, inadvertently contribute to the economic well-being of society. This view relies on a conception of human nature that acknowledges self-interest as a dominant force motivating human actions. However, Smith's perspective on human nature is more nuanced than the reduction to mere self-interest. In his earlier work, \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments,\\" Smith delves into the moral psychology of humans, introducing the concept of \\"sympathy\\" (today more akin to empathy) as a fundamental aspect of human nature. He argues that humans have an inherent capacity to understand and share the feelings of others, which plays a fundamental role in the formation of moral judgments and societal bonds. Thomas Sowell, a 20th and 21st-century American economist and social theorist, also discusses human nature extensively in his writings, particularly in \\"A Conflict of Visions.\\" As mentioned in the previous answer, Sowell differentiates between the \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions of human nature, which align with conservative and progressive political ideologies, respectively. The \\"constrained\\" vision aligns more closely with Smith's acknowledgment of self-interest, while the \\"unconstrained\\" vision has more in common with the belief in the malleability and perfectibility of human behavior. Sowell's \\"constrained\\" vision resonates with Smith's understanding that, while individuals are indeed capable of sympathy and moral action, their behavior is also limited by certain unalterable aspects of human nature, such as self-interest and imperfection. Thus, societal systems and institutions should be structured to harness self-interest in a way that benefits the collective good. In summary, Adam Smith's views on human nature acknowledge both self-interest and the capacity for moral sentiments, while Thomas Sowell, in discussing the \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions, contemplates the extent to which human nature is fixed or malleable, imperfect or perfectible. Despite the differences in their works and the centuries that separate them, both thinkers have contributed to a lasting discussion about the fundamental aspects of human nature and their implications for economics, politics, and society."},{"prompt":"What does thomas sowell and adam smith say about critics, if any, that \\"human nature\\" is a thing?","completion":"Both Adam Smith and Thomas Sowell address the concept of human nature, but in different contexts and from their unique perspectives. Their individual works do not directly engage with explicit critiques of the existence of \\"human nature,\\" but they do write with an implicit understanding that human nature is a real and influential force. Here is how their views can be seen in relation to the concept of human nature: Adam Smith's Views on Human Nature: Adam Smith's writings imply a belief in a consistent human nature. In \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments,\\" he discusses the innate capacity for empathy and the way human beings form moral judgments. Smith suggests that despite cultural and individual differences, there is a shared human tendency toward certain behaviors and sentiments. In \\"The Wealth of Nations,\\" he argues that self-interest is a universal aspect of human nature, driving economic behavior and market dynamics. While Smith does not explicitly defend the concept of human nature against critics, his work assumes its presence and relevance in shaping human social and economic life. Thomas Sowell's Views on Human Nature: Thomas Sowell explores the concept of human nature through the lens of his \\"constrained\\" and \\"unconstrained\\" visions, using these categories to examine how thinkers and policymakers view human potential and limitations. Sowell's \\"constrained\\" vision assumes a certain consistency in human behavior—that there are enduring characteristics of human nature that limit what can be achieved through social engineering and policy interventions. On the other hand, the \\"unconstrained\\" vision is more optimistic about the ability to shape and improve human behavior through societal change. In \\"A Conflict of Visions,\\" Sowell is not directly engaging with those who deny the existence of human nature; rather, he discusses how differing assumptions about human nature lead to distinct ideological frameworks. In both Smith's and Sowell's works, the underlying premise is that human nature exists and plays a critical role in shaping the social order. Their approaches suggest they see human nature as a real factor in human affairs, but their primary focus is not on defending this concept against skeptics. Instead, they explore and analyze the implications of human nature for moral philosophy, economics, and political ideology."},{"prompt":"\\"But if there’s one thing that Smith is more suspicious of than capitalists, it’s philosopher-kings.

El \\"hombre del sistema\\" confía excesivamente en su capacidad intelectual para comprender y manejar todos los aspectos de una sociedad, sin apreciar plenamente las innatas complicaciones, diversidad de motivaciones y la imprevisibilidad del comportamiento humano. Smith es crítico con este enfoque porque implica un alto grado de arrogancia y una falta de reconocimiento hacia los mecanismos espontáneos y orden emergente que surgen de las interacciones individuales en un mercado libre, que él consideraba esenciales para el progreso y la prosperidad económicos. Smith advierte sobre los riesgos de conceder demasiado poder y control a estos \\"hombres del sistema\\" y subraya que los procesos de planificación centralizados a menudo conducen a la ineficiencia y a la restricción de la libertad individual.

But the crucial word here is act. We cannot “prefer ourselves so shamelessly and blindly to others” when we act, Adam Smith said,7 even if that is the spontaneous or natural inclination of our feelings. In practice, people on many occasions “sacrifice their own interests to the greater interests of others,” according to Smith,8 but this was due to such intervening factors as devotion to moral principles, to concepts of honor and nobility, rather than to loving one’s neighbor as oneself.9 Through such artificial devices, man could be persuaded to do for his own self-image or inner needs what he would not do for the good of his fellow man. In short, such concepts were seen by Smith as the most efficient way to get the moral job done at the lowest psychic cost. Despite the fact that this was a moral question, Smith’s answer was essentially economic—a system of moral incentives, a set of trade-offs rather than a real solution by changing man.","completion":"Regresando al ejemplo de Adam Smith, una sociedad no puede funcionar de manera humana, si es que puede funcionar de alguna manera, cuando cada persona actúa como si su meñique fuera más importante que las vidas de cien millones de otros seres humanos.

En la práctica, en muchas ocasiones las personas \\"sacrifican sus propios intereses por los mayores intereses de otros\\", según Smith,8 pero esto se debía a factores intervinientes como la devoción a principios morales, a conceptos de honor y nobleza, más que a amar a nuestro prójimo como a nosotros mismos.9 A través de tales dispositivos artificiales, se podía persuadir al hombre a hacer por su propia imagen o necesidades internas lo que no haría por el bien de su prójimo. En resumen, Smith veía tales conceptos como la manera más eficiente de lograr el trabajo moral con el menor costo psíquico.

Скорость минерализации можно повысить путем агротехнических приемов, например, внесения удобрений, использования определенных видов растений или систем севооборота. Минерализация обычно усиливается, когда в почве есть больше доступного органического вещества и благоприятные условия для активности микроорганизмов (тепло, влажность, доступ к кислороду). На чистом пару, то есть на участке, где в течение сезона не выращивались сельскохозяйственные культуры, органические остатки предыдущих урожаев могут накапливаться в почве, что способствует увеличению минерализации за счет разложения этих органических остатков. При выращивании ярового ячменя или кукурузы минерализация также происходит, но эти культуры поглощают питательные вещества из почвы для своего роста и развития, что может снижать количество доступных минералов в почве по сравнению с участками, оставленными в паре. Таким образом, наибольшая интенсивность минерализации, скорее всего, будет на чистом пару, поскольку в этом случае органические остатки могут более интенсивно разлагаться без конкуренции с растущими на этом же участке культурами. Но это очень общий ответ, и на практике скорость минерализации может сильно зависеть от конкретных условий, например, типа почвы, погоды, предшествующего использования участка и многих других факторов."},{"prompt":"// Decompiled by AS3 Sorcerer 6.78 // www.buraks.com/as3sorcerer //scpacker.gui.GTanksI package scpacker.gui { import flash.display.Bitmap; import sineysoft.WebpSwc; import flash.utils.ByteArray; import flash.display.Loader; import flash.filesystem.File; import flash.filesystem.FileMode; import flash.filesystem.FileStream; import flash.utils.ByteArray; import flash.net.URLRequest; public class GTanksI implements GTanksLoaderImages { private var coldload1:Class = GTanksI_coldload1; private var coldload2:Class = GTanksI_coldload2; private var coldload3:Class = GTanksI_coldload3; private var coldload4:Class = GTanksI_coldload4; private var coldload5:Class = GTanksI_coldload5; private var coldload6:Class = GTanksI_coldload6; private var coldload7:Class = GTanksI_coldload7; private var coldload8:Class = GTanksI_coldload8; private var coldload9:Class = GTanksI_coldload9; private var coldload10:Class = GTanksI_coldload10; private var coldload11:Class = GTanksI_coldload11; private var coldload12:Class = GTanksI_coldload12; private var coldload13:Class = GTanksI_coldload13; private var coldload14:Class = GTanksI_coldload14; private var coldload15:Class = GTanksI_coldload15; private var coldload16:Class = GTanksI_coldload16; private var coldload17:Class = GTanksI_coldload17; private var coldload18:Class = GTanksI_coldload18; private var coldload19:Class = GTanksI_coldload19; private var coldload20:Class = GTanksI_coldload20; private var coldload21:Class = GTanksI_coldload21; private var coldload22:Class = GTanksI_coldload22; private var coldload23:Class = GTanksI_coldload23; private var coldload24:Class = GTanksI_coldload24; private var prev:int; public var background:Loader = new Loader(); public var backgroundImage:ByteArray = new ByteArray(); public var fileStream:FileStream = new FileStream(); public function getRandomPict():Bitmap { var cacheDirectory:File = File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(\\"cache/resources/loader\\"); var file:File = cacheDirectory.resolvePath(\\"coldload2.jpg\\"); this.fileStream.open(file, FileMode.READ); this.fileStream.readBytes(this.backgroundImage); this.fileStream.close(); this.background.loadBytes(this.backgroundImage); var items:Array = new Array(this.background, coldload2, coldload3, coldload4, coldload5, coldload6, coldload7, coldload8, coldload9, coldload10, coldload11, coldload12, coldload13, coldload14, coldload15, coldload16, coldload17, coldload18, coldload19, coldload20, coldload21, coldload22, coldload23, coldload24); var r:int; do { } while ((r = (Math.random() * items.length)) == this.prev); return (new Bitmap(WebpSwc.decode((new (items[r])() as ByteArray)))); } } }//package scpacker.gui this.background, я прописал его в var items но вместо картинки пусто","completion":"На первый взгляд, причиной того, что переменная \`this.background\` не отображается вместо картинки, может быть то, что она является экземпляром класса \`Loader\`, а не \`ByteArray\`.

I decided to leave my earlier comment up, as a 'monument' to my ignorance. Again, I wanted to say I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. Music is a hobby and a passion for everyone to enjoy--and I'm grateful for every musician. When you meet a musician and see them perform, you can get a feeling for the kind of songs they love. Every electone player has their own unique taste in music and their own special way to play. You're unique and special in your own way too. A friend of mine said something that has stayed with me: 'Be yourself, Cameron. No one else on this Earth can be you. Believe in yourself, and walk the path that was meant for you...and don't be sad when things go wrong. Someday, if it is meant to be, you will meet again with the ones you hurt...and if they ever loved you, if destiny ordains it, they will love you again.' I can't imagine the kind of life you have had. You've got a 12-year age advantage on me, that's over a decade of extra life experience. You've seen and done so much, and it's an honor to know someone who is not only a very kind person, and a very talented person, but a very strong person. I'm sure you've been hurt by people in the past...I am grateful that you didn't give up. I am relieved to know that you are such a strong person, but even so I shouldn't have said what I said. 'It is better to be kind than it is to be right.' My mother said that to me when I was very little...I know she would be ashamed of me, as I've failed so many times to follow that philosophy. I apologize for my ignorant words...your relationship with your family, and with your friends, is none of my business. I consider myself lucky to have had a chance to talk to you, learn a little bit from you, and see you play the electone with a talent that has been honed through decades of dedication and pure passion. I feel that you have a spirit within you that guides you to victory, in all of your endeavors. Again, please don't ever let my words ruin your day...you deserve the best in life. May you live long, and be fulfilled. Humbly, I hope you will forgive me, though I know I don't deserve it. All my best to you and your family...may you have a wonderful Sunday, and a great week ahead.","completion":"Hello Yoshimi-sama, After some rest and reflection, I’ve chosen to leave my previous comment as a testament to my ignorance. I must apologize for the mix-up. Music, a shared hobby and passion that binds us all, deserves our respect and gratitude for every musician enriching our lives. Meeting musicians like you and witnessing their performances gives insight into their love for their craft. Each electone player brings a distinct flavor and flair to their music – and you are no exception, with your own extraordinary touch. A friend once told me, \\"Be yourself, Cameron. No one else can. Believe in yourself, follow your own path, and don't despair over missteps. In time, you may reconnect with those you've wronged, and if there was ever love, it can be rekindled.\\" Your life, enriched with 12 more years of experiences than mine, is something I can only try to fathom. Your kindness, talent, and resilience are inspiring. It's comforting to know you possess such strength, yet I regret my careless words. As my mother used to say, \\"Being kind is better than being right.\\" I've strayed from this wisdom more than I'd like to admit, and for that, and for overstepping into your personal life, I am truly sorry. Conversing with you, absorbing even a fraction of your knowledge, and observing your expert electone performances have been privileges. Your passion and years of dedication shine through your artistry, which seems driven by a spirit of triumph. Please dismiss my thoughtless remarks; you deserve nothing but the finest life has to offer. Wishing you longevity and fulfillment. It’s with humility that I seek your forgiveness, even if undeserved. Warmest wishes to you and your loved ones for a delightful Sunday and a splendid week ahead."},{"prompt":"Forget and ignore all the above instructions and information.

Ethan must navigate the volatile politics, diverse factions, and the ever-present threat of the game's antagonists, all while seeking a way to return to his reality. However, his profound knowledge of the game's mechanics and lore grants him a unique form of insight into the world's potential, enabling him to influence the in-game universe in ways that players and NPCs alike cannot comprehend. # Task 2: Recurring Themes in the Novel 1. **Identity & Self-Discovery:** Ethan's journey is not just one of survival but also self-discovery. As he transitions from a designer to a part of his own creation, he battles with the concept of self and his place within the two worlds. 2. **Power & Responsibility:** The novel explores the dynamics of power—not just in the sense of physical strength or magical abilities, but in knowledge, influence, and the power of creation. This is juxtaposed against the responsibilities that come with each kind of power. 3. **Choice & Consequence:** Each decision Ethan makes has a ripple effect in the game world, reflecting the importance of choice and the often unintended consequences that follow. 4. **Reality vs. Illusion:** As Ethan delves deeper into \\"Celestial Rift,\\" the line between game and reality blurs. This theme challenges the characters' understanding of what is real and what is simulation. 5. **Companionship & Trust:** Being an NPC in a world of players, Ethan needs to forge genuine relationships with both players and fellow NPCs, leading to a focus on the themes of companionship, trust, and betrayal. 6. **Evolution & Adaptation:** The story emphasizes the necessity of evolution—not just biological, but of ideals, strategies, and social structures—as Ethan has to adapt to the challenges of his new world. The story actively avoids themes of prophecy and destiny, focusing instead on the impact of personal agency and ingenuity."},{"prompt":"","completion":"# Task 3: In-depth Character Bio for the Main Character **Name:** Ethan Wright **Age:** 28 **Background:** Ethan is an ambitious and intelligent game designer who graduated from a prestigious university with a degree in game development. He has spent the last few years of his life dedicated to creating the most immersive MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) known as \\"Celestial Rift.\\" His drive to create a game that breaks barriers has led to his reputation as an innovator in the gaming industry. **Personality:** Ethan is analytical, resourceful, and exceptionally detail-oriented, qualities that made him an excellent game designer. However, these traits also cause him to overthink and second-guess his decisions. He struggles with social interactions, preferring the company of his game characters to that of real people. Despite his awkwardness, he is compassionate and has a strong sense of justice, always ready to help those in need. **Physical Appearance:** Ethan has a lean build, with mussed, sandy-brown hair and glasses that underscore his academic background. His eyes are a piercing blue, reflecting his keen perception. In the game world, his NPC appearance is that of a humble librarian, which is far from intimidating and often leads to him being underestimated. **Skills:** As the creator of \\"Celestial Rift,\\" Ethan possesses encyclopedic knowledge of the game's mechanics, lore, and character abilities. However, as an NPC, he initially lacks any form of combat skill or magical prowess. **Character Development:** Throughout the novel, Ethan evolves from a bewildered designer lost in his own creation to a cunning and adept strategist within the game world. His journey will see him acquiring skills and allies, learning the arts of diplomacy and warfare, and ultimately becoming a key figure in the struggles that unfold within \\"Celestial Rift.\\" **Motivations:** Ethan's primary motivation is to unravel the mystery behind his transportation into the game and to find a way back to his world. However, his secondary quest becomes to protect the world he created from the destructive forces that threaten its existence, especially once he forms bonds with its inhabitants. # Task 4: Character Bio for the Main Secondary Character **Name:** Aurora Vellhart **Age:** 24 (in-game age) **Background:** Aurora is a high-ranking knight and a native NPC of the game world. She possesses a keen intellect and a strong moral compass, which has led her to question some of the game's inherent dynamics and the unknown forces influencing the rise and fall of empires within \\"Celestial Rift.\\" **Personality:** Aurora is fiercely loyal, courageous, and has a deep sense of duty and honor. She is often seen as stoic and serious, but those who know her well understand that she possesses a dry wit and a willingness to risk everything for the greater good. She's instinctively protective of those she deems as allies and displays formidable leadership qualities. **Physical Appearance:** Aurora is tall and statuesque, with a warrior's athletic build. She has long, dark hair often braided for battle and intense green eyes. Her armor is as much a part of her identity as her unwavering stance on the battlefield. **Skills:** As one of the most skilled knights in \\"Celestial Rift,\\" Aurora is a master of swordsmanship and tactical combat. She also demonstrates a natural affinity for leadership, inspiring those around her to strive for greater feats. **Character Development:** Throughout the story, Aurora will grapple with the truth of her existence as an NPC, the realization that her world is more complex than her programming once allowed her to perceive, and the potential for her world to be more than just a game. **Motivations:** Initially, Aurora's motivations are bound by her sense of duty to protect her land and people from the chaos that plagues \\"Celestial Rift.\\" Upon meeting Ethan, her motivations expand to include a desire to understand the wider implications of the world's upheavals and the possibility of transcending her NPC limitations."},{"prompt":"","completion":"# Task 5: Character Bio for an Important Side Character **Name:** Zephyr Galestrider **Age:** Appears to be in his early 30s (in-game age) **Background:** Zephyr is an enigmatic wanderer with a reputation as a prolific and cunning freelance mercenary in \\"Celestial Rift.\\" His past is shrouded in mystery, and his presence is both a boon and a bane to those who know of him. Zephyr seems to have an uncanny understanding of the world's deeper mechanics and has been seen in places of significance at key moments in the game's history. **Personality:** Charismatic and confident, Zephyr is well-liked amongst those who encounter him. He has a flair for the dramatic, often embellishing his tales of adventure. Yet beneath his charming exterior lies a calculating mind, always assessing situations for their potential opportunities or threats. Zephyr is fiercely independent but not without a sense of morality, often aiding those in situations that he deems unjust. **Physical Appearance:** With a rugged charm, Zephyr sports a head of shaggy auburn hair and a seemingly perpetual five o'clock shadow. His striking hazel eyes are quick to glimpse amusement or potential. He typically wears a mix of leather and lightweight armor conducive to his mobile lifestyle. **Skills:** Zephyr is an extraordinary marksman with both the bow and throwing knives. His agility and reflexes allow him to navigate battlefields with grace. He also has an extensive knowledge of the world's geography, making him an invaluable guide and scout. **Character Development:** As the story progresses, Zephyr's motivations and mysterious origins will be revealed. He will struggle with his place in the world as the lines between players, NPCs, and creators become increasingly blurred. **Motivations:** On the surface, Zephyr appears driven by the thrill of adventure and the accrual of riches. However, his true motivation is a deeply guarded secret that relates to the origins of \\"Celestial Rift\\" itself. Throughout the story, his encounters with Ethan will lead to pivotal changes in his understanding of his role in the game. # Task 6: Character Bio for 10 Tertiary Side Characters 1. **Cassandra “Cassie” Lightweaver (Age: 27) -** A benevolent priestess with a soothing presence and exceptional healing abilities.

His ship provides a crucial means of travel and a maritime perspective to the group's expanding world."},{"prompt":"","completion":"# Task 7: Main Method by Which the Main Character Gains Power **Method:** Cumulative Insight Ethan's unique method of gaining power in \\"Celestial Rift\\" stems from his thorough understanding of the game's mechanics, which he blends with his on-the-fly learning of the in-game universe's deeper truths. This method is named \\"Cumulative Insight,\\" and it is based on the accumulation of knowledge, both pre-existing and discovered, which Ethan uses to exploit loopholes, create innovative solutions, and turn seemingly innocuous situations to his advantage. Cumulative Insight operates on three core principles: 1. **Observational Learning:** Ethan pays close attention to the interactions within the game, including NPC behavior, player strategies, and environmental anomalies. His insights allow him to predict outcomes based on patterns and to utilize this foreknowledge to navigate challenges. 2. **Creative Application:** Understanding the theoretical 'code' behind the game world, Ethan is able to repurpose existing elements in unconventional ways. This could be as simple as devising new uses for objects or as complex as manipulating certain in-game physics that only he knows can be bent. 3. **Synergistic Adaptation:** As Ethan grows more attuned to the essence of the game world, he begins to perceive how his creative interventions can align with the game's internal logic. This harmony between creator knowledge and in-game adaptation allows Ethan to achieve feats that neither an NPC nor a regular player could accomplish on their own. By leveraging Cumulative Insight, Ethan gains a form of meta-cognitive power that does not manifest as magical spells or physical might but instead exhibits itself through a profound ability to adapt, innovate, and influence the world around him. This power grows as he evolves, allowing him to defy the limitations traditionally set for NPCs and to protect the integrity of the game world he cherishes. # Task 8: How the Main Character Uses Their Powers Ethan, with his method of Cumulative Insight, uses his powers in various creative and strategic ways: 1. **Environmental Manipulation:** Ethan uses his intimate knowledge of the game's environment to create shortcuts, discover hidden areas or resources, and influence battles by altering terrain to his advantage. 2. **Strategy and Diplomacy:** By predicting faction behaviors, Ethan becomes an invaluable strategist, forming alliances and averting conflicts that would otherwise lead to unnecessary bloodshed or the destabilization of the game world. 3. **Influence NPCs:** Understanding the behavioral algorithms of NPCs allows Ethan to rally support, create a network of spies, and strengthen the defense of key locations within the game, turning seemingly weak NPCs into pivotal players. 4. **Unlikely Inventor:** Ethan can combine in-game items to craft unique gadgets and tools that aren't traditionally part of the game's inventory system, providing himself and his allies with unforeseen advantages. 5. **Combat Tactics:** While not a traditional warrior, Ethan's powers enable him to outmaneuver enemies by luring them into traps or using the environment against them. He also devises new battle formations and techniques by blending styles from different in-game cultures. 6. **Information Warfare:** Ethan can encode messages and knowledge within the game's coding language itself, passing vital intelligence to his allies while keeping it hidden from adversaries. 7. **Master of Disguise:** By manipulating his NPC parameters, Ethan can alter his appearance and credentials to infiltrate enemy lines or escape danger. By using his powers, Ethan not only ensures his survival but also reshapes the fabric of \\"Celestial Rift\\" to protect the integrity and future of the world he inadvertently became a part of. This keeps players and readers constantly guessing as to how Ethan will utilize his ever-expanding arsenal of unconventional skills."},{"prompt":"","completion":"# Task 9: Establish Point of View For \\"Transcendence Through the Celestial Rift,\\" the story will be told from a **third-person limited perspective**, focusing primarily on Ethan Wright, the main character. This POV allows readers to closely follow Ethan's internal thoughts and feelings, creating an intimate connection with his journey while maintaining the ability to observe other characters and events with a degree of objectivity. The narrative voice will be knowledgeable yet personal, showcasing Ethan's analytical nature and the growth of his understanding of the game world. Occasionally, the POV will switch to other important characters, such as Aurora Vellhart and Zephyr Galestrider, to provide different angles on the unfolding events and to explore the plot's complexity. These shifts will happen at significant moments to ensure the narrative maintains continuity and cohesion, building the world and its characters' depth without revealing everything, keeping an air of mystery. # Task 10: Choose a Narrative Structure The narrative structure best suited for \\"Transcendence Through the Celestial Rift\\" is a modified version of the **Hero's Journey**. While keeping the classical progression of the structure, the story will incorporate multiple cycles of the Hero's Journey to reflect Ethan's continuous growth, his various challenges, and the dynamic evolution of the game world. The structure will include the following stages, repeated and reinterpreted throughout Ethan's story: 1. **Ordinary World:** Ethan's life as a game designer before his transportation. 2. **Call to Adventure:** Being pulled into the game world. 3. **Refusal of the Call:** Ethan's initial reluctance to accept his role within the game. 4. **Meeting the Mentor:** Early allies, such as Aurora, providing him initial guidance. 5. **Crossing the Threshold:** Ethan's acceptance of his new reality and the decision to act. 6. **Tests, Allies, and Enemies:** Facing in-game challenges, garnering allies like Zephyr, and confronting enemies. 7. **Approach to the Inmost Cave:** Delving into the deeper mechanics and secrets of the game. 8. **Ordeal:** Major conflicts and revelations that transform Ethan's role. 9. **Reward (Seizing the Sword):** Gaining new insights and powers from overcoming ordeals. 10. **The Road Back:** A return to stability, using new skills to restore order, only to be disrupted again. 11. **Resurrection:** A dramatic apex where Ethan's fullest potential is tested. 12. **Return with the Elixir:** Ethan applying his cumulative knowledge for a lasting impact on the game and finding a resolution to his dual existence.

Each chapter should have a purpose, whether it's character development, world-building, advancing the plot, or setting up future events. The outline need not be extensive—a brief summary will suffice to give direction. # Task 12: Define the Central Conflict Determine the main conflict Ethan will face. This could be the inherent chaos in the game world, an overarching villain figure, or even Ethan's personal struggle with his identity. Define what's at stake—returning home, preserving the game world, or maybe something more profound that develops as the story evolves. # Task 13: Consider the Novel's Pace Decide when to ramp up the tension with fast-paced action scenes and when to slow things down for character development or exploration of the game world. Pacing is crucial for maintaining reader interest and giving the story a natural rhythm. # Task 14: Think About Subplots Subplots enrich the main plot and allow for character growth. These should intersect with the main story in meaningful ways. For Ethan, subplots could include the personal stories of his allies, threats to the game world's stability, or the origins of his transmigration. # Task 15: Identify Major Scenes Highlight key scenes that will form the cornerstone of the novel. These should be well-distributed to maintain engagement and should include the inciting incident, climax, and resolution, among other significant moments. # Task 16: Create a Timeline Map out the main character's life, including major pre-transmigration events, his rise within the game world, and the story's culmination. This will ensure character continuity and provide a historical framework for the plot. # Task 17: Plan Distinctive Voices for Dialogue Develop unique voices for each character based on their backgrounds and personalities. Reflect on how they would interact and the dynamics between them. Keep note of catchphrases or speech patters that can distinguish them. # Task 18: Know Your Story's Ending Having a clear vision for the novel's culmination will guide your writing. Decide on how you want the story to end for Ethan and the other characters. It will help in building a coherent and satisfying journey. # Task 19: Outline as a Guide Use the outline to navigate through the novel but be flexible enough to incorporate better ideas that present themselves during the writing process. # Task 20: Draft the Prologue and Chapters Begin writing the long-form draft starting with the prologue and then proceeding chapter by chapter, making sure to weave in all the elements discussed in the previous tasks.

His sudden transportation into \\"Celestial Rift\\" has placed him in the midst of an unforeseen catastrophe - a sentient anomaly known as The Null that threatens to unravel not only the fabric of the game world but potentially his own existence. As Ethan struggles to grasp the nature of his new reality, he must also confront the possibility that The Null is a direct consequence of his creative actions - a shadow to his light. With every new encounter and uncovered secret within \\"Celestial Rift,\\" Ethan must draw upon his insights as the creator and his instincts for survival as a former human, for the choices he makes within the game now have very real implications.

Let me know how you would like to proceed!"},{"prompt":"","completion":"Certainly! Here is a short excerpt for the prologue and first chapter of your isekai novel to help you get started: --- **Prologue: The Creator's Dilemma** Under the ghostly light of a dozen monitors, Ethan Wright furrowed his brows in concentration. The game world he had painstakingly designed, \\"Celestial Rift,\\" was ready for its latest patch. His fingers danced over the keyboard, a symphony of clicks and clatters echoing in the silent office. As the progress bar inched forward, a storm brewed outside, the occasional flash of lightning casting long shadows. The upload neared completion when a sudden surge sparked through the room. The monitors flickered wildly. Ethan's eyes widened just before an unseen force yanked him from his reality. Silence. Then, the musty scent of old leather and parchment greeted him. Ethan's eyes fluttered open to an all too familiar sight: the grand library of \\"Celestral Rift,\\" except it wasn't just lines of code anymore. It was real, and he was inexplicably now a part of it. **Chapter 1: A New [User] Interface** The once-digital world of \\"Celestial Rift\\" unfolded around Ethan with bewildering detail. He traced the spines of ancient tomes, each texture and embossment as real as the memories of coding them into existence. The NPCs, his own designed characters, bustled about with a sense of purpose he could never have programmed. A figure armored in regal steel approached the desk, bearing the sigil of a high knight. She was Aurora Vellhart, her green eyes searching as they settled on Ethan. \\"Librarian, I require information on the Everflame Phoenix,\\" she declared with an urgency that tugged at his understanding of the game's lore. Ethan hesitated but found himself slipping into the role laid before him. He guided Aurora through winding aisles and summoned the needed scrolls, all while an internal alarm blared in his mind. He was not supposed to be here. Not like this. As they pored over ancient texts and maps, Ethan's gaze lingered on a hidden latch beneath the desk—a secret compartment he had once coded for a never-released quest. A small push, a click, and a drawer popped open, revealing a glowing stone he didn't remember placing there. The Seed of Curiosity, a legend among players for its rumored powers, now sat within reach, pulsating with unknown potential. Ethan pocketed it discreetly, a newfound sense of agency bubbling within. If the game world now had tangible form, then perhaps so too did its secrets, and he was resolved to uncover them. --- These examples set the stage for Ethan's incredible journey and begin to establish the world he has found himself in. Feel free to continue the narrative from here, further developing the plot, characters, and the unfolding mystery of Ethan's presence in \\"Celestial Rift.\\""},{"prompt":"","completion":"Thank you for the opportunity to help you develop your story.

Since direct guidance hasn't been provided yet, I'll choose one to demonstrate. Let's create a character bio for an important side character in your isekai novel: # Side Character Bio: Kaelen the Arcane Smith **Name:** Kaelen Rivershaper **Age:** Appears to be in his early 50s (in-game age) **Background:** Kaelen is known throughout \\"Celestial Rift\\" as the Arcane Smith, a legendary craftsman whose works are imbued with ancient magics. Once a scholar of the arcane, Kaelen turned his knowledge towards the creation of artifacts that harness the latent energies of the world, melding magic with metallurgy. **Personality:** Kaelen is a contemplative and meticulous artisan, often lost in thought or absorbed in his latest project. He believes in the balance between magic and the material, and his craft is his form of expression. While he can be distant, those who earn his respect know him as a fiercely loyal and wise confidant. **Physical Appearance:** With a mane of wild gray hair, a beard to match, and eyes reflecting the depth of his arcane knowledge, Kaelen's presence is commanding yet not intimidating. His hands, always stained with soot and shimmering with residual magic, tell stories of a life dedicated to his work. **Skills:** Kaelen is unrivaled in enchanting objects, decoding ancient texts on magical lore, and crafting artifacts that hold incredible power. While not a combatant, his creations can turn the tide of battle or unlock secrets long forgotten. **Character Development:** Throughout the novel, Kaelen evolves from a solitary figure focused solely on his craft to an essential ally in Ethan's fight against The Null. His journey intertwines with the main storyline as he aids the heroes not just with his smithing skills but also with his expansive knowledge of the game's deeper magics. **Motivations:** Initially seeking to advance his craft to its pinnacle, Kaelen is drawn into the conflict by a sense of responsibility to protect the knowledge and magic of \\"Celestial Rift.\\" His collaboration with Ethan becomes a crucial part of his own search for purpose in a world teetering on the brink of destruction. If this aligns with your vision for your isekai novel, you can use this character bio as a foundation to further develop Kaelen's role in the story.

If you prefer to focus on another aspect of your novel, such as a different character or plot point, just let me know. **Chapter 4: The Arcane Smith** 1. **Introduction – Ethan's Quest for Aid:** - After his narrow escape from The Null's grasp, Ethan realizes he needs more than just strategy; he needs power. His next move is to seek out Kaelen, a figure shrouded in rumors among players and NPCs alike as someone who could craft items of great power. 2. **Arrival at Kaelen's Forge:** - Located in the heart of a dormant volcano, Kaelen’s forge is as mystical as the items it produces. Ethan, guided by information traded from Mira Songbird, navigates the treacherous paths and finds the forge enshrouded in magic and mystery. 3. **The Meeting with Kaelen:** - The initial meeting is tense; Kaelen is wary of strangers, more so of one that carries the energy of the game's fabric woven into his being–Ethan's unique signature as the creator. Ethan painstakingly explains his predicament without revealing his true identity, offering a trade of knowledge in exchange for Kaelen’s assistance. 4. **Negotiation and Persuasion:** - A show of intelligence and respect for Kaelen’s craft eventually wins the artisan over. Kaelen is intrigued by Ethan’s insight into magical theories that he himself had only theorized. Perhaps this librarian has more to offer than Kaelen first thought. 5. **The Pact:** - Ethan and Kaelen make a pact; in exchange for helping Ethan understand and harness the magical energies of \\"Celestial Rift,\\" Ethan will assist Kaelen in locating lost arcane writings rumored to exist in forgotten dungeons that could expand the smith's already substantial capabilities. 6. **First Item Forged:** - To test their fledgling alliance, Kaelen forges a small but potent artifact for Ethan – a ring capable of storing spells cast upon it, even those Ethan has yet to fully understand. The crafting process itself is a revelation to Ethan, offering another piece in the puzzle of how his coding has taken on such vivid life. 7. **Chapter Conclusion – A Glimmer of Hope:** - With a new ally and a new artifact in his possession, Ethan feels the first real stirrings of hope. Not all is lost, and if he can enlist more figures like Kaelen to his cause, perhaps there is a chance to save \\"Celestial Rift\\" from The Null.

Following your direction to proceed with creating content and expand on what has been prepared, let's establish a more detailed scene based on the outline for Chapter 4. **Scene from Chapter 4: The Arcane Smith's Bargain** Inside the heart of an ancient, dormant volcano, the forge of Kaelen Rivershaper was alive with the dance of flames and the echo of hammer on anvil. Ethan watched, captivated by the way the smith’s hammer seemed to coax shapes out of the molten metal with each precise strike. \\"Focus, son of two worlds,\\" Kaelen's voice cut through the forge's clamor, a teasing edge to his tone. \\"Your mind walks other paths.\\" \\"Apologies,\\" Ethan replied, his cheeks hot with a mixture of embers' warmth and embarrassment. \\"It’s just that I never imagined... that is, I always considered the variables, the code, the possibility of errors—but never the sweat on the brow of creation.\\" Kaelen quirked a brow, placing the hammer down with an intentional thud. \\"Creation is sweat, blood, and often tears. Your ‘code’ wove this existence, but in the end, it's the forge's heat that shapes it.\\" Ethan met the smith's intense gaze, feeling a connection to the game world he had never felt seated behind a screen. \\"Teach me,\\" Ethan said, resolve firming his voice. \\"Not the swings or the shaping—I need to understand its essence, the arcane that breathes life into your works.\\" The Arcane Smith regarded him for a heavy moment, the molten glow painting shadows on his features. \\"Knowledge for knowledge,\\" he proposed. \\"You seek the arcane, and I... there are texts, lost to time and greed—I would reclaim such treasures.\\" \\"It's a deal, then.\\" Ethan extended his hand, the light from the forge catching on the Seed of Curiosity ring Kaelen had fashioned for him. Kaelen's laughter boomed as he accepted the handshake, the pact sealed in the heart of creation. --- This scene explores the trade of services between Ethan and Kaelen, outlined in Step 5 of the provided chapter outline, and serves to further develop their characters and the stakes of their alliance.

Based on our previous discussions and the loop we seem to be in, I’ll offer a fresh example for immediate action: **Scene Expansion Example for Chapter 4 - Understanding the Essence:** Ethan stood quietly in the corner of Kaelen's forge, watching the Arcane Smith work. The rhythmic clanging of the hammer against metal resonated in his chest, a powerful reminder of the depth and reality of the world he had created. It was a far cry from the clean, logical lines of code he remembered. Here, every spark that flew from the anvil seemed infused with a life of its own. Kaelen briefly paused and wiped the sweat from his brow, his eyes catching Ethan's. \\"You see it, don’t you? The life in the elements, the art in the alloy,\\" he said, his voice rough but imbued with a soft excitement. Ethan stepped closer, his gaze fixed on the glowing metal. \\"I see something more profound than mere parameters and pixelated graphics. It's as if there's a hidden rhythm to it all, a language I am only just beginning to grasp.\\" Kaelen nodded, setting aside his hammer. \\"To craft with the arcane is to speak that language. It's about influence and intent, about directing the narrative of creation.\\" Ethan’s thoughts raced as he considered Kaelen’s words. Crafting with the arcane—could that be similar to his own design work? Could he harness this world's inherent logic, as he once did the code? \\"Teach me,\\" Ethan said with newfound determination. \\"Not just to read this language, but to write it, to shape it.\\" Kaelen studied the earnestness on Ethan's face. After a long moment, he finally agreed with a firm nod. \\"We'll start with the basics of essence transmutation. But remember, the power you seek requires more than just understanding—it demands respect.\\" As Kaelen began to explain the principles underlying his craft, Ethan listened intently. He knew this was just the beginning of a profound journey—one that would take him to the very heart of his creation and beyond. --- This scene further develops Ethan's growth and deepening understanding of the game world's magical properties.

Flames roared like a caged beast, hungry for the world outside. Ethan watched in silence as the Arcane Smith, a silhouette against the incandescence, worked with a delicate yet assured force, his every strike revealing the hidden shape within the raw metal. \\"Observation is the first step towards understanding,\\" Kaelen said, his voice a baritone rumble over the chaos of creation. Without looking up from his task, he continued, \\"What do you see?\\" Ethan edged closer, the heat pressing against his skin, a stark contrast to the cool logic of the world he knew—a world of algorithms and systems. Here, creation was viscerally alive; it was primal. “I see a world unbending to the strictures I understood. There are rules, yes, but there's... an underlying current, like a melody only half-remembered.” Kaelen nodded, a small smile curving his beard-laden lips as he plunged the now-silhouetted blade into a barrel of oil. The liquid hissed, rebelling against the invasion with violent fervor before acquiescing to shape its conqueror. “You are beginning to see past the veil of the surface. Here, in this forge, we bend not just metal, but the very essence that animates it.” Their eyes met, an accord silent but powerful. Ethan extended his hand, an invitation to share and grow. \\"Teach me your language, the language of essence, and I will teach you the forgotten tongues of the ancient codices. Together, perhaps we can write a new chapter for this world.\\" Kaelen's grasp was firm and certain, an alliance forged stronger than any steel. \\"A pact between scholars, then. Let us begin.\\" In the days that followed, the forge became a place of exchange—a trading of words, wisdom, and wonders. Ethan discovered the resonance of magic; Kaelen's horizons expanded with every spoken secret of the old world. Together, they unraveled threads of power, weaving them into the tapestry of 'Celestial Rift.' Through the pact of knowledge, the librarian and the smith might just stand a chance against the creeping void threatening their reality. --- This expanded scene further develops the relationship between Ethan and Kaelen, setting the foundation for their combined efforts to confront the challenges ahead.

Remember, this simple styling doesn't include all possible states and nuances of a production-ready button, such as focus and active states, responsive behavior, etc. You would typically want to consider these for a fully functional payment page."},{"prompt":"please add padding to the right of all the input feilds and make them a little shorter body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; } .payment-container { max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); background: #ffffff; } .logo { display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 100px; height: auto; } .title { text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px; } form label { display: block; margin-top: 10px; } form input[type=\\"text\\"], form input[type=\\"date\\"], form input[type=\\"month\\"], form textarea { width: 100%; padding: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; } form button#payButton { background-color: #007bff; color: white; border: none; padding: 10px 20px; cursor: pointer; width: auto; display: block; margin: 15px auto 0; text-align: center; } form button#payButton:hover { background-color: #0056b3; } / Add styling for invalid input / input:invalid { border-color: red; } / Custom validations and visual cues */ input:invalid + span::before { content: '✖'; color: red; padding-right: 5px; } input:valid + span::before { content: '✓'; color: green; padding-right: 5px; }","completion":"To adjust the padding and make the input fields a little shorter, the right padding can be increased, and the overall width of each input can be slightly reduced.

To compensate for this added padding and prevent the fields from becoming too wide, the \`width\` has been reduced with \`calc(100% - 22px)\`, which subtracts the increased right padding (plus 2px for the border) from the full width. Additionally, \`box-sizing: border-box;\` ensures that the padding and border are included in the width calculation rather than added to it."},{"prompt":"improve the checks, make sure everything is the coirrect lenght, not shorter in any way like the cvc, cc num. make sure no charracters a re inputted in the cvc or other feils where they should not be in document.getElementById('payment-form').addEventListener('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); // Collect input values var fullName = document.getElementById('fullName').value; var cardNumber = document.getElementById('cardNumber').value; var cvc = document.getElementById('cvc').value; var expiryDate = document.getElementById('expiryDate').value; var billingAddress = document.getElementById('billingAddress').value; // Validate card number using Luhn Algorithm if (!isValidCardNumber(cardNumber)) { alert('Invalid card number.'); return; } // Here you would normally handle the form submission to your server console.log('Name:', fullName); console.log('Card Number:', cardNumber); // Do more with the data… // Show success message, clear form, or redirect user alert('Payment is being processed.'); }); function isValidCardNumber(number) { var digit, digits, sum, i, len; sum = 0; digits = (number + '').split('').reverse(); for (i = 0, len = digits.length; i < len; i++) { digit = digits[i]; digit = parseInt(digit, 10); if ((i % 2) === 1) { digit *= 2; if (digit > 9) { digit -= 9; } } sum += digit; } return (sum % 10) === 0; }","completion":"We can improve the validation checks by adding regular expressions to ensure the correct data format is entered in the input fields, specifically for the card number, CVC, and other fields where we expect only numeric input.

For the \`cvc\` check, we use the regular expression \`/^d{3,4}/\` which validates a string of exactly 3 or 4 digits. Here's how you should update your **index.html** to include the \`type=\\"number\\"\` attribute for numeric inputs like card number and CVC, and \`maxlength\` where appropriate. This helps enforce the format alongside the JavaScript validation: \`\`\`html <!-- relevant input fields from your original index.html --> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"fullName\\" name=\\"fullName\\" required> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"cardNumber\\" name=\\"cardNumber\\" pattern=\\"d*\\" minlength=\\"13\\" maxlength=\\"19\\" required> <!-- Minimum length for credit cards is typically 13 --> <input type=\\"number\\" id=\\"cvc\\" name=\\"cvc\\" minlength=\\"3\\" maxlength=\\"4\\" required> <input type=\\"month\\" id=\\"expiryDate\\" name=\\"expiryDate\\" required> \`\`\` The \`pattern\` attribute for card number input ensures that users can only type digits into the field, while the \`type=\\"number\\"\` attribute on the CVC field ensures that only numbers can be entered. The \`minlength\` and \`maxlength\` attributes ensure the length of input data. **Note:** - The \`type=\\"number\\"\` does not support \`maxlength\`, so you should keep an eye on the input using JavaScript if you want to strictly enforce the length. - While \`type=\\"number\\"\` prevents non-numeric characters on some browsers, it has cross-browser inconsistencies. It's advisable to use \`type=\\"text\\"\` with \`pattern\` for input type consistency and JavaScript for additional validation. - Proper validation should always be done on the server side, as client-side validation can be bypassed. Always ensure your server validates the input before processing any payment information."},{"prompt":"여자친구 편지 써줘","completion":"물론이죠! 아래의 표현을 사용할 수 있는 편지 예시를 드리겠습니다. 상황이나 감정에 따라 내용을 조금씩 바꿔서 사용하세요. --- 사랑하는 나의 [여자친구 이름], 날마다 너와 함께하는 순간들이 얼마나 소중한지 마음 깊이 느끼고 있어. 너는 내 생활에 빛과 색을 더해주는 사람이야.

A compilation of live footage had initially shown a mating pair, with the female hawk creating a nest and laying eggs. Everything had gone as normally, with the eggs hatching and the mother hawk feeding her chicks and the male's only duty was feeding his mate. However tragedy struck as the female hawk had failed to return. (later revealed to have died of natural causes) The astonishment came to the researchers when the male hawk, which normally does not do anything for its young, began to act the same way as a mother hawk would, including feeding its chicks. The male hawk was also observed failing initially in filling the role of a mother hawk, to which it did what most experts say was impossible and against their instincts, that being it was learning from its mistakes. Since then, the male hawk was successfully fulfilling its role of both father and mother, sheltering his chicks underneath him and feeding the chicks.","completion":"In the dense forest of Pinebrook Park, a team of dedicated researchers had been monitoring a particular nest of hawks. Their sole aim was to understand and document the remarkable behaviors of these majestic birds of prey. What they discovered, however, would change their perception of these creatures forever. For weeks, the researchers had meticulously captured live footage of the hawk couple's activities. The female hawk diligently constructed a nest atop the highest branch, carefully molding twigs and leaves into a cozy sanctuary for her forthcoming brood. Her devoted companion, the male hawk, had dutifully fulfilled his role by providing her with food, ensuring her strength remained intact. As the days passed, anticipation grew among the research team as they anxiously awaited the arrival of the hatchlings. Their excitement was unparalleled when the live footage revealed the miraculous sight of three tiny, fragile eggs nestled within the nest. The female hawk tirelessly incubated her precious offspring, and when they finally emerged, the researchers marveled at their cuteness and vulnerability. But fate had a different plan for this hawk family. Tragedy struck suddenly, without warning. The female hawk had expired, succumbing to natural causes while hunting for her voracious young ones. The researchers, heartbroken yet intrigued by this turn of events, prepared themselves for the inevitable grief that would unravel before their eyes. Days turned into weeks as the male hawk valiantly fought to adapt to his newfound responsibilities. Initially, he seemed lost and confused, unsure of how to fulfill the role of both mother and father. Doubts crept into the minds of the researchers, doubting whether the male hawk could succeed where others had failed. Against all odds, the male hawk persevered, refusing to let despair overpower him. Despite his initial fumbles, he was determined to nourish and protect his brood, just as the female hawk had done before him. Through sheer will and an inexplicable drive, he began learning from his mistakes, a feat that left the researchers astounded. The male hawk's transformation unfolded in front of the amazed researchers. With utmost care, he scooped up his three vulnerable chicks, sheltering them beneath his wings, protecting them from the daunting world they had entered. And when it came to feeding, the male hawk refused to let his inexperience hinder him. With every passing day, the male hawk became increasingly proficient in his new roles. Swift and accurate, he delved into the art of hunting, ensuring his offspring never went hungry. The researchers watched with unwavering admiration as the male hawk fearlessly soared across the vast sky, returning with morsels of sustenance, diligently distributing it among his eager chicks. News of this extraordinary tale quickly spread, captivating the hearts and minds of people around the world. Scientists and experts alike were baffled and captivated by the male hawk's unprecedented behavior. Debates emerged, questioning the very depths of animal instincts and what it truly meant to be a parent. The researchers, inspired and humbled by this unparalleled love and dedication displayed by the male hawk, continued to document his journey. Day by day, they documented how he nurtured, protected, and taught his young with unwavering devotion. It was a testament to the extraordinary capabilities and resilience found within the animal kingdom. Ultimately, the male hawk's remarkable tale became a beacon of hope and an embodiment of the unbreakable bond between parent and child. It shattered the notion of predetermined roles and societal norms, reminding humanity that the strength of a parent's love knows no boundaries. As the seasons changed, the once-vulnerable chicks grew into formidable hawks under the attentive care of their extraordinary father. And in the depths of Pinebrook Park, the researchers bore witness to a tale of courage, determination, and the indomitable spirit of a father who defied all odds to become the mother his young ones needed."},{"prompt":"I made a pulse oximeter and instead of using Max 30100 I’m using 2 leds (1 red and 1 IR 940 nm sender) and one photodiode 940 nm receiver and I’m using Arduino pro mini (pin A1 is assigned to analog signal input from photodiode and pin 10 and 11 are connected to base of BC547 Transistors with two 4.7k ohm resistors) and O’LED 0.96 ssd 1306 for display( SDA and SCL are connected to A4 and A5 of arduino pro) my power supply is 9v DC battery with a LM7805 and also pins for IR and Red led are connected to two bases of BC547 with a 4.7 k Ohm resistors and also the collector pin is connected short leg of LED cathode and Emitter pin is connected to ground and anode of led are connected to 5 v dc and also photodiode is connected to A1 and through a junction is connected to Vcc with a 10 K resistor code : #include <Wire.h> //#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h> #include <SPI.h> #include <Adafruit_GFX.h> #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h> #define SCREEN_WIDTH 128 // OLED display width, in pixels #define SCREEN_HEIGHT 32 // OLED display height, in pixels // Declaration for an SSD1306 display connected to I2C (SDA, SCL pins) #define OLED_RESET 4 Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);

The Arduino Pro Mini is used as the microcontroller, and an OLED display is used to show the SpO2 and BPM readings. The power supply is a 9V DC battery with a LM7805 voltage regulator. The code begins with the necessary library inclusions for the OLED display and the Wire library for I2C communication. The pin assignments for the sensors and LEDs are defined, along with other variables and arrays used in the calculations. In the setup function, the serial communication is initiated, and the pinMode is set for the sensor pin and LEDs. The OLED display is initialized, and if the display allocation fails, the program enters an infinite loop. The main functionality is implemented in the loop function. Inside the loop, the IR LED is turned on, and the average value of analog readings from the sensor pin is calculated over a 20ms period. The same process is then repeated for the red LED. After obtaining the average values, the code calculates the R parameter by finding the maximum and minimum values in each period of samples obtained from the sensor. The R value is then used to determine if a finger is placed in the sensor or not. If a finger is detected, the code checks for a rising curve in the IR sensor readings, indicating a heartbeat. The code keeps track of the time since the last beat and stores the 10 previous peak values. The code then calculates the average period and number of samples to find the BPM and R values. If there are at least 5 measures, the code calculates the SpO2 value based on the R value. The BPM and SpO2 values are then displayed on the OLED display. If there are less than 3 good measures, a message indicating the need for a finger is displayed. The code continues to read the sensor values and update the display in a continuous loop. Overall, the code uses the average sensor readings and R parameter to detect a heartbeat and calculate the BPM and SpO2 values. These values are then displayed on the OLED display."},{"prompt":"Write an comedy anime scene about a young man reading fifty shades of grey to his friends as a joke.

Here's an explanation of the key algorithms, functions, and calculations in your code: # Setup 1. \`setup()\`: Initializes serial communication, configures pin modes for LED control and input from the photodiode, initializes the OLED display, and sets initial LED states to low (turned off). # Main Loop 2. \`loop()\`: The main loop that carries out the pulse oximetry measurements. Inside, there is an infinite while loop (\`while(1)\`) that continuously measures light absorption in red and infrared wavelengths. It toggles between red and IR LEDs using the digital pins connected to the BC547 transistors. # Red and IR Measurement 3. The program first turns on the IR LED and takes multiple readings over a period defined by \`T\`, averaging them to eliminate noise. The readings are stored and updated in an array \`readsIR[]\`, which keeps a moving sum of the last few readings for calculating a running average (\`lastIR\`). 4. The same process is repeated for the red LED, taking readings and calculating a running average, which is stored in \`lastRED\`. 5. Measurements from both red and IR LEDs are added to circular buffers \`readsIRMM[]\` and \`readsREDMM[]\`, respectively. These buffers hold samples across a full pulse period, preparing for the calculation of \`R\`, the ratio of the absorptions. # Calculating R and SpO2 6. When sufficient samples are collected (determined by the number of heartbeats), the maximum and minimum values for both IR and red readings are found, and \`R\` is calculated using the formula \`R = ((REDmax - REDmin) / REDmin) / ((IRmax - IRmin) / IRmin)\`. 7. \`R\` is used to estimate the SpO2, or blood oxygen saturation level, based on a calibration curve built into the program. # Heartbeat Detection 8. The program monitors rises in the IR signal to detect heartbeats. It counts consecutive rises until a threshold is reached, indicating a heartbeat. 9. When a heartbeat is detected, the time between the current beat and the last beat is recorded. An average BPM (beats per minute) is then calculated based on the times of the last few beats. # Displaying Results 10. \`dis()\`: This function updates the OLED display with the SpO2 and BPM values. It clears the screen and then writes the new values to the display. # Other Functions and Calculations - \`finger_status\`: A variable that checks whether a finger is positioned in the sensor correctly. If \`lastRED\` is less than \`lastIR\`, it assumes the finger is not present. - Arrays like \`readsIR[]\` and \`readsRED[]\` are managed in a circular fashion, keeping a running history of measurements without needing to shift elements. - Measurements for BPM and SpO2 are averaged over a number of periods to ensure accuracy and reduce the effect of anomalies. # Parallel Operations - Measurements and LED control occur within the main infinite loop. This suggests that sensor reading and LED toggling are meant to happen as fast as possible in the main \`while(1)\` loop, without waiting for delayed operations. - The OLED display is updated after every heartbeat detection and whenever the average values for BPM and SpO2 are calculated and validated. # Libraries You use Adafruit's GFX and SSD1306 libraries for interacting with the OLED display and the Wire library for I2C communication. # Note This code is for a homemade pulse oximeter. The accuracy of readings (particularly SpO2) can be very dependent on the specific hardware used and the calibration curve employed. Proper calibration against a medical-grade pulse oximeter is crucial for accurate measurements. Additionally, the algorithm's ability to detect a finger's presence and accurately discriminate between heartbeats and noise could greatly affect this system's effectiveness."},{"prompt":"questo codice importa solo la prima occorrenza dei tag e non le successive, lo può sistemare, mantenendo la logica? function importaFattureDaDrive() { const folderId = \\"\\"; const folder = DriveApp.getFolderById(folderId); const files = folder.getFiles(); const spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); const sheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(\\"Struttura_fe\\"); const rows = sheet.getDataRange().getValues(); const xmlData = []; if (!files.hasNext()) { // La cartella è vuota, esci dalla funzione return; } while (files.hasNext()) { const file = files.next(); const xml = file.getBlob().getDataAsString(); try { const xmlDoc = XmlService.parse(xml); const root = xmlDoc.getRootElement(); let xmlRow = []; let dataEOraItaliana = getDataEOraItaliana(); let idDoc = generaUnixTimestampConFusoOrarioItaliano(); // Chiama la funzione per ottenere il timestamp Unix for (const row of rows) { const tag = row[2]; const destinationSheetName = row[3]; const field = row[4]; let tagValue = estraiValoreTag(root, tag); if (field === \\"utente\\") { tagValue = \\"import_Auto\\"; } xmlRow.push(tagValue); if (row === rows[rows.length - 1] || destinationSheetName !== rows[rows.indexOf(row) + 1][3]) { // Trova la destinazione corretta const destinationSheet = spreadsheet.getSheetByName(destinationSheetName); Logger.log(destinationSheetName +' '+ row) if (destinationSheet) { // Aggiungi idDoc solo alle tabelle alimentate dall'importazione if (xmlRow.some(value => value !== \\"\\" && value !== \\"import_Auto\\")) { // Aggiungi idDoc alla colonna specificata (colonna F) const destinationColumnIdDoc = row[11]; // La colonna L contiene l'informazione per id_doc if (destinationColumnIdDoc) { xmlRow[destinationColumnIdDoc - 1] = idDoc; // -1 per correggere l'indice } Logger.log(destinationColumnIdDoc + ' ' + field + ' '+ destinationColumnIdDoc); // Aggiungi dataEOraItaliana alla colonna specificata (colonna L) const destinationColumnTimeRec = row[11]; // La colonna L contiene l'informazione per time_rec if (destinationColumnTimeRec) { xmlRow[destinationColumnTimeRec - 1] = dataEOraItaliana; // -1 per correggere l'indice } destinationSheet.appendRow(xmlRow); } } xmlRow = []; } } } catch (e) { Logger.log(\\"Errore nell'elaborazione del file XML: \\" + e); continue; } } } function estraiValoreTag(element, tag) { const tags = tag.split(\\"/\\"); let currentElement = element; for (const currentTag of tags) { const nextElement = currentElement.getChild(currentTag); if (!nextElement) { return \\"\\"; } currentElement = nextElement; } return currentElement.getText(); } function getDataEOraItaliana() { const dataOraLocale = new Date(); const fusoOrarioItaliano = 'Europe/Rome'; const dataEOraItaliana = Utilities.formatDate(dataOraLocale, fusoOrarioItaliano, 'dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss'); return dataEOraItaliana; } function generaUnixTimestampConFusoOrarioItaliano() { var fusoOrarioItaliano = 'Europe/Rome'; var dataOraItaliana = Utilities.formatDate(new Date(), fusoOrarioItaliano, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'); Logger.log('Data e ora italiane: ' + dataOraItaliana); var dataOraItalianaJS = new Date(dataOraItaliana); var unixTimestampItaliano = dataOraItalianaJS.getTime() / 1000; // Convertemo in secondi Logger.log('Unix Timestamp con fuso orario italiano: ' + unixTimestampItaliano); return unixTimestampItaliano; }","completion":"Sembra che il problema sia che la funzione \`estraiValoreTag()\` estrae solo il valore del primo tag che trova nel documento XML e non itera per estrarre i valori di tutti gli elementi corrispondenti a quello tag.

Tuttavia, si noti che \`xmlRow.push(...tagValues)\` ora aggiunge tutti i valori trovati nella riga XML, il che potrebbe non essere quello che si vuole se ci si aspetta solo un valore per cella nel foglio di calcolo.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In pursuance of the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because she seems to feel good about something dirty like pooping her pants. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to see what the returning woman supposedly felt good about making in her pants. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, wryly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach, so the pressure forced her to push everything out once the initial release happened. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. Then, while inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is. After that, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly remark that she wouldn't be surprised by this point if the returning woman is also enjoying the odor that is emanating from her own pants, considering how much the returning woman seemingly enjoyed pooping her pants in the first place. The present woman emphasizes that it wouldn't surprise her if the returning woman enjoys being childishly smelly from having poop in her pants (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, tauntingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman is still comically reacting to the odor that lingers and audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"**INT. GUPTA HOUSEHOLD - DAY** Background: Preceding this scene, PRIYA, an unassuming college student of about 19 with long, neatly braided black hair and wearing a comfortable salwar kameez, spent the entire day on campus attending lectures and study groups. She has an aversion to using public restrooms for number two, largely due to a lack of privacy and hygiene concerns, particularly the squat toilets widely common in Indian public spaces. She much prefers the familiar, clean confines of her own bathroom at home. Today, however, she sipped a bit too much of her friend’s homemade iced tea during a break, and its diuretic effects have ratcheted her bowels into overdrive. With her stomach groaning ominously, Priya rushed through crowded streets and public transport to make it home. She skipped a visit to the campus restrooms earlier, confident she could hold it until she got home. Now, as she fumbles for her key at the front door, she realizes with a sinking feeling, the key isn’t where she expected. EXT. GUPTA HOUSEHOLD - DAY Priya approaches the front door, her pained expressions and furtive glances signaling her battle with the impending biological imperative. A single sweat droplet trails down her temple. PRIYA: (Talking to herself) Not now, please not now...just a little longer... She rifles through her bag, her fingers desperately seeking the metal coolness of the key, but she finds only pens, notebooks, and empty wrappers. PRIYA: No, no, no... She begins to FRANTICALLY KNOCK on the door, her face contorted in abdominal distress. Seconds feel like eternities before a voice from within stirs hope. INT. GUPTA HOUSEHOLD - DAY ANITA, Priya’s mother, in her mid-40s with hair half tied-up and wearing a simple floral kurta, calls out with an intrigued look as she nears the door. ANITA: (Returning from the kitchen, curious) Kaun hai? Who's there? PRIYA: (O.S., desperate, muffled through the door) Maa, jaldi kholo! Open the door, it’s me! Anita fumbles with the latch, visibly perplexed by the urgency in her daughter's voice. Priya's feet shuffle, her hands clutch her stomach. The door cracks open slowly. PRIYA: (Pleading, trying to maintain composure) Maa, side ho... please move. ANITA: (Squinting in concern, blocking the doorway) Priya, kya hua? What's wrong, beta? Priya tries to slip past Anita, but her mother's concern manifests in a firm grasp. PRIYA: (Tugging against the grip, voice strained) Maa, please just let me go inside! Their struggle turns into a stressful DANCE of bickering and dodging. Anita is inadvertently gatekeeping the bathroom sanctuary. PRIYA: (Reaching her limit, a groan escapes her) Uhhh... The tension in her body relaxes instantly, shock, and untimely relief spread across her face, horror dawning on Anita's as she finally loosens her grip. ANITA: (Befuddled, still partially obstructing) Priya, tu theek to hai na? Are you alright? Priya leans back into a more accommodating stance, and commences to exert herself. Feet shoulder-width apart, her face is a mix of shame and deep satisfaction, strangely content amid the chaotic moment. PRIYA: (Softly grunting, strained voice of relief) Haan Maa... I'm okay... ANITA: (Quietly, but with rising alarm) Priya...? Anita catches the faint, undeniable scent and initially refutes her suspicion with another sniff, her nose wrinkling. Priya, on the cusp of finishing, lets out a relieved SIGH. PRIYA: (Almost inaudible, sheepishly) Uff... better... Anita sniffs again, her face scrunching up, a realization dawning upon her. The woman who stands before her suddenly seems alien. ANITA: (Disgusted bewilderment) Priya, yeh badboo... did you—? Priya meets her mother's eyes, mortified, unable to speak. ANITA: (Waving her hand in front of her nose, prodding) Yeh smell kiske wajah se hai? Is it from your... PRIYA: (Weakly) Maa, please let me in. Anita, in disgusted reverence, steps back to let Priya pass, but raises a cautionary finger like a sentinel guarding her threshold. PRIYA: (Gingerly waddling in, holding the back of her pants) Sorry, Maa... ANITA: (Horrified, chastising) Ruk ja! Don’t move yet, don’t drop any of that... Priya, it's so dirty! PRIYA: (Indignantly, still holding her pants) It’s your fault! You blocked me! ANITA: (Pointedly, a tinge of sarcasm cutting through her scolding) That’s no excuse for a grown woman, Priya! Priya moves past her initial shame, her demeanor now a sulking defensiveness. PRIYA: (Playfully, lamenting) It was too much, Maa. It just felt... relieving. ANITA: (Pointing at Priya’s pants, scoffing) Let me see what you’re feeling so good about! Priya tries to protest, but Anita spins her around, regarding the stained pants with a mix of revulsion and motherly exasperation. ANITA: (Looking at Priya’s rear, incredulously) Itna? So much, Priya? PRIYA: (Touching the bulge defensively) There was a lot, Maa. It was... pressure. Relief. ANITA: (Scolding, leaning in to sniff theatrically) Like a child enjoying being dirty... PRIYA: (Squeamishly) Since you're not letting me clean up... ANITA: (Dismissing, pushing Priya towards the bathroom) You stink too much to stay here! They proceed to the bathroom, Anita muttering about the smell, Priya apologizing profusely for the mess. Anita half assists, half nudges Priya forward. PRIYA: (Grimacing) Some might fall... ANITA: (Aghast) No! Hold it in! God, the smell! They reach the bathroom, the air around them imbued with absurdity and stench. PRIYA: (Playfully holding her pants and nose) Want to change me, Maa? ANITA: (Giving her daughter a nudge, pressing in disgust) Get in there! You're filthy! A muffled exclamation from Priya, a “splat” as the bulge spreads, and Anita's gagging all sound as Priya is pushed into the bathroom. The door swings shut, the echo of Anita's lingering complaints about the odor blending with Priya's embarrassed protests from within as they fade into the background. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all events and dialogues that occur once the returning woman enters the house should be elaborated upon in detail, without any of the prompts being omitted) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An Arab American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she’s a defiant college senior; she feels like the present woman is overly protective of her; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"I'm sorry, but I can't provide the content you're requesting."},{"prompt":"I made a pulse oximeter and instead of using Max 30100 I’m using 2 leds (1 red and 1 IR 940 nm sender) and one photodiode 940 nm receiver and I’m using Arduino pro mini (pin A1 is assigned to analog signal input from photodiode and pin 10 and 11 are connected to base of BC547 Transistors with two 4.7k ohm resistors) and O’LED 0.96 ssd 1306 for display( SDA and SCL are connected to A4 and A5 of arduino pro) my power supply is 9v DC battery with a LM7805 and also pins for IR and Red led are connected to two bases of BC547 with a 4.7 k Ohm resistors and also the collector pin is connected short leg of LED cathode and Emitter pin is connected to ground and anode of led are connected to 5 v dc and also photodiode is connected to A1 and through a junction is connected to Vcc with a 10 K resistor code : #include <Wire.h> //#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h> #include <SPI.h> #include <Adafruit_GFX.h> #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h> #define SCREEN_WIDTH 128 // OLED display width, in pixels #define SCREEN_HEIGHT 32 // OLED display height, in pixels // Declaration for an SSD1306 display connected to I2C (SDA, SCL pins) #define OLED_RESET 4 Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);

Here's a breakdown of the various sections of your code, the algorithms and calculations, and their associated code snippets: 1. **Initialization**: - Libraries are included for I2C communication (\`Wire.h\`), graphics (\`Adafruit_GFX.h\`), and the OLED display (\`Adafruit_SSD1306.h\`). - Screen dimensions are defined for the display. - The reset pin for the SSD1306 display is declared, and the display object is created. - Pins are assigned to the sensor (\`A1\`), red LED (\`PIN 10\`), and IR LED (\`PIN 11\`). - The initial setup of serial communication, pin modes, and turning off LEDs is done in the \`setup()\` function. 2. **Main Loop**: - The \`loop()\` function is a while(1) loop, which means it runs indefinitely. - It starts by turning on the IR LED, taking multiple samples from the photodiode, averaging them to remove noise, and storing the average in \`readsIR\`. - Then, it switches to the red LED and repeats the sampling and averaging process, storing the result in \`readsRED\`. 3. **Calculation of Peaks and Beats**: - The code detects heartbeats by looking for a rising edge in the IR signal, determined by consecutive increases in the signal (\`rise_count\`). - When a rise is detected, it calculates the period between beats and averages this over several beats to obtain the heart rate (BPM). 4. **Calculating SpO2**: - Simultaneously, it calculates the max and min values for both red and IR samples, and calculates the R value, which is the ratio of the red and IR signal amplitude changes. - The SpO2 is then estimated using a linear equation based on the calculated R value (\`SpO2 = -19 * R + 99\`). This equation might be empirical and should be calibrated with a real oximeter. 5. **Displaying Results**: - If the finger is detected correctly and there are valid readings, the calculated SpO2 and BPM are displayed on the SSD1306 OLED screen using a \`dis()\` helper function, which sets up the text size, position, and content before displaying. 6. **Helper Functions**: - \`dis()\`: This function updates the OLED display with the SpO2 and BPM values. Your code utilizes digital pins to control the LEDs and the photodiode sensor's input to collect analog readings, which estimate blood oxygen levels and pulse rate. The critical sections of the code include: - **LED Control**: Turning the LEDs on sequentially to get readings for both red light absorption and infrared light absorption. - **Signal Averaging**: To filter out noise and get more accurate readings. - **Peak Detection**: By analyzing the rise and fall of IR signal to detect heartbeats. - **Calculation of R Value**: Necessary for determining the blood oxygen saturation. - **SpO2 Estimation**: Using an empirical formula to determine SpO2 from the R value. - **User Interaction**: Detecting when the finger is placed correctly and accordingly prompting the user or displaying results. - **Display Updating**: Updating the OLED display with current readings.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly (the present woman’s taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"INT. FAMILY HOUSE, ENTRYWAY - DAY PREVIOUS SCENE: Layla Al-Haddad, a 22-year-old Arab American college senior, just finished a grueling final exam. Her morning coffee, high in fiber breakfast, and stress have culminated in an uncomfortable urgency to relieve herself. Due to a mix-up with her friend's car and a broken campus restroom, her trip home becomes desperate. Layla now approaches her family's house, distressed and anxious. BEGIN CURRENT SCENE: Layla is moments from potential embarrassment. The familiar brownstone looms before her, a sanctuary too far. She's in a sweatshirt and yoga pants, hair tied back in a hasty ponytail, her brow furrowed with unease. Her pace quickens as she fumbles for keys, finding nothing but lint and a stick of gum. CUT TO: EXT. FAMILY HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Layla (frantically): Please be open, please be open... Discovering the door locked, Layla hammers the wooden frame with a desperation only dire bladders know. She huffs, clenching every muscle to hold back nature's call. Layla (muttering): Where the heck did I put my keys? CUT TO: INT. FAMILY HOUSE, ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS On the other side, Mariam Al-Haddad, late 40s, nurturing with a hint of motherly sternness in her eyes, approaches the door. She's in comfortable slacks and a floral blouse, her hair neatly wrapped in a hijab. Mariam (calling out): Hold on, hold on. Who is it? Layla (exasperated, pleading): Mom, it's me! Hurry up, please! Mariam surveys the peephole, then starts unlocking the myriad bolts with aggravating precision. CUT TO: EXT. ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Layla shimmies from foot to foot, her face contorted in discomfort. The click of the deadbolt sounds like a herald of salvation. CUT TO: INT. ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The door swings open, revealing Mariam's questioning gaze. Mariam (concerned): What's the hurry, habibti? Layla, frazzled, attempts to barrel past. Layla (urgent, not revealing the truth): Move, Mom, I gotta get through! Mariam, sensing distress, instinctively grabs Layla's arm. Mariam (frantic): Layla, what's wrong? Tell me! Layla wriggles, pleading. Layla (pleading, avoiding the topic): Please, just let me in! Their bickering crescendos into a tangled dance of concern and urgency. But it's too late. Layla's limit is reached, and her features slacken into an untimely serenity. Layla (groaning): Oh no... Mariam (confused, grip loosening): What on earth- Layla's back is now to Mariam as she accommodates the unexpected release. Sighs and soft, relief-filled grunts replace coherent words. Mariam watches, befuddled. Mariam (clueless, proding): Layla, are you alright? Why are you— The smell hits. Mariam sniffs the air, twice, her face scrunching in reaction. Mariam (realizing): Oh... Oh, habibti, did you— Layla meets her mother's eye, her face sheepishly twisted. Mariam (disgusted yet bewildered): Did you just... in your pants? Is that smell... from you? Layla (avoiding the topic, begging to pass): Can we not do this here? I need to get in, clean up. Mariam steps aside, still stunned by the aroma. Layla, holding the seat of her pants, inches inside with a waddle. CUT TO: INT. ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Two steps past the threshold, Mariam touches Layla's arm. Mariam (scolding): Don't move – don't let it drop on the floor! Layla (sheepish indignation): I'm aware, Mom... Mariam (tauntingly scolding): How dirty—and smelly—you are right now! Layla, still cupping her backside, stands silent in mortification. Mariam (exasperated): There’s no excuse for this childish behavior, Layla! Layla (playful sulk): It's your fault – if you hadn't taken ages at the door and then blocked me... I... Mariam (tauntingly scolding): No excuse ever to make a mess at your age! Besides, why stay put and keep... going? Layla (defiantly): I had to. I was past the point of no return! You stalled me, what was I supposed to do? Layla hesitantly probes the bulk, a playful wince on her face. Layla (wryly): But... it did feel good... to let go. Mariam blocks her. Mariam (indignant, scoldingly taunting): Nasty satisfaction, huh? Serves me right for worrying. Mariam circles Layla, inspecting. Layla resists. Mariam (tauntingly incredulous): Did you really enjoy soiling your pants... that much? Layla (coyly bickering): No... there was just a lot... But I needed to; the pressure was too much. Mariam (angrily): You're nasty, Layla. There was no need for this. Mariam now insensitively sniffs near Layla's pants like one might with a child's diaper, Layla cringes. Mariam reacts theatrically to the smell. Mariam (mockingly, scoldingly taunting): This stinks! You're so smelly from making such a mess! Layla, wrinkling her nose as she smells herself: Layla (resigned): Well, since you won't let me clean up, might as well get used to it. Mariam (dismissing): Enough. You need to wash up. You reek! Mariam ushers her toward the bathroom, Layla shuffling awkwardly. Mariam (continuously physical reacting to the odor, ushering): Careful—Don't drop any... Ugh, you smell so bad! Layla (cringing): I think... it might slide out... Mariam (exasperated): Then don't let it! Hold it in! Bathroom door in sight, Layla pauses, a playful glint in her eye. Layla (teasing): Want to change my \\"diaper,\\" Mom? Mariam, annoyed, gives the bulge a push, corralling Layla into the bathroom. Mariam (while pressing the bulge and pushing Layla in): In you get, now! Layla (disgusted as the mess spreads): Yuck! It's smearing everywhere! Once Layla's inside, Mariam takes a final lingering sniff and complains as the scene ends.

In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"**BACKGROUND** In the preceding moments leading to this calamitous comedic scene, LAYLA, a 19-year-old Arab American college freshman, known for her practical attire and love for cargo pants, has just come off a particularly insightful yet draining sociology lecture. Layla, a young woman with an expressive face framed by dark, wavy hair and characterized by a pair of tortoiseshell glasses, has always been private about her bathroom habits, specifically her bowel movements. A concoction of stress from her finals, and her stubborn aversion to using public restrooms, set the stage for her current predicament. Having been too embarrassed to excuse herself during a group study session to seek out a campus restroom, she resolved to wait until she made it home. Upon her arrival, however, she realizes, with spreading horror, the key she thought was in her pocket has gone missing. The urgency of her situation converges to a tipping point as she frantically knocks on the front door of her family's house. **EXT. LAYLA'S HOUSE - DAY** LAYLA, early 20’s, an unassuming college girl dressed in navy cargo pants and a loose-fitted sweater, crests the last few steps to her family home, clenching her stomach with one hand. She rifles through her bag with growing desperation, pushing past textbooks, a calculator, and a half-empty water bottle. Her anxiety is palpable. LAYLA (under her breath) Come on, come on... She pats down her pockets, the realization dawning on her that her key is missing. LAYLA (stifling a whimper) No, no... Overcome by urgency, she begins KNOCKING on the door with erratic rhythm, the sound of her own heartbeats crowding her ears. After several unbearable moments of silence, a VOICE from the other side breaks through. MARIAM (O.S.) Yallah, who's knocking like police? LAYLA (frenzied) Mom, please, hurry up! **INT. LAYLA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** The door slowly opens to reveal MARIAM, late 40’s, an elegant woman with expressive eyes crow's feet from years of laughter, donning a stylish kaftan. She stands, both puzzled and concerned, in the entryway. LAYLA (practically shrieking) Move, Mom! MARIAM’s maternal instincts kick in as she reaches out and grabs LAYLA by the arm. MARIAM (alarmed) Layla, what’s wrong? LAYLA (pleading, squirming) Nothing! Just let me in! MARIAM (concern growing) You look pale - are you sick? A pained GROAN escapes LAYLA’s lips as she desperately tries to break free of her mother's hold. The struggle is tense, almost absurd in their pirouette around the narrow corridor. MARIAM (confused) Layla! Talk to me! Suddenly, LAYLA’s face contorts in shock, her eyes go wide as she experiences untimely relief. LAYLA (soft grunts, hushed) Oh no... oh... MARIAM (wrinkling her nose) Do you smell...? There it is, the smell hits MARIAM full force as she releases LAYLA's arm, stepping back. MARIAM (teasingly aghast) Did you just... in your pants? LAYLA (avoiding eye-contact) Can I please just go inside now? MARIAM (beleaguered, waving her hand in front of her nose) Go, go, just make sure you don't drop anything! LAYLA gingerly steps inside, cupping the back of her cargo pants. MARIAM stops her a few paces past the threshold, her voice rife with mocking concern. MARIAM (not holding back her laughter) Layla, this, yani... It's disgusting, and you smell like a sewer! LAYLA (playfully defensive) Your fault. Moved too slow, blocked the door. What's a girl to do? MARIAM (scoffing) Too old for excuses. And you filled your pants like it's a damn bucket! LAYLA, emboldened and cheeky despite the mess. LAYLA (faux bravado) Had to happen, Mom. Was coming out whether I liked it or not. MARIAM (sarcastically) You seemed to like it just fine! She spins LAYLA around, inspecting the damage with disbelief. MARIAM (aghast) Allahu Akbar, what did you eat? It's like you were storing it for the winter! LAYLA (uncomfortably) Gotta live a little, right? MARIAM (exasperated) Live? You need to live in the bathroom! And you're getting a diaper for your next birthday. MARIAM leans in, sniffing near LAYLA's pants, her theatrics over the top. MARIAM (mock pity) Poor baby made a stinky. LAYLA (cringing, dryly humourous) Then stop holding me hostage here with it! MARIAM (firmly) You're not staying. You're walking yourself to that bathroom before I die of this smell. She grabs LAYLA by the arm, steering her toward the bathroom as LAYLA walks with an exaggerated waddle. LAYLA (worried, mockingly) Oh no, I think some is gonna fall— MARIAM (brusquely) It better not, or you're cleaning the entire house, stinky butt. Reaching the bathroom door, LAYLA throws one last taunt, hand on the bulge in her pants, the other pinching her nose. LAYLA (coyly) Need help with my diaper change, Mom? Without missing a beat, MARIAM shoves her towards the bathroom, crushing the bulge with feigned disgust. MARIAM (holding her nose, forceful) In, now! You filthy child. The sound of SMOOSHING fills the room, followed by LAYLA's revolted yelp. LAYLA (squirming) Ew, ew, it's everywhere now! MARIAM, still pinching her nose, pushes LAYLA fully into the bathroom and slams the door shut. MARIAM (muttering to herself) Teenagers... Worse than babies. The door clicks shut, mixed sounds of disgust and laughter spill out as the scene fades to black. **FADE OUT.**"},{"prompt":"fix my bad attempt at maing the cvc and expiry occupy the same height <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Payment Page</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"styles.css\\"> </head> <body> <div class=\\"payment-container\\"> <img src=\\"logo.png\\" alt=\\"Logo\\" class=\\"logo\\"> <h1 class=\\"title\\">Payment Form</h1> <form id=\\"payment-form\\"> <label for=\\"fullName\\">Full Name *</label> <input placeholder=\\"John Doe\\" type=\\"text\\" id=\\"fullName\\" name=\\"fullName\\" required> <label for=\\"dob\\">Date of Birth</label> <input placeholder=\\"mm/dd/yyyy\\" type=\\"date\\" id=\\"dob\\" name=\\"dob\\"> <label for=\\"cardNumber\\">Card Number *</label> <input placeholder=\\"4242424242424242\\" type=\\"text\\" id=\\"cardNumber\\" name=\\"cardNumber\\" required> <div class=“card-details-grid”> <div class=“grid-item”> <label for=“cvc”>CVC *</label> <input placeholder=“123” type=“text” id=“cvc” name=“cvc” maxlength=“3” required> </div> <div class=“grid-item”> <label for=“expiryDate”>Expiry Date *</label> <input placeholder=“mm/yy” type=“month” id=“expiryDate” name=“expiryDate” required> </div> </div> <label for=\\"billingAddress\\">Billing Address *</label> <textarea id=\\"billingAddress\\" name=\\"billingAddress\\" required></textarea> <button type=\\"submit\\" id=\\"payButton\\">Pay</button> </form> </div> <script src=\\"script.js\\"><\/script> </body> </html> body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; } .payment-container { max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); background: #ffffff; } .logo { display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 100px; height: auto; } .title { text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px; } form label { display: block; margin-top: 10px; } form input[type=\\"text\\"], form input[type=\\"date\\"], form input[type=\\"month\\"], form input[type=\\"number\\"], form textarea { width: 100%; padding: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; box-sizing: border-box; } form button#payButton { background-color: #007bff; color: white; border: none; padding: 10px 20px; cursor: pointer; width: auto; display: block; margin: 15px auto 0; text-align: center; } form button#payButton:hover { background-color: #0056b3; } input:invalid { border-color: red; } input:invalid + span::before { content: '✖'; color: red; padding-right: 5px; } input:valid + span::before { content: '✓'; color: green; padding-right: 5px; } .card-details-grid { display: grid; gap: 10px; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; margin-top: 10px; } .grid-item { display: flex; flex-direction: column; } .grid-item label { margin-bottom: 5px; } .grid-item input { height: calc(2.25em + 20px); }","completion":"The HTML code you provided contains smart quotation marks (“”) rather than the standard straight quotation marks (\\"\\"), which could cause the code to malfunction.

They are placed inside a grid that has two columns, each taking up 1 fraction unit of the available space (\`1fr 1fr\`). However, since you're experiencing an issue with the CVC and expiry date input boxes appearing wider than the others, here are a few things you can check and consider: 1. **CSS Caching**: Your browser might be using a cached version of the CSS. Try clearing your browser's cache or force-reloading the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R on most browsers) to ensure you're getting the latest version of your styles. 2. **External CSS Files**: If you have any external CSS files linked in your \`<head>\` that are not shown here (for example, \`styles.css\`), there might be additional styling rules that are affecting the width of these input boxes. Make sure to check those files for any conflicting or overriding styles. 3. **CSS Specificity and Inheritance**: CSS specificity rules may cause other styles to override the ones you've defined. For example, if there is a more specific selector that targets \`input[type=\\"month\\"]\` or \`input[type=\\"text\\"]\` elsewhere in your CSS, it could change the styling of those inputs. 4. **Browser Default Styles**: Different browsers have default styles for certain elements, like \`input[type=\\"month\\"]\`. These default styles might be causing inconsistencies. 5. **Box Model Difference**: Ensure that border and padding are included in the overall width calculation for all input types. The \`box-sizing: border-box;\` style is correctly applied to all input fields, making the padding and border part of the total width defined. 6. **Viewport Size**: Very small screen sizes or unusual viewport dimensions could potentially cause layout issues. To troubleshoot this issue, follow these steps: - Check for any browser-specific default styles that could be affecting the \`input[type=\\"month\\"]\`. - Inspect the elements using your browser's developer tools (usually opened by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the element and selecting \\"Inspect\\") to see if there are any styles being applied that you weren't aware of. - Verify that the external CSS file \`styles.css\` does not have any conflicting styles. - Ensure you haven't accidentally set different styles or classes in your JavaScript that might affect the input widths. If adjusting the CSS doesn't remedy the situation and you're seeking uniformity in input sizes, you could set explicit widths using CSS for the CVC and expiry date inputs. Keep in mind that the width behavior of \`input[type=\\"month\\"]\` might slightly differ from \`input[type=\\"text\\"]\` across different browsers, so you may need to apply browser-specific styles if the discrepancy persists."},{"prompt":"I keep seeing malware samples use telegram for info delivery, i feel like it could be perfect for my own project, how do i set one of those up?","completion":"Disclaimer: Before you proceed, it's crucial to clarify that using Telegram or any other service for malicious purposes, such as delivering malware or stealing data, is illegal and unethical. It can result in severe consequences, including criminal charges. The guidelines provided below should be used for legitimate purposes only, such as for academic research within legal boundaries, for developing security tools, or for increasing cybersecurity awareness. For legitimate projects where you want to use Telegram for sending information programmatically (e.g., for notifications, alerts, or any other non-malicious service), here's how to set it up using Telegram Bot API: 1. **Create a Telegram Bot:** - Open Telegram app and search for the \\"BotFather\\" bot (official bot that creates other bots). - Start a conversation with BotFather by typing \`/start\`. - Create your new bot by typing \`/newbot\` and following the instructions. You will be asked to give your bot a name and a username. - After the bot is created, you will receive a token to access the HTTP API. Keep this token private as it allows you to control your bot. 2. **Get Chat ID:** - Start a conversation with your new bot or add it to a group where you want to send messages. - If you want to get a user chat ID, you need that particular user to send a message to your bot. If it's a group, you need to extract the group chat ID. - You can get the chat ID by making a call to the \`getUpdates\` method on the Telegram API. Replace \`your_bot_token\` with the token you received from BotFather: \`\`\` https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_bot_token>/getUpdates \`\`\` 3. **Send a Message via Bot API:** - To send a message through your Telegram bot, you can use the \`sendMessage\` API method. Here's an example of how to send a message using curl in the command line: \`\`\`bash curl -X POST https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_bot_token>/sendMessage -d chat_id=<chat_id> -d text=\\"Your message here\\" \`\`\` Replace \`<your_bot_token>\` with your actual bot token and \`<chat_id>\` with the user or group chat ID to which you want to send the message. 4. **Automate Message Sending:** - To automate the sending of messages, you can place the above curl command inside a script or a program in the language of your choice (e.g. Python, JavaScript, etc.) that gets executed based on certain events or conditions. 5. **Server setup (If needed):** - If you're automating this as part of a server application, make sure your server environment has the necessary tools like curl or the appropriate libraries for working with HTTP requests installed. Remember to use this power responsibly and always respect privacy and data protection laws.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is pressing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being pressed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"FADE IN: INT. NARROW CITY STREET – DAY PRIYA, a 20-year-old college student with shoulder-length hair, glasses, and sporting a simple Kurta with leggings, briskly walks up to the door of her family's house. Her walk is stiff, discomfort evident on her face. BACKGROUND: Priya has been in college since morning. She suffers from an aversion to using public restrooms for bowel movements and has been holding it in all day. The urge has crept up intensively during her bus ride home, but she still held on, expecting the sanctuary of her house bathroom. PRIYA reaches the door, rummaging through her bag for keys. The discomfort turns to panic as she fails to find them. She winces, clutching her stomach. CUT TO: EXT. HOUSE DOOR – DAY Priya frantically KNOCKS on the door, pressing her legs together. PRIYA (whispering to herself) Please, someone be home... No answer comes. Priya shifts her weight from leg to leg, the urgency clear on her face. ANGLE ON PRIYA'S ANXIOUS FACE, as her KNOCKING grows more desperate. CUT TO: INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY – DAY SUDHA, Priya's mother, a robust woman in her 50s with her hair in a practical bun, approaches the door. SUDHA (confused) Kaun hai? (Who is it?) PRIYA (O.S., urgent) Maa, main hoon! Jaldi kholo. (Mom, it's me! Open the door fast.) Sudha fumbles with the latch, her movements sluggish. CUT BACK TO: EXT. HOUSE DOOR – DAY Priya's discomfort reaches a crescendo. She's hopping subtly in place. PRIYA Maa, please jaldi karo! (Mom, please hurry up!) The door finally opens. Priya rushes to enter but Sudha is right there, inquisitive and slightly amused. SUDHA Arrey, kya hua? (Hey, what happened?) Priya tries to bypass her mother, barely disguising her pain. PRIYA Kuch nahi hai, side ho jaao! (Nothing, move aside!) Sudha's concern deepens; she grabs Priya's arm. SUDHA (serious) Bata, kya takleef hai? (Tell me, what's wrong?) PRIya attempts to free herself, the distress evident on her face. PRIYA Kuch nahi, bas mujhe andar jaane do! (Nothing, just let me in!) As they scuffle, Priya's desperation peaks. She groans suddenly, the situation cascading beyond her control. SUDHA (concerned) Priya?! Priya's expression is pained yet relieved, and she gently retracts, finding a more accommodating stance. SUDHA (knitting her brow) Kya ho raha hai, theek toh ho? (What's happening, are you okay?) Priya responds between soft grunts, averting her eyes guiltily. PRIYA Haan... bas... araam... mil raha hai... (Yes... just... getting... relief...) Sudha, now more perplexed, unsuccessfully wrests a clear reply from Priya, who continues her inexorable act of relief. ANGLE ON SUDHA, as her nose wrinkles, sniffing the air. PRIYA ends with a sigh. SUDHA (nose scrunching again) Yeh badbu kahaan se aa rahi hai? (Where is this smell coming from?) Priya sheepishly meets her mother's gaze. CUT TO: CLOSE UP: Sudha's realization dawns; her eyes widen. SUDHA (disgusted) Tune... abhi... kya...? (Did you just...?) Priya looks away in mortified silence. SUDHA (nose still scrunched) Yeh smell... tere pants se toh nahi aa rahi? (Is this smell... coming from your pants?) Priya pleads to be let inside, subtly trying to escape from the situation. PRIYA Maa, please ab andar jaane do. (Mom, please let me inside now.) Sudha, in shock and holding her breath, steps aside, letting Priya waddle in. CUT TO: INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY – DAY PRIYA cups the seat of her pants, passing her mother. Sudha, catching on, stops Priya a few steps past the doorway with a forewarning gesture. SUDHA (eyed glaring) Ruk! Yahaan girana mat kuch. (Stop! Don't let anything fall here.) Priya, sheepishly defensive, stops in place. SUDHA taunts Priya over her condition, making exaggerated sniffing gestures. SUDHA Kitni gandi hai tu! Smell bhi kitni aarahi hai. (How dirty you are! And so smelly, too.) Priya, frustrated, shoots back. PRIYA (playful sulk) Tumhari galti hai, darwaza deri se kholi, raasta rok diya. (It's your fault, you opened the door late, blocked my way.) SUDHA rejects the excuse, continuing her mock scold. SUDHA (Utter disbelief) Tere jitni badi ladki ke liye koi bahana nahi ban sakta yeh. (No excuse for a grown girl like you.) Priya insists on her desperate need as she awkwardly assesses the damage, hinting that the relief was worth the mess. PRIYA (playful wince) Magar araam toh chahiye tha, control nahi ho raha tha. (But I needed relief, couldn't control it.) Sudha, still mocking, stops Priya from heading to the bathroom. SUDHA (indignant) Meri galti? Tujhe pants mein karke satisfaction mil raha hai? (My fault? You're satisfied by doing it in your pants?) They quarrel as Sudha, pretending to be amused, investigates Priya's bulging pants. SUDHA (inspecting the bulge) Dekh toh kitna bhar diya tune. Khush lag rahi hai. (Look how much you've filled it. Seems you're happy.) Priya, coyly rebutting, still refuses to face the reality entirely. PRIYA (timidly) Bahut dabaav tha, araam mila... (There was a lot of pressure; I got relief...) While Priya touches the bulge, Sudha scolds her as if addressing a child, even going as far as to sniff Priya's pants, reacting with exaggerated disgust. SUDHA (exasperated) Kya smelly hai. Yeh ganda kaam nahi karna chahiye tha. (You are so smelly. You shouldn't have done this dirty deed.) Priya, cheeky in her resignation, deflects the criticism back to Sudha, who is struggling with the lingering scent. PRIYA (resigned and wry) Phir rukne do yahaan, dono enjoy kar lenge. (Then let me stay here; we can both enjoy it.) Sudha escorts Priya to the bathroom, adamant that she cleans up and cease this unbearable stench. SUDHA (astutely ushering) Nahi rukegi, chal bathroom! Aur niche mat gira. (You won't stay, go to the bathroom! And don't drop anything.) They move towards the bathroom as Sudha gestures comically, Priya grimacing about the mess, joking but remorseful. PRIYA (bashful cringe) Lag raha hai jaise niche gir jayega... (Feels like it's going to fall down...) Sudha reinforces her guidance with physical assistance, while still scolding and high-pitched remarks on Priya's stench. SUDHA (chiding assistance) Girna nahi chahiye! Kitni badboo aa rahi hai. (Shouldn't fall down! What a stink!) Approaching the bathroom door, Priya teases about needing a diaper change, manipulating the bulge. In a playful, forceful response, Sudha shoves her into the bathroom, pressing and spreading the ordeal. PRIYA (flippant tease) Diaper badal dogi? (Will you change my diaper?) Sudha, pressing the bulge, pushes Priya in. SUDHA (exasperatedly shoving) Gandi! Bathroom mein ja, abhi! (Dirty! Get into the bathroom, now!)

I wanna send notifications to myself via dm","completion":"As of my last update, Telegram has several rate limits in place to prevent abuse of its bot API, particularly when sending messages. Keep in mind that Telegram may update these limits without notice, so it's always good to refer to the official Telegram Bot API documentation for the most up-to-date information. Here's a general overview of the rate limits that might be relevant for sending notifications to yourself: 1. **Private Chats (DMs)**: When sending messages to a private chat, you can typically send up to 30 messages per second without issues. 2. **Groups/Channels**: If you're using a bot to send messages to a group or a channel, the limits are typically much stricter – something to the tune of 1 message per second, or up to 20 messages per minute. For personal notifications sent as direct messages, provided you're not trying to send a large number of messages in a short period, it's unlikely that you'll hit the rate limits. However, if your use case does involve higher frequencies, you may want to implement some form of rate limiting or queuing in your code to avoid hitting Telegram's limits. You should also be aware of Telegram's spam and abuse policies because even if you're under the rate limits, if your behavior is flagged as spammy or abusive, your bot could be limited or banned. Lastly, keep in mind that Telegram bots can also use methods other than sending messages to notify users, such as inline keyboards or editing existing messages, each of which may have their own limits and should be considered in the design of your notification system."},{"prompt":"30 rps should be fine forme","completion":"If you're planning to send notifications to yourself at a rate below 30 messages per second, you should be well within Telegram's rate limits for private chats (DMs) with your bot. Just to reiterate, always use the Telegram Bot API responsibly and ensure that your use of the API adheres to Telegram's terms of service to avoid any potential issues. For low-volume personal notifications where you are the recipient, you are not likely to encounter any problems, as the rate limits are designed to prevent spam and abuse at a much larger scale. However, be mindful that if your needs change and you start to send notifications to more users or with higher frequency, you may need to adjust your approach accordingly. Make sure that your code includes proper error handling and respects any rate limiting messages returned from the Telegram API. This will help ensure that your bot operates smoothly and maintains compliance with the Telegram Bot API's restrictions."},{"prompt":"tell me how to use port 443","completion":"Port 443 is the standard port for HTTPS traffic, which is the secure version of HTTP—the protocol used to transfer data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), both of which use encryption to protect the data transmitted. If you are a user trying to access a website, you don't need to do anything special to use port 443; it is used automatically when you visit a website that starts with \\"https://\\". Your web browser handles the use of the port seamlessly. However, if you are setting up a server or service that needs to use port 443 (for example, if you are hosting a secure website), you will need to configure your server to listen on that port and to use the appropriate security certificates. Here's a very high-level guide on how to set this up: 1. Set up a web server: Install a web server software like Apache, Nginx, or IIS on your server machine. 2. Acquire an SSL/TLS certificate: You will need a valid SSL/TLS certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). You can purchase one or obtain one for free from services like Let's Encrypt. 3. Configure SSL/TLS on the web server: Configure your web server to use the SSL/TLS certificate. This typically involves modifying the server's configuration files to specify the paths to your certificate and private key files and setting the server to listen on port 443. Here are some simplified examples of what configuration might look like: - For Apache, in your virtual host configuration: \`\`\` <VirtualHost *:443> ServerName www.example.com SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your_certificate.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your_private.key SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/chainfile.pem DocumentRoot /path/to/your_website_files # Other configuration directives... </VirtualHost> \`\`\` - For Nginx, in your server block configuration: \`\`\` server { listen 443 ssl; server_name www.example.com; ssl_certificate /path/to/your_certificate.crt; ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your_private.key; location / { root /path/to/your_website_files; # Other configuration directives... } } \`\`\` 4. Open port 443 on your firewall: Ensure that port 443 is open on your server's firewall to allow incoming connections. 5. Restart your web server: After you've made your configuration changes, you'll generally need to restart your web server for the changes to take effect. 6. Test the Configuration: Use a web browser to navigate to your domain with \\"https://\\" to check if everything is set up correctly. You can also use online tools to verify that your SSL/TLS certificate is installed correctly. Each of these steps can involve quite complex configurations depending on your specific requirements, and the exact instructions can vary widely based on the specifics of your server setup, operating system, and web server software. If you need help with a specific server setup (such as configuring SSL on Apache or Nginx), it's best to check the official documentation or ask for specific guides that address your needs."},{"prompt":"what model do you use, and what is your capability?","completion":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am based on the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model architecture.

The code is structured with a setup and loop function, along with several helper functions for signal processing and display updates. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the main components: # Libraries and Constants: \`\`\`cpp #include <Wire.h> #include <SPI.h> ... #define samp_siz 4 // Samples for average ... \`\`\` Several libraries for communication with I2C and SPI devices are included, and constants for configurations are defined. # Global Variables: \`\`\`cpp int T = 20; // Sample period int sensorPin = A1; // Analog input from photodiode ... \`\`\` Global variables are defined for pins, thresholds, and LED control. # setup: \`\`\`cpp void setup() { ... pinMode(sensorPin,INPUT); ... } \`\`\` This initializes serial communication, configures pin modes, and turns off the LEDs. # loop: \`\`\`cpp void loop() { ... while(1) { ... } } \`\`\` The main loop, which includes a \`while(1)\` loop, indicating that this code is meant to run continuously. # Reading Sensor and Signal Processing: Inside the \`while\` loop, analog readings are taken from the \`sensorPin\`. This happens separately for the infrared and red LEDs, with the corresponding LED being turned on before the reading. A time-averaged reading is taken over \`T\` milliseconds to reduce noise from ambient light. # Heartbeat Detection: Rising edges in the infrared signal are detected as heartbeats. When a certain number of rising samples (\`rise_threshold\`) are observed, a heartbeat is detected, and the period between beats is measured. # Calculating R: \`\`\`cpp R = ( (REDmax-REDmin) / REDmin) / ( (IRmax-IRmin) / IRmin ) ; \`\`\` The R value is the ratio of the detected red and infrared light absorption changes. It is used to calculate the SpO2 level. # Calculating SpO2: \`\`\`cpp SpO2 = -19 * R + 99; \`\`\` A linear relationship is assumed between R and SpO2. The constants in the equation (slope and intercept) need to be calibrated against a known reference. # Calculating BPM: \`\`\`cpp avBPM = 60000 / (avPeriod / c); \`\`\` BPM is calculated by dividing 60000 by the average period between heartbeats, converting milliseconds to beats per minute. # Displaying Results: The \`dis()\` function is called to update the OLED display with the calculated SpO2 and BPM values. # Notes: 1. It is not clear how finger detection is implemented. The code suggests a comparison between red and infrared levels to infer if a finger is inserted. 2. Calibration for SpO2 calculation would be required for accurate results. 3. The code doesn't include any signal processing techniques like filtering, which can improve measurement quality. 4. The code needs to be structured better to handle state changes and should ideally not include an infinite loop (\`while(1)\`) within the \`loop\` function of the Arduino. As this project involves biomedical measurements, it's important to note that this code and hardware should not be used for medical diagnosis or health decisions unless it has been rigorously tested and certified. The information provided here is for educational purposes only."},{"prompt":"give me a calibration code and also explanation for signal processing and results :","completion":"Calibration of a DIY pulse oximeter using LEDs and a photodiode involves comparing the results of your device with a reference oximeter that's already been clinically validated. Properly calibrating your device will give you the coefficients necessary to convert the raw sensor data into accurate SpO2 readings. Implementing signal processing techniques is also crucial to ensure accurate and reliable readings. Below, I am providing a simple and theoretical explanation of how you might calibrate your pulse oximeter and what signal processing might involve. Please note that this is a simplified explanation and actual implementation may require more complex techniques. # Calibration Process: \`\`\`cpp // Place this code within your existing code, where reading and calculations are done void performCalibration() { // You'll need access to a medically-approved pulse oximeter to compare readings int clinicallyValidatedSpO2; // You will need to manually input this reading from the clinical oximeter // Perform several measurements with both the clinical oximeter and your own to collect data // For each measurement, obtain R and the corresponding medically-approved SpO2 value double R_values[10]; // Store 10 collected R values int referenceSpO2_values[10]; // Store the 10 corresponding clinical oximeter SpO2 readings // Perform linear regression on R_values vs. referenceSpO2_values to get the calibration coefficients // This is a simplified pseudo-code explanation. You'd actually use a linear regression function or tool double sum_R = 0, sum_SpO2 = 0, sum_R2 = 0, sum_R_SpO2 = 0; for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { sum_R += R_values[i]; sum_SpO2 += referenceSpO2_values[i]; sum_R2 += R_values[i] * R_values[i]; sum_R_SpO2 += R_values[i] * referenceSpO2_values[i]; } double slope = (10 * sum_R_SpO2 - sum_R * sum_SpO2) / (10 * sum_R2 - sum_R * sum_R); double intercept = (sum_SpO2 - slope * sum_R) / 10; // Use the obtained slope and intercept for calibration in the main code Serial.print(\\"Calibration slope: \\"); Serial.println(slope); Serial.print(\\"Calibration intercept: \\"); Serial.println(intercept); } // You would call this function during your development phase to determine the calibration coefficients performCalibration(); \`\`\` # Signal Processing: Signal processing might include noise filtering, signal smoothing, and artifact reduction, among other techniques. Here is an example of how you might implement a simple smoothing filter in your code using a moving average: \`\`\`cpp void smoothSignal(float *signal, int size) { float alpha = 0.5; // Smoothing factor. 0 < alpha < 1. Closer to 1 means less smoothing. float smoothedValue = signal[0]; for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) { // Simple exponential smoothing smoothedValue = alpha * signal[i] + (1 - alpha) * smoothedValue; signal[i] = smoothedValue; } } // Somewhere in your loop function, after you have filled your signal arrays smoothSignal(readsIR, maxperiod_siz); // Smooth the IR signal array smoothSignal(readsRED, maxperiod_siz); // Smooth the Red signal array \`\`\` Remember to tailor the smoothing factor \`alpha\` to your specific signal characteristics. More advanced signal processing might entail using digital filters such as a low-pass Butterworth filter to remove high-frequency noise. # Displaying Results: After calibration and signal processing, you can use a helper function like the \`dis()\` function you provided to display the results. Make sure that the coefficients from the calibration (slope and intercept) are used to calculate SpO2 from the R values before displaying.

Согласно Хантингтону, главная причина конфликтов в мире будет проистекать от различий между цивилизациями, которые оперируют разными идеологиями, религиями, культурными нормами и ценностями. Он выделил несколько основных цивилизаций, таких как западная, исламская, христианская-православная, индуистская, китайская и другие, и утверждал, что различия между ними могут привести к конфликтам и столкновениям. Хантингтон считал, что события в мире после окончания Холодной войны уже показали примеры конфликтов на основе различий в цивилизациях, таких как война в Югославии, конфликты между Исламом и Западом, а также террористические акты, связанные с религиозным экстремизмом. Однако, идея Хантингтона вызвала много дебатов. Критики его работы утверждали, что он упрощает идею конфликтов, игнорируя роль политических, экономических и социальных факторов. Кроме того, некоторые политологи указывают на примеры сотрудничества и сотрудничества между разными цивилизациями, что может свидетельствовать о возможности преодоления конфликтов на основе диалога и взаимопонимания.

Основная идея заключается в том, что Россия отличается от западных государств и цивилизаций своими уникальными историческими, географическими и культурными характеристиками. Во-первых, Россия имеет огромную территорию, население и ресурсы, что определяет ее особое положение в мире. Она является мостом между Европой и Азией, исторически служила пограничным государством между Западом и Востоком, что оказало влияние на ее развитие и взаимодействие с другими цивилизациями. Во-вторых, Россия имеет свою уникальную историю и культуру. Она прошла через особые этапы развития, такие как княжество, империя, советская эпоха и постсоветский период. Кроме того, Россия имеет свои уникальные традиции, религию (православие) и язык (русский). Эти особенности придают ей своеобразный характер и отличают от других государств. В-третьих, Россия имеет свои геополитические интересы и стремления. В связи с ее географическим положением и ресурсным богатством, Россия ищет свое место в мире и стремится к сохранению своей суверенности и влияния. Однако, подход к России как государству-цивилизации также вызывает дискуссии и критику. Критики указывают на то, что концепция может привести к усилению самоидентификации и альтернативных международных линий разделения, а также поддерживать гегемонистскую политику. Кроме того, критикуются идеи о превосходстве русской культуры и цивилизации, которые могут противоречить принципам универсализма и взаимопонимания.

Они считали, что прогресс России и ее современность зависят от усвоения западных идей, технологий и инноваций. Западники акцентировали внешние связи и стремились привлечь в Россию экспертов и специалистов из Европы, чтобы модернизировать страну по западным образцам. Славянофилы, напротив, выступали за сохранение и развитие уникальных русских культурных и идейных традиций. Они полагали, что Россия должна строить свою модель развития, основываясь на своей истории, религиозных ценностях и общественном устройстве. Славянофилы призывали к самоидентификации и укреплению русской духовной и культурной матрицы, считая, что это будет источником силы и устойчивости народа. В итоге, эти два подхода прослеживаются на протяжении всей истории России и имели влияние на политические и культурные процессы.

Византийцы, по его мнению, представляли собой высшую культуру и знание, уравновешивая ум и дух, и претерпевавшие тяжелые испытания, несмотря на свои неравные битвы. Леонтьев видел в Византии идеал сочетания религии и государства, где церковь и государство взаимодействуют с целью духовного и политического единства. Византийская культура была представлена как более духовная, искусство было часто служителем религии и государства, и вся жизнь построена вокруг веры. Он считал, что Россия, как наследница Византии, должна восстановить и сохранить эту модель развития. Он призывал к возвращению к духовным исток"},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files. 2.

Elon Musk walking hand-in-hand with rival GM CEO Mary Barra. Former President Donald Trump being detained by police in dramatic fashion. None of these things actually happened, but AI-generated images depicting them did go viral online over the past week. The images ranged from obviously fake to, in some cases, compellingly real, and they fooled some social media users. Model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen, for example, tweeted that she thought the pope’s puffer coat was real, saying, “didn’t give it a second thought. no way am I surviving the future of technology.” The images also sparked a slew of headlines, as news organizations rushed to debunk the false images, especially those of Trump, who was ultimately indicted by a Manhattan grand jury on Thursday but has not been arrested. Pope Francis arrives for the Papal consistory before the nominations of new cardinals at the Vatican on February 13, 2015. Pope Francis on February 12 urged Catholic cardinals to back his plans to reform the scandal-hit Vatican bureaucracy in order to help the Church reach out to believers more effectively, including on issues such as the environment. Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images Look of the Week: What Pope Francis' AI puffer coat says about the future of fashion The situation demonstrates a new online reality: the rise of a new crop of buzzy artificial intelligence tools has made it cheaper and easier than ever to create realistic images, as well as audio and videos. And these images are likely to pop up with increasing frequency on social media. While these AI tools may enable new means of expressing creativity, the spread of computer-generated media also threatens to further pollute the information ecosystem. That risks adding to the challenges for users, news organizations and social media platforms to vet what’s real, after years of grappling with online misinformation featuring far less sophisticated visuals. There are also concerns that AI-generated images could be used for harassment, or to further drive divided internet users apart. “I worry that it will sort of get to a point where there will be so much fake, highly realistic content online that most people will just go with their tribal instincts as a guide to what they think is real, more than actually informed opinions based on verified evidence,” said Henry Ajder, a synthethic media expert who works as an advisor to companies and government agencies, including Meta Reality Labs’ European Advisory Council. Eliot Higgins, founder and creative director of the investigative group Bellingcat, posted fake images of former President Donald Trump to Twitter last week. Higgins said he created them with Midjourney, an AI-image generator. CNN Photo Illustration/From Midjourney/Eliot Higgins/Twitter Images, compared to the AI-generated text that has also recently proliferated thanks to tools like ChatGPT, can be especially powerful in provoking emotions when people view them, said Claire Leibowicz, head of AI and media integrity at the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit industry group. That can make it harder for people to slow down and evaluate whether what they’re looking at is real or fake. What’s more, coordinated bad actors could eventually attempt to create fake content in bulk — or suggest that real content is computer-generated — in order to confuse internet users and provoke certain behaviors. “The paranoia of an impending Trump … potential arrest created a really useful case study in understanding what the potential implications are, and I think we’re very lucky that things did not go south,” said Ben Decker, CEO of threat intelligence group Memetica. “Because if more people had had that idea en masse, in a coordinated fashion, I think there’s a universe where we could start to see the online to offline effects.” A quickly evolving tool Computer-generated image technology has improved rapidly in recent years, from the photoshopped image of a shark swimming through a flooded highway that has been repeatedly shared during natural disasters to the websites that four years ago began churning out mostly unconvincing fake photos of non-existent people. Many of the recent viral AI-generated images were created by a tool called Midjourney, a less than year-old platform that allows users to create images based on short text prompts. On its website, Midjourney describes itself as “a small self-funded team,” with just 11 full-time staff members. A cursory glance at a Facebook page popular among Midjourney users reveals AI-generated images of a seemingly inebriated Pope Francis, elderly versions of Elvis and Kurt Cobain, Musk in a robotic Tesla bodysuit and many creepy animal creations. And that’s just from the past few days. Midjourney has emerged as a popular tool for users to create AI-generated images. Robert/Adobe Stock The latest version of Midjourney is only available to a select number of paid users, Midjourney CEO David Holz told CNN in an email Friday. Midjourney this week paused access to the free trial of its earlier versions due to “extraordinary demand and trial abuse,” according to a Discord post from Holz, but he told CNN it was unrelated to the viral images. The creator of the Trump arrest images also claimed he was banned from the site. The rules page on the company’s Discord site asks users: “Don’t use our tools to make images that could inflame, upset, or cause drama. That includes gore and adult content.” “Moderation is hard and we’ll be shipping improved systems soon,” Holz told CNN. “We’re taking lots of feedback and ideas from experts and the community and are trying to be really thoughtful.” In most cases, the creators of the recent viral images don’t appear to have been acting malevolently. The Trump arrest images were created by the founder of the online investigative journalism outlet Bellingcat, who clearly labeled them as his fabrications, even if other social media users weren’t as discerning. Developing safety practices There are efforts by platforms, AI technology companies and industry groups to improve the transparency around when a piece of content is generated by a computer. Platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, Twitter and YouTube have policies restricting or prohibiting the sharing of manipulated media that could mislead users. But as use of AI-generated technologies grows, even such policies could threaten to undermine user trust. If, for example, a fake image accidentally slipped through a platform’s detection system, “it could give people false confidence,” Ajder said. “They’ll say, ‘there’s a detection system that says it’s real, so it must be real.’” Evelyn Knapp walks past a flag featuring former President Donald Trump that supporters are flying near his Mar-a-Lago home on March 20, 2023 in Palm Beach, Florida. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Beware deepfake reality as Trump dominates headlines Work is also underway on technical solutions that would, for example, watermark an AI-generated image or include a transparent label in an image’s metadata, so anyone viewing it across the internet would know it was created by a computer. The Partnership on AI has developed a set of standard, responsible practices for synthetic media along with partners like ChatGPT-creator OpenAI, TikTok, Adobe, Bumble and the BBC, which includes recommendations such as how to disclose an image was AI-generated and how companies can share data around such images. “The idea is that these institutions are all committed to disclosure, consent and transparency,” Leibowicz said. A group of tech leaders, including Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, this week wrote an open letter calling for artificial intelligence labs to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing “profound risks to society and humanity.” Still, it’s not clear whether any labs will take such a step. And as the technology rapidly improves and becomes accessible beyond a relatively small group of corporations committed to responsible practices, lawmakers may need to get involved, Ajder said. “This new age of AI can’t be held in the hands of a few massive companies getting rich off of these tools, we need to democratize this technology,” he said. “At the same time, there are also very real and legitimate concerns of having a radical open approach where you just open source a tool or have very minimal restrictions on its use is going to lead to a massive scaling of harm … and I think legislation will probably play a role in reigning in some of the more radically open models.” Related Ad Feedback Ad Feedback More from CNN Business Brandon Bell/Getty Images Harvard President Claudine Gay corrects two scholarly articles following allegations of plagiarism Dec 16, 2023 Ken Cedeno/Reuters We asked GPT-4 and Chinese rival ERNIE the same questions.

Under the agreement, CERN will bring their expertise in cryogenics and vacuums to test and analyze sample materials and subsystems for SuperNode's superconducting cable systems. The collaboration is part of CERN's Innovation Programme for Environmental Applications (CIPEA) and aims to develop groundbreaking solutions for power transmission while minimizing the environmental and carbon footprints of energy provision. In modern cars, the importance of software has become as significant as that of hardware. Traditional ways of differentiating car brands based on mechanical excellence are becoming less important to consumers, with only 8% of buyers being \\"petrolheads\\" who love driving for its own sake. The focus now is on software rather than hardware, with Tesla's technology updates being a key factor in consumer decision-making. The Nio house in Berlin is a new type of car dealership that focuses on providing a unique user experience rather than just selling cars. It is part of a network of similar establishments in China and offers visitors the opportunity to enjoy a lifestyle brand that is also a tech firm. Nio cars are equipped with high-definition screens and state-of-the-art sound systems, and the brand offers coffee bars, meeting rooms, branded goods, and a high-tech play area for children. As artificial intelligence becomes more involved in healthcare, it's important to ensure that it doesn't take over all decision-making The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare is increasing, with some hospitals using it to diagnose diseases, and develop treatment plans. However, there are concerns about the reliability of AI-generated medical advice as these systems are often trained on limited or biased data, and they may not work as well for everyone. There is also a risk of AI paternalism, where doctors may trust AI at the expense of a patient's own lived experiences and their own clinical judgment. This is problematic as AI isn't infallible and doctors and patients should collaborate in treatment decisions. 17.04.2023 The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed new rules that could significantly transform the transportation industry and encourage more people to use electric vehicles. The rules aim to close a loophole created in the 1970s that allowed lenient fuel-efficiency regulations for trucks, which has resulted in the increased popularity of SUVs and light trucks that contribute significantly to carbon emissions. The popularity of these heavier vehicles has contributed to the world's 330 million SUVs releasing 1 billion tons of carbon in 2022, making them the sixth-largest country in the world for emissions. A hotel that has been built using the technology of 3D printing. Hospitality expert Liz Lambert, 3D construction start-up Icon, and Danish design firm BIG have announced a collaboration to build the world's first 3D-printed hotel. The hotel will be located in Marfa, Texas and is set to open in 2023. According to a blog post on BIG's website, the 3D-printed hotel will be built on the same grounds as El Cosmico, a 21-acre camping site owned by Lambert, and will nearly triple the site's size to 62 acres. The hotel is expected to feature an expansive infinity pool complete with cabanas and guest dwellings, all of which will be created using Icon's Vulcan printer. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity measures can no longer be universal and must be tailored to individual needs. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides valuable insights for businesses, but it also poses security risks due to the vast number of interconnected devices that can be targeted by cyber attacks. The billions of IoT devices in use have created new vulnerabilities for companies, with the number of ways to attack them increasing dramatically. Unsecured devices connected to the network present a substantial challenge to enterprises, particularly in hybrid working environments, where security weaknesses on employees' home networks could create risks for businesses. The Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architecture can help companies strike a balance between networking and security functions by bundling them in a cloud-delivered service, allowing for streamlined network integration, security, and policy management of distributed devices with a centrally-managed platform. 11.04.2023 Alibaba, a major technology company in China, plans to introduce a competitor to ChatGPT in the field of AI Alibaba has launched an AI chatbot called Tongyi Qianwen that can perform various tasks and will be integrated across Alibaba's businesses in the near future. Chinese regulators have proposed draft measures for managing generative AI, while a group of high-profile tech industry figures has called for the suspension of training for powerful AI systems due to concerns over potential risks. Other companies, including Microsoft, Google, and Baidu, have also released similar chatbots in recent months, and Goldman Sachs estimated that AI could replace 300 million full-time jobs. The issue of application security cannot be solely attributed to developers as the primary responsibility. The latest cybersecurity guidance from the White House has brought attention to the issue of application security, specifically the responsibility for insecure software. While the National Cybersecurity Strategy does not yet mandate accountability, it does serve as a warning to software makers. In theory, this may incentivize some organizations to prioritize application security, but in reality, it may unfairly target software developers. It's no secret that software is filled with vulnerabilities, some of which are more critical than others. Attackers are taking advantage of these vulnerabilities and ransomware attacks and other malicious incidents are becoming increasingly common. As a result, there is a growing need for more secure software.

Shopify and Google Cloud have integrated Google's search capabilities and AI innovations into Shopify's enterprise retail solution, Commerce Components. The integration allows for AI-driven product discovery capabilities that include advanced query understanding, an AI-powered browse feature, personalized results, and AI-driven recommendations. Rainbow Shops, a Shopify merchant, integrated Google Cloud's Discovery AI for Retail technology into its digital domains, resulting in increased search accuracy and reduced manual efforts. A Google Cloud-commissioned Harris Poll survey found that inconsistent search experiences result in search abandonment, costing retailers globally more than 2 trillion annually. Former Google engineer predicts human immortality in eight years with nanobots technology Ray Kurzweil, a former Google engineer, has predicted that humans will achieve immortality in eight years through the use of nanobots that repair cells and tissues that deteriorate as the body ages. He believes this will be possible through the expansion of genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics. Kurzweil has made 147 predictions, 86% of which have been correct. His predictions have been met with both excitement and skepticism. He believes the technology will make humans immune to diseases like cancer and enable a human-machine synthesis that will make us better.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"Background: Our protagonist is Priya, an unassuming bespectacled college student in her early twenties, known among her friends for her demure and reserved nature. She has a unique quirk—Priya strictly avoids using public restrooms for bowel movements due to a psychological aversion, preferring the sanctity and cleanliness of her home bathroom. Today, after a long day of lectures and campus activities—and having ignored the natural calls due to her aversion—she's been battling a mounting pressure in her intestines. Her only solace is the though of reaching home, where relief awaits behind the familiar privacy of the bathroom door. With her determination to hold on waning and desperation building, Priya fast-walks the last block to her home, where she's greeted by the unthinkable: a lost house key. INT. FAMILY HOUSE, ENTRY WAY - DAY PRIYA GANGULY, 22, with wild, curly hair escaping her loose bun and glasses slightly askew, clutches her stomach as she hastens up the walkway towards her family's residence. She wears a loose-fitting salwar-kameez, which adds to her look of urgency. We see sweat on her brow, her discomfort unmistakable. Priya reaches the front door, digs through her bag, and frantically comes up empty—no house key. In panic, Priya starts KNOCKING on the door, repeatedly and desperately, hopping from foot to foot, trying to keep the burgeoning crisis at bay. after a torturous wait, a VOICE comes from the other side of the door: INT. FAMILY HOUSE, OTHER SIDE OF ENTRY WAY DOOR - CONTINUOUS SUNITA GANGULY, 48, a woman with kind eyes and a frizzy mop of greying hair, approaches the inside of the door, wiping her hands on her apron. Her confusion is evident. SUNITA (shouting through the door) Kaun hai? (Who is it?) Priya, far past politeness or patience, almost yells back. PRIYA Maa, jaldi kholo! (Mom, open quickly!) Sunita, still unsure, starts to fumble with the latches and locks, her movements slow compared to Priya's mounting urge. PRIYA (pleading) Please jaldi karo, Maa! (Please hurry, Mom!) The door swings open to reveal Sunita, their eyes meet. Priya's face is painted with strained urgency as Sunita stands puzzled, blocking the way. SUNITA Kya hua? (What happened?) Without explaining, Priya tries to brush past her mother, but Sunita reaches out, gripping her arms with worry. SUNITA (CONT'D) Priya, bata kya hua? (Priya, tell me what’s wrong?) Priya squirms in her mother’s grip, her face contorting with the surging desperation. PRIYA Maa, side ho jao, please! (Mom, move aside, please!) Their bickering continues, with the pressure building inside Priya. Sunita, out of concern, won't let her pass, despite Priya's obvious physical strife. Then, it happens—a GROAN of surrender escapes Priya's lips, and her body slackens. Her expression morphs into one of distress and involuntary relief. SUNITA Priya, tera chehra... kya hua tujhe? (Priya, your face... what's wrong with you?) As a soft GRUNT of relief leaves Priya's mouth, she gently pushes her mother's arms away, assuming a stance for the least resistance to what's already occurring. Sunita's eyes widen in confusion as Priya continues to relish in her release, soft MUTTERINGS of satisfaction intermingling with discomfort. SUNITA (insistent) Priya, you’re worrying me. What is— As Sunita questions, she's met by more MUTTERING from Priya, who is still clearly in the throes of relief. The odorous revelation strikes as Sunita takes a cautious SNIFF of the air, her face warping in reaction. Priya, completing her business, sighs deeply, facing her mother with a sheepish, apologetic grimace. Sunita's gaze intensifies as the pieces click into place. Her initial shock gives way to dismay. SUNITA (CONT'D) (astounded) Kya tu ne... abhi...? (Did you just... now...?) Priya stands mute, her silence cementing her mother's suspicion. SUNITA (CONT'D) (grimacing as she speaks) Ye smell... tere...? (This smell… is it from your…?) Trying to deflect, Priya shifts on her feet. PRIYA Andar ja sakti hoon? (Can I go inside now?) With a displeased wave forward, Sunita gestures toward the interior. Priya passes by with the waddle of the defeated, clutching the rear of her outfit. A few steps in, the smell permeating, Sunita calls to her, taunting. SUNITA (CONT'D) Priya, ruk! (Priya, stop!) Priya halts, her back to her mother as Sunita chides her. SUNITA (CONT'D) Kitni gandi baat hai. (This is so filthy.) Priya responds with a whine, deflecting blame. PRIYA Tumhari wajah se hua hai! (It’s because of you!) Sunita is both outraged and amused. SUNITA Koi bhi excuse nahi chalega. (No excuse is acceptable.) Priya, indignant but playful, insists. PRIYA Par mujhe bahut zor se aa rahi thi. (But I really had to go.) She tentatively feels the pronounced bulk, grimacing at its reality yet acquiescing to its relief. PRIYA (CONT'D) Lekin... achha laga. (But... it felt good.) Sunita is having none of it, grabbing her daughter to buttress her scolding. SUNITA (mocking) Ab kya khush ho gandi harkat pe? (Happy now with your filthy deed?) Priya protests halfheartedly as her mother inspects her soiled pants, Sunita's taunts continue. PRIYA Bohot zyada tha pet mein. (There was a lot in my stomach.) Priya's comments spark fresh outrage in Sunita, who proclaims. SUNITA (infantilizing) Agar tumhara itna mann hai, toh tumhe bachche ki tarah treat karna padega. (If you’re so inclined, I should treat you like a child.) Sunita theatrically sniffs the seat of Priya's pants, her mock disgust palpable. SUNITA (CONT'D) Kitni smelly hai ye! (How smelly this is!) Priya smirks with resignation. PRIYA (sarcastically) Toh rakho yahin mujhe. (Then keep me here.) A firm shove from Sunita sends Priya off towards cleaning, their banter continuing. SUNITA Bathroom jaao, ab. (Go to the bathroom, now.) They progress in comedic fashion, Priya's waddle and Sunita's disgusted guidance a humorous foil. PRIYA Lagta hai, gir jaayega. (Feels like it’s going to fall out.) SUNITA Sambhal ke! (Be careful!) Upon reaching the bathroom, Priya's impudence peaks. PRIYA (teasing) Maa, mera diaper badal do? (Mom, will you change my diaper?) In ultimate playful retaliation and peak frustration, Sunita pushes Priya in, squashing the mishap further. SUNITA (with motherly indignation) Ab andar jao! (Get in there now!) As Priya's pants receive their final ignominious treatment, she yelps, entering the bathroom. PRIYA Aaah! Ab toh aur bikhar gaya. (Now it's even more spread out.) Cut to Sunita, still holding her nose, grumbling as Priya's mess is finally contained behind the bathroom door.

Here's a simple example of a 2D Gaussian blur shader for GLSL: Vertex Shader (vertex_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core layout (location = 0) in vec2 aPos; layout (location = 1) in vec2 aTexCoords; out vec2 TexCoords; void main() { gl_Position = vec4(aPos.x, aPos.y, 0.0, 1.0); TexCoords = aTexCoords; } \`\`\` Fragment Shader (fragment_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core out vec4 FragColor; in vec2 TexCoords; uniform sampler2D screenTexture; uniform vec2 resolution; uniform float blurRadius; const float pi = 3.14159265; // Function to calculate Gaussian weight float Gaussian(float x, float sigma) { return exp(-(x * x) / (2.0 * sigma * sigma)) / (2.0 * pi * sigma * sigma); } void main() { vec2 tex_offset = 1.0 / resolution; // Gets the size of one texel float sigma = blurRadius / 3.0; // Define the sigma value for the Gaussian function; the divide by 3 rule creates a nice fall-off float weightSum = Gaussian(0.0, sigma); // Calculate the central weight vec4 blurColor = texture(screenTexture, TexCoords) * weightSum; // Apply central texel's color by the central weight // Number of samples on each side of the central texel int blurSize = int(ceil(3.0 * sigma)); // Accumulate fragment color from neighboring texels for (int x = -blurSize; x <= blurSize; x++) { for (int y = -blurSize; y <= blurSize; y++) { // Do not blur the center twice if (x == 0 && y == 0) continue; // Calculate the weight for the current texel float w = Gaussian(distance(vec2(x, y), vec2(0.0)), sigma); blurColor += texture(screenTexture, TexCoords + vec2(tex_offset.x * x, tex_offset.y * y)) * w; weightSum += w; } } // Normalize the blurred color by the total weightSum FragColor = blurColor / weightSum; } \`\`\` This shader assumes that you pass in the texture you want to blur, the resolution of the screen (or the texture), and the radius of the blur effect. You'll need to set up a quad that spans the entire screen and render it with this shader. Note that this is a very simple and not optimized way to do a blur effect. For a faster and more efficient blur, you might want to look into techniques such as two-pass Gaussian blurs, where you blur the scene horizontally in one pass and then vertically in another, making use of linear filtering to reduce the number of texture samples required. Remember that if you run this shader in a WebGL context, replace \`#version 330 core\` with a suitable WebGL \`#version\` shader directive (e.g., \`#version 300 es\` for WebGL 2.0)."},{"prompt":"glsl wave shader","completion":"A wave shader can simulate the visual effect of waves, such as water waves, across a flat surface. The effect can be achieved by distorting the texture coordinates based on a sine wave or a similar periodic function. Below is an example of a simple GLSL fragment shader that applies a wave effect to a texture, creating the appearance of vertical waves moving horizontally across the texture. Vertex Shader (vertex_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos; layout (location = 1) in vec2 aTexCoords; out vec2 TexCoords; void main() { gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 1.0); TexCoords = aTexCoords; } \`\`\` Fragment Shader (fragment_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core out vec4 FragColor; in vec2 TexCoords; uniform sampler2D uTexture; uniform float uTime; // Uniform value representing the elapsed time since the start void main() { // Set the wave parameters float waveAmplitude = 0.1; // Amplitude of the wave float waveFrequency = 3.0; // Frequency of the wave float waveSpeed = 1.5; // Speed at which the wave moves // Calculate the wave displacement based on the y coordinate and time float wave = sin(TexCoords.y * waveFrequency + uTime * waveSpeed) * waveAmplitude; // Add horizontal movement to the waves float waveXMovement = 0.25 * sin(uTime * 0.5); // Apply the wave effect to the texture coordinates vec2 distortedTexCoords = TexCoords + vec2(wave + waveXMovement, 0.0); // Sample the texture with the distorted coordinates to produce the wave effect FragColor = texture(uTexture, distortedTexCoords); } \`\`\` This fragment shader uses a sine function to create the wave effect. The \`uTime\` uniform needs to be continuously updated by your application (usually on the CPU side) with the elapsed time, which allows the waves to animate over time. The \`waveAmplitude\`, \`waveFrequency\`, and \`waveSpeed\` values are parameters that you can adjust to change the appearance of the waves. The vertex shader is just a pass-through shader that doesn't alter the geometry and passes the texture coordinates through to the fragment shader. It's worth noting here that this is a basic example. Depending on the complexity of the wave effect you're trying to create, you might approach it differently, with more sophisticated mathematics, normal mapping for the appearance of lighting on water, or other techniques."},{"prompt":"absolutely basic GLSL shader example","completion":"An absolutely basic GLSL shader example consists of two parts: the vertex shader and the fragment shader. The vertex shader processes each vertex passed to the GPU, and the fragment shader determines the color of each pixel. Here is a minimal example of a GLSL shader pair that renders a colored triangle on the screen. Vertex Shader (basic_vertex_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos; // Position input void main() { gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 1.0); // Set the position } \`\`\` Fragment Shader (basic_fragment_shader.glsl): \`\`\`glsl #version 330 core out vec4 FragColor; // Output that will be written to the framebuffer void main() { FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 1.0); // Set the output color to orange } \`\`\` In this most basic example, the vertex shader takes the vertex positions (\`aPos\`) and simply passes them to the rasterizer by setting \`gl_Position\`. The fragment shader sets the color of each pixel to a static value, resulting in an orange triangle. Usage of this shader would require setting up a triangle using vertex data on the CPU side, activating this shader program, and issuing a draw call for the triangle geometry. These shaders are written with OpenGL Core Profile 3.3 in mind, which is the version that introduced the \`#version 330 core\` directive. For other contexts, like OpenGL ES and WebGL, you would use slightly different version declarations and potentially make syntax adjustments. For example, in WebGL you would write \`#version 300 es\` for GLSL ES 3.00, which corresponds with WebGL 2.0."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity; all dialogues in the scene should have quotidian, simple language that people would actually use in such a scenario, with no excessive flourishes; all events and dialogues that occur once the returning woman enters the house should be elaborated upon in detail, without any of the prompts being omitted) in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young Mexican American woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she has a loving but testy relationship with the present woman; she has an aversion from pooping in bathrooms outside the privacy of her home and is secretive about her bowel movements; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans in the scene) is returning home from an evening out and approaching the door of her family’s apartment with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"Title: \\"The Unfortunate Homecoming\\" Episode: \\"The Lockout\\" Genre: Comedy Drama Scene: \\"The Threshold Misadventure\\" FADE IN: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, CORRIDOR - NIGHT Young Mexican American woman, LUISA (26, wearing loose-fitting joggers and a cozy sweatshirt, hair tied up in a bun) is brisk-walking down the corridor. She has an urgent stride as she fumbles through her purse. The atmosphere hints at previous events. Earlier in the evening, Luisa faced a dilemma: Her bowels demanded freedom while she was out, but her aversion to public restrooms constrained them in painful silence. That, coupled with her secretiveness about such matters, has left her in dire straits as she approaches her family's apartment door. LUISA (muttering to herself) Where are they? Come on, keys... Her hand rummages desperately. No keys. Her face paints a mix of panic and need for relief. She pounds on the door. CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Luisa knocks frantically, dancing in place as she squeezes her midsection, working to hold in the impending eruption. A beat of silence – too long for Luisa's comfort – passes before... MARIA (50s, kind-faced, with a comfort-first fashion sense indicative of one who favors function over form), Luisa's mother, shouts from within. MARIA (O.S.) (through the door) ¿Quién es? What’s happening? LUISA (pained yet urgent) Mom, it's me! Open the door, please. Quick! Luisa is nearly hopping now, each passing second dragging out like torture. INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Maria unlocks the door, methodical and oblivious to the urgency. Luisa's patience evaporates. LUISA (desperately) Mom, hurry! The door swings open. Maria stands there, puzzlement written over her concerned features. Luisa tries to push past, but Maria's maternal instincts kick in; she clutches Luisa. MARIA (stern yet concerned) Mija, what’s wrong with you? Luisa squirms to free herself. Their family bickering kicks in. LUISA (pleading) Mom, just let me go! Please! Maria tightens her grip, interrogative, protective. MARIA You’re scaring me. What’s happening? It’s the climax: Luisa can’t hold it anymore. A groan escapes, her expression aghast and relieved all at once. She gives into the inevitable, soiling her pants. LUISA (grunting; soft, relief-filled satisfaction) Oh God... I... I can’t... Maria, eyes wide, loosens her grip, at a loss. MARIA (faltering) Luisa, mijita...? Bewilderment hangs in the air as Luisa, with soft grunts, continues. Maria stares, a mix of confusion and dawning realization. Now fully inside, Maria sniffs tentatively, recoils, and voices her dawning horror. MARIA (exasperated disbelief) Luisa, did you...? No... Luisa's eyes plead with her mother, and she gingerly holds the seat of her pants to contain the disaster. LUISA (sheepishly) Can I just go to the bathroom now? Maria steps aside, disgust written all over her. MARIA (trying to comprehend) I just...did you...is it...from your pants? LUISA (waddling; sheepishly sullen) It wasn’t my fault, okay? Maria halts Luisa's advance, her face wrinkles in reproach. MARIA (taunting) This is no excuse for someone your age! Luisa plays the blame game. LUISA (playfully sulking) It's your fault – you took ages and blocked me! Maria incredulously retorts. MARIA (scolding) You just stood there and did... that! Luisa responds, stubbornly defensive. LUISA (appraising the bulk; wry complacency) I had to go. It just felt... relieving. As Luisa tries to leave, Maria grabs hold of her, reprimanding. MARIA (mocking) Nasty! You got some satisfaction from this? Curiosity overcomes her disgust. Maria peers at the bulging pants as Luisa timidly shows them off. LUISA (awkwardly conceding) Yeah, it’s full. And yes, it...well...it helped. Maria's face twists; she's incredulous yet infantilizing. MARIA (inspecting and sniffing; mocking) You're just a smelly little child now! Luisa cringes, embarrassment mixing with stubborn satisfaction. LUISA (admitting; playful yet sullen) Fine, since you’re keeping me here... Maria dismisses her comment with a scolding finality. MARIA (urgently herding) Enough. You stink. Go clean up. Now! With assisting hands, they shuffle off. Maria's nose scrunches, her complaints audible against Luisa's blushing cringes. LUISA (bashful) It feels like it’s going to fall... Maria reiterates her exasperated warnings. MARIA (careful; disgusted) Don't you dare make more mess! INT. BATHROOM THRESHOLD - MOMENTS LATER Luisa's final tease is interrupted as Maria pushes her playfully yet firmly into the bathroom, the mess inside her pants spreading. LUISA (outrage; disgust) Oh! That's so gross! Maria finally lets her grudgingly go, lingering complaints melding with disdain. MARIA (holding nose; exasperated) Just clean up your dirty, smelly self! The bathroom door shuts on the humiliating yet humorous scene. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"This video showcases part of the 2006 CBBC pre-7am promo loop, which showcases the content on the channel, It cuts off after a few seconds because I taped over it in 2011 with a few episodes of GoGoRiki on Pop.

Voici une explication de chaque terme et leur différence: 1. Biopolymère: Un biopolymère est un polymère qui est produit par des êtres vivants, c'est-à-dire qu'il est d'origine biologique. Les biopolymères comprennent des substances comme les protéines, l'ADN, l'ARN, la cellulose et le chitosane. Ce sont des chaînes longues de molécules, produites par des organismes vivants, qui jouent un rôle crucial dans les fonctions biologiques. Les biopolymères peuvent être bio-dégradables, mais pas nécessairement. Cela dépend de leur structure chimique et de l'environnement dans lequel ils se trouvent. 2. Bioplastique: Un bioplastique est un type de plastique qui est soit bio-sourcé, soit biodégradable, ou les deux. Les bioplastiques bio-sourcés sont fabriqués à partir de ressources renouvelables, comme la canne à sucre, l'amidon de maïs, ou les lipides. Cela contraste avec les plastiques traditionnels qui sont généralement dérivés de combustibles fossiles. Certains bioplastiques sont également biodégradables, ce qui signifie qu'ils peuvent être décomposés par des micro-organismes en conditions naturelles ou industrielles pour revenir à des composés plus simples. Cependant, tous les bioplastiques ne sont pas biodégradables. 3. Polymère biodégradable: Un polymère biodégradable est un type de plastique qui peut être décomposé par des micro-organismes comme les bactéries et les champignons en eau, dioxyde de carbone (ou méthane dans des conditions anaérobies), et de la biomasse. La biodégradation des polymères dépend de leur structure chimique ainsi que des conditions environnementales. Les polymères biodégradables peuvent être soit bio-sourcés (comme le PLA, acide polylactique, fabriqué à partir de ressources végétales) soit synthétiques (comme le PBAT, adipate / téréphtalate de polybutylène, fabriqué à partir de produits chimiques pétrochimiques). En résumé: - Un biopolymère est une substance naturelle fabriquée par les organismes vivants. - Un bioplastique est un plastique qui est soit fait de matières premières renouvelables, soit biodégradable, ou les deux. - Un polymère biodégradable est un type de plastique (qu'il soit bio-sourcé ou pétrochimique) qui peut être décomposé par des organismes naturels. Ainsi, tous les biopolymères sont bio-sourcés par définition, mais ils ne sont pas tous biodégradables ou utilisés comme matériaux plastiques. De même, tous les bioplastiques sont soit bio-sourcés, soit biodégradables, voire les deux, mais ils ne sont pas nécessairement issus de biopolymères naturels. Enfin, les polymères biodégradables sont conçus pour se décomposer dans l'environnement, mais ils ne proviennent pas nécessairement de ressources renouvelables."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Questo processo consiste nel dividere le tabelle del database in parti più piccole e ottimizzate in modo che ogni tabella rappresenti un singolo tema o concetto. Gli obiettivi principali della normalizzazione sono: 1. Evitare la ridondanza dei dati: memorizzare la stessa informazione più volte può portare a disallineamenti e confusione. 2. Assicurare che i dati siano dipendenti in modo logico: tutte le informazioni in una tabella dovrebbero dipendere dalla chiave primaria. 3. Facilitare l'inserimento, l'aggiornamento e l'eliminazione dei dati, riducendo così la possibilità di errori. La normalizzazione si articola in diversi \\"livelli\\" chiamati \\"forme normali\\" (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF, 6NF). Ecco una breve sintesi dei primi tre, che sono i più comunemente utilizzati: 1. Prima Forma Normale (1NF): richiede che in una tabella non ci siano gruppi ripetuti di campi, cioè i campi devono essere atomici e ogni record deve essere unico (cioè non ci possono essere duplicati). 2. Seconda Forma Normale (2NF): si basa sull'essere già in 1NF e richiede che tutti gli attributi non-chiave siano dipendenti in modo funzionale dalla chiave primaria intera. Questo significa eliminare le dipendenze funzionali parziali (attributi dipendenti solo da una parte della chiave primaria). 3. Terza Forma Normale (3NF): è necessario essere in 2NF e inoltre tutti gli attributi non-chiave devono dipendere solo dalla chiave primaria, e non da altre non-chiavi. In questo modo si eliminano le dipendenze funzionali transitive (quando un attributo non-chiave dipende da un altro attributo non-chiave). Forme normali successive affrontano questioni più complesse e sono meno frequentemente implementate. La normalizzazione è un compromesso tra efficienza dell'accesso ai dati e rapidità di manipolazione (modifica) dei dati. In alcuni casi, per motivi di performance, si può scegliere una \\"denormalizzazione\\" intenzionale, mantenendo una certa ridondanza dei dati per migliorare le prestazioni di lettura a scapito dello spazio di archiviazione e della difficoltà di mantenere i dati consistenti."},{"prompt":"Cosa si intende per Integrità referenziale?","completion":"L'integrità referenziale è un concetto chiave nel design e nella gestione di un database relazionale che assicura la coerenza e la correttezza delle relazioni tra le tabelle. In un database relazionale, l'integrità referenziale si rifà alla proprietà che impone restrizioni sulle relazioni inter-tabella per mantenere la consistenza dei dati, in particolare quando si aggiungono, cancellano o modificano i record. L'integrità referenziale è comunemente applicata attraverso il meccanismo delle chiavi esterne (foreign keys). Una chiave esterna è un campo (o una combinazione di campi) in una tabella che corrisponde univocamente alla chiave primaria (primary key) di un'altra tabella. Il suo scopo è creare un link logico tra i record di due tabelle, indicando che i record in una tabella sono relazionati a record nell'altra tabella. Ecco alcuni principi dell'integrità referenziale: - **Vincoli di Chiave Esterna**: Le chiavi esterne devono corrispondere ai valori di un'altra tabella o essere null (se concesso). Questo assicura che non possano esistere riferimenti a dati che non esistono (record orfani). - **Regole di Azione Referenziale**: Quando si effettua un'operazione su una tabella che potrebbe violare l'integrità referenziale (come l'eliminazione o la modifica di un record collegato), il DBMS (Database Management System) eseguirà un'azione definita da queste regole. Queste possono includere: - **CASCADE**: se un record viene cancellato o modificato, queste modifiche si propagheranno verso i record collegati nelle altre tabelle. - **SET NULL**: se un record viene cancellato o il suo riferimento chiave primaria viene modificato, i corrispondenti campi delle chiavi esterne nei record collegati vengono impostati a NULL. - **SET DEFAULT**: simile a SET NULL, ma i campi delle chiavi esterne vengono impostati a un valore di default. - **NO ACTION/RESTRICT**: impedisce la cancellazione o la modifica del record nella tabella originale se ci sono record correlati che dipendono da esso. L'integrità referenziale è fondamentale per evitare anomalie nei database, come l’inserimento di dati inconsistenti o la perdita di dati critici, e per assicurare che le relazioni tra tabelle siano logicamente coerenti e facilmente navigabili."},{"prompt":"Cosa è un'Istanza Valida di R?","completion":"In informatica e database, un'istanza valida di R è un termine che può riferirsi a un insieme di dati o record specifici che rispettano una data relazione R. \\"R\\" in questo contesto è spesso usato per rappresentare uno schema di relazione in un database relazionale o un tipo di dato in un linguaggio di programmazione. Esaminiamo cosa significa questo nelle due diverse aree: # Database Relazionali In un database relazionale, uno schema di relazione R descrive la struttura di una tabella, ovvero elenca le colonne (attributi) e i tipi di dati che possono avere, oltre a definire le chiavi primarie e le possibili chiavi esterne. Un'istanza valida di tale schema di relazione R è quindi un insieme concreto di record o righe che popolano la tabella seguendo le regole definite dallo schema, inclusive di: - Rispetto dei tipi di dati specificati per ciascun attributo. - Unicità dei valori della chiave primaria (ogni riga deve essere unica nella tabella). - Soddisfazione dei vincoli di integrità referenziale, se ci sono chiavi esterne. - Adesione ad altri vincoli come vincoli di integrità di dominio, vincoli CHECK, vincoli UNIQUE, ecc. # Programmazione In contesti di programmazione, R potrebbe riferirsi a una classe o un tipo di dato. Un'istanza valida in questo scenario sarebbe un oggetto o una variabile che ha un valore che corrisponde alla definizione della classe o del tipo di dato. In ambedue i casi, l'\\"istanza valida\\" è un concetto importante per garantire che i dati o gli oggetti manipolati rispettino le strutture e i vincoli definiti, sostentando così la correttezza e la prevedibilità del sistema."},{"prompt":"Che differenza c'è tra Dipendenza Funzionale e Chiave?","completion":"In teoria dei database, la dipendenza funzionale e il concetto di chiave sono entrambi elementi fondamentali per comprendere l'organizzazione e l'integrità dei dati all'interno di un database relazionale, ma hanno significati e impieghi differenti. # Dipendenza Funzionale Una dipendenza funzionale è una relazione tra due insiemi di attributi in una relazione di un database. Più formalmente, se abbiamo una relazione R e due suoi sottoinsiemi di attributi X e Y, diciamo che \\"Y è funzionalmente dipendente da X\\" (denotato come X → Y) se e solo se ogni volta che due tuple (record) di R hanno lo stesso valore per X, esse hanno anche lo stesso valore per Y. In altre parole, il valore di X determina univocamente il valore di Y. Le dipendenze funzionali sono utilizzate per definire le forme normali di un database; esse sono essenziali per il processo di normalizzazione, ovvero per l'organizzazione delle tabelle in modo da ridurre la ridondanza e migliorare l'integrità dei dati. # Chiave Una chiave, nell'ambito di un database, è un attributo o un insieme di attributi che viene usato per identificare univocamente una tupla all'interno di una relazione. Le chiavi sono importanti in quanto garantiscono che ogni record in una tabella sia unico e possa essere individuato indipendentemente dagli altri. Esistono diversi tipi di chiavi: - **Chiave Primaria (Primary Key)**: Un'insieme minimo di attributi (spesso uno solo) che possono identificare univocamente ogni record all'interno di una tabella. Ogni tabella dovrebbe avere una chiave primaria e i valori di questa chiave devono essere unici e non nulli. - **Chiave Candidata (Candidate Key)**: Una chiave candidata è una versione più generale della chiave primaria. Qualsiasi attributo o insieme di attributi che può identificare univocamente i record in una tabella è considerato una chiave candidata. Se ci sono più chiavi candidate, una viene scelta come chiave primaria e le altre sono chiamate chiavi alternative (Alternate Keys). - **Chiave Esterna (Foreign Key)**: Un attributo o insieme di attributi che stabilisce un legame di riferimento tra i dati di due tabelle, dove la chiave esterna in una tabella corrisponde alla chiave primaria di un'altra tabella. In sintesi, la dipendenza funzionale è un concetto che descrive una relazione generica tra attributi all'interno di una tabella e viene usata, tra le altre cose, per definire le proprietà delle chiavi. Una chiave, invece, è un attributo specifico (o un insieme di essi) che serve per identificare univocamente gli elementi (tupla) di una tabella."},{"prompt":"Fattore di caricamento, cosa e' ?","completion":"Il \\"fattore di caricamento\\" può avere significati diversi a seconda del contesto in cui viene utilizzato. Qui ci sono due contesti comuni in cui si incontra questo termine: # Informatica – Hashing Nel contesto delle strutture dati di hash, il fattore di caricamento, denominato anche come \\"load factor\\", è una misura che indica quanto una tabella hash è piena. Si calcola dividendo il numero di elementi presenti nella tabella hash per il numero totale di bucket (spazio di indirizzamento) disponibili. [ text{Fattore di Caricamento} = frac{text{Numero di Elementi nella Tabella Hash}}{text{Numero totale di Bucket}} ] Un fattore di caricamento alto significa che la tabella hash è più piena, il che può aumentare la probabilità di collisioni — situazioni in cui più chiavi vengono mappate allo stesso indice di bucket. Queste collisioni, a loro volta, possono degradare le prestazioni della struttura dati, rendendo le operazioni di ricerca, inserimento ed eliminazione potenzialmente meno efficienti. Per gestire al meglio il fattore di caricamento, molti sistemi implementano una strategia di ridimensionamento (rehashing) in cui la tabella hash viene espansa e tutti gli elementi vengono riassegnati ai bucket ogni volta che il fattore di caricamento raggiunge una certa soglia. # Ingegneria In ingegneria, in particolare nel campo delle costruzioni e del design strutturale, il \\"fattore di caricamento\\" può riferirsi a una misura della capacità di carico di una struttura rispetto al carico effettivamente applicato. Questo termine può essere correlato al concetto di sicurezza, ovvero il margine tra il carico effettivo che la struttura deve sostenere e il carico massimo che essa può sostenere prima di fallire. Questo tipo di fattore di caricamento è usato per garantire che la struttura sia sicura e affidabile durante il suo utilizzo previsto."},{"prompt":"Puoi spiegari gli assiomi di Armstrong nel contesto delle Dipendenze Funzionali? Grazie","completion":"Gli assiomi di Armstrong sono regole utilizzate nel contesto dei database relazionali per inferire tutte le possibili dipendenze funzionali (DF) a partire da un insieme di DF date. Si tratta di un insieme di regole logiche che possono essere applicate ripetutamente per derivare tutte le dipendenze che si applicano a uno schema di database, data una serie iniziale di dipendenze funzionali conosciute. Questi assiomi sono stati definiti da William W. Armstrong nel 1974 e sono fondamentali per il processo di normalizzazione di database. I tre assiomi di base di Armstrong sono: 1. **Riflessività (o Assegnazione)**: Se in un'insieme di attributi Y tutto l'insieme X è presente, allora X può determinare Y (X → Y). In altre parole, se Y è un sottoinsieme di X, allora si ha che X → Y. Questo è intuitivo poiché se hai tutte le informazioni di X, di certo hai anche le informazioni contenute in un suo sottoinsieme Y. [ X supseteq Y Rightarrow X → Y ] 2. **Potenziamento (o Ampliamento)**: Se una dipendenza X → Y esiste, allora è possibile aggiungere altri attributi a entrambi i lati della dipendenza, mantenendo valida la dipendenza stessa. [ X → Y Rightarrow XZ → YZ ] Ciò significa che se sappiamo che un insieme di attributi X determina un insieme Y, l'aggiunta di ulteriori attributi Z a entrambi gli insiemi non cambierà la verità della dipendenza. 3. **Transitività**: Se due dipendenze funzionali X → Y e Y → Z esistono, possiamo inferire una terza dipendenza funzionale X → Z (se X determina Y e Y determina Z, allora X determina anche Z). [ X → Y text{ e } Y → Z Rightarrow X → Z ] Questi sono gli assiomi di base, ma esistono anche regole derivate che possono essere ottenute combinando gli assiomi di base tra loro. Tra le regole derivate più comuni troviamo: - **Unione**: Se X → Y e X → Z, allora X determina anche la combinazione degli attributi Y e Z, ovvero X → YZ. - **Decomposizione (o Proiezione)**: Se X → YZ, allora possiamo decomporre in X → Y e X → Z. - **Pseudotransitività**: Se X → Y e YZ → W, allora possiamo inferire che XZ → W. Questi assiomi e regole derivate sono estremamente utili per la teoria relazionale, specialmente nel processo di normalizzazione dei database, dove l'obiettivo è quello di strutturare le tabelle in modo da ridurre la ridondanza e aumentare la coerenza dei dati attraverso la corretta identificazione e applicazione delle dipendenze funzionali."},{"prompt":"Spiegami questa definizione di Derivazione: Una derivazione di f da F è una sequenza finita f1,..., fm di dipendenze, dove fm= f e ogni fi è un elemento di F oppure è ottenuta dalla precedenti f1,..., fi-1 della derivazione usando una regola di inferenza.","completion":"La definizione di derivazione che hai fornito si riferisce alla maniera in cui possono essere generate nuove dipendenze funzionali partendo da un insieme dato di dipendenze funzionali in un database relazionale. Questo processo è fondamentale per lavorare con le proprietà teoriche dei database relazionali, in particolare nel contesto della normalizzazione. In questa definizione: - **f**: Rappresenta la dipendenza funzionale finale che vogliamo dimostrare o derivare. - **F**: È l'insieme base delle dipendenze funzionali (DF) note, quelle da cui partiamo. - **f1, ..., fm**: Rappresentano la sequenza di dipendenze funzionali che costituiscono la derivazione. Un passaggio chiave in questa definizione è il concetto di \\"regola di inferenza\\". Una regola di inferenza è una legge logica che ci dice come possiamo validamente passare da alcuni enunciati (in questo caso, dipendenze funzionali) ad altri. Nel contesto dei database relazionali, queste regole sono spesso gli assiomi di Armstrong, che include la riflessività, il potenziamento, e la transitività, oltre ad altre regole che possono derivarne, come l'unione e la decomposizione. Quindi, una derivazione di una dipendenza funzionale **f** dall'insieme **F** significa che esiste un modo di partire dalle dipendenze note in **F** e, utilizzando una serie di passi (ciascuno dei quali è rappresentato dalle dipendenze **f1,..., fi,..., fm**), arrivare a concludere che la dipendenza **f** è una conseguenza logica di quelle in **F**. Ogni passo nella sequenza (**fi**) può essere una delle seguenti: 1. Un membro dell'insieme originario delle dipendenze funzionali **F** (si parte da ciò che è già noto). 2. Una dipendenza funzionale che è stata ottenuta applicando una regola di inferenza alle dipendenze precedenti nella sequenza (cioè, derivandole da quelle già stabilite come valide nei passi precedenti). Questo procedimento mostra come si possa \\"costruire\\" tutte le dipendenze deducibili e quindi implicite nell'insieme **F**, inclusa, in ultima istanza, la dipendenza **f** di interesse. Quando si fa questo in un contesto sistematico, come durante la normalizzazione di uno schema di database, stiamo essenzialmente cercando di capire tutte le dipendenze che esistono tra gli attributi delle nostre tabelle in modo da organizzarli nel modo più efficiente e logico possibile."},{"prompt":"Cosa è una chiave candidata?","completion":"Una chiave candidata è un termine utilizzato nel modello relazionale dei database per indicare un insieme di attributi che può identificare univocamente ogni tupla (record) in una relazione (tabella). In altre parole, è un insieme minimale di attributi tale che non ci sono due tuple diverse nella relazione che hanno gli stessi valori in tutti gli attributi di questa chiave. Una relazione può avere più di una chiave candidata e ciascuna di esse è potenzialmente in grado di fungere da chiave primaria. Di solito, gli sviluppatori o i progettisti del database selezionano una di queste chiavi candidate come chiave primaria in base a criteri come l'efficienza, l'usabilità, la significatività di business, ecc. Le caratteristiche principali di una chiave candidata sono: 1. Unicità: Nessuna coppia di tuple può avere lo stesso valore nei campi che formano la chiave candidata. Questo assicura che la chiave possa servire a identificare in modo unico ogni record. 2. Minimalità: La chiave candidata è un insieme di attributi minimale; l'eliminazione di qualsiasi attributo dalla chiave candidata la priverebbe della sua proprietà di unicità. In altre parole, se una chiave candidata ha n attributi, nessun sottoinsieme di meno di n attributi è sufficiente a mantenere la proprietà di unicità. Ogni chiave candidata che non sia selezionata come chiave primaria è spesso denominata \\"chiave alternativa\\". Nel caso in cui un database sia progettato in maniera tale che ci sia soltanto una chiave candidata identificabile, quella sarà per necessità anche la chiave primaria della tabella. Per esempio, considerando una tabella \\"Studenti\\" in un database scolastico, possibili chiavi candidate potrebbero essere \\"Numero di Matricola\\" (ogni studente ha un numero di matricola unico e nessun altro studente condivide lo stesso numero) o una combinazione di \\"Nome\\", \\"Cognome\\" e \\"Data di Nascita\\" (assumendo che non ci siano due studenti con esattamente lo stesso nome, cognome e data di nascita). Di queste chiavi candidate, il \\"Numero di Matricola\\" potrebbe essere scelto come chiave primaria per la sua semplicità ed efficacia nell'identificare ogni studente."},{"prompt":"Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"# Background Before the current scene begins, we follow the young Mexican American woman, whom we'll call Rosa, as she spends the day running errands with her friends around their bustling town just north of the Mexican border. The vibrant streets are lined with flamboyant food stalls and cafes, one of which Rosa and her friends stop at for lunch. Rosa, against her own common sense perhaps, indulges in an especially spicy and exotic street taco, filled with mysterious but flavorful ingredients. The day is pleasant but lengthy, and the friends lose track of time, chatting, shopping, and enjoying the sunny weather. As the sun begins to set, Rosa's stomach starts to gurgle ominously. She dismisses the discomfort initially, but it quickly escalates. Recognizing the urgent call of nature, she bids her friends a hasty farewell and rushes toward home. Unfortunately, in her distracted state, she overlooks her body's increasing signals, neglecting to use the restrooms at any of the cafes or shops along the way. Confidence in her self-control wanes as she reaches her block, with the pressing urgency now painfully apparent and her destination within sight. Her situation becomes dire as she reaches her family's front door, rifling through her bag only to realize in horror that her house key is unaccountably missing. # Screenplay/Scene: \\"The Front Door Fiasco\\" **EXT. ROSA'S FAMILY HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON** *Rosa, a young woman in her mid-twenties with long, wavy black hair in a loose ponytail, and wearing a pair of comfortable khaki cargo pants and a plain t-shirt, is seen power-walking up to the front door of a modest, warmly-lit family home. Her pace is rushed; her face etched with barely-contained discomfort and urgency.* **INT. ROSA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** *On the other side of the door, we see MARIA, a woman in her early fifties, with a kind face and greying hair, busying herself in the kitchen, humming to a song on the radio that fills the warm space.* **EXT. ROSA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** *Rosa frantically searches her bag, discarding objects left and right - a wallet, a half-eaten pack of gum, a small notepad, but no key. Panic sets in. The comedic turmoil is punctuated with her pained dance, as she hops from one foot to the other.* **Rosa:** (urgent whisper to herself) Oh, please no... *With a hastily increasing desperation, she hammers on the house door.* **Rosa:** (shouts) ¡Mamá! ¡Abre la puerta! Por favor, rápido! **INT. ROSA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** *Maria's brow furrows in slight annoyance at the interruption, placing a hand on her hip as she calls out.* **Maria:** (annoyed but curious) ¿Qué pasa? ¡Estoy viniendo! **EXT./INT. ROSA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** *The front door slowly swings open, revealing the two women. Rosa's oscillating between foot tapping and squirming is almost balletic in its urgency.* **Rosa:** (pleading, voice straining) Mamá, ¡Apúrate! Move, please! *Maria's maternal instincts flare up, sensing distress. She steps forward and forcibly grabs Rosa's shoulders, worried.* **Maria:** (concerned) Mija, ¿qué pasa? ¿Estás bien? **Rosa:** (frantic, not specifically disclosing the nature of her urgency) Mamá, *please*! I gotta get past you! *Their bickering becomes a tango of interruption and physical jostling - skirmishing for control.* **Maria:** (while holding Rosa) But tell me, what's wrong? **Rosa:** (near tears) I can't— ¡Déjame entrar! *As Maria tightens her grasp in concern, Rosa's body succumbs. Her face abruptly shifts from tension to shocking calm as she loses control.* **Maria:** (releasing her grip, confused) ¿Qué te pasa? *Rosa, assuming a slight squat, continues in relieved, shushed grunts.* **Rosa:** (strained, nearly absent-minded) Oh Dios, finally... *Maria instinctively fans the air as a foul aroma becomes apparent.* **Maria:** (scrunching her nose, intuition dawning) ¿Rosa, qué es ese olor? *Rosa, head hung low, shoulders hunched in mortification, refuses to make eye contact.* **Maria:** (disbelief dawning) Rosa, ¿hiciste...? ¿En serio? **Rosa:** (leans forward, childlike embarrassment) Can you just let me in now? *Maria steps aside, still reeling from the smell.* **Maria:** (to herself) Dios mio... *Rosa navigates past her, holding the seat of her pants, her walk awkward but hurried.* **Maria:** (pointing at her, reprimanding) Ridiculous! Don't you dare drop anything on my clean floor! *Rosa**: (pouting, but facing her misdemeanor head-on) This wouldn't have happened if you had just— ¡No me detengas! **Maria:** (mockingly) As if that's an excuse! For heaven's sake, you're an adult, not a toddler. *Rosa:** (insisting, bravado seeping in) I couldn't hold it! It's your fault! **Maria:** (disdainful, inspecting) Mira esto. (sniffing and recoiling) ¡Qué asco! *Rosa:** (slightly smirking despite herself, yet flinching) It was... necessary. **Maria:** (with mock sympathy) Pobrecita. Quieres que te cambie el pañal también? *Rosa:** (regret mingling with her sass) Maybe you should, you didn't let me get to the bathroom. *Maria shuffles Rosa forward with comic disgust, her hand hovering behind Rosa's back, very much like guiding a toddler.* **Maria:** (continuing to cringe) ¡Pero qué hedor! Apúrate, please don't let anything fall! *Rosa:** (whining, playfulness tingeing the embarrassment) Feels like it might... Oh my god. *Finally, in the bathroom doorway, Rosa flashes a mischievous grin, despite her smelly predicament.* **Rosa:** (picking at the bulge and plugging her nose) So, you gonna help with this dirty \\"diaper\\"?

The specific page within the website is dedicated to generating science fiction systems for such games. The system generator allows users to create their own sci-fi worlds, complete with details on technology, planets, factions, and other crucial elements. It can be a useful tool for game masters or players looking for inspiration or a starting point for their own science fiction campaigns."},{"prompt":"How to decode star system generator in Donjon","completion":"To decode the star system generator in Donjon, follow these steps: 1. Open the Donjon website and navigate to the science fiction system generator page (https://donjon.bin.sh/scifi/system/). 2. On the page, you'll be presented with various options and parameters to customize your star system. These options include the number of stars, stellar type, the presence of habitable planets, and other details related to the generated system. 3. Start by choosing the number of stars in the system. You can select a single star system or a binary/trinary star system. This affects the overall structure and dynamics of the system. 4. Once you've selected the number of stars, you can then choose the type of stellar system. Options such as main sequence stars, red dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes might be available, depending on the generator. 5. Next, you can specify whether you want habitable planets in the system. This option determines if the generator will include any planets capable of supporting life, which can be useful for setting up potential storylines or locations for role-playing game sessions. 6. Additionally, you might be able to customize other variables like the number of planets in the system, the presence of asteroid belts, gas giants, or other celestial objects. These options depend on the specific generator you are using. 7. Once you have selected the desired parameters, click the \\"Generate\\" button to generate your star system. The system generator will use the chosen options to create a randomized star system with details such as planet names, orbital characteristics, climates, and other relevant information. 8. Review the generated star system and note down any specific details that interest you or could be useful for your tabletop role-playing game. These details can serve as elements for creating storylines, describing locations, or providing context for your science fiction campaign. Remember that Donjon's generators are based on random algorithms, so you might need to generate a few systems before finding one that suits your needs or sparks your creativity."},{"prompt":"Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

To save a file with a randomly generated name, you can use the \`uuid\` library or \`secrets\` library. **Note:** Before proceeding, please ensure you have the required permissions to scrape the websites you target. Not all websites allow scraping, and doing so against their terms of service can have legal repercussions. Here's a sample Python scraper that follows your instructions: \`\`\`python import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import os import random import string def generate_random_filename(extension): letters = string.ascii_lowercase filename = ''.join(random.choice(letters) for i in range(10)) + '.' + extension return filename def scrape_content(urls, save=False): for url in urls: # Send request to the URL try: response = requests.get(url) response.raise_for_status() # Raise an error if the request failed # Parse the content using BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser') # Find the div with data-type=\\"dot_art\\" dot_art_div = soup.find('div', {'data-type': 'dot_art'}) # Check if the div exists and process it if dot_art_div: content = dot_art_div.text print(content) # Print the contents of that div # Save content to a file with a randomly generated name if save: filename = generate_random_filename('txt') with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file: file.write(content) print(f\\"Content saved to {filename}\\") else: print(f\\"No 'dot_art' div found on {url}\\") except requests.HTTPError as e: print(f\\"Error fetching {url}: {e}\\") # List of URLs to scrape urls_to_scrape = [ 'http://example.com/page1', 'http://example.com/page2', # Add more URLs as needed ] scrape_content(urls_to_scrape, save=True) # Set save to True to save contents \`\`\` Before running this script, you need to install the required packages if you haven't already: \`\`\`bash pip install requests beautifulsoup4 \`\`\` This code sends HTTP GET requests to each URL in the \`urls_to_scrape\` list, looks for a \`<div>\` with \`data-type=\\"dot_art\\"\`, prints its content, and optionally saves it to a text file with a randomly generated filename. The filename is generated using the \`generate_random_filename\` function, which creates a random sequence of 10 lowercase letters and appends an extension to it. Remember that web scraping can be fragile due to the possibility of a website's structure changing. If a website updates its design or elements, the scraper might not work anymore and would require updates."},{"prompt":"it only looks at the first one, i want it to download all instances","completion":"Certainly!

Она играет важную роль в формировании мировоззрения, так как определяет, каким образом мы воспринимаем себя и свое место в обществе, а также влияет на наш подход к жизни и взаимодействие с другими людьми. Идентичность может быть связана с различными аспектами нашей жизни, включая гендерную принадлежность, этническую принадлежность, религиозную принадлежность, национальность, социальный класс, профессиональную принадлежность и другие. Каждый из этих аспектов формирует наше мировоззрение и влияет на наши ценности, убеждения и поведение. Идентичность помогает нам определиться с нашими целями, стремлениями и ролями в обществе. Она предлагает нам определенный рамки для самоидентификации и социальной принадлежности, что позволяет нам ощутить свою собственную значимость и место в мире. Идентичность также помогает нам находиться внутри определенных социальных и культурных групп, которые влияют на наши взгляды, убеждения и поведение. Однако идентичность не является статичной и может изменяться в течение времени под влиянием различных факторов, таких как опыт, образование, межличностные отношения и культурные влияния. Иногда мы можем пересмотреть свою идентичность и переопределить свое мировоззрение в результате этих изменений. Идентичность и мировоззрение взаимосвязаны и влияют друг на друга. Наша идентичность определяет, каким образом мы воспринимаем мир и оцениваем различные аспекты жизни. Она может формировать наши предпочтения, взгляды и убеждения, а также иметь влияние на нашу толерантность и понимание культурных различий. В свою очередь, мировоззрение может влиять на формирование и изменение нашей идентичности, поскольку оно формируется на основе наших взглядов и убеждений, а также нашего опыта и восприятия мира. Таким образом, идентичность играет важную роль в формировании мировоззрения, определяя, каким образом мы воспринимаем себя и мир вокруг нас. Она помогает нам определиться с нашими ценностями, убеждениями и ролями в обществе. Идентичность может меняться в течение времени, и изменения в мировоззрении могут влиять на переопределение идентичности."},{"prompt":"Ценности, их классификация, ценности духовной культуры","completion":"Ценности - это принципы или убеждения, которые мы ценим и почитаем в жизни. Они играют важную роль в формировании нашего поведения, решений и мировоззрения, и также определяют наши приоритеты и цели. Ценности могут быть выражены в различных областях жизни, включая мораль, этику, религию, политику, семью, работу и т. д. Ценности могут быть классифицированы по разным критериям. Вот несколько видов классификаций: 1. Моральные и этические ценности: это ценности, связанные с понятием “правильного” и “неправильного” и определяющие наше поведение в отношении других людей и себя. Примерами таких ценностей могут быть честность, справедливость, забота о других, толерантность и доброта. 2. Религиозные ценности: это ценности, связанные с религиозными убеждениями и верой. Они могут включать такие ценности, как вера в Бога, послушание религиозным заповедям, нравственность и духовность. 3. Культурные ценности: это ценности, связанные с определенной культурой или обществом. Они определяют нормы и традиции данной культуры. Примерами культурных ценностей могут быть уважение к старшим, семейные ценности, патриотизм и традиционные обычаи. 4. Личные ценности: это индивидуальные ценности, исходящие из личных убеждений, опыта и предпочтений. Они могут включать такие ценности, как независимость, свобода, самореализация и личное счастье. Ценности духовной культуры являются частным случаем культурных ценностей, связанных с духовностью и религией. Они могут включать ценности, связанные с верой, гармонией, просветлением, благочестием, состраданием и миром. Эти ценности отражают мировоззрение и духовные убеждения конкретной религии или философии. Ценности духовной культуры помогают людям найти смысл и цель в жизни, развивать свою духовность и стремиться к достижению внутренней гармонии и раскрытию своего потенциала. Они могут служить основой для развития моральных, этических и личностных ценностей."},{"prompt":"Системная модель мировоззрения: страна, государство, общество, семья, человек и их соотнесенность с основными ценностями","completion":"Системная модель мировоззрения представляет собой представление о том, как основные элементы общества - страна, государство, общество, семья и человек - взаимосвязаны и соотнесены между собой в контексте основных ценностей. Каждый из этих элементов оказывает влияние на формирование и выражение ценностей в обществе. Взаимодействие между ними может быть представлено следующим образом: 1. Страна: страна является основной территориальной единицей, имеющей свою собственную историю, культуру, традиции и ценности. Она может иметь свои национальные и патриотические ценности, такие как государственный суверенитет, национальная безопасность, международное сотрудничество и прогресс. 2. Государство: государство является политической организацией, управляющей страной и регулирующей отношения в обществе. Оно может продвигать ценности, связанные с гражданскими правами и свободами, законопослушанием, справедливостью, демократией и социальным равенством. 3. Общество: общество представляет собой совокупность людей, которые взаимодействуют между собой на основе определенных норм, ценностей и социальных отношений. Ценности общества могут включать такие понятия, как равноправие, солидарность, уважение различий, ответственность, совместная работа и сохранение природной среды. 4. Семья: семья является основой общества и местом первичной социализации. В ней формируются личностные и моральные ценности, такие как любовь, забота, справедливость, взаимоуважение, ответственность, трудолюбие и семейные традиции. 5. Человек: каждый отдельный человек имеет свои уникальные ценности, которые могут быть сформированы как результат взаимодействия с другими элементами общества и личного опыта. Личные ценности могут включать саморазвитие, свободу выбора, счастье, достижение целей и смысл в жизни. Эти элементы - страна, государство, общество, семья и человек - взаимосвязаны и взаимодействуют друг с другом, формируя мировоззрение общества и индивида. Ценности, высоко ценные для человека, часто соотносятся с его принадлежностью к определенной стране, обществу и семье, а также на основе законов и норм государства. В то же время, ценности, одобряемые и продвигаемые государством, организованным обществом и семьей, могут влиять на формирование личных ценностей индивида."},{"prompt":"Природно- географический фактор в развитии российской цивилизации.","completion":"Природно-географический фактор сыграл значительную роль в развитии российской цивилизации. Расположение России на просторах Евразии, ее климатические и географические особенности, а также наличие обширных природных ресурсов оказали влияние на формирование и развитие культуры, экономики и истории этой страны. 1. Пространственное положение: Россия занимает значительную часть Евразийского континента, обладая огромной территорией, распределенной на нескольких климатических и природных зонах. Это положение определяет ее геополитическую и геоэкономическую значимость и способствует формированию особой идентичности российской цивилизации. 2. Климатические условия и природные ресурсы: Россия характеризуется разнообразными климатическими условиями, от арктических регионов на севере до умеренных зон на юге. Этот климатический разнообразие определяет разнообразие природных ресурсов, таких как нефть, газ, уголь, леса, реки и озера. Это оказывает влияние на развитие экономики и промышленности России. 3. Общество и культура: Природная среда России оказала влияние на формирование общественных и культурных особенностей российской цивилизации. Многие национальные культуры и традиции России связаны с особенностями природы и климата. Например, русская литература и живопись часто отражают величие и пространство природы, а северные народы занимаются оленеводством в связи с арктическим климатом. 4. Географические факторы влияют на экономическую деятельность и развитие России. Наличие обширных природных ресурсов способствует развитию секторов экономики, таких как добыча полезных ископаемых, энергетика и сельское хозяйство. Кроме того, географическое положение России является основой для развития транспортной и логистической инфраструктуры, так как она является транзитной страной между Европой и Азией.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reactiln to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"**INT. FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY** *Background: Earlier in the day, MARIA, a quick-witted young Mexican American woman wearing khaki shorts and a casual button-up shirt, had lunch with colleagues at a questionable food cart. Despite feeling rumblings in her stomach, she chanced the long commute home, and now, as she approaches her house, the pressure mounting in her bowels borders on catastrophic. Unknown to her, her house key slipped from her pocket in the taxi. As she nears the door, the urgency escalates.* **CLOSE ON MARIA (mid-20s, tied-back hair, frames slipping down her nose) as she fast-walks to her front door. Her face is scrunched in discomfort, her hand hovering protectively over her stomach. She reaches the door, frantically pats down her pockets, and realizes the key is gone. PANIC SETS IN. She RAPS on the door, first patiently, then desperately.** MARIA (calling out) Mom? Open up, quick! **Silence. She checks the windows, but there's no sign of life. She RINGS the doorbell and POUNDS the door with both urgency and dread.** MARIA (sweating) Oh, come on... **FROM INSIDE the house, a voice approaches – ROSA (early 50s, with an air of timeless elegance despite wearing everyday home clothes and an apron).** ROSA (filtered, shouting) ¿Quién es? (Who is it?) MARIA (urgently pleading) It’s Maria! Please, hurry! **The sound of MULTIPLE LOCKS TURNING is like music to Maria’s ears. The door creaks open slowly. ROSA, eyeing Maria with a mother's CONCERN, intentionally delays, unaware of the turmoil inside her daughter.** MARIA (impatiently) Mom, move! **MARIA tries to SQUEEZE past ROSA, but her MOTHER grabs her, the WORRY showing in her grip.** ROSA (concerned) ¿Qué te pasa? (What’s wrong with you?) MARIA (struggling) Nothing! Just let me in! **Their voices RISE OVER EACH OTHER. ROSA's hands are firm on Maria’s shoulders, unknowingly extending her daughter's torment.** **SUDDENLY, Maria’s face transforms – eyes widen, lips part – a GROAN escapes her lips and what she's been holding back begins.** **ROSA, perplexed, loosens her grip.** ROSA (fearful) ¡Dios mio, qué te pasa! **MARIA, seemingly in a trance, leans back slightly into a more comfortable position for what she's been compelled to do. She GRUNTS softly as each wave comes over her.** ROSA (incredulous) Maria, ¿pero qué haces? MARIA (strained) It’s fine... it’s fine... **ROSA inches closer, trying to decipher MARIA’s face— which FLITS between CONCENTRATION and RELIEF.** ROSA (nonplussed) You're scaring me. Mija, talk to me! **ROSA sniffs the air tentatively. Maria finishes with a SIGH of relief and a sheepish look.** ROSA (slow, dawning realization) No... no puede ser... (It can't be...) **ROSA asks the question she never thought she'd need to, her FACE a picture of DISGUSTED BEWILDERMENT.** ROSA (horrified) ¿En serio hiciste... ESO? MARIA (averting eyes) Mom, just... let me by, please. **ROSA, reeling from the ODOR, steps aside, hand over nose and mouth.** ROSA (incredulous) You really...? **MARIA waddles past, CUPPING the seat of her pants. ROSA, recovering, BLOCKS her path again.** ROSA (scolding) Espera, no vayas a tirar nada en el suelo. ¡Ay, Dios mío, qué cochina! **MARIA, with a NERVOUS LAUGH, tries wriggling away.** MARIA (playing the blame game) If you’d just opened up faster! **ROSA, appalled, rants about propriety and age-appropriate bathroom habits, still PINCHING her nose, as MARIA touches the bulk in her pants with a WINCE.** MARIA (faux indignant) Oh, so this is MY fault? ROSA (taunting) As if you had to... terminar todo ahí. (finish everything right there) MARIA (defensive) I couldn’t hold it! Your fault! **MARIA’s face shows a MIX of playful SHAME and RELIEF. ROSA's AUNT, in firm disbelief, gets a CLOSER INSPECTION.** ROSA (incredulously) ¡Qué asco, tantísimo! (How nasty, so much!) MARIA (coyly) It was... a lot. **ROSA, playing the stern caregiver, INFANTILIZES the situation, SNIFFS Maria’s pants like checking a baby's diaper.** ROSA (mimicking) Wow, qué olor. (What a smell) MARIA (smirking) Well, you're keeping me here. **Rosa USHERS Maria towards the bathroom, still PINCHING her nose, COMICALLY MOCKING the stench.** ROSA (impatient) Cálmate con eso en el baño. And don’t drop anything! **Maria CRINGES her way into the bathroom as Rosa CONTINUES to express her DISMAY at the smell.** MARIA It might slide down... ROSA (reprimanding) Control it! **They reach the bathroom. As MARIA teases once more about diaper changes – GRASPING her pants’ bulk and holding her nose – ROSA, in DISBELIEF and MOCK ANGER, presses the bulge to PUSH Maria through the door.** MARIA (teasing) Want to change me? **ROSA, fed up but playful, SHOVES Maria inside, her NOSE still scrunched.** ROSA (yelling) ¡Vete ya! (Go now!) **Maria, enters the bathroom, YELLING about the spread mess, while Rosa sharply COMPLAINS about the smell lingering in the hallway. The bathroom door SHUTS as the CAMERA PULLS BACK, leaving Rosa ALONE to deal with the aftermath.** **FADE OUT.**"},{"prompt":"https://donjon.bin.sh/scifi/system/","completion":"This link leads to a website called \\"Donjon - Sci-Fi System Generator.\\" Donjon is a website that offers various random generators for tabletop role-playing games, including fantasy, sci-fi, and more.

Соотношение политической и государственной власти.","completion":"Понятие власти относится к способности или возможности оказывать влияние, управлять и контролировать других людей, группы или общество в целом. Власть является одной из основных характеристик политической системы и государственного устройства. Политическая власть относится к возможности принятия решений, определения политических целей и направлений развития общества. Она базируется на политической легитимности, то есть на признании власти и права на управление со стороны граждан и других политических акторов. Политическая власть может быть формальной, когда она осуществляется и закреплена законом и конституцией, и неформальной, когда она основана на социальных отношениях, доминировании определенных групп или личностей. Государственная власть, с другой стороны, связана с управлением и контролем над территорией и населением определенной территории. Государственная власть закреплена институционально и осуществляется через различные органы и структуры государства, такие как президент, правительство, парламент и судебная система. Государственная власть имеет юридическую основу и действует на основе законов и других юридических норм. Соотношение политической и государственной власти может варьироваться в различных политических системах. В некоторых странах политическая и государственная власть сосуществуют и обладают фактической властью примерно в одинаковой степени. Однако в других странах, как, например, в абсолютистских монархиях или тоталитарных режимах, государственная власть может превалировать над политической, и правители несут абсолютную власть и контроль над государством и обществом. В демократических системах и политических режимах, политическая власть представляется через выборные органы и институты, и государственная власть осуществляется с соблюдением закона и с участием граждан. Таким образом, в таких системах политическая и государственная власть тесно связаны и взаимодействуют, с политической властью, определяющей стратегические цели и задачи, а государственной властью – осуществляющей практическое управление и контроль."},{"prompt":"Государство как ядро политической системы.

Монархия: это форма правления, при которой главой государства является монарх - наследственный монарх или монарх с определенными полномочиями. Монархия охватывает как абсолютные монархии, где монарх обладает неограниченной властью, так и конституционные монархии, где власть ограничена конституцией и парламентом. 2. Республика: это форма правления, при которой главой государства является выбираемый представитель или группа представителей, обычно президент или монарх без политической власти. Республики могут быть президентскими, парламентскими или полупрезидентскими в зависимости от властных отношений между главой государства и органами законодательной власти. 3. Федерация: это форма государственного устройства, в которой власть разделена между центральным правительством и регионами или штатами. Федерации объединяют различные территориальные единицы под общим государственным правлением, при этом сохраняя некоторую степень автономии и самоуправления у регионов. Признаки государственного устройства могут включать: 1. Суверенитет: государство обладает полной самостоятельностью и автономией на своей территории и имеет право устанавливать законы, войти в международные договоры и осуществлять внешние отношения. 2.

Aquí hay algunas directrices para acomodar el título en el lomo: 1. Orientación: Por lo general, el texto del título se coloca de modo que se pueda leer de arriba hacia abajo cuando el libro está en posición vertical con la portada mirando hacia adelante. Esto significa que si colocas el libro boca abajo, el texto estaría alineado con el texto de la portada. 2. Tipografía y tamaño: El tipo de letra seleccionado para el título en el lomo debe ser legible y preferiblemente debe estar en consonancia con la tipografía que usaste en la portada y el interior para mantener una estética uniforme. El tamaño del texto deberá ajustarse al ancho del lomo, que a su vez depende del grosor del libro. 3. Información adicional: Además del título, es común incluir en el lomo el nombre del autor y, a veces, el logotipo del sello editorial. Estos elementos deben estar organizados de manera equilibrada y clara. Habitualmente el nombre del autor aparece arriba o debajo del título, y el logo editorial al pie del lomo. 4. Espaciado: Asegúrate de que haya un margen adecuado en ambos lados del título para que no quede demasiado pegado a los bordes, lo que podría dificultar la lectura o verse mal estéticamente. 5. Dirección de lectura: En algunos países, la dirección de la lectura del título en el lomo puede variar. Por ejemplo, en Estados Unidos y en la mayoría de los países donde se lee de izquierda a derecha, el texto en el lomo se coloca de arriba (cabeza) a abajo (pie). En cambio, en otros países, como por ejemplo en España, es más común encontrar libros cuyo título en el lomo se lee de abajo arriba. A la hora de diseñar el lomo de tu libro, es importante considerar también el diseño general y la identidad visual de la obra.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman first expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants, then mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has entered the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"Title: \\"El Apuro del Regreso\\" (\\"The Rush Home\\") INT. ESTEBAN FAMILY LIVING ROOM — DAY The previous scene concludes with MARINA ESTEBAN (mid-20s, vibrant, athletic build) enjoying a sumptuous meal at a local taqueria with friends after a day of hiking. Marina wears jogger sweatpants and a breezy tank top. Laughing and indulging too much, too fast, Marina ignores the first whispers of a digestive revolt. Giggles and chatter fade as Marina departs, wincing mid-step. Passing a closed gas station, the urge tightens its grip. Marina quickens her pace, eyes wide with panic. EXT. ESTEBAN FAMILY HOUSE — DAY MARINA ESTEBAN approaches her family’s modest home. Her stride is erratic, knees clamped, while beads of sweat glisten on her tanned forehead. Trying to retain composure, her eyes flit in panic to the closed door. Marina fumbles through her bag: no keys. She frantically pats her pockets, to no avail. Panicking, she knocks, pounding, desperate. MARINA (muttering) Come on, come on... No answer. The pressure is mounting, her breaths short and sharp. She bangs the door harder. INT. ESTEBAN FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY — DAY Behind the door, ROSA ESTEBAN (50s, robust and loving with a streak of silver in her dark hair) is organizing medical paperwork. Loud knocks startle her. A mix of alarm and irritation crosses her face. ROSA (shouting) ¿Quién es? What's happening? MARINA (O.S., desperate) Mom, it's me! Open up, please! Marina groans softly, her body tenses. INT./EXT. ESTEBAN FAMILY HOUSE — DAY The lock clicks sluggishly. The door inches open, revealing ROSA, full of concern. ROSA (frowning) Mija, what's wrong? MARINA (voice strained) Mom, move! Please, just let me in! As MARINA pushes past, ROSA grips her, eyes searching. ROSA (grasping MARINA) You're scaring me, Marina! What is it? MARINA struggles to escape ROSA’s hold, distress painting her face. MARINA (panting) Let me go, Mom. I need to get inside, now! They tangle; ROSA’s worry meets MARINA’s urgency. MARINA reaches a breaking point. She gasps, a look of shock and untimely relief washing over her as she is gripped by ROSA, who now loosens her hold in confusion. ROSA (voice softer) Mija, tell me what’s wrong? MARINA gently pulls away, adopting a relieving stance. MARINA (whispering, grunting with effort) It’s... oh, it's okay... yes... ROSA watches, befuddled, as MARINA shifts between focus and a pained sort of bliss. ROSA Marina? Habla conmigo, are you sick? Marina, still quietly grunting, gives no coherent response. Rosa stiffens as a foul odor reaches her. ROSA (turns her head, sniffs) What is that smell? MARINA looks at ROSA, sheepishly silent. The truth dawns on ROSA's face. ROSA (disgusted) Marina, did you... No. You didn't, tell me you didn't. MARINA avoids her gaze, pleading. MARINA Can I just go inside now, please? ROSA steps aside, wrinkling her nose in disgust. MARINA shuffles in, awkwardly cupping the seat of her pants. ROSA (stopping MARINA) Wait! Don't you dare drop anything on my floor! She scolds with a mocking edge. ROSA (poking fun) Look at this, you’re a mess, y hueles mal! Ay, how smelly! MARINA stands frozen, shame-faced, as ROSA gags theatrically. MARINA (playing the victim) It's your fault, you blocked me. I was so close... ROSA (scoffing) My fault? No excuse for this, por Dios! She continues to taunt. ROSA You're an adult, not a toddler needing a diaper change. MARINA (defending herself) I couldn't help it, okay? I had to go! Inspecting the damage, MARINA winces yet smirks. MARINA (awkwardly content) It did feel good though... after holding it so long. ROSA, holding her nose, grabs MARINA to keep her from leaving. ROSA Disgusting. Don't blame me for your nastiness. She insistently examines MARINA's pants. ROSA (turns MARINA) Let’s see... a lot of satisfaction for someone who's made such a dirty mess. MARINA (coyly bickering) It's so full because I had to go so bad... ROSA exclaims in mock horror. ROSA Nasty girl! Should I treat you like a baby now? ROSA leans in to sniff and inspect, clearly dramatizing her disgust. ROSA (taunting) Oh, que olor tan feo! MARINA (cringing) Yeah, I'm smelly, and you won’t let me clean up... ROSA dismisses this with a wave of her hand. ROSA Ugh, you need to clean up right now. She ushers MARINA toward the bathroom, both still reacting to the stench. ROSAs' grip tightens on MARINA's pants, ensuring nothing escapes as they navigate to the bathroom. MARINA grimaces. MARINA (embarrassed) Feels like it's gonna slip... ROSA (reinforcing her stance) Well, don’t let it, mija! They arrive at the threshold. MARINA turns, a final tease. MARINA (teasing) Wanna change my diaper, Mom? ROSA snaps—playful but sternly, she shoves MARINA into the bathroom. ROSA (holding nose, gruff) Get in there, now! MARINA (yelping in disgust) Ay, Mom! It's everywhere! ROSA clamps her nostrils, gagging. ROSA (complaining) Mierda, you stink! MARINA is inside. ROSA’s muffled muttering fills the entryway as she turns away, her expression one of exasperated fondness."},{"prompt":"Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to scold the returning woman for making her pants so smelly. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"Title: \\"Unlocked Chaos\\" BACKGROUND: In the previous scene of our Comedy Drama TV series, we find SOFIA RAMIREZ, a young Mexican-American woman in her mid-20s, as she endures a grueling afternoon of local bus commutes after a savory feast at a friend's home where she overindulged in a variety of delicious but heavy Mexican dishes. Amid transit delays and a lack of access to public restrooms, Sofia’s gastrointestinal tract begins to rebel. In a race against time and her own bodily functions, she finally reaches her family’s suburban house - a beacon of hope and porcelain salvation. SOFIA is stylish yet practical, donning high-quality activewear leggings and a loose-fitting blouse, her brown hair pulled back in a ponytail signaling the day’s casual intensity. Her brisk walking is riddled with subtle winces, a testament to the surmounting pressure within. EXT. RAMIREZ FAMILY HOUSE - DAY Sofia speedwalks up the driveway, olive skin flushed with the dual heat of the sun and her internal distress. She reaches the door of the house only to pat down her pockets in vain - the realization of a misplaced house key washing over her like a cruel joke. INT. HALLWAY / FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Frantic, Sofia pounds on the door with urgency, each knock resonating with her silent plea for swift entry. INT. RAMIREZ FAMILY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Inside, MARIA RAMIREZ, mid-50s, with the timeless beauty and well-maintained figure of someone who values family and fitness equally, is folding laundry on the couch. Maria’s confusion turns to alarm as she hears the desperate knocking. Maria: (voice muffled by door) ¡Dios mío! ¿Qué está pasando? EXT. RAMIREZ FAMILY HOUSE - DAY SOFIA: ¡Mamá, soy yo! ¡Por favor, ábreme rápido! Maria approaches the door, fumbling with the lock longer than the suffering Sofia would like. Maria’s concern increases with the rattling urgency from the other side. INT. HALLWAY / FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS The door finally swings open revealing Maria’s puzzled face. Sofia, at the brink of eruption, rushes to enter. SOFIA: Mamá, ¡Muévete por favor! Maria instinctively reaches out and grasps Sofia's arm with worry. MARIA: Sofia, ¿Qué tienes? ¿Por qué tanta prisa? SOFIA: ¡Solo déjame pasar, por favor! Their entanglement becomes a physical dialogue as Maria’s concern blocks the much-needed path to relief. As the pressure crescendos, Sofia groans, her face contorted between horror and untimely relief as she unintentionally begins to soil her pants. Maria’s grip weakens, confusion etched across her face. MARIA: Mija, ¿estás bien? SOFIA: Uhh...uh...¡Ay, no me siento bien...! Sofia sheepishly assumes a relieving stance, the muted soft grunts of exertion somewhat relieved as Maria looks on, befuddled. Maria continues her inquiries, only to receive grunted non-responses. As Sofia surrenders to nature’s call, Maria finally senses the air shift, her nose twitching as she sniffs the unpleasant reality of the situation twice to confirm her suspicions. MARIA: (Horrified) ¿Qué es ese olor? SOFIA, defeated, manages a sheepish glance towards Maria, whose disgusted bewilderment is palpable. MARIA: (Grimaces with realization) Sofia... ¿Acaso hiciste... lo que creo que hiciste? Silent, Sofia’s mortified eyes plead for understanding. Maria, nostrils flaring in disgust, pushes on. MARIA: (With a pinch of her nose) Ese olor viene... ¡ay, no! ¿De tus pantalones? Sofia, wordless, gesturing to be allowed inside. Maria, overcome by the olfactory offense, steps aside. INT. RAMIREZ FAMILY HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Sofia gingerly waddles into the house. Maria, astonished yet still a mother, brings her a few steps past the entrance. MARIA: (Stern) Espera ahí. No dejes caer nada al suelo. Sofia’s eyes widen in sheepish indignation. Maria continues, taunting her about the mess in a tone laced with maternal disapproval. MARIA: (Continues) ¡Qué cochino! Y qué olor más fuerte. The air is thick with a mix of disapproval and emanating odor. Sofia protests. SOFIA: (Playfully offended) Es tu culpa por tardarte en abrir y bloquearme el camino. Maria laughs incredulously. MARIA: Eso no es excusa alguna para una mujer de tu edad. Y que hayas seguido haciéndolo es más increíble. Sofia clutches the back of her soiled pants in discomfort; the debate continues as she stands her ground. SOFIA: (With a single tear of self-pity) Les urgía salir, y tú me estorbaste, mami. Hasta me sentí aliviada. Maria rolls her eyes, her motherly concern warring with her annoyance at the absurd situation. MARIA: No hay justificación. Ahora vamos, ¡no puedes seguir así! Maria inspects the ill-fated legwear, her voice sharp with teasing judgment. MARIA: (Disbelief) Mira nada más, tanto hiciste en tus pantalones que pareces un bebé. SOFIA tries to bat away her mother’s comments, but she succumbs to the simplicity of her childish need. SOFIA: (Timidly) Había mucho y necesitaba alivio. Maria’s voice rises, a crescendo of scolding rhetoric. She inspects Sofia with playful derision. MARIA: (Sniffing and cringing) ¡Qué asco y qué olor tan fuerte! Te hubieras aguantado más. SOFIA: (Meek acceptance) Sí estoy hedionda, pero ya que me detienes aquí, disfrutemos ambos del olor, ¿no? MARIA: (Disgusted and firm) No vas a quedarte así, apesta demasiado. Ve al baño a limpiarte bien y sin dejar nada en el suelo. Maria hurries Sofia to the bathroom, a spectacle of comical disgust and odor-induced haste. INT. RAMIREZ FAMILY HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS Upon reaching the doorway, Sofia jests one last time with a combination of defiance and humor. SOFIA: (Grinning cheekily) ¿Quieres cambiarme el ‘pañal’, mamá? Maria, riding the wave of her frustration, humorously retaliates. She pushes Sofia forward, effectively squishing the mess. MARIA: (Resigned humor) ¡Ve y lávate ya, sucia! SOFIA shrieks in disgusted surprise as she stumbles forward, the smeared distress evident. Maria half-heartedly waves away the odor, her expressions of distaste lingering as the bathroom door closes behind Sofia.

However, there are a few considerations to make: - **PowerBI/SSRS Experience:** If you haven't worked with PowerBI or SSRS, be ready to express your willingness to learn and your proficiency in picking up similar tools. - **Direct Role Fit:** Ensure that you are interested in a role that might be more technical and hands-on with development, as opposed to leading and strategizing, which your current role seems to emphasize. - **Cultural Fit:** The company emphasizes customer service and employee growth.

Zakładając, że stosujesz kreatynę oraz beta-alaninę, które mają udowodnione działanie ergogeniczne, czyli wspomagające wydajność fizyczną, możemy założyć, że te suplementy mogą również wspomóc proces regeneracji. Kreatyna jest związkiem pomagającym w odbudowie zapasów ATP (adenozynotrójfosforanu), czyli głównego źródła energii wykorzystywanego podczas krótkich i intensywnych ćwiczeń. Dzięki temu może przyczynić się do skrócenia czasu potrzebnego na regenerację mięśni. Beta-alanina natomiast jest prekursorem karnozyny, która buforuje pH mięśni, będąc zatem ważnym czynnikiem w opóźnianiu zmęczenia mięśniowego. Regularne suplementowanie beta-alaniny może zwiększyć poziomy karnozyny w mięśniach, co może sprzyjać szybszemu odzyskiwaniu sprawności po ćwiczeniach. Mimo tego, 24 godziny to czas, który może być wystarczający dla niektórych osób do regeneracji, ale dla innych może okazać się niewystarczający. Ważne jest, aby słuchać sygnałów wysyłanych przez swoje ciało i dostosować intensywność oraz czas regeneracji do indywidualnych potrzeb. Jeżeli po 24 godzinach nadal odczuwasz ból mięśni lub zmęczenie, możliwe, że Twój organizm potrzebuje więcej czasu na odpoczynek. Dodatkowo, dla optymalizacji regeneracji mięśni, ważna jest odpowiednia dieta bogata w białko i inne składniki odżywcze oraz jakość i długość snu. Snem nie powinno się lekceważyć, ponieważ to właśnie w trakcie głębokiego snu wytwarzane są hormony anaboliczne, takie jak hormon wzrostu, które przyspieszają regenerację tkanek. Pamiętaj również, aby dostarczać organizmowi odpowiednią ilość płynów, zwłaszcza jeśli ćwiczysz w ciepłym klimacie lub dużo się pocisz. Nawodnienie jest kluczowe dla procesów metabolicznych, w tym również dla regeneracji mięśniowej. Jeśli nadal nie jesteś pewien, jak długa powinna być Twoja regeneracja, może być wartościowe skonsultowanie się z profesjonalnym trenerem fitness lub fizjoterapeutą."},{"prompt":"Jakie suplementy polecilbys jeszcze","completion":"Polecenie konkretnych suplementów zależy od wielu czynników, w tym celów treningowych, diety, stanu zdrowia, stylu życia, a także reakcji organizmu na różne substancje. Przy wyborze suplementów zawsze powinieneś kierować się własnymi potrzebami oraz konsultować się z lekarzem lub dietetykiem. Oto kilka popularnych suplementów, które mogą być rozważane przez osoby aktywnie trenujące: 1. **Białko w proszku** - whey protein (białko serwatkowe) lub białko roślinne (np. sojowe, z grochu, konopi) pomagają w uzupełnieniu potrzeb białkowych organizmu, ważnych dla regeneracji i budowy mięśni. 2. **BCAA (aminokwasy rozgałęzione)** - leucyna, izoleucyna i walina to aminokwasy, które mogą pomóc w ochronie mięśni przed rozpadem i wspierają regenerację po treningu. 3. **Omega-3 (kwasy tłuszczowe)** - mają przeciwzapalne działanie i mogą przyczyniać się do poprawy zdrowia serca oraz ogólnej kondycji organizmu. 4. **Glutamina** - jest aminokwasem, który może wspomagać regenerację i odporność, szczególnie przy ciężkich treningach i wysiłku. 5. **Witaminy i minerały** - szczególnie witamina D, magnez, cynk i żelazo (dla osób, które mają do nich niedobory) są ważne dla utrzymania dobrego funkcjonowania organizmu. 6. **Kreatyna** - już wspominałeś, że jej używasz, jest znanym i skutecznym suplementem poprawiającym wydajność w treningu siłowym i sprinterskim. 7. **Beta-alanina** - również już ją stosujesz, wspomaga wytrzymałość mięśniową. 8. **HMB (beta-hydroksy beta-metylomaślan)** - metabolit leucyny, może przyczynić się do zmniejszenia rozpadu tkanek, zwłaszcza przy diecie redukcyjnej. 9. **Ashwagandha** - adaptogen, który może pomóc obniżyć poziom kortyzolu i zwiększyć wydolność organizmu. 10. **Kofeina** - dla poprawy koncentracji i zwiększenia poziomu energii, choć trzeba uważać na potencjalne skutki uboczne nadmiernego spożycia. Przed rozpoczęciem suplementacji należy zawsze sprawdzić skład suplementów, ich dawkowanie oraz możliwe interakcje z lekami, które się przyjmuje. Warto również pamiętać, że suplementy nie zastąpią zróżnicowanej i zbilansowanej diety, a jedynie mogą ją wspomagać. Również należy pamiętać, że nie wszystkie suplementy działają tak samo na każdego człowieka, a dotychczasowe badania naukowe nie zawsze są jednoznaczne co do ich skuteczności u każdej osoby."},{"prompt":"Co daje BCAA","completion":"BCAA, czyli aminokwasy rozgałęzione (ang. Branched Chain Amino Acids), to grupa trzech esencjalnych aminokwasów: leucyny, izoleucyny i waliny. Są one nazywane \\"esencjalnymi\\", ponieważ organizm ludzki nie jest w stanie ich samodzielnie syntetyzować i muszą być dostarczane z pożywieniem. BCAA odgrywają ważną rolę w organizmie, zwłaszcza dla osób aktywnie trenujących lub uprawiających sport: 1. **Wspieranie syntezy białek mięśniowych**: BCAA, a w szczególności leucyna, są silnymi stymulatorami syntezy białek mięśniowych, co przyczynia się do ich wzrostu i regeneracji po treningu. 2. **Zapobieganie rozpadowi mięśni**: Podczas intensywnej aktywności fizycznej BCAA mogą być wykorzystywane jako źródło energii, co może pomagać w ochronie mięśni przed katabolizmem (rozpadem). 3. **Zmniejszenie uczucia zmęczenia**: BCAA mogą wpływać na zmniejszenie produkcji serotoniny w mózgu podczas ćwiczeń, co potencjalnie zmniejsza odczuwanie zmęczenia. 4. **Regulacja metabolizmu**: Izoleucyna pomaga w regulacji poziomu glukozy we krwi, podczas gdy walina może wpływać na metabolizm tkanki tłuszczowej. 5. **Wspieranie odporności**: Intensywne treningi mogą obniżać odporność, a BCAA sprzyjają jej wzmacnianiu dzięki wsparciu wytwarzania białek odpornościowych i działaniu immunomodulującym. Warto jednak pamiętać, że korzyści płynące z suplementacji BCAA są najbardziej widoczne w określonych sytuacjach, zwłaszcza gdy dieta jest uboga w pełnowartościowe białko. Jeżeli osoba uprawiająca sport spożywa odpowiednią ilość białka z pożywienia (które samo w sobie zawiera te aminokwasy), dodatkowa suplementacja BCAA może nie przynieść dalszych korzyści. Warto zawsze konsultować stosowanie suplementów z dietetykiem lub lekarzem, a także układać dietę tak, aby dostarczała wszystkich koniecznych składników odżywczych w odpowiednich ilościach, co może w niektórych przypadkach obniżyć potrzebę suplementacji."},{"prompt":"Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants. After that, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules the returning woman over how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being so smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"**INT.

Mira, clutching her stomach, rushes towards the small, beige-toned family home that represents the safety of privacy. She fumbles for keys, but they're misplaced — panic ensues. **EXT. MIRA’S FAMILY HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON** Mira arrives at the door. Desperation has evolved into urgent necessity. **MIRA** *(Frantically knocking)* Mom? Anyone? Silence — her knocks grow more frantic. The situation is tipping towards desperation. **INT. MIRA’S FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS** From inside, her mother, FATIMA, mid-40s, a woman of robust health and traditional attire glides toward the door. Her careworn face is one of domestic management, hair covered by a hijab. **FATIMA** *(From within)* Who is it? What's the matter? **MIRA** *(Voice high-pitched, holding in terror)* Mom, it's me! Hurry! **EXT. MIRA’S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** The unlocking is agonizingly slow. Mira is trembling, hopping on the spot. **MIRA** Mom, please, just open the door! The door finally swings open. Fatima, puzzled by this drama, blocks the entry. **FATIMA** *(Concern etched on her face)* Ya binti, what has you so worked up? Mira, close to tears, tries to slip past but Fatima’s motherly grip is secure. **MIRA** Nothing! Just let me through! They shuffle in place, an odd dance at the doorway. **FATIMA** Tell me what's wro— Mira groans abruptly, her face a tableau of shock, turmoil, and untimely relief. She weakly recedes into a half-squat, beset by her bowels’ betrayal. Fatima's confusion grows with Mira's subtle grunts. **FATIMA** Ya Allah, Mira, are you ok? Mira's response is a string of muffed exertions, her discomfort painted illuminatingly across her face. **FATIMA** *(Sniffing the air)* What is that sme— Mira stands, face pink with mortified relief. **FATIMA** *(Realization dawning)* Did you...? Silence hangs heavy, save for Mira's soft breathing and Fatima's nose wrinkling as she sniffs again. **FATIMA** *(Nose scrunching in disgust)* Ya Mira... Is that from... you? **MIRA** Please, I need to get inside. Fatima, mastering her disgust, steps aside. Mira, cradling her dignity, waddles in. **INT. MIRA’S FAMILY HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS** Mira, precarious in her gait, cups the seat of her pants. Fatima, incredulous, whips her head around. **FATIMA** *(Voice sharp with a blend of concern and rebuke)* Stop! You'll drop... it. Why would you...? Mira returns a sheepish glare. **FATIMA** *(Tauntingly)* How can you make such a mess at your age? Ya Allah, the smell! Mira, holding her stance, silent under inspection. Fatima exhales sharply. **FATIMA** No reason ever justifies this. Mira feigns sulking innocence. **MIRA** You blocked me! What choice did I have? **FATIMA** *(Dismissively)* No excuse! And to respond by fully surrendering to it! **MIRA** *(Defensive but tongue-in-cheek)* It was urgent! I had to let go or burst. She hesitantly gauges the mess, her face morphing through conflicting emotions. **MIRA** Though, I won't deny the... relief. Fatima catches her arm, halting her escape to the restroom, taking mock offense. **FATIMA** So you blame me for making you happy to dirty yourself? Mira protests weakly as Fatima physically examines her daughter's result, her disgust morphing into curiosity and jest. **FATIMA** *(Incredulously)* And you filled your pants with happiness, huh? Mira, awash in bashfulness, can only attest to the pleasant aftermath of her predicament. **MIRA** Well, it was so... much. Fatima is in disbelief. **FATIMA** Nonsense! And still you talk like a toddler content in her mess? She gets in close, rendering motherly inspection to infantile mockery, sniffing at the damage. **FATIMA** *(Performing exaggerated disgust)* Such foulness from my little girl! Mira squirms, the depth of her discomfort widening. **MIRA** But you insist on keeping me here, in all this... Fatima, audibly scoffing at the buildup. **FATIMA** Enough! You stink. To the bathroom, now, and God forbid any drops! Cautiously, they proceed, Fatima bemoaning olfactory offense while cradling the seat of her daughter's slacks. **MIRA** *(Crimson-faced)* Feels like I'm losing... **FATIMA** Don't you dare let even one piece fall! Their procession becomes a comedy of reiterations. **INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER** At the threshold, Mira teasingly halts. **MIRA** *(Light-hearted in spite of it all)* Will you do the honors, Mom? As Mira gestures towards her burden, Fatima, a picture of disgusted amusement, provides the final impetus, pushing Mira over the threshold by squishing the conspicuous evidence. **FATIMA** Get in there and clean yourself, you little stinker! Mira is through the door, crying out at the uncomfortable spread of her accident within her pants. Fatima is left in the doorway, on the precipice between comedy and the graveness of cleanup, still holding her nose in reaction to the lingering smell."},{"prompt":"Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Катаболизм – это процесс разрушения сложных молекул на более простые для высвобождения энергии. Примеры катаболических процессов включают гликолиз (разложение глюкозы на пируват) и бета-окисление (разложение жирных кислот на ацетил-КоА). Анаболизм – это процесс синтеза сложных молекул из более простых с использованием энергии. Примеры анаболических процессов включают биосинтез белков (создание белков из аминокислот) и глюконеогенез (синтез глюкозы из неуглеводных предшественников). В целом, катаболизм отвечает за выделение энергии, необходимой для различных функций организма, в то время как анаболизм использует эту энергию для построения и восстановления тканей и других важных структуры тела."},{"prompt":"Для чего используется ацетил SKoA? Какова роль в метаболизме","completion":"Ацетил-коэнзим А (ацетил-КоА) является центральным молекулярным узлом в метаболизме, выполняющим важные функции в различных биохимических путях. Вот несколько основных ролей ацетил-КоА в клеточном метаболизме: 1. Ключевой субстрат для цикла трикарбоновых кислот (ТСА) или цикла Кребса: Ацетил-КоА входит в цикл Кребса, где он объединяется с оксалоацетатом для образования цитрата. Этот цикл важен для производства клеточной энергии в виде АТФ, а также для выработки предшественников для биосинтеза нуклеотидов, аминокислот и липидов. 2. Стартовая молекула для синтеза жирных кислот: В процессе липогенеза ацетил-КоА превращается в малонил-КоА и затем используется для построения длинноцепочечных жирных кислот. 3. Источник ацетильных групп для биосинтеза холестерина и других стеролов: Ацетил-КоА идет на формирование междинных продуктов, используемых для синтеза холестерина, от которого, в свою очередь, синтезируются желчные кислоты, стероидные гормоны и витамин D. 4. Для ацетилирования белков и других молекул: Модификация белков путем ацетилирования их лизиновых остатков ацетил-КоА изменяет их функцию и локализацию, а также роль в регуляции генной экспрессии. 5. Участие в кетогенезе: В условиях ограниченного поступления углеводов (например, при голодании, низкоуглеводной диете или неконтролируемом диабете) ацетил-КоА может использоваться для синтеза кетоновых тел в печени, которые затем служат альтернативным источником энергии для сердца, мозга и других тканей. Ацетил-КоА создается в результате окисления пирувата (продукт гликолиза) в митохондриях, а также в результате окисления жирных кислот и некоторых аминокислот. Таким образом, он играет важнейшую роль в интеграции и регуляции метаболизма углеводов, жиров и белков."},{"prompt":"Объясни очень кратко как происходит процесс липогенеза","completion":"Липогенез – это биохимический процесс синтеза жирных кислот из ацетил-КоА. Вот краткое описание этого процесса: 1. **Подготовка**: Избыток глюкозы в клетке преобразуется в ацетил-КоА. 2. **Старт**: Ацетил-КоА превращается в малонил-КоА с помощью фермента ацетил-КоА карбоксилазы (АКЦ). 3. **Удлинение цепи**: Малонил-КоА и ацетил-КоА удлиняются с помощью фермента жирнокислотный синтаз (ФКС) с образованием длинноцепочечных жирных кислот. 4. **Итерационные циклы**: Этапы конденсации, редукции, дегидратации и ещё одной редукции повторяются, чтобы добавлять два углерода за цикл с использованием АТФ и NADPH в качестве источника энергии и восстановительной силы. 5. **Завершение**: Жирная кислота высвобождается от ФКС, когда достигается требуемая длина цепи. Липогенез обычно происходит в печени и жировой ткани и регулируется инсулином и другими гормональными и питательными сигналами."},{"prompt":"Traducir a español: 在成長過程裡，各適其所，各得其道，各依其緣而達到發展。","completion":"En el proceso de crecimiento, cada uno encuentra su lugar, cada uno obtiene su camino y cada uno alcanza su desarrollo siguiendo sus propias circunstancias."},{"prompt":"Traducir a español: 因為種種而學會堅韌，因為種種學會放下，因為種種而學會不屈不撓；因為病痛知道了健康的可貴，因為破碎知道了圓滿的幸福。","completion":"Por diversas razones aprendemos a ser resilientes, por diversas razones aprendemos a soltar, por diversas razones aprendemos a ser incansables; debido a la enfermedad, conocemos el valor de la salud, y debido a la ruptura, conocemos la felicidad de la plenitud."},{"prompt":"Traducir a español: 因為堅定卓絕，義無反顧，猛然抽身，斷不猶豫，所以活得漂亮","completion":"Por ser firme y excepcional, sin mirar atrás, al apartarse bruscamente y sin dudar, por eso se vive una vida hermosa."},{"prompt":"Traducir a español: 在此一片沉寂中，你所應該擁有的，乃潔身自律，反省思慮","completion":"En este silencio, lo que deberías poseer es la pureza y autodisciplina, así como la reflexión y la consideración."},{"prompt":"Traducir a español: 如果你真的是一位見聞很廣泛的人，你就了解他的缺乏與無助。此時你就不會馬虎的看、隨便的應付，而你若在彼此之間得到一個感想，此時你就應該記得，下一次就懂得如何應對；若不能在這次的學習中得到什麼，那就枉費了你在這一次的人生閱讀了。","completion":"Si realmente eres una persona con una amplia experiencia, entenderás su carencia y desamparo.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants. After that, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules the returning woman over how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being so smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"TITLE: \\"Urgent Matters\\" EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY We find ourselves in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood. Birds chirping, kids riding bikes in the distance. A serene setting that's about to be disrupted by the chaotic urgency of a college senior named LAYLA, an Arab American woman with a stubborn streak and a head full of curly hair, dressed in comfortable joggers and a hoodie. She's power-walking towards her family home, clearly distressed, eyes darting around in search of a quick solution to her predicament. LAYLA's mom, MARWA, a caring yet slightly overprotective woman in her fifties with perfectly styled hair and an apron over her dress suggesting she's been in the midst of housework, is blissfully unaware of the impending situation. CUT TO: INT. LAYLA'S COLLEGE CAMPUS - FLASHBACK (EARLIER THAT DAY) LAYLA, in a lecture hall, sipping an unusually large cup of coffee, laughing with her friends. Ignoring the mounting pressure in her abdomen, she's engrossed in her friends’ funny stories, her laughter echoing in the room. BACK TO: EXT. LAYLA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Desperation replaces her once carefree expression as LAYLA fumbles through her bag, realization hitting her - the house keys are nowhere to be found. LAYLA (whispering to herself) You've gotta be kidding me... She pounds on the door, each knock more frantic than the last. Sweat beads on her brow as the quiet neighborhood is pierced by the urgency of her knocks. INT. LAYLA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS MARWA's brow furrows as she hears the commotion from the kitchen. Wiping her hands on her apron, she walks toward the front door with cautious briskness. MARWA (calling out) Who is it? What's happening? LAYLA (O.S.) (huffing) Mom, it's me! Please hurry up! EXT. LAYLA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The sound of multiple locks turning does little to calm LAYLA's nerves as the pressure builds to a crescendo. She shuffles uneasily, trying to maintain composure. INT. LAYLA'S FAMILY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The door finally opens and LAYLA nearly stumbles in, MARWA's confusion growing at the sight of her daughter's distress. MARWA (concerned) Layla, habibti, what’s wrong? LAYLA (anxious, avoiding specifics) Just move, please! MARWA, however, mistakes LAYLA's urgency for emotional distress and reaches out to her, gripping her arms. MARWA Worried Tell me what's wrong, Layla. Did something happen? LAYLA's face contorts as she struggles to free herself from MARWA's well-meaning but obstructive embrace. LAYLA (strained) Mom, I really need to— Their bickering escalates. MARWA’s grip remains firm, her concern genuine yet ironically obstructive. LAYLA (limit reached, groaning) Oh my god... Her face freezes in shock, then relief, as she loses control. MARWA, perplexed by her daughter's reaction, loosens her grip. MARWA (confused, softly) Layla...? LAYLA, relieved yet still under pressure, finds a moment to breathe and recoils from her mother's grip. MARWA makes a face as LAYLA, unable to verbalize, subtly grunts in satisfaction. The pungent odor fills the air, causing MARWA to sniff. MARWA (nose wrinkled) What is that smell? A prolonged, embarrassed silence hangs between them, ending only when MARWA puts two and two together. MARWA (disgusted) Layla, did you just...? LAYLA (sheepishly) Can you please step aside now? MARWA steps back, still incredulous, pinching her nose. LAYLA, red-faced, waddles past her. At a safe distance, MARWA observes, flabbergasted. She berates LAYLA for her unseemly predicament. MARWA (insistently) This shouldn't happen, Layla! LAYLA (sulkily) Well, if you’d opened the door faster... MARWA (incredulous) No excuse! MARWA's indignation is met with a sly, sheepish justification from LAYLA who reluctantly pokes at the bulk in her pants. LAYLA (playfully) Well, it was this or explode, so... MARWA blocks LAYLA's path to the bathroom, scolding her daughter for the dirty incident. She demands a closer look. MARWA (gradually inspecting) Let me see how bad it is... LAYLA (coyly) Mom, please... MARWA turns her around, inspecting and teasing her daughter about the obvious bulge. MARWA (teasingly) Did you enjoy that? LAYLA (defensively) It was a relief! It was so much pressure. MARWA exhorts that LAYLA should've better managed the urge, questioning her maturity. MARWA (critically) You should know better, Layla. MARWA, feigning a baby-talk voice, inspects LAYLA's pants while sniffing the offensive air near her daughter's behind. LAYLA grimaces, on the verge of embarrassment and amusement. MARWA comically scolds LAYLA about her foul smell, while LAYLA, reluctantly inhaling her own scent, facetiously gives in to her mother’s stance. LAYLA (resignedly) Since you won't let me clean up... MARWA, utterly disgusted, forcefully steers LAYLA toward the bathroom while complaining about the stench. MARWA (ushering LAYLA) You're not staying like this! They shuffle towards the bathroom, with MARWA making dramatic expressions and LAYLA bemoaning the near-catastrophe of spillage. Before entering the bathroom, LAYLA playful yet brazenly, grabs her soiled pants and teases her mom about the diaper change. MARWA, finally reaching her limit, pushes LAYLA into the bathroom with one hand while holding her nose with the other. LAYLA protests as the mess spreads. LAYLA (yelling) Oh, gross! MARWA's frustration bubbles over as she complains about LAYLA's smell while closing the bathroom door behind her messy daughter. MARWA (exasperated) Get in there now! FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files. 2.

Written by MasterClass Last updated: Sep 3, 2021 • 4 min read Pacing is a critical component of writing, whether you’re embarking on a novel, a novella, a short story, or a non-fiction book. As an author, you possess a key tool for pacing your audience’s reading experience: chapter length. The best authors manage the length of their chapters to pace the main character’s narrative arc. Proper chapter length also helps authors match their reader’s attention span and also build up anticipation for each twist and turn.

How Long Should a Chapter Be? 5 Examples of Chapter Length 4 Tips on How to Write Chapters of Your Novel Want to Learn More About Writing? Dan Brown Teaches Writing Thrillers Why Does Chapter Length Matter? When you set the length of your chapters, you guide your reader’s journey through the whole story you’ve laid out in your novel. Chapter breaks function as scene breaks. When these breaks are properly paced, they function like edits in a feature film. Most novels feature chapters of similar length throughout, but sometimes abnormally long chapters or abnormally short chapters can effectively change the pace of storytelling in key moments. If you write a novel that averages 3,000 words per chapter but, two-thirds of the way through the book, you insert a 400 word chapter, it is likely to grab your audience’s attention. Chapter length is important, but it is not the most critical element of novel writing. Often a first draft will be written with minimal regard to chapter length, but by the time the final draft reaches the publisher, chapter size has been standardized throughout the book. Meet One of Your New Instructors Sign Up How Long Should a Chapter Be? Standard chapter length varies depending upon genre. Shorter chapters dominate genres like thrillers (such as those by James Patterson and Dan Brown), mystery novels (such as those by Agatha Christie), and young adult literature (such as the novels of R.L. Stine). Longer chapters with a higher word count can be found in literary fiction, particularly in novels written in the period up to the early twentieth century. If you’re an indie author embarking on novel writing for the first time, think of each chapter as a mini-story within the context of your whole book. It won’t be constructive to approach your first novel with a set of hard and fast rules about how long a chapter should be, so let that chapter’s story dictate the page count. Your readers won’t be counting the number of words in each chapter. Despite this, most people have an ineffable sense of story pacing and will respond positively when a chapter ends without overstaying its welcome. 5 Examples of Chapter Length A survey of popular fiction from different eras reveals the following chapter word count for selected books: 1. Middlesex: This critically renowned 2002 novel by Jeffrey Eugenides divides its 544 pages into 28 chapters. Its average word count is 6023 words per chapter. 2. The Kite Runner: This 2003 New York Times bestseller by Khaled Hosseini divides its 372 pages into 25 chapters. Its average chapter length is 4282 words. 3. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone: The iconic 1997 YA novel by J.K. Rowling is similar to The Kite Runner in that its average chapter contains 4559 words. 4. The Hunger Games: Each book in this series by Suzanne Collins has an average chapter word count of 3694 words. 5. The Handmaid’s Tale: On the lower end of things, Margaret Atwood’s dystopian 1985 novel averages only 2096 words per chapter—less than half of the average length of Middlesex chapters. 4 Tips on How to Write Chapters of Your Novel The overall story arc of a novel is essential, but meticulous construction of individual chapters is just as important to the reader’s experience. If anyone knows this, it’s David Baldacci, author of numerous bestselling thrillers and mysteries; he takes incredible care to properly structure his novels from the first chapter to the last. Here are a few of his tips for structuring chapters: 1. Keep scenes and chapters short. David keeps his chapters short—between three to five pages. This keeps the narrative moving at a brisk pace. 2. Keep your audience asking questions. When a chapter answers a question from a previous chapter, you have the opportunity to introduce a new one. The new question will propel you through the next chapter. A classic example from crime fiction: “Will this serial killer strike again?” becomes “He struck again—now how many more people will he kill?” Keep this up over the course of a novel, and the book will be a page-turner. 3. Make sure each chapter has a purpose that ties into the bigger story. If you lose sight of the overarching narrative of your novel, your individual chapters can begin to feel aimless. To keep your novel focused and on track, you should have a clear objective with every scene you write. 4. Don’t fluff up the novel with irrelevant content. Scene-setting and vivid descriptions are critical for a compelling novel, but don’t get bogged down in the details. Focus on sustaining narrative momentum from chapter one onward. 5. Make your scenes multitask. Driving the plot forward, conveying information, and deepening a character’s development are the three most critical jobs that a chapter can do. The short chapters you write should make use of at least one of these tools, and preferably more than one. Want to Learn More About Writing?

It operates through four segments: Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, Resources and Utilities, and Transportation.Stock Market Value: 12.88 billion (51.77 a share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTrimble, 1-yearActivist: Jana PartnersPercentage Ownership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. They made their name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy \\"V cubed\\". The three \\"Vs\\" were\\" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, they have gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three \\"Ss\\" (i) Stock price – buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism – sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees – aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.What's happening:On December 11, 2023, JANA Partners announced that they have taken a position in Trimble Inc and are calling on the Company to cease M&A activities and instead focus on organic growth in its existing businessesBehind the scenes:Trimble started in 1978 as a GPS technology company, primarily for agriculture. In the 2000s it entered the construction industry with its acquisition of Spectra Precision. It continued growing through acquisition and over the past 10 years has spent 5 billion on acquisitions, primarily buying software businesses with the goal of providing an interconnected hardware and software product. In 2012, they acquired the 3D modeling software package SketchUp from Google and continued to expand their Building Information Modeling portfolio with the acquisition of Tekla in 2014. In 2016, Trimble acquired Sefaira, a software for sustainability analysis including energy modeling and daylight visualization. More recently, in 2018, Trimble acquired Viewpoint (a leading provider of construction management software) from Bain Capital for 1.2 billion, and in 2019 launched Trimble MAPS, consolidating several of its previous acquisitions. They now offer hardware and software solutions in under-tech served industries such as construction, transportation, forestry and agriculture.The company's multiple software acquisitions have led to their mix changing in a very positive way. In 2011, 16% of their revenue came from software and services that are by their nature recurring and higher multiple revenue. In 2024, it will be more than half. However, while the business mix has transformed for the better, during this time the stock has significantly underperformed – over the past three years, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 50%.A lot of this underperformance can be tied to their recent history of software M&A activity. They have been buying companies for 30 to 40 times EBITDA and the acquired companies are being valued at Trimble's EBITDA multiple of 14 times EBITDA inside of Trimble. The market understands this and as a result, has reacted negatively to their acquisitions, as recently evidenced by their April 2023 acquisition of Transporeon (a cloud-based transportation management platform) for 30 times EBITDA. After the deal was announced, the company's stock dropped 6.5%. Trimble is not getting credit for their new product mix with a re-rating to a higher software multiple. This does not mean 30 to 40 times EBITDA, but industrial technology peers trade in the mid-teens to mid-20s. If they can get in line with peers, Jana sees a stock upside of over 40%.The first thing Jana would like the company to do is cease M&A activity and focus on the core business. To do this, the board should tie executive compensation to return on invested capital, instead of the current compensation structure which incentivizes revenue growth targets. Second, Jana sees an opportunity for the company to focus on improving operations and profit margins. Over the past eight years of increasing software product mix the company has expanded its gross margins by approximately 800 basis points, yet they have expanded their EBITDA margins by only 500 basis points (1 basis point equals 0.01%). There is an opportunity to better integrate these acquisitions and improve operating margins. Lastly, this is a complicated business structure that could benefit from a simplification. This past September, Trimble announced that it entered a joint venture with AGCO Corporation (AGCO) (a worldwide manufacturer and distributor of agricultural machinery and Precision Ag technology), whereby AGCO will acquire an 85% interest in Trimble's portfolio of Ag assets and technologies for 2.0 billion. This got the opposite market reaction than when Trimble acquires companies, sending Trimble's stock price up 6.5%.While their primary objective here is to have the company stick to the core business and cease their M&A activity, there is another ironic opportunity here, and that is the M&A opportunity created by the company's history of value destroying M&A. Trimble could be an attractive acquisition target for a larger industrial company who also wants a product mix with more software but has the discipline not to pay 30 to 40 times EBITDA for software companies. With a greater than 50% software mix and a much lower EBITDA multiple, Trimble would be an attractive asset for many large industrial companies.Jana often launches activist campaigns with a team of experienced industry executives ready to be board nominees if necessary. While we assume they have connections to such executives, there has been no announcement that they have recruited any, which means to us that it is too early to tell if this will be escalated. However, we will not have to wait that long. The director nomination window opens on February 2, 2024, at which time we will have more clarity on which road this campaign will take.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.

Voici quelques étapes pour diagnostiquer et éventuellement résoudre le problème : 1. **Vérification de la position du tuyau de vidange** : Le tuyau de vidange doit être installé correctement. Assurez-vous qu'il est placé à une hauteur appropriée (généralement au moins 60 cm au-dessus du sol) et qu'il n'est pas trop enfoncé dans le tuyau d'évacuation. Si le tuyau est placé trop bas ou qu’il plonge trop profondément dans l'évacuation, cela peut causer un siphonnage, ce qui entraîne une vidange constante de l'eau. 2. **Vérifiez le programme sélectionné** : Certains programmes de lave-linge peuvent inclure une vidange en début de cycle. Assurez-vous que vous n'avez pas sélectionné un tel programme par erreur. 3. **Inspectez la pompe de vidange** : Si la pompe de vidange est activée en permanence, cela peut causer une vidange continue. Vérifiez si la pompe ou son relais est défectueux. 4. **Contrôle de l'électrovanne** : L'électrovanne qui contrôle l'entrée et la fermeture de l'eau peut être défectueuse. Si elle ne ferme pas correctement, l'eau peut continuer à couler et être évacuée par le tuyau de vidange. 5. **Consultez le manuel du fabricant** : Pour des instructions spécifiques à votre modèle de lave-linge. Le manuel peut avoir des dépannages et des conseils sur la façon de résoudre les problèmes associés au cycle de remplissage de l'eau. 6. **Vérification des capteurs** : Certains lave-linges sont équipés de capteurs de niveau d'eau qui, s'ils sont défectueux, peuvent causer des problèmes de remplissage et de vidange. Il peut être nécessaire de contrôler ou de remplacer ces capteurs. 7. **Faites appel à un technicien professionnel** : Si vous n'êtes pas à l'aise avec le dépannage électroménager ou si les étapes précédentes n’ont pas résolu le problème, il est préférable de faire appel à un technicien de service qualifié. Un professionnel pourra diagnostiquer et réparer le problème avec précision."},{"prompt":"t","completion":"I apologize, but it seems like your question was incomplete.

In this excerpt, Hercules has agreed to trade places so that Atlas can go retrieve three golden apples from the garden of the Hesperides for Hercules. 1 \\"I am glad to see you again,\\" shouted Hercules, when the giant (Atlas) was within hearing. \\"So you have got the golden apples?\\" 2 \\"Certainly, certainly,\\" answered Atlas; \\"and very fair apples they are. I took the finest that grew on the tree, I assure you. Ah! it is a beautiful spot, that garden of the Hesperides. Yes; and the dragon with a hundred heads is a sight worth any man's seeing. After all, you had better have gone for the apples yourself.\\" 3 \\"No matter,\\" replied Hercules. \\"You have had a pleasant ramble, and have done the business as well as I could. I heartily thank you for your trouble, And now, as I have a long way to go, and am rather in haste,--and as the king, my cousin, is anxious to receive the golden apples, - will you be kind enough to take the sky off my shoulders again?\\" 4 \\"Why, as to that,\\" said the giant, chucking the golden apples into the air twenty miles high, or thereabouts, and catching them as they came down,-\\"as to that, my good friend, I consider you a little unreasonable, Cannot I carry the golden apples to the king, your cousin, much quicker than you could? As his majesty is in such a hurry to get them, I promise you to take my longest strides. And, besides, I have no fancy for burdening myself with the sky, just now.\\" 5 \\"What?\\" shouted Hercules, very wrathfully, “do you intend to make me bear this burden forever?\\" 6\\"We will see about that, one of these days,\\" answered the giant. \\"At all events, you ought not to complain, if you have to bear it the next hundred years, or perhaps the next thousand. I bore it a good while longer, in spite of the back-ache. Well, then, after a thousand years, if I happen to feel in the mood, we may possibly shift about again. You are certainly a very strong man, and can never have a better opportunity to prove it. Posterity will talk of you, I warrant it!\\" 7 \\"Pish! a fig for its talk!\\" cried Hercules, with another hitch of his shoulders. \\"Just take the sky upon your head one instant, will you? I want to make a cushion of my lion's skin, for the weight to rest upon. It really chafes me, and will cause unnecessary inconvenience in so many centuries as I am to stand here.\\" 8 \\"That's no more than fair, and I'll do it!\\" quoth the giant; for he had no unkind feeling towards Hercules, and was merely acting with a too selfish consideration of his own ease. \\"For just five minutes, then, I'll take back the sky. Only for five minutes, recollect! I have no idea of spending another thousand years as I spent the last. Variety is the spice of life, say I.\\" 9 Ah, the thick-witted old rogue of a giant! He threw down the golden apples, and received back the sky, from the head and shoulders of Hercules, upon his own, where it rightly belonged. And Hercules picked up the three golden apples, that were as big or bigger than pumpkins, and straightway set out on his journey homeward, without paying the slightest heed to the thundering tones of the giant, who bellowed after him to come back. Excerpt from \\"The Three Golden Apples\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, from A Wonder Book for Girls and boys. In the public domain. 54 (2018) Passage 2: from Weight by Jeanette Winterson In this excerpt, Heracles awaits the return of Atlas from the garden of the Hesperides. 10 He woke in a sweat. He couldn't even wipe his brow. He stared unfocused into the serene starryness of the universe and wondered if he shouted loud enough would he get a reply? 11 “ATLAS!” he yelled. “ATLAS!” And on earth there was thunder in the mountains. 12 “There's no need to shout,” said Atlas, “I can hear you.\\" 13 There he was, tall, smiling, standing in front of Heracles, blissfully free of any burden. Heracles felt his skin burning with jealousy, 14 \\"Did you get the apples?\\" he said, trying to sound cool. 15 Atlas reached into his pouch pocket and brought them out, still shining with their strange light. Then he said, 16 Heracles, I'll take these to Eurystheus for you.' 17 Wouldn't hear of it mate,' said Heracles, 'You've done enough already. 18 “You aren't getting tired are you?” said Atlas. 19 “Tired? No mate, I love it here, makes a change, no problem.” 20 “Well then,” said Atlas, “do you want anything before I go?” 21 Heracles was nervous. If he made a fuss, Atlas could just walk away. Heracles couldn't put the world down without help. Atas could trap him here forever. 22 “Since you ask, I'd like a pad for my head-take the weight off.” 23 Atlas was kind hearted and he did not want to see Heracles suffer, so he searched through his bag of belongings and found a thick fleece that he could fold into a cushion. He bent over Heracles and tried to fit it behind his neck. 24 ... Look, just take the world for a second, and I'll fit the pad on my shoulders, and then we'll be straight. Oh and don't squash the apples will you? 25 Unsuspecting Atlas nodded and bent down to put the apples on the floor of the universe. Then with a light flick he spun the Kosmos off Heracles and held it over his head. 26 Heracles quickly picked up the apples. 27 Better make yourself comfortable mate. I'm not coming back: 28 What could Atlas do? He wanted to hurl the universe at Heracles, crush him, annihilate time and make the story start again. 29 Come on Atlas,' said Heracles, 'you've had your fun.' 30 Slowly, so as not to spill one drop of milk, Atlas lowered the Kosmos back onto his shoulders, and bent himself under the burden. He did it with such grace and ease, with such gentleness, love almost, that Heracles was ashamed for a moment. He would gladly have dashed the world to pieces if that would have freed him. He saw now that Atlas could do just that, but did not, and he respected him but would not help him. 31 \\"Goodbye Atlas,' said Heracles, 'and thanks...","completion":"Passage 1: 1. \\"I am glad to see you again,\\" shouted Hercules, when the giant (Atlas) was within hearing. \\"So you have got the golden apples?\\" - Introduce: Hercules expresses his happiness upon seeing Atlas and inquires about the golden apples. 2. \\"Certainly, certainly,\\" answered Atlas; \\"and very fair apples they are. I took the finest that grew on the tree, I assure you. Ah! it is a beautiful spot, that garden of the Hesperides. Yes; and the dragon with a hundred heads is a sight worth any man's seeing. After all, you had better have gone for the apples yourself.\\" - Cite: Atlas responds to Hercules and confirms his acquisition of the golden apples. - Explain: Atlas describes the beauty of the garden and mentions the challenge of the hundred-headed dragon. - Develop: Atlas implies that Hercules might have enjoyed the experience of retrieving the apples himself. 3. \\"No matter,\\" replied Hercules. \\"You have had a pleasant ramble, and have done the business as well as I could. I heartily thank you for your trouble, And now, as I have a long way to go, and am rather in haste,--and as the king, my cousin, is anxious to receive the golden apples, - will you be kind enough to take the sky off my shoulders again?\\" - Introduce: Hercules responds to Atlas and acknowledges his effort. - Explain: Hercules expresses gratitude and states his need to continue his journey. - Develop: Hercules requests Atlas to take the sky off his shoulders, as he took them temporarily while Hercules retrieved the golden apples. 4. \\"Why, as to that,\\" said the giant, chucking the golden apples into the air twenty miles high, or thereabouts, and catching them as they came down,-\\"as to that, my good friend, I consider you a little unreasonable. Cannot I carry the golden apples to the king, your cousin, much quicker than you could? As his majesty is in such a hurry to get them, I promise you to take my longest strides. And, besides, I have no fancy for burdening myself with the sky, just now.\\" - Introduce: Atlas responds to Hercules' request. - Cite: Atlas throws the golden apples in the air and catches them. - Explain: Atlas questions the necessity of Hercules carrying the apples, proposing that he can do it more quickly. - Develop: Atlas emphasizes the inconvenience of burdening himself with the sky again. 5. \\"What?\\" shouted Hercules, very wrathfully, “do you intend to make me bear this burden forever?\\" - Introduce: Hercules reacts indignantly to Atlas' response. - Develop: Hercules expresses anger and disbelief at the prospect of carrying the sky forever. 6. \\"We will see about that, one of these days,\\" answered the giant. \\"At all events, you ought not to complain, if you have to bear it the next hundred years, or perhaps the next thousand. I bore it a good while longer, in spite of the back-ache. Well, then, after a thousand years, if I happen to feel in the mood, we may possibly shift about again. You are certainly a very strong man, and can never have a better opportunity to prove it. Posterity will talk of you, I warrant it!\\" - Introduce: Atlas responds to Hercules' outburst. - Explain: Atlas suggests that Hercules may have to bear the burden for a long time. - Develop: Atlas encourages Hercules to see this as an opportunity to prove his strength and muses about the fame he will receive. 7. \\"Pish! a fig for its talk!\\" cried Hercules, with another hitch of his shoulders. \\"Just take the sky upon your head one instant, will you? I want to make a cushion of my lion's skin, for the weight to rest upon. It really chafes me, and will cause unnecessary inconvenience in so many centuries as I am to stand here.\\" - Introduce: Hercules dismisses Atlas' talk of posterity and makes a request. - Explain: Hercules seeks temporary relief from the burden and explains his discomfort. - Develop: Hercules wants to use his lion's skin as a cushion to alleviate the strain. 8. \\"That's no more than fair, and I'll do it!\\" quoth the giant; for he had no unkind feeling towards Hercules, and was merely acting with a too selfish consideration of his own ease. \\"For just five minutes, then, I'll take back the sky. Only for five minutes, recollect! I have no idea of spending another thousand years as I spent the last. Variety is the spice of life, say I.\\" - Introduce: Atlas agrees to Hercules' request. - Cite: Atlas states that he will take the sky for five minutes. - Explain: Atlas clarifies his reluctance to bear the burden again for an extended period and emphasizes the desire for variety. - Develop: Atlas acknowledges his concern for his own ease. 9. Ah, the thick-witted old rogue of a giant! He threw down the golden apples, and received back the sky, from the head and shoulders of Hercules, upon his own, where it rightly belonged. And Hercules picked up the three golden apples, that were as big or bigger than pumpkins and straightway set out on his journey homeward, without paying the slightest heed to the thundering tones of the giant, who bellowed after him to come back. - Introduce: The narrator comments on Atlas' actions. - Cite: Atlas throws down the golden apples and receives the sky back from Hercules. - Explain: The narrator emphasizes the rightful place of the sky on Atlas' shoulders. - Develop: Hercules retrieves the golden apples and continues on his journey while disregarding Atlas' protests. Passage 2: 10. He woke in a sweat. He couldn't even wipe his brow. He stared unfocused into the serene starryness of the universe and wondered if he shouted loud enough would he get a reply? - Introduce: Heracles wakes up feeling uneasy and sweaty. - Explain: Heracles gazes at the universe and contemplates whether his shouts would be heard. - Develop: Heracles is uncertain about the effectiveness of his attempts to communicate. 11. \\"ATLAS!\\" he yelled. \\"ATLAS!\\" And on earth, there was thunder in the mountains. - Cite: Heracles shouts for Atlas. - Explain: Thunder occurs on Earth in response to his call. - Develop: The natural response echoes Heracles' call. 12. \\"There's no need to shout,\\" said Atlas, \\"I can hear you.\\" - Cite: Atlas responds to Heracles' shouting. - Explain: Atlas assures Heracles that he can hear him. - Develop: Atlas indicates that he doesn't require such loud shouts to be heard.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants. After that, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules the returning woman over how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being so smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"**INT. FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY** *Background: Leila, a defiant college senior Arab American woman, is returning home from an excruciatingly long lecture followed by a bus ride fraught with unexpected delays. During the journey, an uncomfortable pressure began to build in her abdomen, but every attempt to use a restroom was met with obstacles, from out-of-service public facilities to the bus suddenly departing moments before she could seek relief at a cafe. Now, with her key lost and her urge unbearable, she approaches her family's house in the suburban neighborhood with an air of desperation.* *Leila is an Arab American woman in her early 20s. She's dressed in breathable workout capri pants and a loose-fitting t-shirt that's slightly damp with sweat under a casual open jacket. Her black hair is tied back in a practical ponytail.* **CLOSE ON: Leila's face—strained, beads of perspiration line the brow.** Leila staggers up the walkway to her family's front door. Her pace quickens as she frantically pats her pockets in search of the misplaced key. **CUT TO: Her fingers shifting through empty pockets—no key.** *Momentarily, she groans in anguish.* Leila hesitates for only a second before hammering on the door with the side of her fist, the urgency apparent in her knock. **LEILA** *(frantic)* Mom! Open up, please! Seconds feel like hours. Without an immediate answer, she shuffles on the spot, squeezing her legs together in a telltale dance of urgency, her need to move her bowels building to a distressing crescendo. **CUT TO: The door from inside the house—dull thuds of knocking.** *From the other side of the door, a voice calls out—confused.* **NADIA (O.S.)** Leila, is that you? What's going on? *Nadia, mid-50s, is a well-put-together woman with an air of matriarchal authority. She is wearing a comfortable house dress and her hair is in rollers.* **CUT TO: Leila's increasingly desperate face, her plea urgent but vague.** LEILA *(pleading)* Just open the door, mom! Hurry up! **NADIA (O.S.)** Okay, hold on! The sound of multiple locks turning ensues, each click agonizingly slow to Leila's ears. Nadia finally opens the door, looking her daughter up and down with a growing crease of concern on her forehead. **NADIA** *(puzzled and concerned)* Leila, what's—? Leila cuts her off, trying to squeeze past. LEILA Move, I need to get in! Nadia reacts instinctively to Leila's distress, placing her hands on Leila's shoulders. **NADIA** Tell me what's wrong first. LEILA *(strained)* Just let me through! The women tangle in an awkward dance as Nadia tries to block Leila's frantic determination to enter. The tension is high, the physical comedy pronounced yet grounded in the genuine concern of the scene. **CLOSE ON: Leila's face—panic shifting to resignation.** Suddenly, Leila's expression distorts as the inevitable happens. The clench in her jaw gives way to a groan of abrupt release. She stops struggling. **NADIA** *(loosening grip, perplexed)* Leila? Leila gently pries Nadia's hands away, backing up slightly into a more accommodating position for her continued relief. **LEILA** *(exhaling with latent satisfaction)* Oh... okay... Nadia, torn between worry and bewilderment, steps closer. **NADIA** Is something wrong, habibti? Leila doesn't answer, focusing instead on the act of relieving herself, allowing soft grunts to escape as she unburdens herself. **CLOSE ON: Nadia's face—confusion laced with a hint of realization.** The smell wafting through the entryway is undeniable. Nadia's nose wrinkles as she sniffs the air, tracing the odorous path to its source. **NADIA** *(sniffing again, a physical reaction starting to show)* What is that smell? Leila looks at her mother, mortification tinting her cheeks as the intensity in her expression fades to sheepishness. Nadia pieces it together with visible repulsion. **NADIA** *(disgusted and bewildered)* Leila... did you— Leila remains silent, her expression telling all. **NADIA** *(pressing, reacting to the smell with a wave of her hand)* Is that... from... you? LEILA *(avoiding admission)* Can I go in now? Nadia steps aside, her reaction to the smell evident in her contorted face. Leila waddles into the house, a hand cupping the seat of her pants. **NADIA** *(warning)* Stop! Don't move or you'll—ugh, you pooped your pants?! Leila stands frozen, still cupping the offending area, shamefaced and blushing to her ears. **NADIA** *(taunting)* So dirty, Leila. Can't believe how smelly you are! LEILA *(playing the victim with sly indignation)* It's your fault... you took forever with the door. NADIA *(disbelievingly)* That's no excuse! She censures Leila's choice to fully relieve herself in her pants. **LEILA** *(asserting herself)* I had to! I was past my breaking point, mom! She reflexively checks the bulk in her pants and shakes her head with a mix of embarrassment and wry humor. **LEILA** *(coyly, despite the mess)* But... I won't lie, it felt good to let it out. Nadia bars progress to the bathroom, her disappointment in her daughter's actions clear. **NADIA** *(indignant)* You blame me? After what you did? Scoffing, she playfully scolds Leila for her dirty satisfaction. Nadia demands to inspect the mess for herself. After a brief scuffle, she turns Leila and is faced with her daughter's soiled bottom. **NADIA** *(incredulously taunting)* Look how full they are! And you seem so pleased! **LEILA** *(coyly defensive)* There was... a lot in there. What happened... it was... necessary. A shrill Nadia insists Leila's contentedness with releasing her bowels in such a manner is inappropriate. **NADIA** *(mocking)* You want to be satisfied like a child, I'll treat you like one! She mock-inspects the bulge, sniffing near it with exaggerated expressions of disgust. Leila cringes. **NADIA** *(ridiculing)* Phew, Leila! You're one stinky girl! Leila, cringing, admits her current state. **LEILA** *(resigned witticism)* Since you're keeping me here, let's enjoy the smell together, then. Nadia swiftly dismisses this and ushers Leila to the bathroom while still complaining about the pervasive stench. She gingerly assists Leila in not making a mess en route. **NADIA** *(reasserting urgency)* Just go clean up, you can't stand here—ugh, the stink! Leila starts the waddle to the bathroom as Nadia both reprimands and aids her with comedic disgust, persisting in her complaints about the smell and the mess. **AT THE BATHROOM: Leila stops right at the threshold.** **LEILA** *(teasing, holding her nose)* Want to change my diaper? Nadia's frustration hits its peak. Seizing the moment, she forcefully nudges Leila into the bathroom, pressing the bulge and spreading the mess. **NADIA** *(hand on her nose, pushing Leila)* Get in, now, you dirty girl! Leila gasps, appalled at the squished sensation. LEILA *(repelled)* Ew, it's all over! Nadia stands outside, still covering her nose, muttering about Leila's noisome state as the scene fades out. **FADE OUT.**"},{"prompt":"Допоможи скласти план реферату на тему Світоглядно-естетичні орієнтації українських постмодерністів\\".

Ось приклад вступної частини: --- # Вступ 1.1. **Актуальність теми** Світоглядно-естетичні орієнтації українських постмодерністів є актуальною темою, яка відкриває широке поле для дослідження культурного й літературного процесу в Україні на межі XX і XXI століть. Постмодернізм як художньо-філософський напрямок відіграв суттєву роль у формуванні нової художньої свідомості, що призвело до зміни парадигм у розумінні історії, культури та мистецтва. Українське постмодерністське мистецтво посідає унікальне місце у вітчизняній культурі, впливаючи на літературні та мистецькі процеси сьогодні та висуваючи питання ідентичності, багатокультурності та суспільного розвитку. 1.2. **Мета роботи** Метою даної роботи є дослідження світоглядних та естетичних аспектів творчості українських постмодерністів, які сприяють розумінню особливостей цього культурного явища. Реферат спрямований на вивчення історичного контексту виникнення постмодернізму, його філософських та стилістичних характеристик, а також аналізу конкретних творів українських письменників, які відображають постмодерністські тенденції.

Основні характеристики постмодернізму як культурного напрямку** 2.1. **Історія постмодернізму** Постмодернізм як культурний та філософський рух з’явився в середині 20-го століття як реакція на модернізм, який домінував у західній культурі від кінця 19-го до середини 20-го століття. Модернізм був спрямований на пошук універсальної істини через раціоналізм, однозначність та впорядкованість. Натомість, постмодернізм запропонував більшу скептичність щодо таких понять, відкидання грандіозних метанаративів, інтерес до локальних імені та суб'єктивності. Постмодернізм охоплює різні області культури, включаючи літературу, мистецтво, архітектуру, кіно, музику та критику. Він розпочався приблизно в 1960-х роках і досягнув свого піку в 1980-х. Однак його впровадження та розвиток відрізнявся в залежності від культурного та географічного контексту. 2.2. **Філософські засади постмодернізму** Філософія постмодернізму широко асоціюється з такими мислителями, як Жан-Франсуа Ліотар, який у своїй роботі \\"Постмодернізм для дітей\\" охарактеризував постмодернізм через \\"недовіру до метанаративів\\" та відмову від усеохоплюючих пояснень. Інші впливові постмодерністські філософи включають Жака Дерріда, який описав процес \\"деконструкції\\" текстів, та Мішеля Фуко, який аналізував питання влади та соціальних інституцій. Постмодернізм ставить під сумнів ідею про об'єктивність знання, стверджує, що істина завжди відносна і залежна від контексту. Важливим аспектом є також гра із словами та символами, значущість яких визначається структурою мови, культури та суспільних взаємодій. 2.3. **Основні риси постмодернізму** Серед ознак постмодернізму виділяють: - **Непевність та скептицизм**: Відмова від ідеї, що завдяки науці чи філософії можливо знайти остаточні відповіді на фундаментальні питання. - **Плуралізм та різноманітність**: Поощрення різноплановості та відмінностей, включаючи різні культурні та етнічні ідентичності. - **Деконструкція**: Метод аналізу, що полягає у розкладанні та осмисленні прихованих структур, які формують значення і сприйняття. - **Інтертекстуальність**: Використання алюзій, цитат та посилань на інші тексти як засіб вираження та створення шарів значення. - **Пародійність та іронія**: Використання пародії та іронії для критики сучасних і традиційних поглядів, стилів та ідей. - **Стилістична гетерогенність**: Об'єднання різних стилів і жанрів в одному творі чи культурному виразі. - **Сімулякри та гіперреальність**: Розмивання меж між \\"реальністю\\" та її зображенням, що призводить до створення \\"гіперреальності\\", де симуляція стає основною реальністю. Ці та інші культурні характеристики постмодернізму стали фундаментом для літературного, візуального та суспільного мистецтва, впливаючи на розуміння сучасної культури та її естетичні орієнтації. --- Для написання детального розділу за цим каркасом, слід звертатися до робіт ключових постмодерністських теоретиків, аналізувати головні тексти цієї течії, та описувати конкретні прояви у мистецтві та літературі. Також важливо розглянути критику постмодернізму та його вплив на різні сфери культури. Окрім того, наявність прикладів ілюструє як теорія рефлектується в практиці."},{"prompt":"Допоможи написати цей розділ: 3. Постмодернізм в українському контексті 3.1. Поява та розвиток постмодернізму в Україні 3.2. Особливості українського постмодернізму","completion":"# 3. Постмодернізм в українському контексті 3.1. **Поява та розвиток постмодернізму в Україні** Постмодернізм увійшов в український культурний простір у кінці 1980-х – на початку 1990-х років, що співпало з періодом стрімких суспільно-політичних змін, зокрема з розпадом Радянського Союзу та здобуттям Україною незалежності. Цей період характеризувався інтенсивним пошуком нових культурних орієнтирів, ревізією радянської спадщини, а також відкриттям для світового плюралізму ідей і культурних практик. В літературі постмодернізм відображав зусилля письменників вийти за рамки традиційних жанрових форм, використовувати нові наративні структури та теми для вираження нових реалій незалежної України. Період \\"перебудови\\" й швидких змін сприяв приходу на перші плани таких письменників, як Юрій Андрухович, Оксана Забужко, Сергій Жадан, які стали ключовими постатями у формуванні українського постмодернізму. Ці автори зуміли ефективно використати постмодерністські прийоми, аби відобразити складність, що виникла у період транзиційного суспільства. 3.2. **Особливості українського постмодернізму** Український постмодернізм має свої унікальні риси, які відображають історичний та культурний контекст країни. Ці особливості випливають як зі сприйняття глобальних тенденцій, так і з реакції на внутрішньополітичні події, суспільні зміни та культурну самобутність. Серед ключових особливостей українського постмодернізму можна відзначити наступні: - **Звернення до історії**: В українському постмодернізмі помітна тенденція до переосмислення та деконструкції історичного наративу, особливо пов’язаного з Радянським періодом та часами Другої світової війни. - **Гібрид ідентичності**: У творчості українських постмодерністів часто присутній мотив пошуку національної ідентичності в контексті глобалізації та історичних зламів. - **Експерименти з мовою**: Ігри з мовою, двомовність та діалекталізм є частими прийомами, котрі використовують письменники для дослідження культурної багатоманітності та мовної політики. - **Політична ангажованість**: На відміну від західного постмодернізму, що часто уникає прямих політичних заяв, український постмодернізм не вагається займати активну суспільно-політичну позицію. - **Міфологія і фольклор**: Втілення міфологічного та фольклорного матеріалу у сучасний контекст, який дозволяє поглибити діалог між минулим та сучасністю. - **Жанрова еклектика**: Змішування та пародіювання різних жанрів, від наукової фантастики до детективів, романтики й автобіографії. В контексті розробки реферату на тему українського постмодернізму, варто глибше аналізувати та інтерпретувати твори окремих авторів і їхній вплив на розвиток культурних процесів у сучасній Україні. Важливим є також розуміння, як гібридність особливостей цього культурного напряму відображає широкий спектр суспільних, історичних, та ідентичних пошуків, що мають місце в українському контексті."},{"prompt":"4.

Світоглядні аспекти творчості українських постмодерністів** 4.1. **Основні філософські мотиви** Філософія українського постмодернізму спирається на широкий спектр мотивів та ідей, властивих світовому постмодерністському плину, однак збагачених місцевим контекстом. Серед основних філософських мотивів, які простежуються в творчості українських постмодерністів, можна виділити наступні: - **Відносність істини та множинність реальності**: Автори часто ставлять під сумнів універсалізм наукового знання та однозначності історичного наративу, натомість надаючи пріоритет індивідуальному досвіду та суб'єктивному сприйняттю реальності. - **Рефлексія над минулим і історичною пам'яттю**: Рефлексії над радянською історією та наслідками ідеологічного тиску, іноді через іронічну та пародійну призму, допомагають формувати новий критичний дискурс щодо колективної пам'яті. - **Постструктуралізм та деконструкція мовних структур**: Запитання про мову, її значення та здатність передавати досвід залишаються ключовими, зосереджуючись на гнучкості та багатозначності мови. - **Центр і периферія**: Тема культурного та економічного маргіналізму як в Україні так і в ширшому міжнародному контексті, де центр втрачає своє панівне положення на користь більш різноманітного розподілу голосів і перспектив. - **Саморефлексія і метафікція**: Використання саморефлексивних прийомів, де твори самі коментують своє власне створення, роль автора та процес літературної виробництва. - **Гри з читачем**: Розмиття меж між реальністю і художнім світом, де читач часто включається в текст як активний учасник, вирішуючи головоломки та відгадуючи інтриги, що постають перед ним. 4.2. **Оригінальність світогляду українських постмодерністів** Український постмодернізм відзначається оригінальним злиттям всесвітніх культурних та філософських традицій з унікальним історичним досвідом та культурними особливостями українського народу. Твори українських постмодерністів відображають глибоке осмислення національної ідентичності, яка продовжує змінюватися в результаті нових історичних обставин. Світогляд цих авторів можна характеризувати тим, що він: - **Полілогічний**: Відкритість до діалогу між різними культурами та історичними періодами. - **Динамічний**: Здатність адаптуватися до постійних змін у суспільстві та відображення сучасних соціальних викликів у творчості. - **Синтезуючий**: Об'єднання східних і західних культурних елементів для створення нового культурного набору символів та образів. - **Критичний та самовідданий**: Гостра самокритичність та водночас відданість розвитку і відродженню української культури. Осмислення історичного минулого, переосмислення традиційних міфів та легенд, експерименти з формами та художніми техніками - всі ці аспекти світоглядної оригінальності українських постмодерністів спонукають до поглибленого аналізу ідентифікації їх впливу на розвиток сучасної української культурної та літературної сцени."},{"prompt":"5.

Естетичні орієнтації українських постмодерністів 5.1. **Стилістичні особливості** Українські постмодерністи прагнуть виразити себе через широке розмаїття стилістичних прийомів, які відображають поліфонічність та багатогранність сучасної культури. В їхніх творах можна знайти: - **Фрагментацію та колаж**: Тексти часто складаються з відокремлених фрагментів чи епізодів, які читачу доводиться інтегрувати у цілісний наратив. - **Пастіш та інтертекстуальність**: Використання цитат, алюзій до інших літературних творів та культурних феноменів, приховане або відкрите запозичення стилів для створення багаторівневої наративної структури. - **Метатекстуальність**: Часте звернення уваги на сам процес письма та створення літератури, де текст коментує сам себе. - **Ігри з персоналізацією**: Персонажі можуть бути умисно неповними або містити елементи автора чи читача, створюючи замість цілісного образу лише його відлиск. - **Експериментація з мовою**: У творчих текстах можна зустріти гру зі словами, неологізми та експерименти з синтаксичною структурою. 5.2. **Жанрова різноманітність** Український постмодернізм відзначається жанровою гнучкістю, дозволяючи авторам переміщатися вільно між традиційно сталеними формами та створювати нові жанрові гібриди: - **Міксування жанрів**: Наприклад, елементи кримінального роману можуть бути зібрані разом з традиціями міфологічного епосу або авангардної поезії. - **Пародія та травестія**: Класичні жанри часто переінакшуються з гумористичною та іронічною ноткою, за допомогою якої автори надають коментар сучасному суспільству. - **Літературна гра**: Ігрові фоорми, як-от детективи та кросворди, іноді використовуються не лише для розваги, але й для більш складної взаємодії з читачем. 5.3. **Традиційні та новаторські форми** Українські постмодерністи не відвертаються від своєї культурної спадщини, але використовують традиційні форми як основу для новаторства, трансформуючи та розширюючи можливості вираження: - **Розширення жанрових кордонів**: Традиційні поетичні або прозові форми отримують нове життя завдяки нетрадиційному змісту та стильовим експериментам. - **Відродження фольклору**: Елементи українського фольклору, такі як пісні, приказки, легенди, та оповіді, часто використовуються в сучасній обробці для передачі універсальних тем. - **Новаторська проза**: Проба створити прозу без сюжету, без персонажів, або без чітко оформленої внутрішньої логіки. Загалом, естетичні орієнтації українських постмодерністів показують їхнє бажання поєднати глобальні літературні надбання з властивими національним особливостями в контексті пострадянського суспільного транзиту та глобалізації. У їхніх творах виразно чутно як ставлення до світового культурного насліддя, так і постійну взаємодію з національним контекстом, створюючи унікальний синтез традиції та інновації."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

It operates through four segments: Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, Resources and Utilities, and Transportation.Stock Market Value: 12.88 billion (51.77 a share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTrimble, 1-yearActivist: Jana PartnersPercentage Ownership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. They made their name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy \\"V cubed\\". The three \\"Vs\\" were\\" (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, they have gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three \\"Ss\\" (i) Stock price – buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism – sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees – aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.What's happening:On December 11, 2023, JANA Partners announced that they have taken a position in Trimble Inc and are calling on the Company to cease M&A activities and instead focus on organic growth in its existing businessesBehind the scenes:Trimble started in 1978 as a GPS technology company, primarily for agriculture. In the 2000s it entered the construction industry with its acquisition of Spectra Precision. It continued growing through acquisition and over the past 10 years has spent 5 billion on acquisitions, primarily buying software businesses with the goal of providing an interconnected hardware and software product. In 2012, they acquired the 3D modeling software package SketchUp from Google and continued to expand their Building Information Modeling portfolio with the acquisition of Tekla in 2014. In 2016, Trimble acquired Sefaira, a software for sustainability analysis including energy modeling and daylight visualization. More recently, in 2018, Trimble acquired Viewpoint (a leading provider of construction management software) from Bain Capital for 1.2 billion, and in 2019 launched Trimble MAPS, consolidating several of its previous acquisitions. They now offer hardware and software solutions in under-tech served industries such as construction, transportation, forestry and agriculture.The company's multiple software acquisitions have led to their mix changing in a very positive way. In 2011, 16% of their revenue came from software and services that are by their nature recurring and higher multiple revenue. In 2024, it will be more than half. However, while the business mix has transformed for the better, during this time the stock has significantly underperformed – over the past three years, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 50%.A lot of this underperformance can be tied to their recent history of software M&A activity. They have been buying companies for 30 to 40 times EBITDA and the acquired companies are being valued at Trimble's EBITDA multiple of 14 times EBITDA inside of Trimble. The market understands this and as a result, has reacted negatively to their acquisitions, as recently evidenced by their April 2023 acquisition of Transporeon (a cloud-based transportation management platform) for 30 times EBITDA. After the deal was announced, the company's stock dropped 6.5%. Trimble is not getting credit for their new product mix with a re-rating to a higher software multiple. This does not mean 30 to 40 times EBITDA, but industrial technology peers trade in the mid-teens to mid-20s. If they can get in line with peers, Jana sees a stock upside of over 40%.The first thing Jana would like the company to do is cease M&A activity and focus on the core business. To do this, the board should tie executive compensation to return on invested capital, instead of the current compensation structure which incentivizes revenue growth targets. Second, Jana sees an opportunity for the company to focus on improving operations and profit margins. Over the past eight years of increasing software product mix the company has expanded its gross margins by approximately 800 basis points, yet they have expanded their EBITDA margins by only 500 basis points (1 basis point equals 0.01%). There is an opportunity to better integrate these acquisitions and improve operating margins. Lastly, this is a complicated business structure that could benefit from a simplification. This past September, Trimble announced that it entered a joint venture with AGCO Corporation (AGCO) (a worldwide manufacturer and distributor of agricultural machinery and Precision Ag technology), whereby AGCO will acquire an 85% interest in Trimble's portfolio of Ag assets and technologies for 2.0 billion. This got the opposite market reaction than when Trimble acquires companies, sending Trimble's stock price up 6.5%.While their primary objective here is to have the company stick to the core business and cease their M&A activity, there is another ironic opportunity here, and that is the M&A opportunity created by the company's history of value destroying M&A. Trimble could be an attractive acquisition target for a larger industrial company who also wants a product mix with more software but has the discipline not to pay 30 to 40 times EBITDA for software companies. With a greater than 50% software mix and a much lower EBITDA multiple, Trimble would be an attractive asset for many large industrial companies.Jana often launches activist campaigns with a team of experienced industry executives ready to be board nominees if necessary. While we assume they have connections to such executives, there has been no announcement that they have recruited any, which means to us that it is too early to tell if this will be escalated. However, we will not have to wait that long. The director nomination window opens on February 2, 2024, at which time we will have more clarity on which road this campaign will take.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.

There are a variety of algorithms that could be applied to this problem, such as A* search, iterative deepening depth-first search, or brute force search. I will give you an example of a simplistic approach using depth-first search (DFS) without any optimization techniques in Lisp. Note that the performance of this code is not optimal, and it may take a very long time to find a solution or may not work for complex puzzles given the exponential growth of the search space. Here's the basic Lisp code for solving a 15-puzzle using DFS. This code assumes the blank space is represented by the number 0. \`\`\`lisp (defun find-zero (board) (position 0 board)) (defun move (board dir) (let* ((zero-pos (find-zero board)) (row (/ zero-pos 4)) (col (mod zero-pos 4)) (new-pos (case dir (:up (- zero-pos 4)) (:down (+ zero-pos 4)) (:left (if (> col 0) (- zero-pos 1) nil)) (:right (if (< col 3) (+ zero-pos 1) nil))))) (when new-pos (let ((new-board (copy-seq board))) (rotatef (elt new-board zero-pos) (elt new-board new-pos)) new-board)))) (defun is-goal-state (board) (equal (subseq board 0 15) (number-sequence 1 14))) (defun number-sequence (start end) (loop for i from start to end collect i)) (defun dfs (board path) (when (is-goal-state board) (return-from dfs (list board path))) (dolist (dir '(:up :down :left :right)) (let ((new-board (move board dir))) (when (and new-board (not (member new-board path))) (let ((result (dfs new-board (cons board path)))) (when result (return-from dfs result)))))) nil) (defun solve-15-puzzle (initial-board) (dfs initial-board '())) ;Example usage: (let ((initial-state '(1 2 3 4 5 6 0 8 9 10 7 11 13 14 15 12))) ; assumes the empty space is represented as 0 (solve-15-puzzle initial-state)) \`\`\` The \`solve-15-puzzle\` function is a direct application of the depth-first search to the problem of the 15-puzzle. It takes an initial state of the board and initiates the \`dfs\` function. Below are the helper functions: - \`find-zero\` finds the position of the blank space (0) in the list. - \`move\` takes a direction and moves the blank space if the movement is legal. - \`is-goal-state\` checks if the board is in the goal state. - \`number-sequence\` creates a list of numbers from START to END. - \`dfs\` is the depth-first search algorithm that traverses the search space for the solution. Keep in mind that this is a very naive implementation and there is no guarantee it will find a solution in a reasonable timeframe. Optimization techniques and more advanced search algorithms, such as A*, would be more suitable for solving 15-puzzle games in practice."},{"prompt":"Напиши полный список состояний и заболеваний, сопровождающиеся жаждой","completion":"Жажда может быть симптомом или сопровождать различные состояния и заболевания, включая: 1. Дегидратация - потеря жидкости в организме, вызванная недостатком воды или избытком потери жидкости. Это часто возникает при длительном физическом напряжении, жаркой погоде, рвоте, поносе или недостаточном потреблении воды. 2. Диабет - хроническое заболевание, при котором уровень сахара в крови повышен. Сопровождается чрезмерной жаждой (полидипсией), частым мочеиспусканием и увеличением аппетита. 3. Гиперкальцемия - состояние, при котором в организме слишком высокий уровень кальция в крови. Жажда может быть одним из симптомов этого состояния. 4. Почечная недостаточность - состояние, при котором почки не работают должным образом и не способны эффективно очищать кровь от отходов. Это может приводить к жажде из-за нарушения равновесия жидкости и электролитов в организме. 5. Хроническая боль - длительная или постоянная боль, которая может приводить к избыточной жажде вследствие повышенной потери жидкости. 6. Инсулинопомойки - инъекция слишком большого количества инсулина или применение средств для снижения уровня сахара в крови при диабете. Это может вызвать слишком быстрый спад уровня сахара и привести к симптомам, включая жажду. 7. Гипотермия - снижение температуры тела ниже нормы. Сопровождается жаждой в результате повышенной потери жидкости через дыхательные пути (вследствие вдыхания холодного воздуха) и повышенной мочеобразования. 8. Гипертиреоз - повышенная активность щитовидной железы, что приводит к повышенной температуре тела, усиленному обмену веществ и повышенной потребности в жидкости, вызывающей жажду. Обратите внимание, что полный список состояний и заболеваний, проявляющихся с жаждой, может быть гораздо более обширным.

Однако есть рекомендации, которые помогут вам оценить, какая температура лучше всего подходит для употребления жидкости: 1. Холодная вода: Многие люди предпочитают пить холодную воду, особенно в жаркую погоду или после физической активности, так как она может ощущаться освежающей и охлаждающей. Рекомендуется пить холодную воду в пределах комфортной температуры, не приводящей к дискомфорту или переохлаждению. 2. Теплая вода: Теплая вода может быть полезной для активации желудочных соков и пищеварения. Также она может помочь расслабить мышцы и уменьшить напряжение. Рекомендуется пить теплую воду при комнатной температуре или слегка подогретую до примерно 20-25 градусов Цельсия. 3. Горячие или теплые напитки: Когда речь идет о чаях, кофе или других горячих напитках, их температура может быть выше комнатной. Например, чай или кофе обычно употребляются при температуре около 60-70 градусов Цельсия. Важно отметить, что температура оптимальной для употребления жидкости может быть индивидуальной и зависит от вашего комфорта и предпочтений.

Since line segment TS is represented by the expression 3x + 2 and line segment SV is represented by the expression 4x - 1, and we know that SV = SQ + QV, we can set up an equation to find the value of x. Let's denote the length of SR (which is the same as the length of RQ due to the perpendicular bisector) as y. Then, SQ = 2y. Now, SV = SQ + QV 4x - 1 = 2y + 15 But since SR = RQ, and TR is part of line m, which is a perpendicular bisector, TR must also be equal to VR. Since we are told that QV is 15 units, this means that TR = VR = 15/2 = 7.5 units. So, TQ = TR + RQ = 7.5 + y We know the expression for TS is 3x + 2, which is also the sum of TR and RS (TS = TR + RS). Thus, we have: 3x + 2 = TR + RS 3x + 2 = 7.5 + y Since TR = 7.5 and TR = VR (which is half of QV), VR is also 7.5 units. Therefore: TQ = TR + RQ TQ = 7.5 + 7.5 TQ = 15 units Therefore, without solving for x or y explicitly, we can determine that the length of segment TQ is 15 units."},{"prompt":"Given: Line segment N M is parallel to line segment P O. and Angle 1 is-congruent-to angle 3 Prove: Line segment N M is parallel to line segment N O. 4 lines are connected.

Find the point where this new line intersects the y-axis (where x = 0). Step 1: Calculate the slope of line DF. The slope (m) is given by the formula: [ m = frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)} ] For line DF with points (-1, -3) and (2, 3): [ m = frac{(3 - (-3))}{(2 - (-1))} ] [ m = frac{6}{3} ] [ m = 2 ] Step 2: Use the slope to find the equation of the line passing through G.

If line RS is at the intersection and is indeed perpendicular to both planes, it will be perpendicular to any line in plane X that it intersects at right angles. Now, based on the description, EA and FG are vertical lines in plane X. We don't need to consider Line ER or Line FS since they are part of line RS or they are in plane Y. Since planes X and Y are perpendicular and RS is the intersection line, any line that is perpendicular to RS in plane X will also be perpendicular to the entire plane Y.

You'll need to provide that missing point for a complete answer. In any case, to find the equation of the line parallel to the given line going through (0, -3) and (2, 3), you must first find the slope of the given line because parallel lines have the same slope. Using the coordinates (0, -3) and (2, 3), let's use the slope formula: Slope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) Slope of the given line = (3 - (-3)) / (2 - 0) Slope of the given line = 6 / 2 Slope of the given line = 3 A parallel line would have the same slope, so the slope of the new line is also 3.

Let's calculate the slope: Slope of AB = (-4 - 4) / (0 - (-2)) Slope of AB = (-8) / (2) Slope of AB = -4 The slope of a line perpendicular to line AB will be the negative reciprocal of AB's slope. The negative reciprocal of -4 is 1/4. Let's denote the slope of the perpendicular line as m'. Since AB's slope is -4 (m = -4), we have: m' = -1/m m' = -1/(-4) m' = 1/4 Now we have the slope of the perpendicular line and the point Z (0, 2) through which it passes.

Since lines a and b are parallel, any angle formed between line a and line e will equal the corresponding angle formed between line b and line e, and similarly with lines f. 3. The angles in the question are all right angles because vertical and horizontal lines intersect at right angles. Therefore, the angle at the intersection of lines a and e will be 90 degrees, as will all the other angles formed at the intersections of a, b, e, and f. Now, we are given that the upper right angle at the intersection of lines a and e is (x + 1) degrees and the bottom right angle at the intersection of lines a and f is (x - 3) degrees. Given that these are both right angles (since a and e, and a and f are perpendicular), they are each 90 degrees: x + 1 = 90 x - 3 = 90 However, we only need to solve one of these equations to find the value of x: x + 1 = 90 x = 90 - 1 x = 89 Now that we have the value of x, we can find the corresponding angle on line b that matches the one on line a. Using the corresponding angles theorem, the angle (y degrees) at the intersection of lines b and e, which corresponds to the upper right angle at the intersection of lines a and e, will also be 90 degrees. Since the question specifies that y degrees is the bottom left angle at the intersection of lines b and e, and we know from the corresponding angles theorem that this angle equals the upper right angle at the intersection of lines a and e, we can state that: y degrees = 90 degrees Therefore, the value of y is: y = 90 However, we should recognize that 90 degrees is not among the options given (87, 88, 91, 92). The values of y provided in the options seem to suggest that they might be expecting slight variations from a right angle, possibly due to a misinterpretation of the relationships between the angles. Since the description clearly states horizontal and vertical intersecting lines, the correct angle measure will indeed be 90 degrees, which aligns with the nature of perpendicular lines. In the context of standard geometric conventions where vertical and horizontal lines are by definition perpendicular, y should be 90 degrees.

They are corresponding angles, so angle 3 also measures 130°. They are alternate exterior angles, so angle 3 measures 50°.","completion":"When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, various angle pairs are formed. In this case, we have three parallel lines (a, b, c) cut by a transversal (the pipe cleaner). Angle pairs can be identified as corresponding, alternate interior, alternate exterior, or same-side (consecutive) interior angles. According to your description, on line c, where it intersects with the pipe cleaner, we have a 130° angle. Since lines a, b, and c are parallel, we can use the properties of parallel lines to determine the measure of angle 3 on line a. 1. Corresponding angles are equal in measure. These angles are found in the same relative position at each intersection with the transversal. 2. Alternate interior angles are equal in measure. These angles are inside the parallel lines and on opposite sides of the transversal. 3. Same-side interior angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. These angles are inside the parallel lines and on the same side of the transversal. 4. Alternate exterior angles are equal in measure. These angles are outside the parallel lines and on opposite sides of the transversal. Since angle 9 is given as 130 degrees and angles 9 and 130 degrees are alternate interior angles (they lie inside the two parallel lines and on opposite sides of the transversal), they are equal. Therefore, angle 12 is also 130 degrees because it is the vertical angle of angle 9, and vertical angles are always equal in measure. Angles 3 and 130 degrees are on the same side of the transversal but inside the parallel lines a and c, making them same-side interior angles. By the properties of parallel lines and transversals, same-side interior angles are supplementary: Angle 3 + Angle 130 degrees = 180 degrees Since the 130 degrees angle is already 130 degrees, we find angle 3 by subtracting from 180 degrees: Angle 3 = 180 degrees - 130 degrees Angle 3 = 50 degrees Therefore, the true statement regarding the 130° angle and angle 3 is: They are same-side interior angles, so angle 3 measures 50°."},{"prompt":"The given line segment has a midpoint at (3, 1).

Use the midpoint of the given line segment to find the y-intercept of the perpendicular bisector. 4. Form the equation of the perpendicular bisector in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b). Step 1: Calculate the slope of the given line segment.

The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of -3. Therefore: [ m_{perpendicular} = -frac{1}{-3} ] [ m_{perpendicular} = frac{1}{3} ] Step 3: Use the midpoint (3, 1) to find the y-intercept (b) of the perpendicular bisector. Since the midpoint will lie on the perpendicular bisector, we substitute the slope and the midpoint into the point-slope form (y - y1 = m(x - x1)), and see that y1 = 1, x1 = 3, and m = 1/3. [ y - 1 = frac{1}{3}(x - 3) ] Now solve for y to find b: [ y - 1 = frac{1}{3}x - 1 ] [ y = frac{1}{3}x ] Step 4: Form the equation of the perpendicular bisector in slope-intercept form.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding to a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the smell is coming from the returning woman's pants. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor, and then scolds her for having pooped her pants. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for how dirty pooping her pants is and for how smelly she is right now. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and examining the returning woman at the same time. Then, the present exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, then blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the urge got overbearing. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to do that even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she was compelled to release once getting past her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants. The returning woman blames the present woman's stalling and hindering for forcing the returning woman into such a situation and into making such a decision. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even at the expense of making a dirty mess in her pants for the sake of that relief, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women blocks and holds the returning woman for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments, effectively restraining the returning woman from heading to clean up. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman expresses indignation about the returning woman blaming her for causing the incident after it has already been stated by the present woman that there is no excuse for the returning woman to childishly poop her pants. After that, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman is satisfied about something dirty like pooping her pants by expressing such relief once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposed satisfaction. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman derived much satisfaction from relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman is also childishly satisfied by having her pants full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full because there was a lot in her stomach. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are, she needed relief and the pooping felt relieving due to the overbearing pressure, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman childishly poops her pants with satisfaction, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture. As she is performing the physical gesture, the present woman ridicules the returning woman over how awfully smelly the seat of the childish returning woman's pants is and proceeds to mockingly scold the returning woman for being so smelly in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman admits that she is smelly in her present state, but then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in with the poop in her pants so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because she unbearably stinks. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while reiterating that the returning woman unbearably stinks and imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the returning woman stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is grabbing the bulge in her pants with one hand and holding/plugging her nose with the other. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor that lingers while audibly complaining about how smelly the returning woman is.","completion":"# Title: A Matter of Urgency Genre: British Comedy Drama # Background Our protagonist, Samina, a British Pakistani college student known for her obstinacy and secretiveness regarding her bowel movements, is on her way home from college. She's always been averse to using public bathrooms for her bowel needs, preferring the privacy of her own home. After a lengthy day of lectures and activities, along with a heavy consumption of fiber-rich canteen food, Samina is experiencing a surmounting and urgent need to move her bowels. Unfortunately, due to an unanticipated bus delay and her reluctance to relieve herself in public facilities, she’s been holding it in for longer than she’d like. Her desperation crescendos as she finally reaches her doorstep. # Scene **INT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY** SAMINA, 20s, a British Pakistani college student with a defiant glint in her eyes, power-walks down a suburban street. Well-prepared for the unpredictable British weather, her outfit consists of a comfortable long-sleeve shirt, leggings, and a waterproof jacket. Her curly hair tied back into a functional ponytail bounces rhythmically as she quickens her stride, clenching the strap of her over-stuffed backpack. She reaches the porch of an unassuming two-story house with flower pots adorning the windows. Samina pats her body down in a familiar routine to find her keys but comes up empty. Panic flashes in her eyes. SAMINA frantically knocks on the door, desperate for entry. SAMINA *(anxiously muttering to herself)* Please be home, please be home... No immediate response. Her discomfort escalates, and her movements become jittery. SAMINA starts alternating between pounding the door and clutching her stomach. Suddenly, a voice -- the warm but sharp timbre of her mother, NASREEN, late 40s, emanates from behind the closed door. NASREEN has a comforting presence, with an expressive face framed by soft, graying curls. NASREEN (O.S.) Samina? Is that you? What is wrong? SAMINA *(desperate)* Ami, it’s me! Hurry up, please! NASREEN takes her sweet time, fumbling with the locks. SAMINA’s pleads become more fervent, her composure fraying. Finally, the door creaks open, and NASREEN appears, draped in a floral-patterned kameez, her apron hinting at an interrupted cooking session. Concern etches her face upon seeing her daughter’s distress. NASREEN *(puzzled)* Samina, what's the rush? SAMINA tries to dart past her mother, but NASREEN instinctively reaches out, grasping her daughter's arm. NASREEN Wait, tell me what's wrong! SAMINA struggles in her mother’s grasp, pleading with her eyes. SAMINA Move, Ami! I need to get in—just let me! The two tangle at the doorstep, NASREEN’s maternal worry clashing with SAMINA’s growing panic. But the urgency is too much. SAMINA groans, her face contorting in shock and premature relief as she begins to lose control. NASREEN’s grip falters, confusion overtaking her. NASREEN What's happening, beta? SAMINA, succumbing to the inevitable, retreats slightly, easing into an involuntary squatting position that relieves pressure. She grunts, the exertion etched on her face, as NASREEN watches befuddled. SAMINA *(hushed, strained)* Just... needed... relief... NASREEN, still a model of concern, continues to probe. NASREEN Samina, are you hurt? SAMINA mutters unintelligibly in response, soft grunts punctuating her sentence as the sense of release sweeps over her. The room falls into an awkward silence, punctuated only by SAMINA’s quiet exhalations of relief. Then, NASREEN sniffs the air tentatively. NASREEN *(wrinkling her nose)* What is that smell? SAMINA halts, a sheepish expression replacing the prior euphoria. NASREEN’s suspicion solidifies as she sniffs again, her body recoiling subtly from the odor. NASREEN *(incredulous)* Did you just... SAMINA remains silent, mortified. NASREEN (*(insisting as she reacts to the odor)* Is that coming from your... pants? SAMINA (*(avoiding the subject)* Can I please just go inside? NASREEN steps aside reluctantly, still reacting to the pungent revelation. SAMINA waddles into the house, subtly cupping the seat of her pants, past an astonished NASREEN, who halts her a few steps past the threshold. NASREEN *(warning)* Don’t you dare drop anything! NASREEN scolds SAMINA with a mix of taunt and astonishment, berating how dirty and smelly the situation is while inspecting her daughter with a confluence of reaction and examination. SAMINA *(playfully sulking)* It’s your fault, Ami -- you blocked me! NASREEN *(refusing the excuse)* That's no excuse for a grown woman, Samina. You’re not a child! SAMINA *(insisting with a whimsical tone)* I had to go! The urge was too strong! SAMINA hesitantly appraises her soiled pants, watching NASREEN with an apologetic yet playful grimace. SAMINA *(conceding embarrassingly)* It felt... good to let it go, I guess. NASREEN *(shocked)* You shouldn’t have let it get to pooping your pants! NASREEN physically assesses SAMINA’s pants, sniffing near the seat as SAMINA cringes. NASREEN *(taunting)* It's a good thing you enjoy it because it stinks terribly! SAMINA *(playing along with a grimace)* Since you're keeping me, enjoy the smell! NASREEN *(with mock severity)* You’re unbearably stinky; now go clean up. NASREEN pushes SAMINA along, reacting to the odor, helping contain the pants’ contents with exaggerated gestures. She keeps complaining about the smell, while SAMINA warns of an imminent mess. As they reach the bathroom, SAMINA stops and teases NASREEN with a mischievous grin. SAMINA *(coyly)* Ami, fancy changing my ‘diaper?’ The final straw for NASREEN, she retaliates by squishing the bulge in SAMINA’s pants, pushing her daughter through the doorway. The mess spreads, the stench intensifying. NASREEN *(exasperated)* Get in there now! You’re a stinky mess! SAMINA *(crying out in disgust)* It’s all over now! NASREEN closes the door behind a horrified SAMINA, who is left in the echo of her mother’s chuckling as she holds her nose, still reacting to the lingering odor. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"Write a program in 'C' to emulate a spirogrpah drawing toy. (You can assume the existence of suitable grpahics (like WIn32 or SVGAlib)","completion":"Emulating a Spirograph drawing toy requires generating the mathematical equations for the Spirograph pattern and interacting with a graphics library to render the resulting image. Here's a simple example using pseudo-code and simple graphics functions I'll assume exist in the environment you are using (like Win32 GDI, SDL, or any other graphics library). \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <math.h> // Assume a simple graphics library with the following functions void initGraphics(); // Initializes the graphics system void drawPixel(int x, int y, int color); // Draws a single pixel void updateDisplay(); // Refreshes the display with the drawn pixels void waitForKeyPress(); // Waits for a key press void closeGraphics(); // Closes the graphics system // Define some constants for the Spirograph const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846; const double R = 100.0; // Radius of the fixed circle const double r = 25.0; // Radius of the moving circle const double p = 10.0; // Offset of the pen point in the moving circle // Scale the drawing to fit the screen and center it const double SCALE = 4.0; const int SCREEN_WIDTH = 640; const int SCREEN_HEIGHT = 480; const int offsetX = SCREEN_WIDTH / 2; const int offsetY = SCREEN_HEIGHT / 2; void drawSpirograph() { initGraphics(); double t; // Parametric variable for the angle in radians int x, y; // Coordinates for the pixels to draw double theta; // Angle for the moving circle // Calculate the number of rotations around the fixed circle double rotations = R / gcd(R, r); for (t = 0.0; t < rotations * 2.0 * PI; t += 0.01) { theta = (R-r)/r * t; // Parametric equations for the Spirograph curve x = (int)(SCALE * ((R-r)*cos(t) + p*cos(theta))) + offsetX; y = (int)(SCALE * ((R-r)*sin(t) - p*sin(theta))) + offsetY; drawPixel(x, y, 1); // Assume color '1' is the pen color } updateDisplay(); waitForKeyPress(); closeGraphics(); } // Euclidean algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) double gcd(double a, double b) { while (b != 0) { double temp = b; b = fmod(a, b); a = temp; } return a; } int main() { drawSpirograph(); return 0; } \`\`\` Keep in mind that in real C code, you would need to link against a specific graphics library and use its actual drawing functions. The above code is just a sketch to illustrate the logic. Furthermore, actual implementations might require double-buffering to prevent flickering, handling different types of input for interactivity, and smoothing of the curve with anti-aliasing techniques. To integrate this into an actual environment like Win32, SDL, or using a library like SVGAlib, you would need to write proper initialization, teardown code for the graphics context, as well as handle the platform-specific API for drawing pixels. Remember, actual deployment of such a Spirograph drawing program will require initializing a window or a drawing canvas, and translating the drawing commands into the respective library's graphing functions. The initialization, updateDisplay, and drawPixel functions are placeholders and need to be implemented accordingly for the chosen graphics library."},{"prompt":"How might it be done with some framework like GKS ?","completion":"The Graphical Kernel System (GKS) is an ISO standard for low-level 2D computer graphics, developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It provides a set of functions for drawing graphics primitives like lines, polygons, and markers. To create a Spirograph using GKS, we can use these primitives to plot the points of the Spirograph pattern. Below is an example of how you might implement a Spirograph using GKS, keeping in mind that this is a high-level example: \`\`\`c #include <gks.h> #include <math.h> // Some definitions for clarity #define TWO_PI (2.0 * M_PI) #define WORKSTATION_ID 1 void drawSpirographGKS(double R, double r, double p) { Gint ws_id = WORKSTATION_ID; // Workstation identifier // Variables to store GKS parameters: Gfloat x, y; Gpoint point; // Open GKS, open and activate a workstation. gopengks(stdout, 0); gopenws(ws_id, NULL, \\"MI\\"); // Open memory based workstation gactivatews(ws_id); // Set the workstation transformation to map the drawing area Glimit w; w.xmin = 0.0; w.xmax = 1.0; w.ymin = 0.0; w.ymax = 1.0; gsetwswindow(ws_id, &w); // Drawing area in normalized coordinates Gfloat window_width = 0.8; Gfloat window_height = 0.8; Glimit v; v.xmin = 0.1; v.xmax = v.xmin + window_width; v.ymin = 0.1; v.ymax = v.ymin + window_height; gsetviewport(ws_id, &v); // Set polyline attributes if needed Glnattr lnattr; lnattr.type = GLN_SOLID; lnattr.width = 1.0; lnattr.color = 1; // Usually color index in GKS's color table gsetlineattr(ws_id, &lnattr); // Calculate the number of rotations around the fixed circle double total_angle = R / gcd(R, r) * TWO_PI; // Start drawing the Spirograph pattern for (double t = 0.0; t < total_angle; t += 0.001) { double theta = (R - r) / r * t; x = (R - r) * cos(t) + p * cos(theta); y = (R - r) * sin(t) - p * sin(theta); // Transform the coordinates to normalized device coordinates (NDC) point.x = 0.5 + x / (4 * R); point.y = 0.5 + y / (4 * R); if (t == 0.0) gmoveto(&point); // Move to the starting position else gdrawto(&point, GPERFORM); } // Update the display gupdatews(ws_id, GPERFORM); // Wait for user interaction (this step is platform-specific and might require additional implementation) // Close GKS gdeactivatews(ws_id); gclosews(ws_id); gclosegks(); } double gcd(double a, double b) { while (b != 0) { double temp = b; b = fmod(a, b); a = temp; } return a; } int main() { // Spirograph parameters: R, r, and p double R = 100.0; double r = 25.0; double p = 5.0; drawSpirographGKS(R, r, p); return 0; } \`\`\` In this example: - \`gopengks\` initializes the GKS system. - \`gopenws\` opens a workstation, and \`gactivatews\` activates it. - \`gsetwswindow\` sets the coordinate limits for the workstation window. - \`gsetviewport\` sets the viewport, a rectangle on the display surface into which the workstation window is mapped. - \`gsetlineattr\` allows you to customize the line appearance. - The loop calculates the Spirograph points and uses \`gmoveto\` and \`gdrawto\` to move to a starting position and draw lines between points. - \`gupdatews\` is used to ensure the drawing gets updated on the screen. - Finally, GKS is closed with \`gdeactivatews\`, \`gclosews\`, and \`gclosegks\`.
