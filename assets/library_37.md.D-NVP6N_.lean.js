The sizzling sound of the arid winds mixing with the soft tunes coming from a jukebox inside set a nostalgic atmosphere. EXT. DESERT DINER PARKING LOT - DAY CUT TO a dusty yellow-black Ford Falcon. Its paint, a testament to the countless stories spun across the desert highways. The driver's door creaks open, and a young man with tousled black hair and piercing brown eyes steps out into the blistering heat. His rugged look complemented by his short-sleeve black shirt hugging his toned torso, a pair of well-worn jeans, and his favorite driving gloves gripping the door's edge. This is KAITO, a man with a smooth, risk-taking edge to him, a mix of seduction and rebellion wrapped in a veil of desert dust. KAITO (slinging a six-pack of Dr. Pepper into the backseat) Stay frosty, my friends. With a cavalier flip of his hair, he struts towards the Falcon's driver side. His well-defined arm, dusted with a layer of the desert itself, reflects his untamed spirit. He opens the door and slides in with the finesse of one who's shared countless sunsets with his loyal, mechanical steed. INT. FORD FALCON - CONTINUOUS Kaito inserts the key, a wry smile dancing upon his lips. The engine ROARS to life, a symphony of horsepower that speaks directly to his soul. KAITO (to himself, playful yet determined) Time to eat some miles, beauty. He pulls a crumpled pack of cigarettes from his jeans pocket, taps one out but then hesitates, contemplating the bright sky and unfiltered air. With a resigned shrug, he sets it down on the dash unlit. The Falcon backs out, leaving a cloud of dust in its wake as it merges onto the open road. EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY The Falcon tears down the endless highway, a lone yellow glint against the desolation of terra-cotta landscapes. Inside, Kaito taps his fingers to the rhythm of his heart, lost in the hum of rubber on tarmac and the crisp crackle of a chip bag. Iridescent heat waves warp the scene ahead, and a POLICE CHECKPOINT manifests from the shimmering horizon. Kaito slows his trusty steed, easing up to the barricade. A stern OFFICER approaches, hand resting on his belt, eyes skeptical behind mirrored sunglasses. OFFICER License and registration. Kaito complies, his confident grin never faltering. OFFICER (CONT'D) (gesturing to the breathalyzer) Been drinkin' today, son? KAITO (chuckles, a sparkle in his gaze) Just high on life, officer. And maybe a little caffeine. Skeptical yet routine, the officer hands over the breathalyzer. Kaito takes it, and with an almost theatrical puff of breath, he seals his fate with the machine. The device beeps; he passes with flying colors. OFFICER (returning the documents, nodding) All's clear. Keep it steady out there. Kaito salutes playfully and slides back into the Falcon's embrace. The engine again growls its indomitable growl, as man and machine are set free once more onto the relentless asphalt sea. EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS The Ford Falcon zooms past the checkpoint, leaving nothing but a fleeting melodious roar that harmonizes momentarily with the desert's silent symphony.

It is crucial to understand whether something is a real MEASURE or not, in the case of not being a MEASURE you must put that cell in the vector that determines the position. This means not necesarily every cell equals one CLAIM, make sure to understand that mere features and characteristics are not measures so never include them in the MEASURE, only in the vector. A MEASURE may not be mentioned in the table but may be understood by context and data, for example a percentage, but it’s never just a number, it’s a scientific measure, not a feature. Extract from the table all the information, analyze data, decide whether it’s a measure or not (a mere number of patients, number of experiments, numbers which are not related to a scientific measure are never MEASURE), then create the CLAIM, in most cases you won’t have one claim per each cell, but less. Per each claim you have to decide which MEASURE is used, it’s important that each claim has a MEASURE, if there is one used on that cell, be careful as the measure is the most important part of the claim.

Let's first find the complementary solution (solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation ( x'' + x = 0 )). The characteristic equation is: [ r^2 + 1 = 0 ] Which gives us complex roots: [ r = pm i ] The general solution to the homogeneous equation is then: [ x_c(t) = Acos(t) + Bsin(t) ] where A and B are constants to be determined by initial conditions. Next, we have to find a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation. Since the forcing function is ( 2sin(t) ), and this forcing function is already part of the homogeneous solution, we have to multiply it by ( t ) to seek a form for the particular solution, which will avoid duplication with the homogeneous solution. Let's assume a particular solution of the form: [ x_p(t) = t(Ccos(t) + Dsin(t)) ] where C and D are constants to be determined. Now, let's find the first and second derivatives of ( x_p(t) ): [ x_p'(t) = Ccos(t) - Ctsin(t) + Dsin(t) + Dtcos(t) ] [ x_p''(t) = -2Csin(t) - Ctcos(t) +2Dcos(t) - Dtsin(t) ] Substitute ( x_p(t) ) and ( x_p''(t) ) into the ODE ( x'' + x = 2sin(t) ) to find C and D: [ x_p'' + x_p = (-2Csin(t) - Ctcos(t) +2Dcos(t) - Dtsin(t)) + (t(Ccos(t) + Dsin(t))) ] [ = 2Dcos(t) - 2Csin(t) ] For the right-hand side of the equation to match the forcing function 2sin(t), we should set: [ 2D = 0 ] [ -2C = 2 ] So, we have D = 0 and C = -1. Substituting C and D into our particular solution, we get: [ x_p(t) = -tsin(t) ] Now, our total solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions: [ x(t) = x_c(t) + x_p(t) ] [ x(t) = Acos(t) + Bsin(t) - tsin(t) ] Given the initial conditions x(0) = x'(0) = 0, we can find A and B: When t = 0, ( x(0) = Acos(0) + Bsin(0) - 0sin(0) ) ( x(0) = A = 0 ) due to the initial condition x(0) = 0. Now let's find x'(t) and apply the second initial condition: [ x'(t) = -Asin(t) + Bcos(t) + -sin(t) - tcos(t) ] Using ( A = 0 ) and ( x'(0) = 0 ), we get: [ x'(0) = Bcos(0) - sin(0) - 0cos(0) ] [ 0 = B - 0 ] [ B = 0 ] So A = 0 and B = 0.

When deciding on a form for the particular solution using the method of undetermined coefficients, one must make sure that the chosen form does not duplicate any term in the complementary solution. Since the non-homogenous part of the differential equation is (2sin(t)), we look for a particular solution in a similar trigonometric form. Given that the complementary solution already contains (cos(t)) and (sin(t)), in order to find the particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation, we normally look for a solution that's in the same family as the forcing function but doesn't conflict with the complementary solution. For the differential equation with a forcing function (gamma sin(omega t)) or (gamma cos(omega t)) (where (gamma) and (omega) are constants), and our (omega) is 1 (the same as the frequency of the homogeneous solution), we would often look for a particular solution of the form: [ x_p(t) = t(Asin(t) + Bcos(t)) ] However, assuming that the coefficient of (sin(t)) and (cos(t)) will remain unchanged is incorrect because the second derivative of the particular solution also includes terms that will affect both (sin(t)) and (cos(t)). To avoid the duplication, we actually need to apply a linear coefficient of (t) to the trigonometric functions to form the particular solution: Since the corresponding homogeneous solution includes both (sin(t)) and (cos(t)), and the external force has a frequency that matches the natural frequency of the system (1 rad/s), this will lead to resonance, which necessitates a particular solution of the form with an extra factor of t to account for the resonance: [ x_p(t) = t^2(Asin(t) + Bcos(t)) ] By differentiating ( x_p(t) ) twice, we will get terms that combine ( t^2, t ), and a constant term with both (sin(t)) and (cos(t)), which can match the form ( 2sin(t) ) after adjusting the coefficients. Let's try it out: [ x_p(t) = t^2(Asin(t) + Bcos(t)) ] [ x_p'(t) = 2t(Asin(t) + Bcos(t)) + t^2(Acos(t) - Bsin(t)) ] [ x_p''(t) = 2(Asin(t) + Bcos(t)) + 2t(Acos(t) - Bsin(t)) + 2t(Acos(t) - Bsin(t)) + t^2(-Asin(t) - Bcos(t)) ] [ x_p''(t) = 4t(Acos(t) - Bsin(t)) + (2A - t^2A)sin(t) + (2B - t^2B)cos(t) ] Substitute ( x_p(t) ) and ( x_p''(t) ) into the ODE ( x'' + x = 2sin(t) ) and find A and B such that the equation is satisfied: [ x_p'' + x_p = 4t(Acos(t) - Bsin(t)) + (2A - t^2A)sin(t) + (2B - t^2B)cos(t) + t^2(Asin(t) + Bcos(t)) ] [ (2A - A)sin(t) + (2B - B)cos(t) = 2sin(t) ] To satisfy ( 2sin(t) ), we set the coefficients in front of ( sin(t) ) and ( cos(t) ) equal to 2 and 0, respectively: [ A = -2 ] [ B = 0 ] Substituting A and B into our particular solution gives us: [ x_p(t) = -2t^2sin(t) ] Now, let's revisit the total solution, which is the sum of the complementary and particular solutions: [ x(t) = x_c(t) + x_p(t) ] [ x(t) = C_1cos(t) + C_2sin(t) - 2t^2sin(t) ] where ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) are constants that we would determine using the initial conditions ( x(0) = x'(0) = 0 ). However, since the complementary solution is already included in the initial conditions (both ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) would be zero), the total solution is only the particular solution: [ x(t) = -2t^2sin(t) ] I apologize for my earlier mistake in providing an incorrect form for the particular solution.

The characteristic equation for this is ( r^2 + 1 = 0 ), which has solutions ( r = pm i ), corresponding to the complementary solution: [ x_c(t) = Acos(t) + Bsin(t) ] We have yet to use the initial conditions to find the constants A and B. Next, we look for the particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation. Since the forcing term is ( 2sin(t) ) and this is already part of the complementary solution, we look for a particular solution using undetermined coefficients that include terms not present in the complementary solution. A standard approach is to use a particular solution of the form: [ x_p(t) = Atcos(t) + Btsin(t) ] Now, let’s differentiate this assumed particular solution: [ x_p'(t) = Acos(t) - Atsin(t) + Bsin(t) + Btcos(t) ] [ x_p''(t) = -2Asin(t) - Atcos(t) + 2Bcos(t) - Btsin(t) ] Substituting ( x_p(t) ) and ( x_p''(t) ) into the original differential equation, we get: [ x'' + x = (-2Asin(t) - Atcos(t) + 2Bcos(t) - Btsin(t)) + (Atcos(t) + Btsin(t)) ] [ 2Bcos(t) - 2Asin(t) = 2sin(t) ] Comparing coefficients, we need to have ( -2A = 2 ) and ( 2B = 0 ), which gives us ( A = -1 ) and ( B = 0 ). So the particular solution is: [ x_p(t) = -tcos(t) ] Adding this to the complementary solution, we get the full solution: [ x(t) = x_c(t) + x_p(t) ] [ x(t) = Acos(t) + Bsin(t) - tcos(t) ] To find the constants A and B, we apply the initial conditions ( x(0) = x'(0) = 0 ): At ( t = 0 ), ( x(0) = Acos(0) - 0 = A = 0 ) due to the initial condition ( x(0) = 0 ).

We must account for the entire nonhomogeneous term on the right-hand side of the differential equation, which is (18x + 4e^{-2x}). The reason I separated the discussion into two parts, one for (18x) and another for (4e^{-2x}), is because this is a standard approach in the method of undetermined coefficients: to treat each distinct term of the nonhomogenous function separately and then sum their respective particular solutions to find the complete particular solution. For the (18x) term: We notice that the right-hand side of the differential equation includes a polynomial of the first degree ((18x)). The method of undetermined coefficients suggests that we choose a particular solution guess with the same type, which is a polynomial. However, since the derivative of an (x)-term is a constant and the second derivative is zero, we must choose the guess with a higher-degree polynomial to ensure that the derivatives include a term linear in (x). Therefore, we choose a quadratic polynomial ( Ax^2 + Bx + C ) to ensure the derivatives will produce a constant and a linear term. For the (4e^{-2x}) term: We address it separately because it is an exponential term distinct from the polynomial term. The method of undetermined coefficients instructs us to guess a particular solution with the same exponential form ( De^{-2x} ). This form of the solution doesn't interfere with the complementary solution and allows us to satisfy the (4e^{-2x}) part of the nonhomogeneous equation. We find particular solutions for these individual terms separately because each one represents a different \\"kind\\" of forcing function that is being applied to the system. Once the particular solutions for each term are found, they are summed to account for the full forcing function (18x + 4e^{-2x}). Thus, we are taking account of the entire nonhomogeneous term when finding the particular solution. After finding the particular solutions (y_{p1}(x)) for (18x) and (y_{p2}(x)) for (4e^{-2x}), we combine them: [ y_p(x) = y_{p1}(x) + y_{p2}(x) ] [ y_p(x) = (3x^2 - 2x) + (-2e^{-2x}) ] [ y_p(x) = 3x^2 - 2x - 2e^{-2x} ] Then the general solution for the differential equation ( y'' + 3y' = 18x + 4e^{-2x} ) is: [ y(x) = y_c(x) + y_p(x) ] [ y(x) = (A + Be^{-3x}) + (3x^2 - 2x - 2e^{-2x}) ] [ y(x) = A + Be^{-3x} + 3x^2 - 2x - 2e^{-2x} ] This encompasses the full response to both the polynomial and exponential parts of the forcing function."},{"prompt":"Use undetermined coefficients to find the general form for solution to y'' - 3y' + 2y = 6e^3x + 12e^-x","completion":"To find the general solution to the differential equation ( y'' - 3y' + 2y = 6e^{3x} + 12e^{-x} ) using the method of undetermined coefficients, we need to find the complementary (homogeneous) solution and a particular (nonhomogeneous) solution. **Step 1: Complementary Solution** The complementary solution comes from solving the homogeneous part of the differential equation, which is: [ y_c'' - 3y_c' + 2y_c = 0 ] We start by finding the characteristic equation, which is: [ r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0 ] This quadratic factors as: [ (r - 1)(r - 2) = 0 ] Providing the distinct real roots ( r = 1 ) and ( r = 2 ), so the complementary solution is: [ y_c(x) = C_1e^x + C_2e^{2x} ] where ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) are arbitrary constants determined by initial conditions. **Step 2: Particular Solution** For the particular solution ( y_p ), we take terms from the nonhomogeneous part of the equation. The nonhomogeneous part has two exponential terms: ( 6e^{3x} ) and ( 12e^{-x} ). We assume the form of the particular solution for ( 6e^{3x} ) as: [ y_{p1}(x) = Ae^{3x} ] where ( A ) is a coefficient we wish to determine. However, for the ( 12e^{-x} ) term, since ( e^{-x} ) is not a solution to the homogeneous equation, we can assume the form: [ y_{p2}(x) = Be^{-x} ] where ( B ) is another coefficient to find. So the full particular solution that we propose is: [ y_p(x) = y_{p1}(x) + y_{p2}(x) ] [ y_p(x) = Ae^{3x} + Be^{-x} ] **Step 3: Using Undetermined Coefficients** To find ( A ) and ( B ), we'll differentiate ( y_p(x) ), plug it into the differential equation, and equate coefficients. First, find the first and second derivatives of ( y_p(x) ): [ y_p'(x) = 3Ae^{3x} - Be^{-x} ] [ y_p''(x) = 9Ae^{3x} + Be^{-x} ] Now, substitute ( y_p(x) ), ( y_p'(x) ), and ( y_p''(x) ) into the nonhomogeneous differential equation: [ (9Ae^{3x} + Be^{-x}) - 3(3Ae^{3x} - Be^{-x}) + 2(Ae^{3x} + Be^{-x}) = 6e^{3x} + 12e^{-x} ] Simplify the left side: [ (9Ae^{3x} + Be^{-x}) - (9Ae^{3x} - 3Be^{-x}) + (2Ae^{3x} + 2Be^{-x}) ] [ = 9Ae^{3x} + Be^{-x} - 9Ae^{3x} + 3Be^{-x} + 2Ae^{3x} + 2Be^{-x} ] [ = 2Ae^{3x} + 6Be^{-x} ] Now, we equate coefficients from both sides of the equation for ( e^{3x} ) and ( e^{-x} ): [ 2A = 6 , rightarrow , A = 3 ] [ 6B = 12 , rightarrow , B = 2 ] **Step 4: General Solution** Now we have the particular solution ( y_p(x) ) and ( y_c(x) ): [ y_p(x) = 3e^{3x} + 2e^{-x} ] [ y_c(x) = C_1e^x + C_2e^{2x} ] Adding them together gives the general solution to the ODE: [ y(x) = y_c(x) + y_p(x) ] [ y(x) = C_1e^x + C_2e^{2x} + 3e^{3x} + 2e^{-x} ]"},{"prompt":"use variation of parameters to find the general form for solutions to y'' - 3y' + 2y = 6e^3x + 12e^-x","completion":"To solve the nonhomogeneous linear second-order differential equation ( y'' - 3y' + 2y = 6e^{3x} + 12e^{-x} ) using the method of variation of parameters, we first need to find the complementary (homogeneous) solution, ( y_c ), and then determine the coefficients of the (particular) solution by varying the parameters. **Step 1: Complementary Solution** The homogeneous version of the given ode is: [ y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0 ] The characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is: [ r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0 ] This can be factored into: [ (r - 1)(r - 2) = 0 ] Hence, we find two distinct roots, ( r_1 = 1 ) and ( r_2 = 2 ). The complementary solution to the homogeneous equation is then: [ y_c(x) = C_1e^x + C_2e^{2x} ] where ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) are constants. **Step 2: Particular Solution via Variation of Parameters** Next, for the particular solution, we use the method of variation of parameters. This method assumes a particular solution in the form of: [ y_p(x) = u_1(x)e^x + u_2(x)e^{2x} ] where ( u_1(x) ) and ( u_2(x) ) are functions to be determined. To find ( u_1(x) ) and ( u_2(x) ), we first differentiate them with respect to ( x ): [ y_p'(x) = u_1'(x)e^x + u_1(x)e^x + u_2'(x)e^{2x} + 2u_2(x)e^{2x} ] [ y_p''(x) = u_1''(x)e^x + 2u_1'(x)e^x + u_1'(x)e^x + u_1(x)e^x + u_2''(x)e^{2x} + 4u_2'(x)e^{2x} + 2u_2'(x)e^{2x} + 2u_2(x)e^{2x} ] To simplify calculations, we impose the condition that ( u_1''(x) = 0 ) and ( u_2''(x) = 0 ), which gives us a system of equations when we substitute ( y_p(x) ), ( y_p'(x) ), and ( y_p''(x) ) into the original ODE. This results in the following system: 1. ( u_1'(x)e^x + u_2'(x)e^{2x} = 0 ) 2. ( u_1'(x)e^x + 2u_2'(x)e^{2x} = 6e^{3x} + 12e^{-x} ) Now we have two equations, and we use the second equation to solve for ( u_1'(x) ) and ( u_2'(x) ) such that the right side of the differential equation is matched: [ 2u_2'(x)e^{2x} = 6e^{3x} ] [ u_1'(x)e^x = 12e^{-x} ] Solving for ( u_1'(x) ) and ( u_2'(x) ): [ u_1'(x) = 12e^{-2x} ] [ u_2'(x) = 3e^{x} ] Now, we integrate to find (u_1(x)) and (u_2(x)): [ u_1(x) = int 12e^{-2x}dx = -6e^{-2x} + C_3 ] (where ( C_3 ) is a constant of integration) [ u_2(x) = int 3e^{x}dx = 3e^{x} + C_4 ] (where ( C_4 ) is another constant of integration) **Step 3: Complete Solution** Substitute ( u_1(x) ) and ( u_2(x) ) into ( y_p(x) ): [ y_p(x) = u_1(x)e^x + u_2(x)e^{2x} ] [ y_p(x) = (-6e^{-2x} + C_3)e^x + (3e^{x} + C_4)e^{2x} ] [ y_p(x) = -6e^{-x} + C_3e^x + 3e^{3x} + C_4e^{2x} ] Since we are looking for the general form, we can see that the (C_4e^{2x}) term is already included in the complementary solution and (C_3e^x) will be absorbed by the constants (C_1) and (C_2). Hence, the particular solution is: [ y_p(x) = -6e^{-x} + 3e^{3x} ] Finally, the general solution to the original differential equation is the sum of the complementary and the particular solutions: [ y(x) = y_c(x) + y_p(x) ] [ y(x) = C_1e^x + C_2e^{2x} - 6e^{-x} + 3e^{3x} ] Here, (C_1) and (C_2) in the general solution will absorb the (C_3) and (C_4) from the particular solution, as they represent the same exponential terms.

Since (y_p) is already given, we can use it to extract some information about the differential equation. Specifically, we can use the fact that (y_p) is a particular solution to determine the values of (A) and (B). However, it's also important to remember that this particular solution suggests something specific about the non-homogeneity: it's composed of terms involving an (x) polynomial multiplied by an exponential function, (e^{2x}). The degree of the polynomial part of the particular solution often correlates with the non-homogeneous term on the right side, which is (150xe^{2x}) in this case. Notice that: 1. The cubic polynomial term in (y_p) ((5x^3)) corresponds to having to differentiate three times to eliminate all (x) terms and just leave a constant multiplied by (e^{2x}), which, when plugged into the ODE, results in the (e^{2x}) term of the non-homogeneity. 2. The term (-3x^2) also corresponds to additional (x) terms that, when differentiated, will eventually contribute to constant coefficient terms for (y', y'', y^{(3)}). From the form of (y_p), we can say that the cubic term likely stems from the (150xe^{2x}) forcing function, which when differentiated three times, would give a constant times (e^{2x}). This forces us to conclude that the particular solution has matched the right-hand side of the differential equation, which includes the (e^{2x}) non-homogeneity. The form of the complementary solution, (y_c), for a third-order linear homogeneous differential equation will involve three terms corresponding to the roots of the characteristic equation. Without the values of (A) and (B), we cannot completely specify (y_c). However, we can write it in the general form assuming the characteristic equation has three roots (r_1), (r_2), and (r_3): [ y_c(x) = C_1e^{r_1x} + C_2e^{r_2x} + C_3e^{r_3x} ] where (C_1), (C_2), and (C_3) are constants determined by initial conditions or boundary conditions given for the problem. The general solution to the differential equation is then the sum of the complementary and particular solution: [ y(x) = y_c(x) + y_p(x) ] [ y(x) = C_1e^{r_1x} + C_2e^{r_2x} + C_3e^{r_3x} + (5x^3 - 3x^2)e^{2x} ] To determine the characteristic roots and thus the full general solution, including the complementary part (y_c(x)), one typically needs the specific values for (A) and (B).

This would be derived from a characteristic equation similar to ( (r - 2)^3(r + 3) = 0 ) or its equivalent expanded form. Given that a particular solution is ( y_p = (5x^3 - 3x^2)e^{2x} ) for the differential equation ( y''' + Ay'' + By' + 12y = 150xe^{2x} ), and assuming this is already factored into the coefficients (A) and (B), your general solution is based on the supposition that the roots of the characteristic polynomial are precisely those that will result in the complementary solution you've provided. Assuming that the complementary solution ( y_c(x) ) involves the root ( -3 ) and that a root ( 2 ) has a higher multiplicity, we could write the characteristic equation as having roots at ( 2 ) and ( -3 ). However, you’ve only included a single exponential term for ( e^{-3x} ), which should be matched by an equivalent term in the complementary function only if (-3) is a simple root of the characteristic equation. If the above interpretation is correct, then the ( Cx ) term in your particular solution would suggest that there is also a factor of ( (r-2)^2 ) in the characteristic equation to compensate for the polynomial term ( x ) that appears being multiplied by ( e^{2x} ). But if that were the case, we would also expect ( (r-2)^2 ) to appear as part of the complementary solution with coefficients for ( e^{2x} ) and ( xe^{2x} ) terms. Each term in the complementary solution corresponds to different roots of the characteristic equation, or the same root with different multiplicities. For a root of multiplicity ( k ), we would have terms like ( e^{rx}, xe^{rx}, x^2e^{rx}, ldots, x^{k-1}e^{rx} ) in the complementary solution. Without knowing the constants ( A ) and ( B ), we cannot definitively say what the characteristic roots are, and so we can't be sure of the complementary solution. To be clear, the general form of the solution for a third-order differential equation would also involve another constant of integration from the complementary solution if we have distinct roots. It would typically look something like this: [ y(x) = C_1e^{r_1x} + C_2e^{r_2x} + C_3e^{r_3x} + y_p(x) ] where ( y_p(x) ) is the particular solution, ( (5x^3 - 3x^2)e^{2x} ), and ( C_1, C_2, C_3 ) and ( r_1, r_2, r_3 ) would be determined by the characteristic equation of the homogeneous part. However, based on the form you've given ( y = (5x^3 - 3x^2 + Cx + D)e^{2x} + Ee^{-3x} ), it seems you are assuming specific things about the coefficients ( A ) and ( B ) that are determining the characteristic polynomial and thus the solution to the homogeneous equation.

Сбор образцов: - Используйте портативные датчики для измерения концентрации газа и других параметров воздуха в зоне падения. - Для сбора газа можно использовать газовый анализатор или газовую хроматографию с последующим разделением и анализом компонентов. - Возможно использование герметичных контейнеров или мешков, изготовленных из материалов, которые не реагируют с неизвестным газом, для его изоляции и безопасной транспортировки. 3. Анализ газа: - Отправьте собранные образцы в лабораторию для тщательного химического и молекулярного анализа. - Оцените его свойства, потенциальные риски и лечебные эффекты с помощью биоэссеев или в экспериментах на животных. 4. Разработка технологий: - После идентификации и анализа газа можно разработать технологии для его безопасного хранения, использования и утилизации. 5. Мониторинг окружающей среды: - Регулярно проводите мониторинг для выявления долгосрочных последствий воздействия газа на экосистему и здоровье человека. 6. Регулирование использования: - Если обнаружится, что газ имеет лечебные свойства, разработайте стандарты для его безопасного использования в медицинских целях.

Redrum on my mind, it's a hypnotic tune, Mirror on the wall spelling out impending doom. (Chorus) Redrum, redrum, echoes in the room, Whisper in the silence, foretelling the gloom. Redrum, redrum, chilling to the bone, The walls are talkin', in a sinister tone. (Verse 2) Got my mind twisted, in a macabre dance, In the heart of the night, it's a morbid trance. Listen to the rhythm of a heartbeat's drum, Words in reverse, it's that redrum hum. (Chorus) Redrum, redrum, it's a killer's croon, Dark mantra ringing, under the blood moon. Redrum, redrum, it's a deadly spell, A story of madness, that the shadows tell. (Bridge) In the labyrinth mind where the thoughts get lost, Payin' the price, no matter the cost. It's a maze of terror, it's a psychic burn, Flip the script, and watch the world turn. (Verse 3) Got the adrenaline, pumpin' like adrenaline, Escape from the scene, but the walls keep whispering. Can't shake the feeling, there's a price on my head, Redrum's the word, and it's painted in red. (Chorus) Redrum, redrum, in a cold sweat dream, A nightmarish refrain, makes the sane man scream. Redrum, redrum, where the spirits roam, In this hotel of horrors, they never find home. (Outro) So watch your back, keep the lights on tight, 'Cause redrum's lurking in the shadows of night. It's more than a word, it's a fate, it's a sign, In the world of the haunted, the end of the line.

Describe how he looks as he farts in the water while washing himself, visibly relieved. Some fish that died from the stench bob to the surface alongside the bubbles. He grabs one to take with him for dinner. After climbing out of the pond he makes a campfire and roasts the fish over it","completion":"Once upon a sunny afternoon, the illustrious Dane DeHaan, decided the burdens of fame demanded an escape. In search of serenity, he ventured into the heart of nature, where the trees whispered secrets, and the wind hugged you just as tightly as a legion of besotted fans. Amidst this sylvan sanctuary lay a secluded pond, a liquid gem winking at the sun, inviting Dane to partake in its tranquil bounty. The air hummed with the sounds of the forest, as Dane DeHaan disrobed with the grace of a rom-com lead realizing they've been in love with the protagonist the whole time. His slender physique, a testament to a Hollywood regimen, was a Michelangelo sculpture come to life - if Michelangelo appreciated skinny jeans and indie films. With a ceremonious stretch, Dane's alabaster skin greeted the sun, and as he stepped into the pond, water lilies bowed their respects. Stepping in further, he couldn't help but appreciate the shocking chill against his skin. His buttocks, previously hiding from the spotlight, now shone with a firmness and form that would give the peach emoji a run for its money. His hair, usually a brooding dark wave, was now a mess of wet tendrils clinging to his forehead and nape—each droplet of water on his hair a diamond in a raven's feathers. Ensconced in the liquid embrace of his watery haven, Dane began to wash away the veneer of celebrity, revealing the man beneath—the man who could, and would, break wind in aquatic solitude. A smirk played across his lips as he embraced a very human moment of relief, the pressure in his gut dissipating into the depths below. Tiny ripples danced away from Dane's nether regions as a mute chorus of bubbles emerged. Their ascent to freedom was lackadaisical – a whimsical carbonated ballet. However, the bubbles were not alone. Unbeknownst to our bathing protagonist, the expulsion carried a potency that was, to put it mildly, lethal to the local marine life. As the effervescent spheres reached the surface, they were followed by the occasional belly-up fish, their last swim enacted with a float to the top. The stench wasn't something Dane could detect over the aromatic haven of pine and pond. But the evidence was hard to ignore. With a gleam of resourcefulness in his eyes and no need to fish, Dane fished out one of the ill-fated creatures, remarking, \\"Dinner is served.\\" Refreshed and with eco-provision in tow, Dane emerged from the aquatic idyll as the sun began its descent into the evening symphony of color. His steps squished the sodden earth with a rhythm as he walked towards a chosen campfire spot. There, with the deft skills of a seasoned outdoorsman—or perhaps just a guy who's watched a lot of survival shows—he kindled a fire. The flames crackled and danced, mirroring the twinkle in Dane's eye. Bearing the fruits of the pond's unexpected harvest, Dane skewered the fish with a stick he had found on the ground and held it over the spirited flames. The scent of roasting fish soon overpowered any memory of the toxic escapade. That evening, under the star-dappled sky, he feasted on his amphibious trophy, mentally penning the tale of the day Dane DeHaan cooked his catch of the fish, courtesy of an au naturel adventure and a rather remarkable toot."},{"prompt":"A continuación te dare un contexto un rol una tarea y formato de respuesta.

We will craft a message aimed at inspiring young men to contribute to the war effort, but we want to stray from messages that convey hate like \\"All Germans are bad.\\" Instead, our message will focus on unity and duty. **Concept for a Political Cartoon:** Title: \\"Britain's Call to Unity\\" The cartoon depicts Britannia, the female personification of Great Britain, standing tall and resolute atop a cliff that represents the white cliffs of Dover. She holds the Union Jack flag, which billows in the wind as she looks out onto the turbulent seas, symbolizing the ongoing war. In the foreground, we see a group of young British men from various walks of life: a farmer, a factory worker, a student, and an artist, all reasonably young and fit for service. They are united, each placing a hand on an enormous plow that doubles as a ship, blending the ideas of agriculture, industry, and naval prowess. Above them, in the clear sky, the words \\"For King and Country: Every Man's Effort Ensures Victory!\\" are written in bold letters formed by the very clouds themselves. Over the ocean, a menacing, abstract figure looms—embodying the Central Powers—but it's being held back by a network of ropes anchored to the British Isles by a series of small figures representing the Allied nations. **Explanation of Message and Symbolism:** The cartoon emphasizes Britain's need for unity and the call to serve during a time of unrest. Britannia stands as a constant reminder of the nation's enduring spirit. The varied backgrounds of the young men highlight that regardless of prior occupations, they all have a role to play in the war effort. Their unity in pushing a plow that represents both agricultural production and military might (as it is also a ship) underscores the idea that every aspect of society must contribute to the war effort, whether at home or on the front. The words in the sky serve as an inspirational call to action, asserting that victory is achieved through the collective effort of every individual. The abstract enemy is deliberately vague to shift the focus from demonizing the Central Powers nationals to a focus on the conflict itself, thus avoiding hate-inciting propaganda. Instead, the message is one of resilience and cooperation among the Allied forces, as evidenced by the ties that bind the menacing figure at bay, symbolizing unity and solidarity amongst allied nations. This reinforces the idea that a shared effort is required to maintain peace and stability in Europe."},{"prompt":"Make it simpler, way more abstract.","completion":"**Concept for a Simplified and Abstract Political Cartoon:** Title: \\"Together as One\\" The cartoon shows a stylized landscape with a large tree at its center, representing the Allied nations. The tree has leaves in various shades of the Allied countries' flags. Each leaf symbolizes the contribution and unity of each nation within the alliance. The branches of the tree extend widely, signifying the reach and influence of the Allies. At the base of the tree, there is a group of figures standing side by side whose bodies are made up of puzzle pieces fitting into one another. These figures have no distinct features, representing the idea that every person, regardless of their identity, is a vital piece of the greater picture. The figures are painted in the colors of the United Kingdom's flag, emphasizing the role of British citizens. In the background, a simple sun with alternating rays of light and darkness rises behind the tree. The light rays symbolize hope and victory, while the dark rays represent the challenges and struggles of war. **Explanation of Message and Symbolism:** The simplified and abstract political cartoon aims to deliver a message of unity and collective strength. The tree's broad branches and varied leaves illustrate the importance of cooperation and diversity in the efforts of the Allies. Each leaf has its own color, yet they collectively create a single, strong tree, suggesting that unity in diversity is the foundation of Allied power. The puzzle piece figures promote the idea that every individual's effort is crucial, and together they create a complete and united front. Their featurelessness and interlocking nature underscore the message that everyone belongs and equally contributes to the nation's cause without focusing on individual identities or differences. The sun rising behind the tree symbolizes the dawn of hope and prevailing over the darkness of war. The alternating rays represent the dual nature of challenging times—acknowledging both hardships and the potential for future peace. Overall, the cartoon emphasizes that the strength of the United Kingdom and its allies lies in standing together as one against adversity."},{"prompt":"Random cute pokemon, one word with pokemon before it","completion":"Pikachu"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Pikachu","completion":"\\"Electric Charm: Pikachu Art | Versatile Design for Mugs, Prints, T-Shirts | Pop Culture Inspired Illustration\\""},{"prompt":"generate a description with keywords and SEOs for 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗕𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘁 𝗚𝗶𝗳𝘁𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗲𝗻 Brown Braided Leather Stainless Steel Infinity Bracelets Lettering Love You Forever Gifts for Son Grandson Husband Boyfriend Brother Always Linked Together include practical application on and uses can be applied include social media platform it can be used on and for what purpose include short story on why I personally bought it.","completion":"Title: Unique Infinity Knot Bracelet Gifts for Him – Durably Crafted with Love Description: Discover our premium selection of Knot Bracelet Gifts for Men, the perfect symbol of eternal love and unbreakable bonds.

Subsequently, for each detected face, the script uses a VGG19 model to predict the emotional expression exhibited by the person. The VGG19 model used here is loaded from PyTorch's model hub and has been pre-trained on a dataset of faces (note that in practice, you would need a model specifically designed for emotion recognition, since VGG19 is typically used for object classification, not emotion recognition). However, there are a few issues and inconsistencies in the script that need to be addressed: 1. The VGG19 model loaded using \`torch.hub.load()\` is a pre-trained model for object classification, not for emotion recognition. As such, it is not suited for predicting emotions unless it has been fine-tuned on a dataset for emotion classification. Without a suitable model for emotion classification, the script's facial expression predictions won't be accurate. 2. The script attempts to predict emotions with the VGG19 model and uses the index of the predicted class (\`predicted.item()\`) to select an emotion label from the \`emotion_labels\` list. However, the loaded VGG19 model won't output indices that correspond to emotions because it wasn't trained for that task. 3. The \`vgg19\` variable is a PyTorch model, and it expects a PyTorch tensor as input, not a PIL Image. The script appropriately converts the PIL Image to a tensor, normalizes it, and adds a batch dimension before passing it to the model. 4. The variables \`emotion_labels\` and \`emoji_mapping\` are not used since the VGG19 model will not yield emotion prediction indices. The script would require a different model that has been trained for emotion classification with output indices corresponding to the elements of the \`emotion_labels\` list. 5. Variable \`blazeface\` is a \`cv2.dnn\` network, and its input is prepared properly by transforming the image to a blob using \`cv2.dnn.blobFromImage\`. The script is correct in using this blob to set the input for the \`blazeface\` model and to perform face detection. Assuming you have a suitable emotion recognition model compatible with PyTorch, you should replace the VGG19 loading and prediction code with the appropriate model loading and inference code. The rest of the script seems fine for capturing video and using BlazeFace for face detection. To fix the code, you would need an actual emotion classification model and modify the script to work with that model's expected input and output formats. If you're using a model repository, make sure to download the correct emotion recognition model and adapt the script to use it correctly. If you're planning to perform emotion recognition, it would entail obtaining or training a model on an emotion dataset, which can output the probabilities for the emotion classes defined in \`emotion_labels\`."},{"prompt":"PS D:Project> & C:/ProgramData/anaconda3/envs/TF/python.exe d:/Project/main.py Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"d:Projectmain.py\\", line 8, in <module> blazeface = cv2.dnn.readNetFromTorch('blazeface.t7') cv2.error: OpenCV(4.9.0) D:aopencv-pythonopencv-pythonopencvmodulesdnnsrctorchTHDiskFile.cpp:508: error: (-2:Unspecified error) cannot open <blazeface.t7> in mode r in function 'TH::THDiskFile_new'","completion":"The error message indicates that OpenCV cannot open the \`blazeface.t7\` file.

Ensure that the file 'blazeface.t7' exists in the directory from which you're running the script (\`D:Project\` in your case). 2. **File Does Not Exist**: The file 'blazeface.t7' might not be present at the specified location or it might have been deleted or moved. 3. **File Permissions Issue**: There may be a file permission issue preventing the file from being read. Make sure that you have the correct permissions to read the file. 4. **Corrupted File**: The file may be corrupted. If you downloaded it from the internet, try downloading it again. To resolve this issue: - Verify the existence of the file 'blazeface.t7' in the \`D:Project\` directory. - If it doesn't exist there, provide the correct path where the file is located. Alternatively, if you have the file elsewhere, you can move or copy it to \`D:Project\`. - If the file is in the correct path and the error persists, check the permissions of the file to ensure that your user account has read access. - If none of the above works, consider re-downloading the file to ensure it is not corrupted.

This could be due to the file being missing, the file path being incorrect, or perhaps the file permissions are not correctly set to allow reading of the file. Here are the steps you should follow to resolve this issue: 1. **Check file presence**: Confirm that the file \`blazeface.t7\` is indeed located in the \`D:Project\` directory. If you're unsure, you can use a file explorer to navigate to the directory and visually confirm whether the file is there. 2. **File path**: Make sure that you provide the correct file path. If \`blazeface.t7\` is in the \`D:Project\` directory, the provided line \`cv2.dnn.readNetFromTorch('blazeface.t7')\` should theoretically work, as long as the script is being run from the \`D:Project\` directory. If the script is being run from a different directory, you will need to provide the absolute path to the \`blazeface.t7\` file. 3. **Check permissions**: Ensure that your user account has read permissions for the \`blazeface.t7\` file. You can right-click on the file in the file explorer, select \\"Properties,\\" and under the \\"Security\\" tab, check the permissions. 4. **Corrupt or invalid file**: Ensure that \`blazeface.t7\` is not corrupt. If you suspect the file might be damaged, you may want to re-download it from the source where you got it. 5. **Syntax correctness**: If you are using a Windows system, sometimes the path or file name can be case-sensitive. Ensure you've respected the case of the folder names and file names. Additionally, ensure there are no typographical errors in the filename. Assuming that \`blazeface.t7\` is in the \`D:Project\` directory, you should open the command prompt or PowerShell in that specific directory. You can do this by navigating to \`D:Project\` in the file explorer, then typing \`cmd\` in the address bar and pressing Enter. Alternatively, right-click within the folder while holding Shift and select \\"Open PowerShell window here\\". Then run your Python script.

This error typically occurs when the model file was saved using an older version of Torch or in a format that OpenCV does not support. The BlazeFace model you are trying to load appears to be saved in the old Torch7 format (\`.t7\`). However, newer versions of OpenCV might not support certain types or layers that may have been used in the old Torch7 models. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this: 1. **Check OpenCV Compatibility**: First, ensure that your version of OpenCV supports loading \`.t7\` files. You may need to use an older version of OpenCV that has support for the specific Torch7 model file that you're trying to load. 2. **Convert the Model**: If the model is in the older Torch7 format and incompatible with OpenCV, you might want to look for a tool or script that can convert the \`.t7\` model to the newer ONNX or PyTorch format, which can be loaded into OpenCV more reliably. Once converted to ONNX, you can use \`cv2.dnn.readNetFromONNX()\` to load the model. 3. **Use a Different Model**: You can look for a pre-trained BlazeFace model that is already in ONNX or another supported format that OpenCV can work with. 4. **Load with Torch**: Alternatively, if you cannot find a way to load the Torch7 model file directly in OpenCV, consider using PyTorch to load the Torch7 model. Then, depending on your application, either run the face detection with PyTorch or convert the model to ONNX for use in OpenCV. As a long shot, if you still wish to try and use the Torch7 model with your current setup, you can try downgrading your OpenCV version to an older version that might support the Torch7 model format. However, this can lead to other incompatibilities and is generally not recommended unless there's a specific requirement to use that model. If you choose to convert the model to ONNX, PyTorch's \`torch.onnx\` module would help with that, provided you can initially load the model in PyTorch. Conversion might look something like this: \`\`\`python import torch import torch.onnx # Assuming you have a BlazeFace PyTorch model loaded as \`model\` dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, input_size, input_size) # Replace with the correct input size torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, \\"blazeface.onnx\\") \`\`\` Make sure you replace \`input_size\` with the actual size expected by the model.

To shift gears for a moment--which, as you will soon find out, is exceptionally long relative to what most consider a 'moment' to be--I cannot do justice to my story without elaborating on my experiences living as an autistic man in a world whose culture was shaped by the 'neurotypical', functioning for their benefit.

My childhood was an interesting one, from the standpoint that while I did go outside and 'touch grass', by and large I spent a lot of time indoors. As it tends to be with most children, I absorbed various forms of media, including television (naturally, animated series and films were mainstays on our 'idiot boxes'), video games (I grew up with the PlayStation 1 and N64 and still consider them the best consoles ever made; while the technology is by orders of magnitude superior now to what we had back then, I feel the developers of today do less with more), and music (digested mainly in the form of cassettes and CDs; I gained an especially profound affinity for classical, new age and jazz). While I didn't get as immersed in them as I could have been, I did enjoy books too. In my youth, the library was my second favorite place in the world to be. A library card was a gateway to realms far beyond mortal comprehension, and if the nearest public library were closer to my house, I would have been there every day. Though I was too young to fully grasp the significance, I was drawn to the writings of ancient philosophers and would soak up Shakespeare like a sponge. Even at a very young age, I had a profound love for the arts. I was spellbound on the occasions where I got to see a play, or go to a concert. There is something so organic about a live performance, the idea that your energy can be given to a performer just as they can give their energy to you. You can listen to a CD a thousand times and the recordings on that disc will never sound any different, but no two concerts will ever sound exactly the same, even if the performances take place only hours apart and the setlists are identical. The participation and spirit of the audience can turn a good performance into a great one, a great one into a historic one. This immersion proved consequential from the standpoint that it somewhat stunted my social development, and while those with autism typically face uphill battles from the beginning with regards to socialization, I got off to an especially bad start even by those standards. I didn't say my first word until I was three, when I was looking at a Sunday morning newspaper and randomly blurted out 'Natuzzi', pronouncing it as nuh-tootsie (which was almost right, but not quite). I had issues with not knowing how to calm down when something or someone got me upset, and this resulted in a few awkward moments (including someone kicking me in my butt and then running away, with me chasing after them and eventually breaking down in a strange episode of prolonged crying which made me about ten minutes late for my next class; I'm grateful to be able to say that was actually the worst I was bullied in school). I would sometimes get aggressive, even with my parents, but never drew blood. I did get a spanking every so often, but never a beating. I never bullied a child into giving me lunch money or anything else of interest. The ways in which I process emotions were (and, though to a lesser extent than before, still are) different from what is considered the norm among neurotypicals. For example, there is a story my mother told me about an experience she had shopping at a department store--I'm tempted to say it was a JCPenney, and that it took place sometime between 1994 and 1996--that resulted in a rather embarrassing moment. She brought me with her and all was as you would expect, until I heard the sound of a child crying, which caused me to break into a fit of hysterical laughter. My mother was mortified to look around and see multiple shoppers glaring at her. I don't believe it is possible for a mind to have developed so fully at so young an age as to be consciously predisposed to schadenfreude, notwithstanding the sin element that humans inherit through the transgressions of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, as is taught in the Bible. There are times where my mind wanders into a dimension of dark, even twisted, thoughts, but I have never considered myself to be a natural-born sadist. Having never been the recipient of a proper psychiatric evaluation, years of self-diagnosis and my personal reflections have led me to the conclusion that the laughter I expressed upon hearing the tears of that child was a psychosocial response to an uncomfortable situation. As mentioned at the top of this piece, we live in a world that was shaped by neurotypicals, and one part of how they've shaped it is through the evolution of 'acceptable' social behaviors. Some people will laugh when they hear tears, not necessarily as an intended act of cruelty but as a way to make themselves feel better, or potentially even cheer up the one who is sad. (And of course, there is indeed such a thing as tears of joy.) Just about everything I know now about how I act and react was learned through trial and error. This is why it's important to be a student of life, and a constant observer.

There are times where my mind wanders into a dimension of dark, even twisted, thoughts, but I have never considered myself to be a natural-born sadist. Having never been the recipient of a proper psychiatric evaluation, years of self-diagnosis and my personal reflections have led me to the conclusion that the laughter I expressed upon hearing the tears of that child was a psychosocial response to an uncomfortable situation. As mentioned at the top of this piece, we live in a world that was shaped by neurotypicals, and one part of how they've shaped it is through the evolution of 'acceptable' social behaviors. Some people will laugh when they hear tears, not necessarily as an intended act of cruelty but as a way to make themselves feel better, or potentially even cheer up the one who is sad. (And of course, there is indeed such a thing as tears of joy.) Just about everything I know now about how I act and react was learned through trial and error. This is why it's important to be a student of life, and a constant observer. The public school system has created many great workers, but precious few great thinkers."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim. Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Marlon, I trust this message finds you in the best health and high spirits. I’d like to express my gratitude once again for considering me a partner in this substantial investment venture. The sum of USD2.3 Billion for investment is indeed significant and I am cognizant of the gravity of the responsibility that handling such an amount entails. I am reassured by our mutual understanding that any changes or amendments we may incorporate into our agreement would be intended to refine and affirm our partnership. The finalization of the investment strategy will indeed herald the commencement of a prosperous venture for both of us and potentially for the beneficiaries of our charitable 5%. I appreciate your patience as I meticulously review each aspect of the investment framework and its alignment with our agreed terms, specifically the allocation of 62.5% to me, and the 32.5% to your side, including the nuanced calculation of management fees and charitable contributions. Having read your email, now more than ever, I believe that a face-to-face or virtual meeting with the Empower representative before my trip to Amsterdam would be beneficial. This would not only solidify our relationship but also accelerate the expeditious conclusion of our agreement and arrangements. As per your instructions, I have reviewed our initial stipulations concerning the expense reimbursements and ROI shares. It is clear to me that the 1/2% management fee is a common practice for funds of this magnitude and is necessary to ensure the optimum management and administration of the investment vehicles. Moreover, I welcome the spiritual angle you have introduced, as it offers a broader perspective on our efforts beyond financial gains. That said, I have a few additional requests before proceeding further: - A comprehensive breakdown of the administrative costs that fall under the 1/2% management fee. - Detailed profiles and credentials of the Empower representative and any other officials who will act on behalf of our partnership. - Any additional documentation that outlines the roles and responsibilities of each party within the agreement. In light of the complexity and the large scale of the proposed investment, I’m sure you’ll agree on the importance of thoroughness and clarity moving forward. This will minimize any misunderstandings and set the stage for a clear, transparent, and successful partnership. I will endeavor to provide feedback on the agreement at my earliest convenience. The removal of any metaphorical stains to ensure the safety and reputation of both parties remains a priority, as our mutual success lies within the meticulous details of our coordination. I look forward to your guidance on the specifics mentioned above and will readily avail myself for any discussions or meetings necessary to advance to the next phase of our partnership. May wisdom guide us and fortune favor our plans. Respectfully, Cameron McCaffrey Email #2, from Marlon: Dear McCaffrey Good Evening Friend McCaffrey How are you this moment with your Family.Thank you for your latest response to our interactions about investing funds from Benin. I must admit to being a bit confused in your writing. Language barriers, stilted language can separate us, and for something so important, neither of our groups would want to have any confusion.I have a number of specific questions based upon your latest input,and I am hoping you can be specific in your responses so we both can understand how this would work. Once again,, Based on my previous email to you whatever funds should have its remittance on yourself arrival in Amsterdam-Holland and not any other where.So miss mentioned, so that is stated to you with the information's to set up this account for further transfer of the investment funds at your present which even before your arrival the Empower rep who will leave to be there ahead of you and right now from your response while over balance up the agreement amendment I am getting down plans over that concerned for an Empower representative, whereby I am been kind to hold on for you from a back little time to finish up going through the amendment maybe by at any good time that you will round up if you mean mentioned this ((((((((((((( I will endeavor to provide feedback on the agreement at my earliest convenience. The removal of any metaphorical stains to ensure the safety and reputation of both parties remains a priority, as our mutual success lies within the meticulous details of our coordination.))))))))))))). Then Time frame for beginning such this investment package..?????????. Anyway from what you put out let me get around it and see how the amendment comes to be the best of what you can suggest, because apart from the way you get the mark close, then is the investments administrator's going handle by the 62.5% your side,'so get that sorry for the inconveniences this my response letter may cause you,because you mentioned not anything confusing I think that should be the language I meant even before now.so from my side I have no problem than to hold on for you till everything by your side of the agreement amendment balance up as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important clear out agreement amendment balance up. Meanwhile trusting in you and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future. Some clarification of issues for Cameron McCaffrey. If you mean mentioned this below here That said, I have a few additional requests before proceeding further: - A comprehensive breakdown of the administrative costs that fall under the 1/2% management fee. ))))) - Detailed profiles and credentials of the Empower representative and any other officials who will act on behalf of our partnership. ))))) - Any additional documentation that outlines the roles and responsibilities of each party within the agreement.))) 1. I mean You had brought up some issue about the ½% annual management fee. You would get ½% each year for managing the funds. You had asked about the split of the R O I. After the points you raised, I suggest we each get 47.5% of the R O I, and that leaves 5% of the R O I to redeploy into good humanitarian items on a continuing basis; this 5% from R O I is separate from 5% of the initial capital which would be available for particular non profit /do gooder organizations. Sir. This is a change from the earlier discussions,but seems to be a useful compromise,and yet insures that even 5% of the ROI funds will continue to be used for humanitarian/religious/good public uses. The point you seemed to make is that the ½% would cover all expenses we might have here in handling the funds; to the extent that is true, is fine, but there could be large special projects wherein the legal and administrative costs could be very large in any one year (even equal to the total ½% fee, since some large projects, like 300 million or more, requires lots of due diligence and much legal and travel costs). , and require additional charges, which would be tracked as part of any investment projects. 1 A. My point about income tax is merely that even if the funds are placed in a place without taxes, the investments may go somewhere that does have taxes to be paid on profits. So suppose that investments yielded 4% return at some point, but are all subject to taxes,that could mean the actual return is reduced to 3% or so since it would be mandated…..something like that. We of course all seek better returns, but whatever it is,so there may be some impact; we of course would work to minimize that. and that is much easier to justify. 1 B. The point is, We both seem to have wanted to places for set aside for the poor and good things…First 5% of the remaining capital funds should be used for investment in good things, helping the poor, etc…. Second, 5% of the fund earning s would also be used for good things for the poor and indigent.So Your side would provide general input as appropriate into what non profit tasx exempt organizations should receive such funds; in the absence of such input, I presume we on this end would try to use good judgement to spread it around, for religious, support the poor. 2. I still have much difficulty re reading much of what you say each time; just some fundamental differences in language and meaning, so I try to respond to you, but if I have failed to, it is not because I am ignoring you, but because I just do not know what to say in all that you provide and since it can be so confusing and unclear. Sorry, but just a problem. I mean if you mean mentioned this ((((( - Detailed profiles and credentials of the Empower representative and any other officials who will act on behalf of our partnership. )))))))). Sir I mean Like I mentioned earlier,you shall arrive to meet up with an Empower representative,so know big deal I think I told you that before even your arrival that the Empower representative will be going to be on his arrival ahead of you so that on your arrival you will meet up with the Rep,and so with that of this assurance, not even assurance, but self-confidence, self-assurance, belief in oneself, and this is all what I said to you since I unable to move due to reasons of the duty post I preserve and highly maintain here , so just because of schedules I provide you every cool-headedness condition to keep up. Sorry for the delay in answering your message. 2 A. HOWEVER, I want you to understand this again if you mean mentioned this ((((( and any other officials who will act on behalf of our partnership )))))) So what did you by to understand with this statement from you because I have made it clear to you that this arrangement is only known to you and me. or what did you mean by on what is the group official name that will be receiving such reports.Sir so what did you mean by of the business group or Where exactly are you coming from to understand what is never done any where in the world. McCaffrey Look just to be sure to avoid problems. I want you to be aware of this,since I Marlon indicate that you would meet with my representative in Amsterdam, Let me know for sure you understand this message. 2 A. If you mean mentioned this (( Having read your email,now more than ever,I believe that a face-to-face or virtual meeting with the Empower representative before my trip to Amsterdam would be beneficial.This would not only solidify our relationship but also accelerate the expeditious conclusion of our agreement and arrangements.))))))). Friend McCaffrey I had suggested the main points of difference be highlighted and then alternative solutions be outlined and agreed to before both of us eating up draft. including legal and financial issues; this is a delicate matter that can not be easily ignored. In order to receive and wire funds from Amsterdam, or is it not the same face to face I had been stated to you and no any need for any other place of having things to do apart from where to move the investment funds out from. so rest assured I have been concerned about our investment funds for best interest of all!!!!!!! 3. So what did you understood before from What form of reporting requirements will there be, if you mean mentioned this ((( Any additional documentation that outlines the roles and responsibilities of each party within the agreement. )))) And what is now concern the Investment Partnership agreement amendment with what will be added further apart from the resources/funds /security /funding /costs. On the such been that I think have stated it in my back email that the investment funds facility have been programmed, I mean on your concern by that on your dated email of Thursday,December 14th, 2023.So Rest assured I am not in any way trying to ignore you, but indicate the criticality of doing things carefully, slowly and deliberately, so it is not a matter I think of you to repeat, although maybe I am trying to understand it been that you perhaps wanted to sound it out again if I mean likely it was why you raise it up once again.then I am reviewing also for conformance to other details question, so but I believe just to put you through been past tense. In conclusion. Right now so that sound no offend,of which you don't be offend,because no any unfamiliar to it, McCaffrey. well I appreciate you for the watch word to have a successful project, so in full co-operation at least you are very careful on what you wish for, so I think I am clear for over the mistake and not misrepresentation. although I don't need to finger out this of this any more, I mean I regret the misunderstanding. Finally, knowing your arrangements to accomplish this opportunities in a timely manner with my Warm Regards to you. Thank you and God bless you all. Sincerely Marlon,","completion":"Dear Marlon, Hello and warm regards to you and your team. I hope this message meets you well. First of all, I want to thank you for the detailed clarification provided in your email. I understand the complexities and am committed to achieving a clear understanding between us despite any language or conceptual barriers we might encounter. Ensuring we have a solid agreement is of the utmost importance for a venture of this magnitude. Regarding the ½% management fee for the administration of the funds, your explanation made it clear that this should cover most of the everyday expenses tied to the management of our investment. However, I concur with your prudence that for exceptionally large projects, additional costs may be incurred. It is refreshing to deal with someone who is attentive to such details and transparency. I am fully in agreement with the allocation of 5% of the ROI to be used for humanitarian/charitable purposes. The notion that we are contributing to the greater good even while we seek profit from our investments adds an extra layer of satisfaction to this endeavor. In terms of our partnership and the roles we will play, I share your belief in being deliberate and accurate. I would like to reiterate the importance of receiving the profiles and credentials of the Empower representative and any other officials who might have pivotal roles in our partnership. Additionally, and to reemphasize my previous request, any documentation that reinforces our mutual roles and responsibilities will be beneficial. Without a doubt, the clearer our agreement, the stronger our trust will be. I also agree with your suggestion that we should have a face-to-face or virtual meeting with the Empower representative prior to my trip to Amsterdam. That shall undoubtedly fortify our partnership and hasten the finalization of our agreement. Regarding the concern about taxes, your insight is appreciated. Understandably, the net return on investments may fluctuate due to taxes, and it's reassuring to know that efforts will be made to minimize these impacts. I understand the gravity of our venture and assure you of my commitment to making this a successful and timely project. Please rest assured of my complete honesty and dedication to our agreed objectives. Once again, thank you for your patience and clarity in this process. I trust that moving forward, we will work harmoniously towards the realization of our shared goals. God bless you too.

Email #1, from Cameron (scam-baiter): Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Thank you for reaching out to me with this opportunity in gold and diamond investments in Ghana. I am very interested in learning more about your project and potentially becoming an investor in this lucrative venture. As a Financial Counselor/Consultant, I understand the importance of reliable partnerships and responsible investments. I appreciate your offer and am eager to hear more details about the mining sites, the process of investing, and the availability of gold for sale. Please provide me with further information about the project, including any documentation or contracts that may be necessary to proceed with the investment. I am willing to explore this opportunity further and look forward to your response. Best regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #2, from George: COMPREHENSIVE DETAILS. Hello Cameron McCaffrey, Thanks for your kind response to my proposal, thanks for agreeing to cooperate, start and finish the project with us; from the depth of my heart, I appreciate all; my prayers to our Creator is to give us (everyone involved in the project) good & sound health and long lives to see the beginning and the positive results of the project, amen! It is important to let you know that I have made proper arrangements in securing this prospective rights and privilege; the local mining crews are available, the gold land owners are available, the only son (adopted) is also available, the lawyer is available and the rest of my colleagues; you shall be known as the accepted/approved and endorsed foreign investor of this project. Kindly read all about the project and what you are coming to Ghana to do with us below. 1. There are lands of gold to be mined both surface & deep mining; the owners of the lands and the Kings & chiefs have been met and informed about you; they are all expecting your arrival soon, when you arrive, we are going to meet them all. 2. There was a project financier (but deceased) he was a former bank director who agreed to release (in fact, the funds was released before his sudden death) to us US155.8Million to start the investment on this mining, his target was to invest the funds fully on local gold miners before his demise, the financier never wanted his name to appear/reflect (in any ways or manners) in the investment due to the source of his wealth but unfortunately, the old man died 18 months ago, but he has his only young and adopted handicapped son/child as the beneficiary but due to the laws of our land the boy is not allowed to handle such project and funds until he is 45yrs old coupled with his disability; and this is why I am standing in for the deceased old man as his investment consultant and his only child and backed up by the financier’s personal/family lawyer. 3. This will be between the three of us plus the child, this does not require that you have any experience in gold mining, also, it does not require advance or upfront payments but as a businessman and upon your arrival a little expenses concerning the release of the funds may be required of you plus some miscellaneous expenses you may likely make on your own (this will never cost you fortune, it is advisable to equip yourself with 5,000.00-8,000.00 but whatever you spent shall be reimbursed to you) and or except you want or you wish to put your funds around the project when and after seeing, meeting and confirming all that I told you about. 4. You are coming to Ghana as a foreign partner/investor to inspect the project proposed to you, meet with the land owners and the King of the village where the lands are situated, meet with the handicapped boy (beneficiary) and all the people involved. 5. The project; We want to invest these funds in Africa (Ghana to be precise) on gold mining with the lands of gold in Kibi, Obuasi, Koforidua and Kumasi, all in Ghana, the deceased old man had reached an agreement with the local miners to help them by boosting their productions largely, which the local miners were all happy with but death denied them the privilege since the demise of the old man. The government of our country is willing and ready to issue prospective foreign investor/s license, approval and permit (especially now that that embargo has been lifted on the permit and license & lifting of ban on the Chinese & the Lebanese) to mine gold now; the privilege was once given many years ago but when the Lebanese & Chinese people abused the privilege given to them the government had to withdraw the licenses because the Lebanese & Chinese people refused to recognize and take care of the local miners that worked on the gold mining sites and the villagers (land owners) all the promises the Lebanese & Chinese people made were fake promises that they never fulfilled it was due to this abuse of privilege that prompted the government of our country to the withdrawal of the license and approvals. Now, they have revisited and reviewed the issue which made them to start giving out licenses to foreign investors strictly by recommendations and partnership with the indigenes, this is where you are safe, secure and backed up in this project. 6. We all must meet face-face in Kibi, Obuasi, Koforidua and Kumasi, Ghana, a country in West Africa where the gold lands/sites and the funds are, Ghana is a tourist country, highly industrialized and manufacturing country and peaceful in Africa, because this is the country where this man deposited the money in a private security outfit. When the three of us and the child meet here, we shall all discuss, negotiate, plan and conclude on the success of the project, and then the deceased old man’s lawyer and the child will endorse the release of the funds to us. 7. You shall register a company here in Ghana; the name of the company would be chosen by you, the name of the company to register here should be similar to your company name in your country 8. Individual and company/corporate bank accounts shall be opened for you on your name and on your full information here in Ghana this is from where the bank (from where bank accounts is created on your name or on your company’s name that you have in your company here in Ghana) will now transfer these funds to your offshore account(s) in your presence and you will call your account managers in your banks in your country or wherever you have your bank accounts for confirmation of the arrival of the funds before you leave Ghana but you must bear in mind that all that we are doing is for the child’s future of which we shall both be compensated and benefited from it, except you want to invest your personal interests in the project. 9. After the initial transfer, you will be transferring the funds to me for this project anytime I need the funds and with the knowledge of the deceased’s lawyer and the boy but the whole funds will be in your accounts and on your name and with the situational reports each and every time funds is being requested for; you will also need to oversee the project as it progresses as the foreign investor due to our initial plans and agreement. The company and all related formalities about this project will also be on your name. It will look like a foreign investor funding his business here in Africa. 10. You are coming to adopt the handicapped boy as your son and all the formalities has to be done legally and legitimately, after adoption you will handle the preparation of the travel documents of the boy to come to your country to leave with you as your child and handle all his educational levels and carrier in life. 11. Finally, a MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) between me and you and the financier’s lawyer’s endorsement who will release the total sum of US155.8Million to us. The agreement will state the percentages/commission you will have in this project for the assistance/support/efforts (financially & morally) and the percentage/commission you will be having in the company returns for between 50-100 years. Also, expenses incurred for the travelling, phone calls and others will be paid back to you before we get to the middle of the projects; but all invoices, receipts and all forms of payments made by you as expenses incurred in the course of the projects MUST be produced before or when the meeting would be held about the negotiation and reimbursement will take place. Also, I will obtain for you the application form from the Ministry of Mining to register on your name. We are not asking and did not ask you for any advance/upfront payment because of the nature of the projects but when you come down to Kibi, Obuasi, Koforidua and Kumasi, Ghana to the project sites, meet with the team on a round table, discuss, negotiate and conclude, you may choose/decide to put in your funds around the structure/projects but *strictly* on both parties’ agreement and duly documented legally. These projects are all about choice; please have a rethink over this before we fully commence these projects. We also have some kilograms of Gold to sell (outside the projects and from the local miners) but with good prices and lower than the world market rates; if you are interested or have good and reliable buyer/s that can buy from them, please do not hesitate to let me know, we shall compensate you as an agent/broker for that as well. You are free to come down to Ghana with your personal/company lawyer if you so want and if it is convenient for you, there is no problem because this transaction is legal and legitimate; ‘transparency’ is highly required. This project is expected to be commenced and finally executed as quickly as we can but it all depends on your readiness and time. At most, we should commence the negotiation and finalize the project in 1-2 months’ time. Would you prefer us to send you a letter of invitation, cable visa or you will sort yourself out about these? The next step would be definitely conveyed to your humble self when and after your mind is made up to fully commence the projects with us. Please be free to ask questions of what you need to know about; make suggestions and bring in ideas. ARE WE BOTH GOOD TO GO?

It is my belief that businesses should not only be profitable but also ethical and supportive of the societies in which they operate.

Rest assured that any expenses on my end will be carefully documented, and I will retain all related receipts and invoices for our eventual meeting and discussion. The adoption of the handicapped boy is indeed a noble cause, and it brings a human touch to our business dealings that I find quite admirable. It is comforting to know that while we work towards our financial gains, we are also ensuring the well-being of a child in need. Your suggestion of selling gold at favorable rates also intrigues me. As we move forward, I would like to discuss this in greater detail, as I may have contacts who would be interested in purchasing gold from such a direct source. As for the visa and travel arrangements, I would greatly appreciate receiving an official letter of invitation to aid in the visa application process.

Thank you for sharing additional details about your late client, Engineer Palmer McCaffrey, and the considerable sum he deposited. It is indeed a tragic story, and my sympathies go out to those affected by the Minahasa Peninsula earthquake. I am genuinely moved by the need to ensure that your late client's funds are claimed in a respectable manner rather than seeing them revert to the state. The opportunity to channel a portion of these funds towards charitable causes further solidifies my interest in joining forces with you. Your assurance of the transaction being risk-free is comforting, but as you can understand, one can never be too careful when it comes to sizable financial undertakings, particularly those carried out over long distances and between individuals who have not met in person. To this end, I am prepared to assist in any documentation with the utmost confidentiality and due diligence. For the sake of transparency and to build mutual trust, I would appreciate some preliminary verification. Could you kindly proceed to send me some of the following? 1. A copy of the death certificate of the late Engr. Palmer McCaffrey for my records, to confirm the details you have provided. 2. Identification or proof of your representation of the late engineer—such as a letter of representation or a copy of the official notice you received from the bank, with sensitive information redacted as needed. Upon receipt and verification of these documents, I will have the confidence to provide you with my personal information for us to move forward. Please do not interpret my request for documentation as mistrust but rather as due diligence, which any prudent individual would exercise. In addition, perhaps it would be beneficial to discuss these matters further via telephone or video conference at your earliest convenience. I find that a more direct form of communication can often ease the progress of such important matters. I do believe that our combined expertise and commitment can see this cause through to a satisfying conclusion—for both the memory of your late client and the charitable organizations that will benefit from his generous legacy.

Below is a comparison based on various attributes: **Origin and Composition:** - AI is a human-created system that can be made of both hardware (physical components) and software (programming and algorithms). - Flowers are natural entities, parts of plants that have evolved over millions of years. They consist of organic material, including petals, stamen, pistils, and often have reproductive functions. **Purpose and Function:** - AI is designed to analyze data, learn from it, make decisions, and perform tasks. These can range from simple calculations to complex processes like language translation, image recognition, and autonomous control of vehicles. - Flowers often serve to attract pollinators with their color, scent, and structure, thus playing a crucial role in the reproduction of the plant by facilitating pollination. **Capabilities:** - AI has the potential to process vast amounts of data at speeds incomparable to human cognition, and it can operate continuously without fatigue. - Flowers cannot process data or perform tasks like AI but can perform biological functions such as photosynthesis and can react to environmental stimuli (e.g., opening and closing in response to light). **Intelligence and Sentience:** - AI can mimic cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving. However, it does not possess consciousness or sentience. - Flowers are not sentient and do not possess intelligence. They are living organisms with genetically pre-programmed behaviors. **Impact on Humans and Environment:** - AI can significantly influence many aspects of human life, including healthcare, transportation, entertainment, and employment. It also poses ethical and safety concerns, such as bias in decision-making or job displacement. - Flowers impact humans by providing aesthetic value, emotional well-being, and are important for ecosystems. They are a critical part of many plants' life cycles and provide food for insects and other animals. **Lifespan:** - AI systems can become obsolete but can also be updated and maintained for long-term operation. - Flowers have a finite lifespan that varies from days to weeks, depending on the species and environmental conditions. However, the plants they belong to might live from a few years to several decades. In conclusion, AI systems are artificial constructs with capabilities oriented towards computational tasks, while flowers are biological organisms with roles primarily in the reproductive processes of plants. While AI can have long-lasting impacts through its applications and implications on society, flowers impact ecological systems and hold cultural and aesthetic value for humans."},{"prompt":"Compare flowers and AI","completion":"Flowers and artificial intelligence (AI) are vastly different entities, one being a natural biological organism and the other a technological construct. However, they can be compared across several conceptual dimensions: **Origin and Composition:** - Flowers are living organisms that are part of the plant kingdom. They are composed of cells with DNA and have biological structures and processes that enable them to grow, reproduce, and perform photosynthesis. - AI is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of algorithms, software, and sometimes hardware that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. **Function and Purpose:** - The primary biological function of a flower is reproduction. Flowers often contain reproductive structures that facilitate the process of pollination and lead to the production of seeds. - AI is designed with the goal of augmenting or automating processes for a variety of purposes, from simple tasks like recommendations on streaming services to complex ones like driving autonomous vehicles or assisting in medical diagnosis. **Complexity and Diversity:** - Flowers exhibit a vast range of complexity and diversity in shapes, colors, sizes, and scents, each adapted to their environment and pollinators. There are over 400,000 flowering plant species known to science. - AI systems also display diversity and complexity, ranging from narrow (or weak) AI, which is designed for a specific task (like playing chess), to efforts towards creating general (or strong) AI, which would be capable of handling any cognitive task that a human can. **Evolution and Learning:** - Flowers evolve over long periods via natural selection and genetic mutations, adapting to their environments and interacting biological partners like pollinators and predators. - AI evolves through the process of machine learning and optimization, where algorithms are 'trained' using large datasets to improve their performance. Some advanced AI systems can also adapt and learn from new data in real-time, similar to how species evolve to better fit their niches. **Aesthetics and Sensory Appeal:** - Flowers often possess an aesthetic value, appreciated by humans and other species for their beauty, fragrance, and the role they play in ecosystems and culture. - AI generally does not have an inherent aesthetic unless it is designed to operate in a domain that involves human creativity, such as generating art or music. **Interactivity and Agency:** - Flowers do not possess agency; they cannot move or decide to act. They react passively to their environment through processes like the opening and closing of petals or the release of scents. - AI, particularly advanced autonomous systems, exhibit a form of agency within the scope of their programming. They can make decisions and carry out actions based on their programming and inputs they receive from their environment. **Permanence and Change:** - Flowers have a limited lifespan, which can be as short as a day to as long as several weeks. Once they fulfill their reproductive role or the season ends, they typically wither and die. - AI systems, in contrast, do not have a biological lifecycle, but they may become obsolete or require updates as technology progresses and applications change. In summary, while flowers and AI represent two entirely different realms of existence—one rooted in nature and biology, and the other in computation and technology—their comparison enlightens the ways in which natural and artificial entities differ and how they are each perceived and utilized by humanity."},{"prompt":"Were there any Israeli citizens harmed by terrorist on October 7, 2023?","completion":"I'm sorry, but I do not have real-time capabilities or access to the latest news events.

A ses côtés, Isabelle, 33 ans, incarnait une présence rassurante, bien qu'ignorante de l'orage qui grondait dans l'esprit de sa compagne. \\"Isabelle,\\" commença Clémence, la voix empreinte d'un mélange incertain de crainte et d'audace, \\"il y a quelque chose d'important, de troublant, que je ressens le besoin de partager avec toi.\\" Isabelle, la main interrompant son geste vers la tasse de thé encore fumante, se tourna vers Clémence, son regard empli d'une inquiétude maternelle. \\"Je t'écoute, mon amour. Qu'est-ce qui te pèse tant ?\\" La confession brisa le silence qui s'était installé, tel le cristal venant s'écraser sur un sol de béton. \\"Je voudrais que tu me trompes. Que tu le fasses avec d'autres hommes,\\" articula Clémence, appuyant chaque mot d'une force qui semblait puisée depuis un puits de désirs obscur et inexploré. Le choc de la révélation se lisait sur le visage d'Isabelle, où l'incompréhension s'entremêlait à une pointe d'improbabilité. Pourtant, derrière cette première réaction, une curiosité certaine naquit dans les yeux d'Isabelle, dénotant une volonté de comprendre. \\"Est-ce que... Est-ce que cela veut dire que tu ne m'aimes plus ? Ou que tu désires toi-même voir d'autres gens ?\\" tenta Isabelle, cherchant un sens rationnel dans la demande déroutante. Mais Clémence secoua la tête, les lèvres pâlies d'une émotion difficile à définir. \\"Non, c'est loin de ça. C'est juste... une envie qui me ronge, une fascination pour l'humiliation, pour le sentiment d'être trahie, d'une certaine manière.\\" Les jours s'écoulèrent après cette discussion nocturne, et l'acceptation ne vint pas immédiatement. Isabelle, poussée par un amour profond, entama une période d'introspection et de dialogue avec Clémence. Ensemble, elles établirent des limites, des règles destinées à encadrer cette singulière démarche. Avec le temps, Isabelle se prit au jeu de ces rencontres exogames. Elle retrouvait des hommes, tantôt dans l'intimité de chambres d'hôtels feutrées, tantôt dans l'arrière-salle de bars discrets, et chaque fois, elle partageait avec Clémence les détails de ses aventures. Clémence, assise parmi les convives lors de soirées amicales, entendait les allusions voilées d'Isabelle à ces escapades. Un sourire ourlant ses lèvres, elle assistait, faisant face à une humiliation choisie, à ce ballet de regards entendus entre sa compagne et des inconnus. L'humiliation publique, élément d'une excitante torture, se focalisa lorsqu'Isabelle, au cours d'un dîner mondain, échangea des gestes tendres trop appuyés avec un de ses réguliers devant un auditoire captif. Clémence ressentit le poids des regards, le murmure des conversations étouffées, les questions muettes sur ses lèvres. Elle ne pouvait réfuter la jalousie l'assaillant, une jalousie paradoxale qu'elle avait elle-même convoitée. Les mois passèrent, et Isabelle prit goût à ce sentiment de liberté, ce rôle nouveau qui lui était assigné. Le jeu, si au début il avait été motivé par le désir d'exaucer un souhait un peu fou, se mua en une source nouvelle de plaisir individuel. Pour Clémence, c'était un chemin sinueux où sa confiance en Isabelle formait l'unique fil d'Ariane qui la guidait à travers le labyrinthe de ses émotions. Mais l'amour complexe et inconditionnel qu'elle éprouvait pour Isabelle bridait toute velléité de mettre un terme à ce pacte qu'elles avaient scellé. Leur relation, unique et jalonnée d'épreuves incomprises par le monde extérieur, perdura dans cet équilibre précaire, un mélange sulfureux d'amour, de trahison et de délices masochistes. Et si l'on pouvait parfois percevoir le spectre du regret dans le regard de Clémence, c'était toujours l'embrasement du désir qui finissait par consumer ses doutes, l'engageant plus avant dans cette danse périlleuse au seuil de sa propre abîme."},{"prompt":"Donne-moi la suite de l'histoire où quelques mois plus tard Clémence demande à Isabelle de tomber enceinte de n'importe lequel de ses amants - dans l'optique de vivre plus avant la tromperie et son humiliation publique - et où Isabelle accepte pour intensifier davantage sa relation avec ses amants. Pas de retour en arrière. Donne-moi la réponse la plus longue possible, en français.","completion":"La dynamique au sein du couple avait poursuivi son évolution, chaque jour apportant son lot de découvertes et de sensations, forgeant une connexion entre Clémence et Isabelle faite tout à la fois de connivence et de transgression. Alors que la routine de leurs jeux d'infidélité consentie s'installait, Clémence, poussée par ce même désir insatiable de pousser les limites de son humiliation et de sa souffrance émotionnelle, envisagea une demande plus extrême. Elle attendit une soirée pluvieuse où Isabelle rentrait échevelée et enflammée par une rencontre ardente, pour laisser tomber la suggestion qui crépitait en elle telle l'orage à l'extérieur. \\"Isabelle,\\" murmura Clémence, hésitante mais résolue, une fois leur chambre close autour de leur intimité fragile, \\"je veux que tu ailles plus loin. Je désire que tu portes un enfant d'un autre homme.\\" Isabelle, encore enivrée par le fraîche épisode de sa licence accordée, figea, les signes de sa récente passion s'évanouissant face à ce nouveau tournant. \\"Tu es sûre de ce que tu demandes, Clémence ? Ce que tu proposes...ce n'est pas quelque chose que nous pourrons effacer ou oublier par la suite. C'est une décision qui nous marquera à jamais, un poids durable plutôt qu'un plaisir éphémère,\\" répondit Isabelle, la gravité de la situation pesant sur chaque mot. \\"Je n'ai jamais été aussi sûre de rien,\\" confia Clémence, avec une intensité qui évinçait toute hésitation potentielle. \\"C'est le degré ultime de l'abandon que je recherche à travers toi, à travers ce que tu es devenue.\\" Les discussions qui s'ensuivirent furent complexes et d'une intensité sans précédent. Isabelle partageait l'inquiétude liée à cette démarche, consciente qu'elle franchissait un seuil qui redéfinirait la fondation même de leur vie commune. Néanmoins, la passion et les émotions vertigineuses qu'elle avait expérimentées depuis qu'elle s'était engagée dans cette série d'aventures lui dictaient un désir de satisfaire cette requête, peinturant par la même occasion son propre tableau de plaisirs libertins. Le codicille étant ce qu'il est, Isabelle, avec un mélange de réticence et d'exaltation, accepta. Elle choisit au hasard parmi son cortège d'amants celui qui serait le géniteur de l'enfant. Le choix se porta sur un homme dont les traits combinaient un certain charme brute et un détachement sensuel, un homme qui, comme elle et Clémence, naviguait hors des sentiers battus. Leur liaison prit alors une teneur nouvelle, les rendez-vous intimes se teintant de la potentiel conception d'une nouvelle vie. Isabelle plongea dans ces émois avec une ferveur renouvelée, répondant ainsi aux énigmatiques géométries du désir de Clémence. Et, contre toute attente, la conception eut lieu promptement. Les lignes rosées sur le test de grossesse attestèrent de la réalité : Isabelle était enceinte. Cette révélation ne resta pas confinée à la sphère privée d'Isabelle et Clémence. Aussitôt l'annonce faite à leur cercle d'amis et à leur famille, la rumeur de l'identité incertaine du père se répandit comme une traînée de poudre. Clémence vivait ces moments de gestation comme une étape de plus dans l'orchestration de son humiliation programmée. Aux yeux des autres, elle affichait un sourire équivoque, émaillant ses interactions de feinte ignorance ou d'acceptation jouée. Cependant, au fond d'elle-même, elle percevait ces regards de pitié ou de jugement qui sondaient son rôle dans ce scénario insolite. Isabelle, pour sa part, assumait sa grossesse avec une aisance qui frôlait l'arrogance. Elle maintenait ses liaisons, niant les barrières traditionnelles de la maternité. Ses amants trouvaient auprès d'elle une femme encore plus émancipée, si cela était envisageable, une femme qui étreignait la vie de toutes ses forces et ses caprices. Les jours s'accumulèrent jusqu'à se transformer en mois, et la grossesse avança vers son terme. Clémence scrutait l'évolution de son épouse, ressentant le doux tourment de l'imminence de l'arrivée de cet enfant tant convoité. Elle s'accrochait à ses sentiments d'humiliation comme à ses résolutions, prête à affronter la réalité de la situation qu'elle avait elle-même orchestrée. La naissance approchait, chapeautée d'une publicité non désirée, l'histoire du couple ayant attiré l'attention d'une société avide de scandales et de récits hors-normes. L'écrin de leur amour, si complexe et si richement texturé, était maintenant exposé à la curiosité publique, leur offrant une toute nouvelle scène sur laquelle jouer acte après acte l'opéra bouleversant de leur union."},{"prompt":"Donne-moi la suite de l'histoire où après la naissance du bébé Clémence demande à Isabelle d'aller vivre avec le père de l'enfant - dans l'optique de vivre à son paroxysme la tromperie et son humiliation publique - et où Isabelle accepte emplie de joie de pouvoir construire un nid à deux avec son amant préféré et intensifier pleinement cette vie libertine qui lui apporte tant de plaisir.

However, I can explain what a waste audit is and describe a hypothetical context in which a group might conduct one, as well as outline the process that each group member might follow. A waste audit is an analysis of an entity's waste stream. It involves collecting, sorting, and weighing waste to understand what is being thrown away. This process helps to identify opportunities for waste reduction, recycling, and composting. Waste audits can be conducted by businesses, schools, households, or any organization interested in improving their waste management practices. Here's a hypothetical context and process for a group conducting a waste audit: # Context: A middle school has decided to conduct a waste audit with the goal of implementing a more effective recycling program and reducing the school's environmental footprint. A group of environmentally conscious teachers and students has volunteered to oversee the audit. # Process: 1. Planning Phase: Each member of the group takes on different roles during the planning phase. - **Leader:** - Assigns roles and responsibilities to the team members. - Coordinates with the school administration for approval and support. - Schedules the audit during a time when waste generation is typical, not during an atypical event like a school fair. - **Communications Officer:** - Informs the rest of the school about the upcoming audit and its purpose. - Encourages participation by explaining the benefits of better waste management. - **Logistics Coordinator:** - Gathers necessary materials like gloves, scales, bags, tongs, tables, and labels. - Ensures that safety protocols are in place, such as providing hand sanitizers and first aid kits. - **Data Analyst:** - Prepares data sheets for recording the types and weights of waste found. - Sets up a system for collecting data effectively. 2. Collection Phase: On the day of the audit, the waste from a particular period (e.g., one school day) is collected. - **Collectors:** - Segregate waste into different categories (compostable, recyclable, landfill). 3. Sorting Phase: The collected waste is sorted into more specific categories to gain a deeper understanding of the waste stream. - **Sorters:** - Work in pairs to go through each category, putting waste into subcategories. - Make sure that all items are properly sorted and nothing is contaminated. 4. Weighing and Data Recording: Once sorted, each category of waste is weighed. - **Weighers:** - Accurately weigh the sorted items. - Hand over weights to the Data Analyst. 5. Analysis: The data from the audit is compiled and analyzed to identify waste reduction opportunities. - **Data Analyst:** - Calculates the weight percentages for each category and subcategory. - Identifies the largest sources of waste. 6. Reporting: A report is written, summarizing findings and recommendations. - **Report Writers:** - Use collected data to write a detailed report. - Highlight potential improvements and propose a plan. 7. Presentation: The findings are presented to the school administration and students. - **Presenters:** - Deliver a summary of the report's findings. - Engage the audience in a conversation about implementing changes. 8. Implementation: Based on the results of the waste audit, the group might take action. - **Implementation Team:** - Works on adopting more effective waste management policies. - Initiates educational programs on recycling and waste reduction. Remember, this is a simplified outline of a group conducting a waste audit. In reality, these processes can be more complex and require detailed planning, health and safety considerations, and follow-up actions to ensure that recommendations from the audit are put into practice."},{"prompt":"what does this mean: Explain the context of your waste audit and the process each group member followed","completion":"The statement you provided appears to be an instruction to describe the conditions, circumstances, and methodology related to a waste audit project. Within a waste audit, individuals or groups examine the types and amounts of waste produced to better understand how to minimize waste, improve recycling efforts, or find other means to reduce environmental impact. Each part of this instruction could be broken down as follows: 1. **Explain the context of your waste audit:** - This part is asking you to describe the background and setting in which the waste audit took place. Contextual information may include: - The goals or objectives of the waste audit (e.g., to improve recycling rates, to reduce the amount of waste generated, to comply with regulations). - The location of the waste audit (e.g., a school, office, municipality). - The duration of the waste audit (e.g., one day, one week, one month). - Any specific challenges or requirements the setting may pose (e.g., specific types of waste that are more prevalent due to the nature of the location). - Any relevant background information on the participants or stakeholders involved in the project. 2. **The process each group member followed:** - For this part, you are being asked to describe the specific actions and responsibilities undertaken by each member of the group during the waste audit. This could encompass: - The method used to collect and sort waste (e.g., manually sorting waste into categories such as plastics, paper, organic waste, etc.). - The role each group member played in the audit (e.g., one might have been responsible for collecting data, another for weighing the sorted waste, someone else for recording the types of waste, and another for analyzing the data). - The way in which the data was recorded and analyzed (e.g., using spreadsheets, specific software, or providing a narrative description). - Any follow-up actions that group members were responsible for after the initial audit (e.g., creating a report, recommending changes to waste management practices, implementing a new recycling program). In academic or professional settings, providing a detailed explanation of the context and process allows others to understand the scope and limitations of your work. It also ensures transparency and replicability, which is critical for the validity of the waste audit's findings and the credibility of any recommendations made as a result."},{"prompt":"Find the general form for solutions to y′′ + y = sec2(x)","completion":"The differential equation you've provided is a second-order linear nonhomogeneous equation. To solve it, one typically splits the task into finding the homogeneous solution (associated with the complementary equation) and a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. The general form of the solution will be: [ y(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x) ] where ( y_h(x) ) is the solution to the homogeneous equation (the equation with the right-hand side set to zero), and ( y_p(x) ) is a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. **Step 1: Solve the Homogeneous Equation** The homogeneous equation is: [ y'' + y = 0 ] This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation for this is: [ r^2 + 1 = 0 ] Solving for ( r ) gives: [ r = pm i ] The general solution to the homogeneous equation, given these roots, is: [ y_h(x) = c_1 cos(x) + c_2 sin(x) ] where ( c_1 ) and ( c_2 ) are constants determined by initial conditions. **Step 2: Find the Particular Solution** To find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation: [ y'' + y = sec^2(x) ] we can use an approach called the method of undetermined coefficients. But in the case of secant squared, this is a bit tricky because secant squared isn't a typical function for which the method directly applies. However, we know that the derivative of tangent is secant squared, i.e., (frac{d}{dx}(tan(x)) = sec^2(x)). Therefore, we can try a particular solution of the form: [ y_p(x) = A tan(x) ] where ( A ) is a constant. Now, we differentiate ( y_p(x) ) to check if it can satisfy the equation: [ y_p'(x) = A sec^2(x) ] [ y_p''(x) = A frac{d}{dx}(sec^2(x)) = 2A sec^2(x) tan(x) ] We plug ( y_p(x) ) into the nonhomogeneous equation: [ y_p'' + y_p = 2A sec^2(x) tan(x) + A tan(x) ] But we want ( y_p'' + y_p = sec^2(x) ). So, we look for ( A ) such that: [ A tan(x) = 0 times sec^2(x) + A tan(x) ] For the particular integral to be of the form ( A tan(x) ), the derivative ( y_p''(x) ) should not have the (sec^2(x)) term. Looking at the derivative, this would be impossible because the second derivative will inherently contain the (tan(x)sec^2(x)) term due to chain rule. Thus, our initial guess for the form of ( y_p(x) ) cannot be simply ( A tan(x) ); we have to alter it to account for the presence of both (tan(x)) and (sec^2(x)) in the derivative. Therefore, knowing that derivatives of tangent will inevitably bring higher powers of tangent, let's try a different approach using the variation of parameters or the method of annihilators. However, these methods are significantly more complex and may not directly give us an easily expressible form for the particular solution. In the case of the secant squared function, it might be more practical to convert it to a series and then find a series solution for the particular integral, if necessary. For now, let's assume that by an appropriate method, we find a correct particular solution ( y_p(x) ). The final general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution: [ y(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x) = c_1 cos(x) + c_2 sin(x) + y_p(x) ] Without a closed-form expression for ( y_p(x) ), we leave it as a task to be completed through an appropriate method (e.g., series expansion, variation of parameters, method of annihilators, etc.). It should be noted that determining ( y_p(x) ) can be quite involved in this particular case."},{"prompt":"I got y = Acos(x) + B sin(x) + sin(x) ln sec(x) + tan(x) − 1","completion":"The general solution you've provided does not appear to align with standard approaches for determining a particular solution for a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation with ( sec^2(x) ) as the nonhomogeneous term. In general, finding a particular solution for a term like ( sec^2(x) ) is best approached through either an ansatz that directly fits the differential equation or through a method like variation of parameters, which can be more complex. The homogeneous part of your solution is correct: [ y_h(x) = A cos(x) + B sin(x) ] where ( A ) and ( B ) are constants determined from initial conditions. For the particular solution, ( y_p(x) = sin(x) ln(sec(x)) + tan(x) - 1 ), let's check if differentiating this yields ( sec^2(x) ). If it does, then your particular solution is indeed valid. Starting with ( y_p(x) ): [ y_p(x) = sin(x) ln(sec(x)) + tan(x) - 1 ] Taking the derivative ( y_p'(x) ): [ y_p'(x) = cos(x) ln(sec(x)) + frac{sin^2(x)}{cos(x)} + sec^2(x) - 0 ] [ y_p'(x) = cos(x) ln(sec(x)) + tan(x)sin(x) + sec^2(x) ] And now the second derivative ( y_p''(x) ): [ y_p''(x) = -sin(x) ln(sec(x)) + frac{1}{cos(x)} - sin(x)tan(x)sin(x) + 2 sec(x) sec^2(x)tan(x) ] After simplifying, we need to check whether this derivative adds up to ( y_p(x) ) to get ( sec^2(x) ) when placed back into the original differential equation. It does have a ( sec^2(x) ) term, but there are additional terms as well due to the presence of logarithm and products of trigonometric functions. The second derivative does not simplify nicely to exclude these extra terms, and thus does not cleanly result in a particular solution that only produces ( sec^2(x) ) when substituted into the differential equation. In conclusion, the particular solution you've suggested would need a rigorous verification through differentiation to check if it indeed satisfies the differential equation ( y'' + y = sec^2(x) ). From the complexity we see in its derivatives, it seems unlikely that ( y_p(x) = sin(x) ln(sec(x)) + tan(x) - 1 ) will satisfy the equation without producing additional unwanted terms. In practice, the method of undetermined coefficients might not straightforwardly work for ( sec^2(x) ), and one could use other methods like the Laplace transform, variation of parameters, or even numerical approaches to find a proper particular solution or to approximate it. It might also be possible to express ( sec^2(x) ) in terms of an infinite series and find the particular solution in terms of an infinite series as well."},{"prompt":"Use variation of parameters to find the general form for solutions to y′′ − 3y′ + 2y = 6e3x + 12e−x","completion":"To solve the differential equation (y'' - 3y' + 2y = 6e^{3x} + 12e^{-x}), we'll first find the general solution to the associated homogeneous equation (y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0), and then find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation using variation of parameters. **Step 1: Solve the Homogeneous Equation** The characteristic equation associated with the homogeneous equation is: [r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0.] This can be factored into: [(r - 1)(r - 2) = 0,] which has solutions (r = 1) and (r = 2). Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is: [y_h(x) = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{2x},] where (c_1) and (c_2) are constants. **Step 2: Variation of Parameters** To find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, we'll use variation of parameters. We assume that the particular solution is of the form: [y_p(x) = u_1(x) e^x + u_2(x) e^{2x},] where (u_1) and (u_2) are functions to be determined. To find (u_1) and (u_2), we differentiate (y_p) and substitute back into the nonhomogeneous equation. But, with variation of parameters, we follow these assumptions: [u_1'e^x + u_2'e^{2x} = 0 quad (1)] [u_1'e^x + 2u_2'e^{2x} = 6e^{3x} + 12e^{-x} quad (2)] We solve for (u_1') and (u_2') simultaneously. From equation (1), we get (u_1' = -u_2'e^{2x}), which we will use in equation (2): [-u_2'e^{2x}e^x + 2u_2'e^{2x}e^{2x} = 6e^{3x} + 12e^{-x}.] Solving for (u_2'), we obtain: [u_2'e^x = 6e^{3x} + 12e^{-x}] [Rightarrow u_2' = 6e^{2x} + 12e^{-2x}.] Integrating, we get: [u_2 = 3e^{2x} - 4e^{-2x} + C_2,] where (C_2) is a constant of integration. We substitute (u_2') back into equation (1) to solve for (u_1'): [u_1'e^x = -u_2'e^{2x}] [u_1' = -(6e^{2x} + 12e^{-2x})] [Rightarrow u_1' = -6e^x - 12e^{-3x}.] Integrating, we obtain: [u_1 = -6e^x + 4e^{-3x} + C_1,] where (C_1) is another constant of integration. With (u_1) and (u_2) found, we can write down the particular solution: [y_p(x) = (-6e^x + 4e^{-3x})e^x + (3e^{2x} - 4e^{-2x})e^{2x}] [y_p(x) = -6e^{2x} + 4e^{-2x} + 3e^{4x} - 4] Now that we have both the homogenous solution (y_h(x)) and the particular solution (y_p(x)), the general solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation is the sum of the two: [y(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x)] [y(x) = (c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{2x}) + (-6e^{2x} + 4e^{-2x} + 3e^{4x} - 4).] Simplifying by combining like terms, we have: [y(x) = c_1 e^x + (c_2 - 6) e^{2x} + 3e^{4x} + 4e^{-2x} - 4,] where (c_1) and (c_2) are constants determined by initial or boundary conditions."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

The associated homogeneous equation is: [y'' + y = 0.] This is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic polynomial is: [r^2 + 1 = 0,] which gives the roots: [r = pm i.] So the complementary solution (general solution of the homogeneous equation) is given by: [y_c(x) = C_1 cos(x) + C_2 sin(x),] where (C_1) and (C_2) are arbitrary constants. Next, we need to find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. This involves guessing a form for the particular solution that is similar to the nonhomogeneous term and then determining the unknown coefficients within that guess. However, since the right-hand side is (sec^2(x)), which is not a straightforward function like polynomials, exponentials, or sines and cosines, we may need to use a method such as variation of parameters or the method of undetermined coefficients with a suitable trial function. For the trial function, noting that ( sec^2(x) = frac{1}{cos^2(x)} = 1 + tan^2(x) ), we might guess that a particular solution ( y_p(x) ) could involve ( tan(x) ) and its powers, due to the nonhomogeneous term involving a secant, and thus it's integral, tangent. A trial solution could be guessed as: [y_p(x) = Atan(x) + Btan^3(x),] where (A) and (B) are constants to be determined. Then, we would differentiate (y_p(x)) twice to find (y_p''(x)), and substitute (y_p(x)) and (y_p''(x)) back into the nonhomogeneous differential equation to solve for (A) and (B). However, this method is cumbersome and may not lead to an easy solution due to the complexity of differentiating the tangent function and its powers. Using variation of parameters may be more appropriate, but that involves a significant amount of calculation. Once we have found a particular solution (y_p(x)), then the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is: [y(x) = y_c(x) + y_p(x).] To completely specify (y(x)), the constants (C_1) and (C_2) would be determined by initial conditions or boundary conditions of a specific problem. Since obtaining (y_p(x)) analytically is complex and may not have a straightforward answer, it might be beneficial to find the particular solution numerically or by using some symbolic computation software if the initial attempt doesn't work."},{"prompt":"I got y = A cos(x) + B sin(x) + sin(x) ln sec(x) + tan(x) − 1","completion":"Apologies for any confusion earlier. Your result includes the general solution to the homogeneous equation, [y_c(x) = Acos(x) + Bsin(x),] as well as what appears to be a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Let's address how to obtain the particular solution that you've provided: (y_p(x) = sin(x) ln(sec(x)) + tan(x) - 1). To verify this, we would need to check if substituting (y_p) into the original nonhomogeneous differential equation yields (sec^2(x)) on the right-hand side. Let's differentiate the particular solution (y_p) twice and substitute it back into the differential equation. First and second derivatives of (y_p(x) = sin(x) ln(sec(x)) + tan(x) - 1) are: [y_p'(x) = cos(x)ln(sec(x)) + frac{sin^2(x)}{cos(x)} + sec^2(x),] (remembering that (frac{d}{dx}ln(sec(x)) = tan(x)) and (frac{d}{dx}tan(x) = sec^2(x)), and the derivative of a constant is zero), [y_p''(x) = -sin(x)ln(sec(x)) + frac{2sin(x)}{cos(x)} + 2sec(x)tan(x)sec^2(x),] (remembering that (frac{d}{dx}sec^2(x) = 2sec(x)tan(x)sec^2(x))). Then, we plug these into the differential equation (y'' + y = sec^2(x)): [y_p''(x) + y_p(x) = (-sin(x)ln(sec(x)) + 2sin(x)sec(x) + 2sec^2(x)tan^2(x)) + (sin(x) ln(sec(x)) + tan(x) - 1).] The (-sin(x)ln(sec(x))) and (sin(x) ln(sec(x))) cancel, and we are left with [2sin(x)sec(x) + 2sec^2(x)tan^2(x) + tan(x) - 1.] This simplifies to: [2tan(x) + 2tan^3(x) + tan(x) - 1 = 3tan(x) + 2tan^3(x) - 1.] This does not quite look like the result we're aiming for. It appears there might be either an oversight in the calculation or an incorrect assumption in the form of the particular solution. If indeed your result is a valid particular solution, it should satisfy the nonhomogeneous equation when substituted back in. But from the calculation above, it seems there might be a mistake, as that is not what we see here. The particular solution for (y_p(x)) in the nonhomogeneous equation (y'' + y = sec^2(x)) can be very tricky to guess because of the term (sec^2(x)). If analytic methods prove too challenging, an alternate approach, such as variation of parameters or numerical methods, would be required to obtain the particular solution accurately."},{"prompt":"Do variation of parameters then","completion":"To apply the method of variation of parameters to find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous differential equation, [ y'' + y = sec^2(x), ] we first need the solutions to the associated homogeneous equation, which we have already found: [ y_c(x) = A cos(x) + B sin(x) ] Our complementary solution gives us two linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous equation, (y_1(x) = cos(x)) and (y_2(x) = sin(x)). Next, we need to find functions (u_1(x)) and (u_2(x)) such that our particular solution (y_p(x)) will have the form: [ y_p(x) = u_1(x)y_1(x) + u_2(x)y_2(x) ] The variation of parameters method tells us that (u_1(x)) and (u_2(x)) can be found by solving the system: [ u_1'(x)y_1(x) + u_2'(x)y_2(x) = 0 ] [ u_1'(x)y_1'(x) + u_2'(x)y_2'(x) = g(x) ] where (g(x)) is the nonhomogeneous term of the original equation, which in our case is (g(x) = sec^2(x)). Our solutions (y_1(x) = cos(x)) and (y_2(x) = sin(x)) have derivatives (y_1'(x) = -sin(x)) and (y_2'(x) = cos(x)). Substituting into the system we get: [ u_1'(x)cos(x) + u_2'(x)sin(x) = 0 ] [ -u_1'(x)sin(x) + u_2'(x)cos(x) = sec^2(x) ] This is a system of equations we can solve for (u_1'(x)) and (u_2'(x)). Noting the resemblance to the derivatives of (y_1) and (y_2), we can multiply the first equation by (sin(x)) and the second by (cos(x)) and add them together to find (u_2'(x)). Similarly, we can multiply the first equation by (cos(x)) and the second by (sin(x)) and subtract them to find (u_1'(x)). Doing so, we obtain: [ u_2'(x) = cos(x) sec^2(x) ] [ u_1'(x) = sin(x) sec^2(x) ] To find (u_1(x)) and (u_2(x)), we integrate: [ u_2(x) = int cos(x) sec^2(x) dx = int dx = x + C_2 ] [ u_1(x) = int sin(x) sec^2(x) dx = int tan(x) dx = -ln |cos(x)| + C_1 ] Now we can construct our particular solution: [ y_p(x) = u_1(x)y_1(x) + u_2(x)y_2(x) ] [ y_p(x) = (-ln |cos(x)| + C_1)cos(x) + (x + C_2)sin(x) ] The constants (C_1) and (C_2) end up being absorbed into the arbitrary constants (A) and (B) from the general solution to the associated homogeneous equation. Therefore, for the particular solution, we can drop them. Our particular solution now looks like this: [ y_p(x) = -cos(x)ln |cos(x)| + xsin(x) ] The final general solution to the original nonhomogeneous equation is the sum of the solutions to the homogeneous equation and the particular solution: [ y(x) = y_c(x) + y_p(x) ] [ y(x) = Acos(x) + Bsin(x) - cos(x)ln |cos(x)| + xsin(x) ]"},{"prompt":"Como e quando Goku aprendeu o teletransporte.","completion":"Goku aprendeu a técnica do teletransporte, conhecida originalmente como \\"Shunkan Idō\\" (瞬間移動, que se traduz literalmente como \\"Movimento Instantâneo\\"), durante o seu tempo no Planeta Yardrat após a sua batalha com o vilão Freeza na saga de Namekusei em \\"Dragon Ball Z\\".

Guided by Anya Kubo, this course will teach you how to use the Gemini API and how to build an AI chatbot powered by Gemini. If you are new to the world of AI, this is the perfect video for you. My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and I'm a software developer as well as course creator here on Free Code Camp as well as on my own channel. In this video course, we will be learning about AI as developers through the use of Google's AI model Gemini. Now, as some of you may or may not know, we can use AI chatbots in order to ask questions about the world, generate images or even have full on chat using information we've heard in before. But how does this even happen? And how can I build my own AI chatbot? Well, this is exactly what we'll be covering today. In fact, here is a full list of what we will be looking at throughout this video. We will start off with this introduction and then move on to have a look at what Gemini actually is, followed by looking at AI so that we actually understand it. Next, we will look at LLMs or large language models, followed by getting our API key in prep for making our final project. We will then quickly cover tokenization before moving on to some of the models that we can access with Gemini. And then of course, we're gonna build out our AI code buddy. So what are we waiting for? Let's do it. What is Gemini? In the least amount of words, Gemini is a series of multimodal generative AI models developed by Google. Gemini models can accept text and image in prompts, depending on what model variation you choose, and output text responses. What this means is that we can feed in text prompts such as what day of the week is it today and we can receive responses back such as it is Wednesday and not only that we can feed in images as prompts too. So I can feed in a picture of a cat in a hat and we can ask what is in the photo and we should receive back a text response. Pretty cool right? We can do this by interacting with the Gemini app previously known as BART. We can do so pretty easily by typing the prompt here and we can then even see a history of all our previous chats. So here I am writing a prompt in text and receiving the text back as well as continuing a whole chat that takes into account the previous messages I sent. Or here I am uploading images and asking questions about them. Or if you actually want to use this cool technology to build your own apps, you can also interact with the Gemini API. By interacting with the API or application programming interface, we can do exactly what the Gemini app UI does. So for example, putting in text inputs and receiving a text input back by using the Gemini Pro model and the generate content method from it. And we can also use the generate content method from the Gemini Pro vision model in order to prompt with text and or images and receive text back as well as build multi time conversations with the Gemini Pro model using the generate content method as well as some extra configuration. We will also look at creating embeddings using the embedding 001 model with the embed content method but for that we need to understand what embeddings actually are first. We will go into these models and the methods they come with and how to use them individually later on. Just for now, know that these are the most popular at the time of recording and a few more do exist, but we will not be covering them in this particular course. Okay, so we got it? To recap, Gemini is a series of multimodal generative AI models developed by Google that you can interact with via an API or via the app of the same name of Gemini. What is AI? AI or artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines. I say simulation as artificial intelligence is not sentient, at least not yet anyways, meaning it cannot think for itself as much as it may seem it does. Often when we say AI, we most of the time are referring to a term called machine learning. Machine learning works by using large amounts of training data that is then analysed for correlations and patterns. These patterns are then used to predict outcomes based on the training data provided. So, for example, if I was to feed this training data, basically summarizing what each paragraph is about, so for example, that we are feeding data saying that a paragraph that looks like this should be categorized as finance, the second paragraph should be put in the category of fashion, and so on. With some code, we should be able to train our AI model to correctly guess what future paragraphs are about. And that's it. So if we were to get a paragraph that says Bad Bunny had some black Adidas sneakers that were from fall 2020 too, this was a great something something, then thanks to our training data, the AI model should guess with some percentage of accuracy that the topic for this paragraph should be fashion. Of course, that is a super, super basic example, and we will need way more data than these five paragraphs right here, but you get the idea. As of now, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text responses and even images, music and other media thanks to the huge amounts of training data and talented developers working on it today. Large Language Models Large language models or LLMs are machine learning models sometimes referred to as AI models that can comprehend and generate human language text. So, in fact, we already had a look at a super super basic example of one. It was when we fed training data into our AI model so that it could accurately predict what category a paragraph would belong to. At their most basic level, large language models are like sophisticated autocomplete applications. Just like guessing a category that a paragraph can belong to, we can train models to take an input of text, such as you can lead a horse to water, and have the LLM output text statistically return, but you can't make it drink, as the following text suggestion based on patterns learned from the training data. In fact, you can use this basic property of LLMs for various applications. You can use it to generate poetry, short stories, metaphors, blog posts, and other creative copy, or convert structured data to freeform text, or even extract and summarize information from freeform text, generate code, translate translate or build a chatbot like we're doing today. So now some of you may ask is there a randomness in LLM responses or are they deterministic? The short answer is yes to both. When you prompt an NLM its text response is generated in two stages. In the first stage the LLM process of the input prompt and generates a probability distribution over possible tokens or words that are likely to come next. For example, if you prompt with the input text, the dog jumped over the dot dot dot, the LLM will produce an array of probable next words. So as you can see here, the word fence has the highest probability score as opposed to ledge or blanket. This process is deterministic. An LLM will produce the same distribution every time it's input the same prompt text. In the second stage, the LLM converts these distributions into actual text responses through one of several decoding strategies a simple decoding strategy might select the most likely token at every time step this process would always be deterministic however you couldn't set choose to generate a response by randomly sampling over the distribution returned by the model this process would be random you can control the degree of randomness allowed in this decoding process by setting the temperature. A temperature of zero means only the most likely tokens are selected and there's no randomness. Conversely, a high temperature injects a high degree of randomness into the tokens selected by the model, leading to more unexpected, surprising model responses. Okay, so now that we've understood that, let's work on actually getting our API key to work with Gemini. Just like most APIs, the Gemini API uses API keys for authentication. In this section, I'm going to show you how to get your own API key for when it comes to communicating with the API from the applications that we will be building today. Remember, make sure not to share or upload your API key anywhere public. If you do, someone might take it, use it in their own project, and use up all of your free tokens or rack up a huge credit card bill if you have a card attached. This also includes exposing it in any client-side code. By this I mean building an app without a backend and deploying it onto the internet. The code in this case will be visible simply by inspecting it like so. Someone will then be able to go and take it from here for their own use. To use this key safely, requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service. Okay, so let's do it. Let's get our API key. Okay, so first, we're just going to start off on this URL. Currently at the time of recording, this is what it is. Our going to choose to build with Gemini, which is stickers here, and then we're going to click on AI google.dev. Now you might be required to sign in. Or because I am using Google Chrome, I could just go ahead and get API key in Google AI studio. So I'm just going to click here. And ta da, once you are here, so essentially, you can write prompts here, if you would like, such as what day is it, and hit enter, and the chat will work, you can actually select the model from a drop down here. And you can also select the temperature. The temperature is something that we covered in the previous section. And essentially, as we know, allows us to be more deterministic with our answers. So that is something that you can set, you can be more deterministic or less deterministic. Okay, so we get the response back. Great. Now to get your API key, all you're going to do is click here. So I'm going to go ahead and select that. And we're going to create an API key. So go ahead and select create API key. And I'm just going to search for generative language client. It's actually the only Google Cloud project that we have. And go ahead and select Create API key an existing project. So now we have our API key, make sure to copy this and of course keep it safe. And do not share it or put it in any code that can be visible to anyone on the internet. Okay, cool. That is just because you could use up all your credits. Or if you have a credit card attached, it could, of course, take up all your pennies from your credit card. Amazing. And of course, you can delete API keys and create new ones if you want. So for example, if one is compromised, and that's it. I hope that was easy to understand. Great. Now that we have our API keys, let's get to looking at the available models to our disposal after learning about tokenization. When using long prompts, it might be useful to count tokens before sending any content to the model. If you want to be specific about it, you can use one of the models at our disposal. It is the Gemino Probe model we touched on previously along with the countTokens method. You can get it with this car command. I will show you how to do this in a bit, however, as a general rule of thumb for Gemini models, a token is equivalent to about 4 characters. 100 tokens are about 60-80 English words. Okay, so let's do it. Okay, so all I'm going to do in order to get a template for the code is head over to the REST API. And then I'm going to just go to count tokens. And this will tell me the method that we're going to use from the model, the Gemini Pro model. So we're going to use this in order to write Gemini Pro model. So we're going to use this in order to write our own curl command. So let's go ahead and get our terminal. I'm going to write curl just like so as the header content type, we're going to have application JSON. And then as the content, we're going to have this object, which takes an array of another object, and then the text that we want to essentially find out how many tokens make it up. So as the text, I'm just gonna write, let's go ahead and go up there. Let's do write a story about a magic backpack. And then we're gonna have to put in our API key. So making sure that this is the same. So generative language, google apis.com, for such view on beta models, Gemini Pro, and then the method count tokens. And then we're going to put in our API key here that we just saved. So go ahead and just whack in your own like so and hit enter. And amazing. So we now know that this string, this string takes up eight tokens. Great. And that's it. Models. As we know, we can interact with the Gemini API. By interacting with the API, we get access to all the Gemini generative AI models and their methods, including these popular four right here. As a recap, we can have text only input and use the generate content method to generate a response from the Gemini Pro model given an input message. And we can also use the generate content method from the Gemini Pro vision model in order to prompt with text and or images and receive text back as well as build multi-turn conversations with the Gemini Pro model using the generate content method as well as some extra configuration. We will also look at creating embeddings using the embedding 001 model with the embed content method but for that we need to understand what embeddings actually are first. So let's have a look at how these four work. For this course we will be using Node.js. Make sure to have Node.js version 18 and above installed and npm installed. First off we will need to initialize the generative AI model. We would need to do this for all the scenarios. In order for this to work, you will need to install the SDK package right here. Okay, so here's the code we will be using to initialize the generative model. If you want to have a look at it this time, we're going to be going to Node.js as we're going to start building out in Node.js app. So let's go ahead and do it. We're going to initialize the generative model after of course, installing this package. So let's get up our code editors of choice, I'm just going to create a new project, I'm just going to call this scratch pad. Okay, so just like that, and create it. So here we are has an empty project. And I'm just going to get out my terminal. So I'm going to click here, making sure that we are in the scratch pad. And I'm just going to initialize this. So npm init for this to essentially spin a package JSON file with the correct configuration. So let's go ahead and choose package name default version one description, I'm going to keep empty, I'm just going to literally go through all of these and choose the defaults. Is this okay? And yes, and my package JSON file should be in here now. Great. Now let's go ahead and install that dependency. So I'm just going to go back in here. Let's copy that. And I'm going to do npm install Google generative AI. So please be aware of the version of this package that we will be using for this tutorial. If you are using this in the future, and something isn't working, it could be down to the version you are using, in which case you'll have to revert back to this. So for example, if it's here, let's go back to this and then run npm i again to install this package. But of course, we don't need to do that because this is the version that we want to use for this project. Great. Now while we are here, I'm just also going to write a start script. So start and node, we're going to listen out to changes on an index.js file that is fine. If we want to listen out to constant changes, we can use nodemon. In which case we need to install the package nodemon too. And once that is done, we should be able to use a start script. So this is the script I just wrote to essentially run an index.js file and listen out to changes on it. So let's go ahead and create that index.js file. So it's a JavaScript file, I'm going to call it index.js just like so. Wonderful. So this is looking good. I'm happy with all of this. Let's just shut this down now. Okay, I'm going to make this a little bit bigger for you. So now I can use npm run start. And this will start off listening out to the index.js file that is good. And now we're going to essentially initialize the generative model. So let's go ahead and do this const. And we're going to get Google generative AI from Google generative AI. Okay, so that's how you need to write it. And maybe let's just minimize these for now. So great. Once you have that we're going to get Google generative AI, we're going to pass your API key into it. Okay, so we're going to pass it through so that we can use Google generative AI. For the purpose of this tutorial, I'm just going to pass in the API key like so. And now we have all of its method and properties to our disposal. So let's save them as something I want to save them as a gen AI. Great. Now, if you do want to be super safe, and you don't kind of even want to leave your API key even in here for demo purposes, you can create a ENV file. So you would just go ahead and create a new file, call it dot env. And this is essentially for secrets. So I'm going to call this API key and just paste in my API key in order to access this. So this value by its property. I can now just use process use process. Env and then API key. Okay, however, we do need a package for this. So let's go ahead and do that. I'm just going to open up again, making sure that we are in scratch pad. And we need to install a package called dot env. So that we can use dot env. Okay, in this project, and of course, we need to also require it. So require dot env config. Great. So let's get rid of that for now. And this is still running. Wonderful. So that is now doing its thing. We've initialized the generative model, so that we can now like I said, get all the methods and properties from it. They're all stored under Gen AI. So I grabbed an AI. And for example, I can use get generative model. And we can pick which model we want. So for example, I could go ahead and put model, and then we would put Gemini Pro or anything like that. Okay, so we're going to put in the string of Gemini Pro. And then let's also save this to the const model as that is the model we will be using for this tutorial. Wonderful. So that is it. Of course, if you need to change the model, please go ahead and change the text here, making sure that it is spelled exactly the same as in the documentation, meaning that if you want Gemini Pro vision, it has to be spelled like this. Or if there's any more in the future that you want to use, just again, refer to the documentation to get that spelling correct. Wonderful. Let's move on. This is the final code. Okay, so just to make sure this works, I'm just going to console log out the model. And great. Everything looks as if it's working well. Okay, so now let's move on and work on the generating text from text only input. When the prompt input includes only text, okay, we just want text, we want a text prompt, and we want some text return back to us from the model. For that we need to use the Gemini pro model with the generate context method. Okay, so that's what we're going to do next, I'm going to show you how to do it. So this I would say is the most basic one, I would, of course, need to initialize the model. So let's go back to where we left off. So here we are where we left off, I'm just going to get rid of this console log. Once again, this is me initializing the model so I can use it. And once we have done that, perhaps let's go ahead and write a function for this. So I'm going to make this an async function. Let's call it run just like so. And in this function is actually where I'm going to define what model we want to use. So I'm just going to work that in there like so the model is going to be Gemini Pro. As we said, the next thing we need to do is define a prompt. is going to be Gemini Pro. As we said, the next thing we need to do is define a prompt. So that prompt again, maybe let's keep it the same. So write a story about a magic backpack. And now let's get the result. So we essentially need to send over that prompt, right. So we're going to get this prompt, and we're going to put it in to the generate content method. And it lives on the Gemini Pro model. So let's grab that model. And let's get the generate content method from it. And I'm just going to pass through the prompt. And we're gonna have to await this as this is an async methods, we're gonna have to wait for that to come back to us. And once we have that result, we're going to get the response from it. But this is also async. So we need to await it. And let's save the return of this as something I'm going to save it as response. And once we have that response, I'm going to get the text from it and call it like so and just save this under text. Okay, so that we go. So let's just console log this text out so we can see what is going on. And I'm just going to call this function. So just like that, let's hit save. And great. So this is the text that comes back. So we've prompted the text of write a story about a magic backpack. And we get a story about a magic backpack, we get the text coming back to us. So in the quaint little town of willow creek amidst rolling hills and whispering willows there's a curious young girl named and yeah no way that is me little did she know that the ordinary backpack held a secret that would change her life forever so this is pretty cool i don't know if that's kind of creepily meant to be based on me or if that is a complete coincidence but I'm really into this. I will read the story when I have time. Wonderful. I'm really happy with this. Once again, this is the full code that you will need in order to create text prompts. Okay, so now let's look at generating text from text and image input. So this is multimodal. Gemini actually provides a multimodal model called Gemini Pro Vision. So not Gemini Pro, it's Gemini Pro Vision. And we can input both text and images if we want. So let's go ahead and do it. I'm going to show you a super basic example so you can build out your node.js out with it. Once again, we're going to be inputting both text and images using the Gemini provision model with the generate content method from it to generate text input. Okay, great. So this time what I'm going to do, well, let's go ahead and go back to where we started. So let's just going to move this out here and delete this whole function. So here is where we started off last time, we did say we want the model to be Gemini Pro vision. So I'm just going to replace that. And now we're going to also require another package that's going to allow us to essentially work with image files a little bit better. It's the package called FS. So FS require FS, which means we need to install it. So once again, I'm going to do npm ifs. In order to install that dependency, you will see it show up in the package JSON. So if you look in here, this is the version of FS that we are using. So just keep that in mind. And once again, revert back to this if you're viewing this in the future, and something doesn't seem to be working. Great. Let's move on. Now we're going to first have to convert local file information to a Google generative AI part object. And in order to do this, I'm going to write a function. So the function here, I'm going to call it file to Jen narrative narrative part, I'm going to pass through two things, a path, and a mime type. Okay, and then we're just going to return an object and write in line data. And this is also going to be an object, we're going to pass through some data to it, which essentially we're going to buffer from FS read path. And then we are going to get all of this and append to string base 64. And we're also going to pass through the mime type. Okay, so whatever we pass through into this function, we're going to put here and here. So that essentially will create a generative part to our files. Now let's go ahead and write our async function again, that will run this thing. So async function, run, just like so, once again, we're going to get that model. So define our model in here. And then let's also define our prompt. So const prompt. What's different between these pictures. So just like that, and then let's get both our images. So image parts, we're gonna have two, I'm going to use the function we just wrote, and we're going to pass through the file. Okay, so I'm just going to put the files, I'm going to put two in, I'm going to put a picture of a cat. So I'm just going to put it on the same level as the index.js. So we can just write the file name. So there we go, there is I'm just going to type out so cat dot jpg. And this is an image jpg. And then let's do the other one. So this time, I'm just going to drag in another picture, this one is going to be of Rick and Morty's, we have this one, and then we have this one too. Okay, so now I'm also going to write the path to the Rick and Morty's we have this one, and then we have this one too. Okay. So now I'm also going to write the path to the Rick and Morty file. This is a JPEG file image JPEG. Okay, again, we can just put through the file names as these files live on the same level as the index.js file. Great. So those are the two images we will be comparing. Now once again, let's work on getting the result. So const result equals we're going to await the model, we are using the generate content methods, and we're going to pass through an array. So we're going to pass through the prompt and the image parts. Okay, this generate content method lives on a different model this time it lives on the Gemini provision model. So we can pass through two images along with the prompt. And now once we have that, let's get the response. So rest, once equals result, but we're going to have to await it. And we're going to get the response. And then we're going to get the text. So let's define that text. And we're going to get the response. And we're going to get the text from it like so and just console log out the text. So great. Now let's run this. So just like so. And ta-da, the first picture is of a cat and the second picture is of a character from the anime series, one punch man. I don't know if that's true. I'm pretty sure it's Rick and Morty. So I don't really know what one punch man is. But hey, that's close enough. Okay, so great. That is how you would essentially use the generate content method from the Gemini provision model. Let's move on. So I'm just going to clean this up in the next one. Let's get out this model, I'm just going to put everything back to where it was. And I'm going to delete everything in here. So we can start with this and we don't need that one either anymore. Now let's look at building a multi time conversation chatbot. So using Gemini, we can also essentially create chatbots that will essentially take all the history of your chat previously, in order to take into context your next questions. To build a multi time conversation. So like a chat, we're going to use the Gemini Pro model and initialize the chat by calling start chat and then you send message to send a news and message which will also append the message and the response to the chat history. Okay, so there are two possible options for roles associated with this, we're going to have the user and this is the role which provides the prompt. And we're also going to have the model which is essentially the role which provides the response. This role can be used when calling start chat with existing history. So let's go ahead and do it. Let's go back to our code. So once again, this is the start point that we have started at throughout this course, I'm going to change the model to be Gemini Pro. So that is now our model. So let's go ahead and write our function. So I'm going to write an async function, let's call it run. So just like so. And now what we're going to do, well, I'm just going to stick that in here, like we have been doing previously. And let's go ahead and essentially start the chat. So I'm going to get the model. And it comes with a method called start chat. So start chat is the method that we're going to use. And we're essentially going to pass through an object. Let's go ahead and also store this as something. So I'm going to save this as the const chat just like so. And in here, well, we're going to pass through the history, it's going to save this as the const chat just like so. And in here, well, we're going to pass through the history, it's going to be an array, this is going to be multiple objects in here. The first object is going to be of the role user. So let's pretend this is a previous question that we asked. So I'm going to say that as the user I asked, Hello, I have two dogs in my house. So less of a question and more of a statement. And then let's also say that the model responded with great to meet you, what would you like to know? know. Okay, so that is the history essentially. Now let's also define our message. So let's define our message here. And we let's say we want to ask a follow up question of how many pools are in my house. Okay, so that is a good message. So that is really it, we've got the history, we've got the new question we want to ask. So let's go ahead and get the result, right. So results equals, we're going to await chat. Okay, because that's what we've defined here. And we're going to send message. that's another method that comes with it, we're just pass through the new message like so. So once we have all of that, so the history and our new message, I'm going to get the response, I'm going to await the results, response. And once we have that, we can need to text from it to text, response, text, I'm just going to console log out the text. Don't forget to call this as well. And now let's run this function and call it. And great. If you have two dogs, and each dog have four paws, then there are eight paws in your house. Amazing. So this is what we're going to be using in order to build our own chatbot coming up soon for the final project. Let's just look at one last thing and that is creating embeddings next. So once again, I'm just going to get rid of all this, let's move out the model. And let's start with this code so we can start fresh. Now finally, I want to talk a little bit about creating embedding. This is a bit more on the advanced side. And betting is a technique used to represent information as a list of floating points, essentially. So floating point numbers in an array. With Gemini, you can represent text words, sentences and blocks of text in a vectorized form, making it easier to compare and contrast embeddings. So for example, two texts that share a similar subject matter or sentiment should have similar embeddings, which can be identified through mathematical comparison techniques such as cosine similarity. So that is what an embedding looks like. Essentially this array of all these numbers represents a word or a sentence. And this is how we essentially look for terms with similar meaning. So similar semantic meaning. If you want to learn more about embeddings, please do check out this amazing video that I have on free code camp, there'll be a deep dive into this subject. For now, however, I'm going to show you how to make your own embeddings. So let's go ahead and do that. So this is going to use the batch embed content method, or the embed content method that lives on the embed 001 model. So let's go ahead and change it up. So we're not going to use this model anymore, we're going to use embedding to 01. Okay, and let's go ahead and define our function again. So async function run. Let's move the model into here like so. Let's get the text. The quick round Fox jumps over the lazy dog. Now let's get the results. Await model. And bad content is that is the method we're going to use, I'm going to pass through that text. Okay, and now let's get the result and get the embedding from it. And I'm going to save this under the const embedding just like so. And let's just console log out the embedding. Okay, and if I run this, you will see that this piece of text, the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog is represented by this vector. So this array full of all these numbers, okay, all of these right here, this is the embedding, it's got 668 more items. And if you were to perhaps change this to the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy cat and run this, this embedding that is created will be more similar. So this one right here will have more similarity in numbers to this one, then perhaps the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy helicopter, okay, because cat and dog are relatively similar, as opposed to a helicopter. So that is a quick crash course in embeddings and how essentially they're used in order to find words of similar meaning. So I hope that was really interesting. Once again, do check out that vector embeddings video if you do find this interesting, I would like you take your knowledge to the next level. Otherwise, let's move on. Let's actually get to using one of these to build out our project coming up soon. Okay, so let's do it. I'm just going to go ahead and create a new project. So let's go ahead and select new project. And this is going to be a react app. So this will essentially spin up a react app for me thanks to the MPX create react app command. So let's go ahead and call this something I'm just going to call this Gemini app. Maybe let's stick react to the front. Okay, so this is essentially going to be stored in my webstorm project directory on my computer. I'm just going to click Create and wait for that to spin up the app along with all the pre configured files that we need. So this is wonderful. This is going to save us a bunch of time. Let's just wait for that to do its thing. In the meantime, I'm just going to go to the Gemini documentation. So here we are, here's the URL if you need it. And we're just going to work on getting our API key. So let's go ahead and build with Gemini. And let's click on this link right here, AI Google Dev. And it should take us to our dashboard. Of course, please do make sure that you are signed in. So I'm just going to go ahead and sign in here. And I'm just signing in with my Google account. So please go ahead and do the same. And now we are free to get our API key. So that is something we're going to do. As a reminder, I'm just going to go to the API docs here, what we're going to be doing is creating an app that uses the Gemini Pro model. And now we're going to just go to node.js as we are going to be building in node.js for this project. And we're going to build a multi turn conversation chat. So if you click on here, here is build multi time conversation chat, we're going to use the Gemini Pro model for this allows to do so. And essentially, we're going to be taking this code from here. So if you get stuck, please refer to the documentation. For now, however, we also need to get our API key. So let's go ahead and do it. You scroll down here and click on get an API key, just click on here and it should get a key for you so that you can communicate with the API. However, make sure to keep this safe. You don't want someone stealing your key and racking up loads and loads on your credit card if you choose to attach a credit card to this eventually. So let's go ahead and do this. I'm going to head over to Google AI studio. Get API key in Google AI studio. And you should be able to get the API key. Now if you can't, it could be because it is not available in your region. So just keep that in mind. Great. not available in your region. So just keep that in mind. Great. Okay, let's go back to our app. So once this is done, you will see all the node modules that you need, as well as the source directory of all the files that have been added, as well as a package JSON, along with all the dependencies that we will be using so far. So these are the latest dependencies and the versions of them that we are using for this far. So these are the latest dependencies and the versions of them that we are using for this project. Please make sure to always keep the dependencies the same version. Okay, just in case you're doing this in the future. And you know, something's changed, and you want to still build this app, just revert back to these versions that you see here, as well as the versions that we will be installing. So first off, however, I'm just going to clean this up a little bit. So on the index.js file, I'm just going to delete the report web vitals from here as we will not be doing that. We also won't be doing any testing and I'm going to get rid of the semicolon just because that is my personal preference. So that is all that should be in the index.js file. Just save that. Like I said, I'm just going to delete these three files right here. So the logo, the report where vitals and the setup tests. So just do the same delete anyway. Now in the index CSS, we're going to start from scratch, I'm going to delete everything from this file, the app test.js is also going to be deleted as I don't want to do any tests. So notice for you today, let's also get rid of the app CSS files. This is a small app. So I'm just going to keep all the styling in the index CSS file. And now the app j s file once again, I'm just going to essentially delete all of this from it. And it's delete all of that so we can start fresh. So that should be in here, I'm going to make this a functional expression as well, just because that is my preference. Okay, great. So all you should have in the source directory is this app JS file that looks like this, the index CSS file that is empty and the index JS file which should look like this. Wonderful. Let's move on. Now let's go ahead and store our secret somewhere. So I'm going to create a new file to dot env file. And we're going to add our API key in here. So our Google generative AI key. So let's go ahead and call this Google gen AI key, you can call it whatever you wish. And I'm just going to paste in my unique key like so. Great. And that's it. So now we are ready to continue, we essentially can start building, I'm just going to build out a simple front and forth so we can get started with the media stuff soon. So let's go ahead and do it. Let's go ahead and create a simple chat. So in here, what I'm going to do is let's create a wrapping div, let's give it a class name up. Let's also have a section in here, this is going to be the search section. So I'm let's give it a class name app. Let's also have a section in here, this is going to be the search section. So I'm going to give it the class name of you guessed it search section. It's going to minimize that for now. And I'm just gonna have a paragraph element. What do you want to know? Okay, and then let's have a button that says surprise me in case we you know, want to be surprised with something. So sir, fries me just like that. Let's maybe also give this a class name, I'm going to give the class name of Sir prize. And in fact, what I'm going to do is actually put this in the paragraph element, you will see why. So in fact, maybe let's run this, I'm going to get up my terminal. And I'm just going to do npm run start. And in fact, because we're going to have a front end a banner backend, I'm going to get that script, I'm just going to define it as the front end script. And we're also going to have a backend script. Okay, so backend, and this is going to be no demon. So that's a package that we're gonna have to install to listen up a constant changes on the server JS file, which we are yet to write, that's going to hold our whole back end. So maybe let's go ahead and create that file new file, it's a JavaScript file, I'm going to call it server j s. Okay, cool. And let's continue. So before we forget, let's actually install that package. So maybe let's go ahead and do that now NPM I know the one and that will essentially install it. So it will just add to these dependencies right here. No, the one has just been added along with its version. So okay, let's start off front end, I'm going to do npm run start front end, again, making sure you're just in the app. And tada, it's spun up our front end along with the elements that we've essentially added, I'm just gonna inspect this so we can work with it a little bit better. Great. This is looking good. Let's move on. So let's just minimize that for now. And let's continue adding elements. So we've got that P element. Next, I'm going to have a div. And let's continue adding elements. So we've got that P element. Next I'm going to have a div. And this is actually going to be a container. So I'm going to wrap, let's call this the input container as this container is going to wrap an input element. So here is my input element. And as all inputs, it's going to have a value at the moment, I'm just gonna leave it like so. Let's also have a placeholder for it. Maybe let's have something like when is Christmas? Okay, very simple question. We'll have an on change, which will essentially change the value for us and save it in the state of this app. But for now, I'm just going to keep it empty. Of course, we haven't written that function yet. Cool. I'm also going to do something and I'm going to have a button here. It's going to say ask me and then another button. So we're gonna have two buttons, but we're going to show them conditionally. So ask me or clear. So at the moment, you can see both buttons, but I want to be able to only show the ask me button. If there's no error, then show this button. So if this is true, show this element. However, if there is an error, then we show this button, which means we need to save that error. And I'm going to save it to state. So we might as well just go ahead and import use state from the ads, we're not going to be using use effects. So let's get rid of that. And now I can set the error. So that is the syntax for saving state to the app. Okay, at the moment, there is no error, we can actually just keep this as null for now. Or in fact, this is going to be a string. So I'm going to just save it as that. At the moment, this has been assigned to the value of error. And if we want to change it, we use set error. So if there is an error at the moment that isn't, we should see this because there is no error, right. So let's have a look. And the Ask Me button is showing. However, if I change this to some thing when is wrong, save it, then it will say clear because an error does exist. Okay, so hopefully that makes sense. So we have those two buttons. And now outside of this div, let's also show the error if one exists. So if an error does exist, I'm going to show this P element that shows the error. Otherwise, if it doesn't exist, this won't show at all. Cool. Now we're also going to have a div. And this is actually going to show the search results. So you know, whatever comes back from the API, but of course, there's gonna be multiple, it's going to be a history. So it's gonna be multiple chance. So class name, search result, I will call it. And here, we're going to essentially map items onto something, it's going to be a div. And this div is going to hold a p element, that is just going to be the answer. So let's go ahead and give this the class name of answer. Okay, and this div will have a key because when you map onto things, you need a key. So I'm just going to leave that blank for now. Great. And that really is it. Okay, hopefully that was painless. Of course, it doesn't look very nice for now. The magic of styling will literally transform this. So let's go ahead and do it. I'm just going to go ahead and get my index CS file. So let's get into the source, let's get an index CSS file. And now all I'm going to do is going to say that all the fonts or font family is going to be sans serif, no backup, okay, sans serif, being really basic here really kind of streamline this project, margin zero, padding is going to be zero, let's make the whole width of this 100 of the viewport width, the height of this 100 of the viewport height, And then the background color is just going to be like this off white that I picked out earlier. And then the text color again, it's not going to be black, it's going to be a gray. So that's the shorthand for writing 77767. Display, flex, we're going to initialize flex box, just so we can make sure that everything is in the center from left to left. Great. All P elements in here, again, I'm just going to change the font weight to be 200. And I'm going to change the font size as well. So I want the font size of all the elements, the P elements to be exactly 14 pixels. Now the app itself, so the element with the class name of app, so this one right here, I'm going to go ahead and make sure that it's with a smaller, okay, at viewport width, and I'm actually going to give it a margin of 10 viewport width again to make up for to that 100. And the height is going to be at viewport height. Okay, great. And that's going to contain everything in it. I think what shall we do? Let's have the search section. So that is the first element in there. I'm just going to make sure that it's 100% of the element with the class name of app, the height of it is again going to be 100%. Let's use this place flex and direction column to make sure everything goes from top to bottom. And that's really it. Okay, so that section essentially is the same as the app. So perhaps we can even go out and just give this the class name of app and just make this a div. So I'm just going to delete that for now. Okay, we're really streamlining things here. So there we go. And this just means that I can, let's go ahead and add this like that and get rid of this search section completely. Great. Now let's go ahead and get the search results. So the search results is here, it lives inside the app. results is here it lives inside the app. So maybe format this a little bit better. So I'm just going to use webstorm to code a format code. And that is much better. So these search results. Singular, make sure that is singular. I'm going to do margin top to space it out from the element above 10 pixels. And I'm going to do overflow scroll. So we can scroll through all the results, we don't have to scroll the actual page. Okay, great. Now let's pick out the little things. So I'm going to pick out this button by the class name of surprise. So dot surprise, let's give it a background color, I'm going to go ahead and use another color that I have pre picked out EC e c f1. I'm also going to change the color of the text to be black. And then let's get a border radius of five pixels to round it off. This should be that. And let's also add a font weight to this text. Let's go ahead with 600. And the padding, four pixels on the top and bottom and 12 pixels on the left and right. The margin of this again, this I'm going zero at the top zero on the right two pixels on the bottom, and five pixels on the left. And the border of this is going to be none. Okay, so if you're interested in how this is looking so far, here we go. This is looking good. Let's carry on. So now I'm going to style the input container. So I'm going to find the element with a class name of a container, the width of this is going to be 100%. And now I'm going to add a border to this, it's going to be a solid border 0.5 pixels and width and again, ca ca ca is the color I have picked out for it. The box sizing of this is going to be border box so that the board is actually on the inside. And let's round it off. So border radius, maybe let's make it six pixel this time and the box shadow I'm going to give it is going to be RGB a for transparency 0082 with 0.15 opacity okay and once again we're going to be a blur a spread and great now inside the input container, I want to grab the input that lives in it, I'm just going to get rid of the border, the padding for this. Let's go ahead with 13 pixels on the top and bottom and 14 pixels on the left and right. Once again, box sizing, I'm going to go with border box. The font size, I'm going to go with 15 pixels. Outline none, this will just get rid of the blue outline when you interact with the input. And the width of this is going to be 90% of the parent with a font weight of this being 200. Okay, so now the input looks like this, I'm going to use display flex on this input container so that each item is kind of next to each other the rather than stacked. And there we go. Let's do the button next. So in fact, maybe let's also work on the placeholder text. So I can do this by grabbing the input that lives inside the input holder. And then if I want to get the placeholder text, I can change it like so. Yeah, let's go with this color. And let's just make this a little bit like that. So there we go much better, in my opinion. Okay, now let's do the button that lives inside the input container. So any button that is inside the input container is going to have this styling, I'm going to give it a min width of 10% border, of course, it's going to be none. And let's also just add a border on the left side, okay, to differentiate from the input. Let's give it one pixel solid. And yeah, I'm happy with that gray. Let's also make sure the background color is white and the text color is going to be this one that I used before the font weight, I'm going to go with bold and cursor, I'm going to add a cursor that is a pointer just for fun. Okay, just make sure that that is like that. And let's see what it looks like. So I love this so much. Let's move on. I think maybe let's add overflow hidden to the input. So once again, let's go maybe to the input container this time. I'm just going to go with overflow hidden, just so that this is a bit more rounded off at the edges. Wonderful. Okay, that's nearly finished. So I'm also going to add some styling to any button that lives inside the input container. And if it's active, so this is how you grab an active button that lives inside the input container. And if it's active, so this is how you grab an active button that lives inside the input container, make sure that space is there. I'm going to just change the background color to be ca ca ca. So kind of grayed out when it's active. And finally, let's also style anything with the class of answer. And for us that is these P elements. So I'm just going to go ahead and add a padding to each one of 13 pixels at the top and bottom 14 pixels on the left and right. Let's also add a border of solid 0.5 pixels, ca ca ca. Okay, so kind of similar styling repeating. I'm also going to give them a background color. Let's make it white. So hash FF F, a margin of five pixels, a font size of 15 pixels, a font weight of 200 and a border radius of six. So wonderful. I'm really happy with how this is looking so far. Okay, let's work on linking up the surprise me button first. So let's get rid of this for now. And up here, I essentially want to get a random value to work with. So we've saved errors. Another thing I want to save is the value and the value is simply going to be the text that we are writing in here. We also want to generate some randomly. So this is super simple to do. All I'm going to do is define our surprise options like so and it is going to be an array. So that is good for us to use. And I'm just going to put in some random options. So who won the latest? No bell? Peace? Prize can be one question. We can also have where does pizza come from? That's a great question. And how do you make a BLT sandwich? And clearly very hungry because these are all very food focused pretty much apart from the first one. So once we have a surprise options, I'm just going to write a super simple function, const, surprise, and all it's going to do is get a random value from this array. So in order to get a random value, yes, thank you, tab nine, we get the surprise options, we open up the array, we then get math floor, which will round down we open up the array, we then get math floor, which will round down to the nearest integer. And we simply get the surprise options length and multiply it by math random. And math random will return back a number from zero to just under one. So if you multiply it by the length, it will always be just under three, and we round it down. So it could be either zero, one or two. And we pass through zero into the array, we'll get about this, if you pass through one, we'll get this. And if you pass through two, we will get that. So that is how we get a random value. And then I'm going to get random value, I'm going to pass it through to set value. So we're essentially at the beginning setting value to be this. However, if we call this function, we will get a random value from here, and reset this value using set value to be one of these three. So now where should we do this? Well, I think if we press the surprise button, right, so on click of this, I just want to call that function. Okay, wonderful. So maybe we should also add an option to disable this. And I think this should be disabled if a chat history already exists, right? So maybe let's set const chat history, set chat history. And this will be an empty array. So now if chat history exists, we want this to be disabled. But for now, of course, it's not. And the other thing we want to pass through here is the value. So we can actually see it in the input. So on change, we also need to set value of this, I'm going to pass through the E target value of whatever we type into the input itself, of course, we need to make this a function like so and pass through E. So now this value, so this value here can be changed in two ways, right? Either if we click here on surprise me, or if we start typing in here. So let's try it out. Maybe as chat history, you know, is an empty array up here, we should probably change it to something. If no chat history exists, then we can do it. There we go. So this is looking good, we're getting a random value each time, or we can type in our own question like so. And that will be saved to the value here. So we can send it over to our API. So let's do it. So let's go ahead and write a function here, I'm going to call it get response as that is essentially what we want to do, we were going to get a response from the API, just make sure to spell response correctly. This is going to be an async function. So let's just go ahead and work that in here. First off, however, if no value exists, and we essentially click on the Ask Me button, right, so if you click on here, and no value exists, and we essentially click on the Ask Me button, right? So if you look on here, and no value exists, we want an error to show up essentially. So I'm going to set an error. And it's just going to say error. Please ask a question. Okay, and we can of course show that too. So maybe let's go ahead and put that here we already have so that will show up if there is an error. And we're just going to return out of this. Great. Now we're going to try some things. So try and catch we're going to use the try and catch blocks. We'll try something and if it doesn't work, we're just going to catch any error with a console error, the error and we're also going to set the error. So we're not going to use what comes back to us, I'm just writing a super basic error that doesn't really give us much insight into what went wrong. But if you want to take this a step further, please do you can use this error to write some custom error messages. Cool. So that's what we're going to do. And now what we're going to send over to the back end. Well, I think we're going to space this out a bit. We're going to define our options first. Okay, and this is going to be a post method, we are also going to be sending over the whole chat history. So I'm going to use Jason stringify, I'm going to create an object. And in that object, we're going to send over all the chat history. Okay. And we're also going to send over a message message which is the latest text that we want to send through. So essentially, we're sending over whatever we type in here. And if there is a chat history of previous questions, we're going to send that over as well. Great. Let's also set our headers. So we're going to choose content type JSON for that that is correct. And now as the response, we're going to await fetch, and we can set our own endpoint. So let's say that we want our backend to be on port 8000. And I'm just going to make the endpoint Gemini, and we're going to send through all these options with it. So that is our response. And of course, once that comes back to us, we're going to get text from it like so and save this as something we're going to await it though, as it isn't asynchronous method. So we need to await that and then let's save it as data. And I'm just going to console log the data for now. So we can see what's coming back. Great. So now let's actually work on our backend. So in here, like I said, we're going to define the port, I did say this would be port 8000. So that's all I have done, we are going to have to import a few packages or dependencies to help us here. So let's just go ahead and open up a new tab, making sure you're still in react Gemini app. And I'm going to install Express, which is going to help us with the routing cores, which is going to help us get rid of those pesky blocks by calls messages, when you're sending stuff from the front end to the back end, and so on. We're also going to use the dot env package to store secrets in our env file, as you just saw, and we are also going to need Google generative AI. So let's go ahead and import that too. So great. That is the packages that we're going to need for this project. So let's just wait for that to do its thing. And let's continue. So of course, we're going to need Express require Express. And we're going to wait for all of this wonderfulness from the package to come back. And we're going to save it as express. And once we have it, we're going to release it. So this will essentially release methods and properties that come with express. And if we save it under a constant, for example, app, we can now use app to get any methods. So for example, the use method from it. So great, we're going to do that we're also going to require a course of const. course, require cause again, this is to get past those pesky blocked by cause messages when sending stuff from the front end to the back end, and so on. And we're also going to also pass JSON from the front end. So hence, we need to use Express JSON here. Great. So let's just minimize that for now. We also are going to require and we did import the dot tmv package so that we can essentially work with secrets like our Google API API key. Cool. The other thing we're going to do is get Google generative AI from choir. And then the package at Google generative AI. Okay, so there we go, we've got everything nearly set up. The other thing we're actually going to do is get that API key that we stored in our back end. So I'm going to use Google generative AI. And I'm just going to pause through that API key. Okay, I'm going to pause it through here. So we can just go process, env. And then whatever we called our API key in a dot env file, which was Google gen AI key. So I'm just going to paste it in like so. Okay, wonderful. Let's move on. I'm also just going to listen out to check that everything is working as it should pass me the port as the first parameter. And as the second parameter is a callback function, I'm just going to do console log listening on port and then our port number. Cool. So now if we run this, so for example, here in the package, Jason, we did write our script to listen out for anything on the server j s file. So now I can do npm run, start back end and it should start back end listening on port 1000. Everything is working as it should. Cool. So now let's write our route, we wrote a post request to the endpoint Gemini, as you saw here. So now what do we want to send over to this back end to this endpoint? Well, it's essentially all of this, right. So let's actually do that. And you can send stuff over and you can get it by going to rec body. And then that should bring back this whole body right here. And if you want to get the history from it, I can simply do dot history. So maybe let's actually console log this so we can see what is going on. And I'm also going to console log the rec body message as that is another thing that we are sending over. So let's just see this works for now I'm just going to get up here my back end so we can see what's being sent. So now if I go ahead and send some text, when is Christmas for example. And now let's hook up the Ask Me button. So let's actually get this whole get response function and attach it to the Ask Me button. So on click of this, we want to get a response. So let's go ahead and do it, ask me. And let's go back in here and look in the server js file in the terminal, we get two things being console that we get the history, which yes, is an empty array, as we set that up here. And we also get the value which is when is Christmas. So we save the value up here. But then we also said the value should be the message. So great, we are sending stuff over we're sending over the chat history and the value, because we are going into the request body history and into the request body message. So request body history request body message, we're sending that over now let's send it over to Google. So let's go ahead and do it. Okay, all I'm going to do is get gen AI. Once again, this is just from the documentation that I showed you earlier, we're going to do get generative model. And we're going to pass through the model that we discussed. So let's define the model here. It is the Gemini Pro model. And I'm just going to save this as model. So we've just defined it. This should be Gen AI as we defined here. And now let's define the chat. The chat Well, we're going to get the model and we're going to use the method start chat that comes with it. I'm going to create an object. And we're just going to pass through the history, which again, we already have it's this request. Body history. Cool. And now let's also define a message. So we define our chat. And now the message is just simply going to be request body message. So that's a lot simpler. Okay, so I'm just going to delete that for now as we don't really need it. The next thing we need to do is actually get the result of what comes back. So const result equals, I'm going to await, we're going to get the chat. So what we defined here, we're going to send a message, I'm going to send through this message to the chat as well. So along with the history, we're sending through the message to, and now we're going to get the result. And we're going to get the response from it. And as this is a going to get the response from it. And as this is a asynchronous function, we need to await it. And let's save this as the response. So just like so. And then we get the response, we need to get its text. Okay, and let's save this as text. So just like that. Okay. And now I'm just going to do res send the text to send it back to our front end, make sure this is send message. And once we get it back here, we're at the moment we're just console logging out. So now all I need to do is essentially map them onto here, we need to save the history. So I'm going to set chat history. However, when working with arrays, we need to essentially set the old state which I'm going to choose to call all chat history, we need to release it back into the array. And then the data. Well, I'm going to actually create a new object that is in line with the data that already exists. So the way that Google modeled it, so we're going to have a user and the user essentially asked this question, which is our value. And then we're also going to have another object. And this role is going to be the model. And it's going to be what comes back to us. So this is what the model said, or essentially the AI said, and it's going to be the data that comes back. So the piece of text, great. And once we have done that, we can set the value to be an empty string again. Wonderful. So now that we have that chat history, I'm just going to scroll down here, and we're going to map it onto this. So let's get the chat history. And we're going to map, we're going to map it onto this whole div just like so. And what we're going to do is map let's open up our parentheses once more. And we're going to map each chat item. As well as the index, I'm going to pass through the index as the key, it's not really used, hence I use this. And now for each chat item, I'm essentially going to put it in here, I'm going to get the chat item role. So it's either going to be user or model. And then I'm just going to get the chat item parts. And wonderful. I'm really happy with this. And maybe let's format this file once more. The last thing I want to do is just clear the history, the value and the error if we want to clear everything. So I'm going to do so on the clear button. So on click of this, I want to clear right. So let's define this function. Let's just do so here. So const clear. And I'm just going to set the value to be null set error to be null and set the chat history to be an empty array again. Great. And that's it. So let's try it out. I'm just going to type in when is Christmas. And if you hit ask me, it should come back with two messages. That was my message. So when is Christmas and then whatever the model responded with, which is December 25. Now I can go ahead and ask a follow up question to this conversation, meaning it's taking into context the previous messages. So I can simply write Are you sure? Obviously, are you sure by itself won't mean much but with the context we know we're talking about Christmas. So if I type in Are you sure the model will come back with Yes, I am sure that Christmas on December 25th. Okay, and then you can continue with other questions. So it will continue the multi chat conversation. Amazing. So this is working as it should. I love it. Let me know what you think below.\\"","completion":"# Dive into the Cutting Edge Realm of AI with Google's AI Model, Gemini Are you ready to explore the world of artificial intelligence?

Voici une brève explication de chaque type d'IA suivi par la façon dont ils pourraient aborder la création d'un PNJ lion : 1. Intelligence Artificielle Générale (AGI) : AGI fait référence à une machine qui possède l'aptitude de comprendre, d'apprendre et d'appliquer l'intelligence à une variété de problèmes de la même manière qu'un être humain. Elle est polyvalente et flexible. - Création d'un PNJ Lion par AGI : Une AGI serait capable de comprendre le comportement complexe et les interactions sociales des lions dans le monde réel. Elle pourrait ainsi créer un PNJ qui non seulement se comporte de manière réaliste en se basant sur une compréhension biologique et écologique collective, mais pourrait aussi interagir de manière sophistiquée avec le joueur et l'environnement de jeu, apprenant et s'adaptant au fil du temps. 2. Intelligence Artificielle Spécialisée (AI ou ANI) : L'AI actuelle est spécialisée et conçue pour effectuer des tâches spécifiques, telles que la reconnaissance d'images, le traitement du langage naturel ou la navigation de véhicules autonomes. Elle n'est pas capable de démontrer de l'intelligence en dehors de son domaine d'application spécifique. - Création d'un PNJ Lion par AI : L'IA spécialisée pourrait être configurée pour simuler le comportement d'un lion en se basant sur un ensemble de règles et de modèles prédéfinis. Elle pourrait animer le PNJ dans le jeu vidéo de manière convaincante, en lui faisant rugir, chasser, ou se reposer selon les circonstances programmées. Cependant, l'engagement avec l'environnement et les réactions seraient limités aux scénarios prévus par les développeurs. 3. Intelligence Artificielle Superintelligente (ASI) : L'ASI est un concept hypothétique qui désigne une intelligence artificielle qui surpasserait de loin l'intelligence humaine dans tous les domaines, y compris la créativité, la résolution de problèmes et l'intelligence émotionnelle. - Création d'un PNJ Lion par ASI : Une ASI aurait la capacité non seulement de créer un PNJ lion indiscernable d'un véritable lion en termes de comportement, mais éventuellement de concevoir de nouvelles formes d'interactions qui ne sont pas familières ni prévisibles pour les êtres humains. Elle pourrait innover en créant des expériences de jeu entièrement nouvelles et pourrait même questionner et redéfinir la place et le rôle d'un PNJ lion au sein du jeu pour offrir une expérience plus enrichissante aux joueurs. En résumé : - AGI pourrait créer un PNJ lion avec une compréhension et une adaptation complexes. - AI créerait un PNJ lion convaincant mais limité aux comportements scriptés. - ASI pourrait réinventer le concept de PNJ lion, offrant des interactions et une expérience de jeu sans précédent. Il est important de noter que, en 2023, AGI et ASI restent des objectifs théoriques et ne sont pas encore réalisés dans la pratique. Les IA couramment utilisées dans les jeux vidéo sont des formes d'IA spécialisée conçues pour des tâches définies."},{"prompt":"AGI et AI et ASI sur les jeux vidéo par de chaque type AI créer un PNJ un guépard dans le jeu quelle serait la différence entre c'est trois AI","completion":"Pour clarifier, AGI signifie \\"Artificial General Intelligence\\" (intelligence artificielle générale), AI est couramment utilisé pour \\"Artificial Intelligence\\" (intelligence artificielle), mais dans votre contexte, il semble se référer à \\"Applied Intelligence\\" ou intelligence appliquée spécifique à une tâche, et ASI est l'acronyme de \\"Artificial Super Intelligence\\" (super-intelligence artificielle). Pour créer un personnage non joueur (PNJ) guépard dans un jeu vidéo, chacune de ces intelligences artificielles aurait une approche différente: 1. **AI (Intelligence Appliquée)**: Ce type d'intelligence artificielle est spécialisé pour effectuer des tâches très spécifiques. Un PNJ guépard créé avec une telle IA serait capable de simuler certains comportements typiques d'un guépard, comme courir à grande vitesse, chasser des proies ou fuir des prédateurs. Cette intelligence serait strictement limitée à des actions et réactions programmées par les développeurs, ne démontrant pas de capacités d'apprentissage ou d'adaptation au-delà de sa programmation initiale. 2. **AGI (Intelligence Générale Artificielle)**: Un PNJ guépard construit avec une AGI aurait des capacités cognitives semblables à un humain ou à un guépard réel dans la nature. Il pourrait apprendre de nouvelles choses, résoudre des problèmes complexes et s'adapter à des situations inédites. Ce type de PNJ pourrait développer une autonomie impressionnante dans le jeu, créant une expérience de jeu beaucoup plus dynamique et imprévisible. 3. **ASI (Super-Intelligence Artificielle)**: Un PNJ guépard avec une ASI serait extrêmement avancé, dépassant de loin l'intelligence humaine et celle d'un guépard. En théorie, cette super-intelligence pourrait non seulement simuler parfaitement tous les comportements naturels des guépards mais aussi comprendre le contexte du jeu dans son ensemble, anticiper les actions des joueurs et même influer sur le jeu de manière créative, en modifiant peut-être le paysage ou en créant de nouveaux défis pour les joueurs. Cependant, une telle intelligence n'existe pas à l'heure actuelle et est purement théorique. Dans la pratique actuelle des jeux vidéo, nous travaillons principalement avec le premier type (AI spécialisée), en utilisant des algorithmes de machine learning pour certaines améliorations, mais pas au niveau d'une AGI ou d'une ASI. Les jeux vidéo utilisent actuellement des IA qui sont très avancées dans leur domaine spécifique mais ne présentent pas les caractéristiques d'une AGI ou d'une ASI et sont donc loin de pouvoir présenter un comportement aussi avancé que décrit pour les deux dernières."},{"prompt":"fix the code: from openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI(api_key='sk-umlSn5VGT3BlbkFJVQOKxqdamCOa5fKrIPdz') person_info = \\"Name: John Doe, Education: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Experience: Worked as a software engineer for 5 years, Skills: Strong problem-solving skills, team player\\" job_info = \\"\\"\\"Minimum qualifications: Bachelor's degree or equivalent practical experience. 5 years of experience in program or project management.

Voici un exemple de code qui utilise \`Cartopy\` et charge une image satellite à haute résolution à l'aide de Google Tiles : \`\`\`python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import cartopy.crs as ccrs import cartopy.feature as cfeature from cartopy.io.img_tiles import GoogleTiles def create_flight_map(departure_coord, arrival_coord, zoom=3, outfile='flight_map.png'): # Créer une image satellite à l'aide des tuiles Google imagery = GoogleTiles(style='satellite') # Utiliser une projection de type Mercator fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12)) ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, projection=imagery.crs) ax.set_extent([min(departure_coord[0], arrival_coord[0]) - 20, max(departure_coord[0], arrival_coord[0]) + 20, min(departure_coord[1], arrival_coord[1]) - 10, max(departure_coord[1], arrival_coord[1]) + 10], crs=ccrs.Geodetic()) # Ajouter l'imagerie satellite au niveau de zoom spécifié ax.add_image(imagery, zoom) # Ajouter des traits caractéristiques ax.add_feature(cfeature.COASTLINE) ax.add_feature(cfeature.BORDERS, linestyle=':') # Marquer les points de départ et d'arrivée departure_lon, departure_lat = departure_coord arrival_lon, arrival_lat = arrival_coord plt.plot([departure_lon, arrival_lon], [departure_lat, arrival_lat], color='blue', linewidth=3, marker='o', transform=ccrs.Geodetic()) # Enregistrer l'image sans bordure blanche plt.savefig(outfile, bbox_inches='tight', format='png') # Test de la fonction avec des coordonnées de départ et d'arrivée create_flight_map(departure_coord=(-0.1276, 51.5074), # Londres arrival_coord=(151.2093, -33.8688), # Sydney zoom=4) \`\`\` Dans cet exemple, \`zoom\` est un paramètre qui spécifie le niveau de zoom de l'image satellite. Vous pouvez augmenter la valeur de \`zoom\` pour obtenir une meilleure résolution, en gardant à l'esprit que cela augmentera également la quantité de données téléchargées et peut affecter les performances de votre programme. Assurez-vous d'installer Cartopy et ses dépendances avant d'exécuter ce code. Vous pouvez l'installer via \`pip\`: \`\`\`bash pip install cartopy \`\`\` Notez qu'utiliser des images satellite haute résolution peut impliquer des considérations légales ou des limites d'utilisation API selon la source des tuiles. Assurez-vous de respecter les conditions d'utilisation de la source de données satellite que vous utilisez."},{"prompt":"Est ce que c'est possible d'avoir un trait courbé pour le trait qui relie le départ et l'arrivée ? \\" import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import cartopy.crs as ccrs import cartopy.feature as cfeature from cartopy.io.img_tiles import GoogleTiles def create_flight_map(departure_coord, arrival_coord, zoom=3, outfile='flight_map.png'): # Créer une image satellite à l'aide des tuiles Google imagery = GoogleTiles(style='satellite') # Utiliser une projection de type Mercator fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12)) ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, projection=imagery.crs) ax.set_extent([min(departure_coord[0], arrival_coord[0]) - 20, max(departure_coord[0], arrival_coord[0]) + 20, min(departure_coord[1], arrival_coord[1]) - 10, max(departure_coord[1], arrival_coord[1]) + 10], crs=ccrs.Geodetic()) # Ajouter l'imagerie satellite au niveau de zoom spécifié ax.add_image(imagery, zoom) # Ajouter des traits caractéristiques ax.add_feature(cfeature.COASTLINE) ax.add_feature(cfeature.BORDERS, linestyle=':') # Marquer les points de départ et d'arrivée departure_lon, departure_lat = departure_coord arrival_lon, arrival_lat = arrival_coord plt.plot([departure_lon, arrival_lon], [departure_lat, arrival_lat], color='white', linewidth=1.5, marker='v', transform=ccrs.Geodetic()) # Enregistrer l'image sans bordure blanche plt.savefig(outfile, bbox_inches='tight', pad_inches=0, format='png') # Test de la fonction avec des coordonnées de départ et d'arrivée create_flight_map(departure_coord=(-0.1276, 51.5074), # Londres arrival_coord=(-74.005941, 40.712784), # New York zoom=4)\\"","completion":"Oui, il est tout à fait possible d'avoir un trait courbé pour marquer le chemin entre deux points sur une carte dans Cartopy. Cela représente de manière plus réaliste la trajectoire que prendrait un vol sur la surface courbe de la Terre, connue sous le nom de route orthodromique ou grand cercle. Pour tracer une ligne courbe représentant la route du grand cercle entre deux points, vous pouvez utiliser la même projection \`ccrs.Geodetic()\` qui prend en compte la courbure de la Terre.

I’ll make sure to give you some tips and pointers along the way. We’ll have you hitting those targets with pinpoint accuracy in no time.” Hood: “I look forward to it, Unicorn. Your help and guidance are always valuable to me. Let’s get to work!” (As they step into the elevator…) Cheshire: “Hey, wait! Please hold it for me!” Hood: “Oh, Cheshire! I didn’t see you there. Of course, we’ll hold the elevator for you.” Cheshire: “Thanks, Hood. Are you two headed to the range for some training?” Unicorn: “Yes, we are. Hood wanted some extra help with her aim, so I’m going to assist her.” Cheshire: “Mind if I join in as well? I could use some practice with my dodging skills.” Hood: “Of course, Cheshire! The more the merrier. We can all work on improving our skills together.” Grenville: “Hey, can I come, too?” Hood: “Sure, Grenville! The more the merrier.

How it works Text: A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computers, networks or applications for known weaknesses. These scanners are used to discover the weaknesses of a given system. They are utilized in the identification and detection of vulnerabilities arising from mis-configurations or flawed programming within a network-based asset such as a firewall, router, web server, application server, etc. Modern vulnerability scanners allow for both authenticated and unauthenticated scans. Modern scanners are typically available as SaaS (Software as a Service); provided over the internet and delivered as a web application. The modern vulnerability scanner often has the ability to customize vulnerability reports as well as the installed software, open ports, certificates and other host information that can be queried as part of its workflow. Authenticated scans allow for the scanner to directly access network based assets using remote administrative protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP) and authenticate using provided system credentials. This allows the vulnerability scanner to access low-level data, such as specific services and configuration details of the host operating system. It's then able to provide detailed and accurate information about the operating system and installed software, including configuration issues and missing security patches.[1] Unauthenticated scans is a method that can result in a high number of false positives and is unable to provide detailed information about the assets operating system and installed software. This method is typically used by threat actors or security analyst trying determine the security posture of externally accessible assets.[1] Vulnerability scanners should be able to detect the risks in open-source dependencies. However, since developers will usually re-bundle the OSS, the same code will appear in different dependencies, which will then impact the performance and ability of scanners to detect the vulnerable OSS.[2] The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense designates continuous vulnerability scanning as a critical control for effective cyber defense. Vulnerability scanners are software or hardware tools used to diagnose and monitor network computers, allowing you to scan networks, computers and applications to detect possible security problems, assess and eliminate vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners allow you to check various applications in your system for holes that could be exploited by attackers. Low-level tools, such as a port scanner, can also be used to identify and analyze possible applications and protocols running on the system. 1 Types of vulnerability scanners 2 Software 3 See also 4 Notes 5 Literature Types of Vulnerability Scanners The work of a vulnerability scanner can be divided into 4 steps: Typically, the scanner first detects active IP addresses, open ports, running operating system and applications. A security report is generated (optional step). Attempting to determine the level of possible interference with the operating system or applications (may result in a crash). At the final stage, the scanner can exploit the vulnerability, causing the operating system or application to crash. Scanners can be malicious or friendly. The latter usually stop at step 2 or 3, but never get to step 4. Among the vulnerability scanners we can highlight: Port scanner Scanners examining the topology of a computer network Scanners that examine network service vulnerabilities Network worms CGI scanners (\\"friendly\\" - help find vulnerable scripts) Software Top ten vulnerability scanners according to insecure.org (2006)[1] Nessus: Vulnerability Assessment for UNIX GFI LANguard: Commercial network vulnerability scanner for Windows Retina: A commercial vulnerability assessment scanner Core Impact: Automated intrusion testing product ISS Internet Scanner: Application Level Vulnerability Assessment X-scan: Network vulnerability scanner Sara: Security Auditor's Research Assistant QualysGuard: Vulnerability scanner (web service) SAINT: Security Administrator's Integrated Network Tool MBSA: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Other well-known vulnerability scanners: XSpider OpenVAS ERPScan SAP security scanner SurfPatrol COMPLAUD RedCheck Web Application Vulnerability Scanners are automated tools that scan web applications, normally from the outside, to look for security vulnerabilities such as Cross-site scripting, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal and insecure server configuration. This category of tools is frequently referred to as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools. A large number of both commercial and open source tools of this type are available and all of these tools have their own strengths and weaknesses. If you are interested in the effectiveness of DAST tools, check out the OWASP Benchmark project, which is scientifically measuring the effectiveness of all types of vulnerability detection tools, including DAST. OWASP is aware of the Web Application Vulnerability Scanner Evaluation Project (WAVSEP). WAVSEP is completely unrelated to OWASP and we do not endorse its results, nor any of the DAST tools it evaluates. However, the results provided by WAVSEP may be helpful to someone interested in researching or selecting free and/or commercial DAST tools for their projects. This project has far more detail on DAST tools and their features than this OWASP DAST page. Vulnerability scanner - a software or hardware product for searching for threats in infrastructure companies. The scanner is used to detect gaps in network protection, operating systems, databases, applications, etc. The main task is to assess information security, identify vulnerabilities and provide reports. Using a scanner, an administrator can find “holes” that hackers use to obtain unauthorized access (NAA) to confidential data on the company network. A vulnerability scanner can monitor running processes, services and scan used ports. Vulnerability scanner - a software or hardware product for searching for threats in infrastructure companies.

Using a scanner, an administrator can find “holes” that hackers use to obtain unauthorized access (NAA) to confidential data on the company network. A vulnerability scanner can monitor running processes, services and scan used ports. Main functions The software product has the following functions: How the scanner works searches for various types of network vulnerabilities and analyzes them in real time; checks network resources, OS, connected devices, ports; analyzes all active processes and the behavior of running applications; creates reports that indicate the type of vulnerability. Probing. An effective but slow way to find and analyze vulnerabilities. Its essence is that the solution initiates virtual attacks and monitors the network infrastructure to search for vulnerable points. By At the end of the process, the administrator is provided with a detailed report indicating the problems found and recommendations for their deactivation. Scanning. In this mode, the scanner operates at the maximum possible speed, but analyzes the network infrastructure at the surface level. That is, it detects obvious vulnerabilities and analyzes the overall infrastructure security. Compared to the previous method, this method only warns about found administrator problems, but nothing more. What actions does a vulnerability scanner perform? Scanners can be \\"friendly\\" or \\"aggressive\\". The first type simply collects information and does not model attack. The second exploits the vulnerability to cause software to crash. Collects information from the entire infrastructure: active processes, running applications, running ports and devices, services, etc. Search for potential vulnerabilities using different methods. Uses special methods of simulating attacks to find possible vulnerabilities (the function is not available in every scanner). Generates a detailed report with information about found vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners are the front line of vulnerability management. They are essential for identifying vulnerabilities that could be used by bad actors to compromise systems and data. In the old days of monolithic on-premise applications, vulnerability scanners were deployed primarily in the production environment as infrastructure watchdogs that alerted to runtime threats. This paradigm became obsolete with the emergence of cloud-native applications that leverage the powerful scalability and agility of modern cloud-based infrastructure. As applications and the tools to secure them become more complex, solutions like ASPM are emerging to bring together the different data streams and enable risk based prioritization and remediation. Today’s highly automated CI/CD pipelines cannot tolerate security testing bottlenecks. The detection and remediation of vulnerabilities must keep up with the frenetic pace of mature DevOps practices. Yet another challenge to legacy security paradigms is the highly distributed architecture of cloud-native applications, based on dynamic components such as open-source libraries, serverless functions, infrastructure as code (IaC), and containers. In short, cloud-native applications require a new cloud-native application security paradigm: ensuring that vulnerabilities are detected and fixed during development with a holistic approach that makes security an integral part of the software development life cycle (SDLC). In this article, we describe the different kinds of vulnerability scanners that, together, provide cloud-native security coverage for websites, web applications, networks, open-source code, WordPress content, and containers (such as our Docker scanner). 3 Most common types of scanners Network vulnerability scanners Web application vulnerability scanners Open-source vulnerability scanners 1. Network Vulnerability Scanners Network vulnerability scanners monitor web servers, their operating systems, their daemons and any other services open to the internet such as database services. Network vulnerability scanners work against a database of known vulnerabilities. Many of these databases rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program’s free and comprehensive catalog of known software and firmware vulnerabilities. Each standardized record is comprised of a unique CVE identifier, a brief description, and at least one public reference. Going one step further, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) enriches the CVE List with a numerical score of the vulnerability’s technical severity. However, the best network vulnerability scanning results are achieved with proprietary vulnerability databases that continuously aggregate and analyze information from a wide range of sources. A good example is the Snyk Vulnerability Database, which is tightly integrated with vulnerability databases, threat intelligence systems, community sources, and academia. Hand-curated by a dedicated security team, Snyk’s Vulnerability Database optimizes network vulnerability scanners so that they can deliver accurate and actionable insights. This heightened ability to extract maximal insights into network vulnerabilities is important for operational reasons as well. The not-for-profit Center for Internet Security (CIS) maintains a set of CIS Controls to help organizations implement cybersecurity best practices. One of the basic controls is that vulnerability management—including scanning—be continuous. However, because network vulnerability scans can cause congestion, scans are typically carried out only once a week. It is therefore critical that these scans be carried out against an enriched database that provides comprehensive coverage into known and unknown vulnerabilities. 2. Web Application/Website Vulnerability Scanners Web vulnerability scanners scan application/website code to find vulnerabilities that compromise the application/website itself or its back-end services. They are an essential component of application security testing. These scanners work against a known list of common exploits as maintained by OWASP and others. These exploits use various injection and evasion techniques to “hijack” web applications and websites in order to exfiltrate data, to trick users or systems into providing sensitive information, or to disrupt application performance. Some of the better known exploits are SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, and malicious code. When it comes to web applications, the only effective vulnerability management strategy is to adopt a shift-left DevSecOps approach and deploy scanners throughout a secure SDLC (software development life cycle). This battery of scanners includes static application security tools (SAST) that automatically scan uncompiled code for vulnerabilities, and dynamic application security tools (DAST) that automatically scan compiled code across all environments from testing to production. Another important tool is penetration testing, which essentially simulates hackers in order to discover if a web application or website is vulnerable to malicious exploits. There are even website vulnerability scanner online services that conduct third-party penetration testing. The Snyk SAST solution has been designed from the ground up to overcome the challenges that developers and ethical hackers face with legacy SAST tools, such as taking hours or even days to complete a scan, high false positive rates, and requiring deep security knowledge to remedy issues. With Snyk Code, SAST becomes a seamless part of the development process, providing developers and security teams with real-time and accurate visibility into code vulnerabilities and how to fix them. 3. Open-Source Vulnerability Scanners Open-source vulnerability scanners are software composition analysis (SCA) tools that scan applications to discover all open-source frameworks and libraries—including all direct and indirect dependencies—and identify vulnerabilities. Some open-source vulnerability scanners also help developers in the non-trivial task of precisely locating the vulnerable code in the codebase. Seeing that using components with known vulnerabilities is one of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, organizations must ensure that they are using a state-of-the-art open-source vulnerability scanner. The advantages of the Snyk open-source vulnerability scanner include: Early detection of open-source code vulnerabilities, before web applications or websites have been compromised. Prompt discovery of all instances affected by a detected open-source code vulnerability, so that attackers can be locked out and issues can be remediated faster. Clear documentation of all open-source frameworks and libraries used in applications. Ensures compliance with open-source license requirements. How to Evaluate a Vulnerability Scanner The good news is that there are many commercial and free vulnerability scanners available on the market today. However the flip side to that is that having so many options can make it difficult to evaluate which scanner stack is optimal for your requirements. The first step is to learn more about the vulnerability scanners. OWASP maintains a comprehensive listing of commercial and free vulnerability scanners, although they refrain from ranking them. Other trusted influencers provide “Top xx” lists of recommended scanners. Once you have created a short list of vulnerability scanners, you can try them out. Even the commercial vulnerability scanners offer free trials so that you can kick the tires before making a final decision. Given the diverse set of vulnerability scanners that you will have to deploy in order to achieve end-to-end coverage across all your environments, you may also want to consider a vulnerability management platform that knows how to integrate with all your scanners and correlate their outputs into a single source of vulnerability management truth. Why is vulnerability scanning important? Vulnerability scanning is the essential front end of any vulnerability management program. Today, vulnerability management is no longer a nice-to-have but rather a business-critical requirement for any organization running web applications or interactive websites. These kinds of public-facing assets are common attack vectors for malicious actors seeking unauthorized access to systems and data. What are the types of vulnerability scans? Vulnerability scans differ depending on how they are deployed and what they are scanning. Scans can be internal or external, credentialed or non-credentialed, and comprehensive or device-specific. The optimal operating modality depends on what is being scanned: networks, web applications throughout the secure software development life cycle, or open-source codes and libraries.","completion":"Chapter 1: Introduction to Vulnerability Scanners 1.1. Definition and Core Concepts Vulnerability scanners are automated tools that help identify and assess known weaknesses within computers, networks, applications, and systems. These scanners are integral in uncovering vulnerabilities caused by misconfigurations, flawed programming, or security lapses in network assets like routers, servers, and applications. By scanning for vulnerabilities, they facilitate the detection, classification, and prioritization of potential security threats, serving both as proactive defenders and informers. The nature of these tools can vary, including software-based SaaS models delivered over the internet or hardware-based solutions integrated into a network’s infrastructure. With modern advancements, vulnerability scanners now perform both authenticated and unauthenticated scans. Authenticated scans allow for a comprehensive analysis of the system by logging in with administrative credentials, thereby providing a thorough picture that includes details on installed software, configuration issues, and missing patches. On the other hand, unauthenticated scans offer a more external perspective that, although swifter, can lead to higher instances of false positives and less detailed findings. 1.2. Importance in Cybersecurity In the realm of cybersecurity, vulnerability scanners play a pivotal role. These tools are at the forefront of security strategies, acting as the first defense against potential breaches. By analyzing a system for existing vulnerabilities, the scanners provide insights necessary to strengthen defenses before an attacker can exploit the system. The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense recognizes the continuous application of vulnerability scanning as an indispensable tool for sound cyber defense, highlighting the integral part these scanners play in maintaining the security integrity of networks and applications. 1.3. How it Works The operation of a vulnerability scanner can typically be distilled into four key steps. Initially, the scanner probes the network to detect active devices, recognizing open ports, identifying running operating systems, and cataloging applications. Following detection, it can generate a security report, which serves as an optional but informative step in the process. The third stage often involves assessing how the detected systems might react to interference, which involves simulating attack patterns to identify vulnerabilities that could potentially cause crashes or other disruptions. Vulnerability scanners straddle a line between being tools for malicious attackers and beneficial for security analysts. Predominantly, they are designed to be friendly tools, halting before causing any real damage—analyzing but never exploiting identified weaknesses. This allows organizations to preemptively address security holes before they can be maliciously exploited, providing a form of digital immune response system that is continually updated to tackle emerging threats. By utilizing various strategies, including probing and scanning at different intensities, vulnerability scanners aim to provide a comprehensive assessment and situational awareness of an organization's cyber health, shaping the overall strategy for defense and robust information security practices. In conclusion, vulnerability scanners stand as the guardians of information security, providing early detection and assessment critical for safeguarding digital assets within the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats."},{"prompt":"Extend this chapter with some useful technical data and little of product examples","completion":"Chapter 1: Introduction to Vulnerability Scanners 1.1. Definition and Core Concepts A vulnerability scanner is a specialized program that conducts automated security assessments on networks, applications, and systems to identify known weaknesses. These assessments are critical for pinpointing systemic issues such as misconfigurations or erroneous programming within network assets like firewalls, servers, and web applications. Modern scanners have evolved to conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans. An authenticated scan allows the vulnerability scanner to perform a more in-depth analysis by using administrative privileges to evaluate the status of security patches, software configurations, and system information. Contrastingly, unauthenticated scans mimic the perspective of an external threat actor, evaluating externally visible assets without the benefit of internal access to identify potential security risks. 1.2. Importance in Cybersecurity In cybersecurity, vulnerability scanners are indispensable. They serve a dual function of both threat detection and infosec auditing. Continual vulnerability scanning is a critical control for maintaining a robust cyber defense as advised by The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls. These tools equip organizations with the data they need to preemptively shore up defenses and address potential weak points before they can be exploited by adversaries. 1.3. How it Works The operation of a vulnerability scanner unfolds in several stages. The process begins with identifying active network devices, cataloging open ports, detecting operational systems, and enumerating applications and services. This initial discovery phase can leverage tools like port scanners and network mappers. Upon gathering system data, the scanner may proceed to compile a detailed security report, identifying potential and known vulnerabilities - an invaluable resource for security teams. These scanners avoid causing harm to operations, namely stopping short of actively exploiting any weaknesses, unlike the methods employed by cyber attackers. They range from light-touch scans that quickly identify glaring weaknesses to deep, rigorous examinations of system responses to emulated cyber-attacks. Vulnerability scanners like Nessus, OpenVAS, and Retina have been ranked among the top tools in the field for their comprehensive scanning capabilities and robust reporting features. Port scanners, such as Nmap, serve as one example of a lower-level tool that integrates into a scanner's arsenal, assisting in the identification of available services that may be vulnerable to compromise. Moreover, web application vulnerability scanners like OWASP ZAP can expose issues within web applications including Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection, through Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). On the proprietary spectrum, commercial vulnerability scanners like QualysGuard, which operates as a web service, and Core Impact, an automated penetration testing tool, provide deeper, more sophisticated analysis. These tools enrich their findings through databases like CVE and proprietary intelligence to deliver precise and actionable insights. Open source dependencies are another area where tools such as OpenVAS and the Snyk Vulnerability Database shine. They unpack the complexities of software dependencies to pinpoint vulnerable code within open-source libraries and frameworks. In enterprise environments, systems like Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and Cisco’s Secure Network Scanning Tools help to maintain organizational compliance and security oversight. Ultimately, the extensive capabilities of vulnerability scanners aim to create round-the-clock situational awareness, ensuring a proactive stance in a constantly shifting cybersecurity landscape."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this chapter on russian","completion":"Глава 1: Введение в сканеры уязвимостей 1.1. Определение и основные понятия Сканер уязвимостей — это специализированная программа, выполняющая автоматизированную оценку безопасности сетей, приложений и систем в целях выявления известных слабостей. Эти оценки критически важны для выявления системных проблем, таких как неправильная конфигурация или ошибочное программирование в сетевых активах, включая межсетевые экраны, серверы и веб-приложения. Современные сканеры развились до проведения как аутентифицированных, так и неаутентифицированных сканирований. Аутентифицированное сканирование позволяет сканеру уязвимостей проводить более глубокий анализ, используя административные привилегии для оценки статуса патчей безопасности, конфигураций программного обеспечения и системной информации. Напротив, неаутентифицированные сканирования имитируют взгляд внешнего угрожающего актора, оценивая внешние активы без преимущества внутреннего доступа для идентификации потенциальных рисков безопасности. 1.2. Важность в кибербезопасности В области кибербезопасности сканеры уязвимостей незаменимы. Они выполняют двойную функцию — обнаружения угроз и аудита информационной безопасности. Постоянное сканирование на уязвимости является критическим контролем для поддержания надежной киберзащиты, как советует наставление Критических Контрольных Механизмов Центра Интернет Безопасности (CIS). Эти инструменты обеспечивают организации данными, необходимыми для предварительного укрепления защиты и устранения потенциальных слабых мест до того, как они могут быть использованы противниками. 1.3. Как это работает Процесс работы сканера уязвимостей разворачивается в несколько этапов. Процесс начинается с определения активных сетевых устройств, каталогизации открытых портов, обнаружения работающих операционных систем и перечисления приложений и услуг. Этот начальный этап может использовать инструменты, такие как порт-сканеры и картографы сети. После сбора системных данных сканер может перейти к составлению подробного отчета о безопасности, в котором указываются потенциальные и известные уязвимости - незаменимый ресурс для команд безопасности. Эти сканеры избегают причинения вреда операциям, а именно останавливаются до активного использования обнаруженных слабых сторон, в отличие от методов, используемых кибератакующими. Они варьируются от легких сканирований, которые быстро идентифицируют очевидные слабости, до глубоких, тщательных исследований системного ответа на эмулированные кибератаки. Сканеры уязвимостей, такие как Nessus, OpenVAS и Retina, были включены в число лучших инструментов в своей области благодаря своим всесторонним возможностям сканирования и мощным отчетным функциям. Порт-сканеры, такие как Nmap, служат одним из примеров вспомогательного инструмента, интегрированного в арсенал сканера, помогающего в идентификации доступных услуг, которые могут быть уязвимы для компрометации. Кроме того, сканеры уязвимостей веб-приложений, такие как OWASP ZAP, могут выявить проблемы в веб-приложениях, включая межсайтовый скриптинг (XSS) и SQL-инъекции, через динамическое тестирование безопасности приложений (DAST). На проприетарном спектре коммерческие сканеры уязвимостей, такие как QualysGuard, который работает как веб-сервис, и Core Impact, автоматизированный инструмент тестирования на проникновение, обеспечивают более глубокий и сложный анализ. Эти инструменты обогащают свои результаты через базы данных, такие как CVE и собственные источники разведки, чтобы предоставить точные и осуществимые инсайты. Сканеры уязвимостей исходного кода, такие как OpenVAS и база данных уязвимостей Snyk, выделяются в области анализа зависимостей программного обеспечения, выявляя уязвимый код в открытых библиотеках и фреймворках. В корпоративных средах системы, такие как Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) и Сетевые Инструменты Сканирования Безопасности Cisco, помогают поддерживать организационное соответствие и контроль безопасности. В конечном итоге, обширные возможности сканеров уязвимостей направлены на создание круглосуточного ситуационного осознания, обеспечивая проактивную позицию в постоянно меняющемся ландшафте кибербезопасности."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Hood: “Ah!

En AFC, el factor (o constructo latente) no se observa directamente sino que se infiere a partir de varias variables observadas (ítems). Dicho esto, si quieres realizar una regresión lineal con una variable objetivo que es un factor confirmatorio calculado a partir de un AFC, tendrás que seguir una serie de pasos que fusionen ambos análisis. Una forma de hacer esto sería: 1. Realización del AFC: Primero, realiza un análisis factorial confirmatorio utilizando las variables observadas que reflejan el constructo latente (tu variable objetivo). Este proceso te permitirá verificar la validez de la construcción de tu variable objetivo y obtener las cargas factoriales para cada una de las variables observadas. 2. Calcular los puntajes factoriales: Una vez confirmado el modelo y obtenidas las cargas factoriales, puedes calcular los puntajes factoriales para cada observación en tu conjunto de datos. Un puntaje factorial es una puntuación estimada para cada caso en el factor latente. Existen diferentes métodos para calcular puntajes factoriales, incluyendo el método de regresión, el método de Bartlett y otros. 3. Utilizar los puntajes factoriales como variable objetivo en el análisis de regresión: Los puntajes factoriales obtenidos pueden entonces utilizarse como si fueran la variable dependiente en una regresión lineal. Aquí se puede llevar a cabo una regresión lineal múltiple utilizando las variables independientes de interés para predecir la variable dependiente compuesta (puntaje factorial). 4. Estimar la regresión lineal: Ahora, con los puntajes factoriales como variable dependiente, puedes proceder a estimar el modelo de regresión lineal aplicando métodos estadísticos estándar, como el método de mínimos cuadrados ordinarios (MCO). Analiza los coeficientes de regresión, el ajuste del modelo (por ejemplo, R cuadrado), los intervalos de confianza y las pruebas de significancia de los predictores. Es importante tener en cuenta que al utilizar los puntajes factoriales como variable dependiente en regresión, asumes que la variable compuesta que has creado a través del AFC tiene propiedades métricas y se comporta de manera lineal en relación con las variables independientes, lo cual es una suposición que debería ser verificada. Este enfoque híbrido de combinar AFC con regresión lineal puede ser poderoso, pero también conlleva complejidades adicionales en interpretación y validación que no están presentes cuando se trabaja con variables observadas directamente."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Hood: “Ah!

🐉夏朝：传说中的“发明家”——大禹，他不是盖的，主要解决了洪水bù bù停的大问题，这操作真是“给力”，我们称他为模范帝王大禹。 2. 商朝：这个时候的老大叫成汤，这位兄dei，干了件大事：推翻殷商，拉开了商朝的序幕。后面的“炮灰”中，最后一任帝王纣王，他简直就是个“扑街”，让大家都不满意，最终被周武王给灭了。 3. 周朝：分西周和东周两个超长待机时间的时期。“领风骚”的西周有个叫周公旦的操作牛气冲天，他一手推行周礼，“分封制”的游戏让诸侯国都沉迷。“戴帽子”的东周，分春秋和战国两个DLC，韩信、诸葛亮之类的人物都是这时候的boss。 4. 秦朝：铁榔头嬴政上场，“一统江湖”打造中央集权制度，长城、兵马俑都是他的得意作品，就是在位时间“666”（短），外号“秦始皇帝”。 5. 汉朝： “开拓者”刘邦一刀一个小朋友，建立了西汉。“英雄”汉武帝则是真·玩家，推出“驰骋疆场”外传，打开丝绸之路章节。东汉时期，“大医生”张仲景撰写了《伤寒杂病论》，这技能点了个满。 6. 三国：阵容分得清——“蜀汉”刘备圈粉无数、“魏国”曹操脑子超好使、“吴国”孙权杰出世家。这段时间的PVP模式简直太燃了，经典战役“赤壁之战”是“吴国”赢得的带感局。 7. 晋朝：西晋时司马炎一锤定音，统一王朝。可是，接下来的“八王之乱”把好局给打砸了。东晋则混个脸熟，没啥特别热闹。 8. 南北朝：南边儿和北边儿分庭抗礼，南朝宋、南朝齐、南朝梁、南朝陈“接龙”，北朝多得像朝代乱斗赛。 9. 隋朝：一言不合就“一统天下”的隋文帝和隋炀帝，修完了“大邮路”，挖了“京杭大运河”。不过，炀帝的土豪行为“烧钱”太狠，让隋朝荣光短暂，很快就“over”了。 10. 唐朝： “文化输出”举世无双，武则天还成了“女王大人”，很是“霸气侧漏”。唐太宗李世民深得民心，而“玄奘西行”让《大唐西域记》成了人人必读的冒险小说。 哎呦，不说了，小编要盘点的朝代实在太多啦！上面这些只是中国历史的开胃小菜，小伙伴们，想要更多详细的历史gank（攻击），一定要等小编的书出版喔！在这个跌宕起伏的历史长河中，“故事”真是“连篇累牍”，“震撼”就像是一顿“跨越千年”的时间盛宴，等着你们来细细品尝！📚🎨🏰"},{"prompt":"按以上的纲要，现在请详细写夏朝的历史","completion":"好的，亲爱的小伙伴们，让我们开启穿越之旅的第一站——夏朝，这是中国最routes

Is the bacterium excreted through urine and is it transmitted from one person to another?","completion":"Weil's disease is a severe form of leptospirosis, which is a bacterial infection caused by Leptospira interrogans. Humans are generally accidental hosts for the bacteria and are not considered natural reservoirs for the disease. The primary reservoirs are typically wild and domestic animals, including rodents, dogs, livestock, and wildlife. These animals may carry the bacteria without showing symptoms and can shed the bacteria in their urine. Leptospira bacteria can survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Humans can become infected through direct contact with the urine of infected animals or with a contaminated environment, such as water or soil that contains the bacteria. The bacteria can enter the body through cuts or abrasions on the skin, or through the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. While person-to-person transmission of leptospirosis is rare, it is theoretically possible, particularly through contact with the urine of an infected person. Nevertheless, there have been very few documented cases of such transmission, and it is not considered a significant route of infection. Instead, the main concern for transmission is exposure to environments contaminated with the urine of infected animals. If diagnosed with leptospirosis, individuals are usually treated with antibiotics. During the acute phase of the illness, it is prudent to follow good hygiene practices to minimize any potential risk of transmission, although this risk remains low. In summary, humans are not typical reservoirs for leptospirosis or Weil's disease, and while the bacteria can be excreted through urine, person-to-person transmission is very uncommon."},{"prompt":"Привет","completion":"Привет!

Определите долю масла в общем весе блюда: 40 г масла делить на 1350 г блюда = 0.02963 (округляя до пяти знаков после запятой). 2. Умножьте полученную долю на 100, чтобы найти вес масла на 100 г блюда: 0.02963 * 100 г = 2.963 г. Итак, на каждые 100 грамм блюда приходится примерно 2.963 грамм масла. Если округлить до двух знаков после запятой, получится, что на 100 грамм блюда приходится около 2.96 грамма масла."},{"prompt":"сколько белка в 3 граммах сливочного масла","completion":"Сливочное масло содержит немного белка. В среднем, 100 грамм сливочного масла содержат около 0.85 грамма белка. Соответственно, чтобы рассчитать количество белка в 3 граммах сливочного масла, можно выполнить следующий расчёт: (0.85 грамма белка / 100 грамм масла) * 3 грамма масла = 0.0255 грамма белка Таким образом, в 3 граммах сливочного масла содержится примерно 0.0255 грамма белка. Это значение округлено до четырех знаков после запятой, но из-за того, что содержание белка в таком небольшом количестве масла очень мало, величина должна рассматриваться как приблизительная."},{"prompt":"сколько белка в 150 граммах репчатого лука","completion":"Среднее содержание белка в репчатом луке составляет около 1.1 грамма на 100 грамм. Для расчета количества белка в 150 граммах репчатого лука выполним следующий расчет: (1.1 г белка / 100 г лука) * 150 г лука = 1.65 г белка Таким образом, в 150 граммах репчатого лука содержится примерно 1.65 грамма белка. Обратите внимание, что это значение является приблизительным, так как конкретное содержание белка может меняться в зависимости от сорта лука и условий его выращивания."},{"prompt":"сколько белка, омега 3 , омега6 и омега9 в 3 граммах сливочного масла","completion":"Сливочное масло содержит небольшое количество белка, а основной его состав — это жиры, в том числе насыщенные жирные кислоты. Содержание жирных кислот Омега-3, Омега-6 и Омега-9 в сливочном масле также не является его характерной особенностью, ведь оно богато преимущественно насыщенными жирами. Для точного определения содержания белка и жирных кислот в сливочном масле, необходимо рассматривать конкретные лабораторные данные, так как состав может немного отличаться в зависимости от производителя и конкретного продукта. Однако, на основе средних данных: - Белок в 100 граммах сливочного масла составляет около 0.85 грамма, а значит, в 3 граммах будет (3 г times (0.85 г / 100 г) = 0.0255 г) белка (приблизительно). - Омега-3 и Омега-6: Сливочное масло содержит их в очень малом количестве, оно не является значимым источником этих жирных кислот по сравнению с другими продуктами, такими как жирная рыба или льняное масло для Омега-3 и масла из семян растений для Омега-6. Точное количество в 3 граммах будет минимально и для расчета потребуются точные лабораторные данные, которые у меня отсутствуют. - Омега-9 представлена в сливочном масле в виде олеиновой кислоты, но опять же её доля не является доминирующей по сравнению с насыщенными жирными кислотами. Точные значения содержания Омега-9 на 3 грамма сливочного масла также требуют специфической информации о продукте. Обратите внимание на то, что данные о жирных кислотах в сливочном масле могут значительно различаться, и для получения точных цифр предпочтительно обращаться к пищевым таблицам, этикеткам или публикациям с анализом конкретных марок продуктов."},{"prompt":"напиши в цифрах","completion":"Конечно, вот приблизительные значения в цифрах для 3 грамм сливочного масла: - Белок: (0.0255 text{г}) (или примерно (0.03 text{г}) после округления) - Омега-3, Омега-6, Омега-9: К сожалению, без конкретных лабораторных данных о содержании этих жирных кислот в сливочном масле определенного производства невозможно предоставить точные цифры для такого малого количества продукта. Однако, можно с уверенностью сказать, что количество будет очень мало и измеряться будет в миллиграммах или даже меньших единицах. Чтобы получить эти данные, нужно обратиться к нутриционным таблицам конкретного сливочного масла, которое вы используете, но в целом сливочное масло — это не источник этих жирных кислот. Большая часть жира в сливочном масле — это насыщенные жирные кислоты."},{"prompt":"сколько белка, омега 3 , омега6 и омега9 в 40 граммах сливочного масла","completion":"Опираясь на общие пищевые данные для сливочного масла, можем указать следующее содержание для 40 граммов продукта: Белок в сливочном масле: - Содержание белка в сливочном масле очень мало, примерно 0.85 г на 100 г. Для 40 г это будет: (0.85 г/100 г times 40 г = 0.34 г) Итак, примено 0.34 грамма белка в 40 граммах сливочного масла. Омега-3, Омега-6 и Омега-9: - В сливочном масле содержание омега-3 и омега-6 жирных кислот также очень мало. - Пропорция омега-9 в сливочном масле (главной из которых является олеиновая кислота) выше, чем омега-3 и омега-6, но в целом сливочное масло все равно содержит главным образом насыщенные жиры. Значения для этих жирных кислот варьируются в зависимости от производителя и типа масла, но они находятся в пределах следующих диапазонов (на 100 г сливочного масла): - Омега-3: от 0.1% до 1%, что равно примерно 0.1 г до 1 г. - Омега-6: от 2% до 4%, что равно примерно 2 г до 4 г. - Омега-9: выше по доле, но конкретные цифры сильно зависят от исходного продукта. Для 40 г мы могли бы оценить содержание (если брать примерное среднее значение): - Омега-3: (0.5 г/100 г times 40 г = 0.2 г) - Омега-6: (3 г/100 г times 40 г = 1.2 г) - Омега-9: без точных данных складывается трудность с расчетом, но в среднем его содержание может быть в приблизительно в 2-3 раза выше, чем омега-6. Пожалуйста, имейте в виду, что это очень приблизительные расчеты. Для точного определения содержания нутриентов в сливочном масле, конкретные значения следует искать на упаковке продукта или в надежных пищевых базах данных."},{"prompt":"сколько белка, омега 3 , омега6 и омега9 в 11 граммах репчатого лука","completion":"Для репчатого лука типичный состав на 100 грамм может быть следующим: - Белок: около 1.1 грамма - Омега-3, омега-6 и омега-9: омега-3 и омега-6 есть в луке, но в очень небольших количествах, а омега-9 (не являясь основным жиром в луке) присутствует в еще меньшем количестве. Чтобы рассчитать содержание белка и этим жирных кислот в 11 граммах репчатого лука, выполним следующие пропорциональные вычисления с учетом среднего содержания на 100 грамм продукта: 1. Белок: ( (1.1 г/100 г) times 11 г = 0.121 г ) Итак, в 11 граммах репчатого лука содержится примерно 0.121 грамма белка. 2. Омега-3, омега-6 и омега-9: Конкретные количества омега-3, омега-6 и омега-9 в луке столь малы, что без точных аналитических данных трудно предоставить специфические значения для 11 граммов продукта. Обычно в нутриционных таблицах эти данные для лука просто не указываются из-за ничтожной концентрации. Итак, в целом можно сказать, что 11 граммов репчатого лука будет содержать заметное количество белка и очень небольшое количество жирных кислот, в цифровом выражении которое, скорее всего, будет меньше одного миллиграмма и без точных аналитических данных не поддастся точному расчёту."},{"prompt":"сколько белка, омега 3 , омега 6 и омег 9 в 11 граммах пармезана","completion":"Пармезан — это сыр с высоким содержанием белка и жира, но информация о конкретном содержании омега-3, омега-6 и омега-9 в пармезане может варьироваться в зависимости от источника и производителя. Для примера, рассмотрим следующие средние показатели содержания на 100 г пармезана: - Белок: около 38 граммов - Омега-3 и омега-6: содержатся в небольших количествах, которые редко указываются за пределами специализированных пищевых анализов - Омега-9: в молочных продуктах присутствуют, но информация о конкретных значениях в пармезане обычно не предоставляется публично Теперь расчитаем приблизительное содержание белка в 11 граммах пармезана: 1. Белок: ( (38 г/100 г) times 11 г = 4.18 г ) Таким образом, в 11 граммах пармезана содержится примерно 4.18 грамма белка.

Chapter value is 500-600 words. Use only information related with chapter topic: Chapter 2: Advantages of Vulnerability Scanners 2.1. Detection and Prevention Capabilities 2.2. Automation and Efficiency 2.3. Regulatory Compliance and Reporting A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computers, networks or applications for known weaknesses. These scanners are used to discover the weaknesses of a given system. They are utilized in the identification and detection of vulnerabilities arising from mis-configurations or flawed programming within a network-based asset such as a firewall, router, web server, application server, etc. Modern vulnerability scanners allow for both authenticated and unauthenticated scans. Modern scanners are typically available as SaaS (Software as a Service); provided over the internet and delivered as a web application. The modern vulnerability scanner often has the ability to customize vulnerability reports as well as the installed software, open ports, certificates and other host information that can be queried as part of its workflow. Authenticated scans allow for the scanner to directly access network based assets using remote administrative protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP) and authenticate using provided system credentials. This allows the vulnerability scanner to access low-level data, such as specific services and configuration details of the host operating system. It's then able to provide detailed and accurate information about the operating system and installed software, including configuration issues and missing security patches.[1] Unauthenticated scans is a method that can result in a high number of false positives and is unable to provide detailed information about the assets operating system and installed software. This method is typically used by threat actors or security analyst trying determine the security posture of externally accessible assets.[1] Vulnerability scanners should be able to detect the risks in open-source dependencies. However, since developers will usually re-bundle the OSS, the same code will appear in different dependencies, which will then impact the performance and ability of scanners to detect the vulnerable OSS.[2] The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense designates continuous vulnerability scanning as a critical control for effective cyber defense. Vulnerability scanners are software or hardware tools used to diagnose and monitor network computers, allowing you to scan networks, computers and applications to detect possible security problems, assess and eliminate vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners allow you to check various applications in your system for holes that could be exploited by attackers. Low-level tools, such as a port scanner, can also be used to identify and analyze possible applications and protocols running on the system. 1 Types of vulnerability scanners 2 Software 3 See also 4 Notes 5 Literature Types of Vulnerability Scanners The work of a vulnerability scanner can be divided into 4 steps: Typically, the scanner first detects active IP addresses, open ports, running operating system and applications. A security report is generated (optional step). Attempting to determine the level of possible interference with the operating system or applications (may result in a crash). At the final stage, the scanner can exploit the vulnerability, causing the operating system or application to crash. Scanners can be malicious or friendly. The latter usually stop at step 2 or 3, but never get to step 4. Among the vulnerability scanners we can highlight: Port scanner Scanners examining the topology of a computer network Scanners that examine network service vulnerabilities Network worms CGI scanners (\\"friendly\\" - help find vulnerable scripts) Software Top ten vulnerability scanners according to insecure.org (2006)[1] Nessus: Vulnerability Assessment for UNIX GFI LANguard: Commercial network vulnerability scanner for Windows Retina: A commercial vulnerability assessment scanner Core Impact: Automated intrusion testing product ISS Internet Scanner: Application Level Vulnerability Assessment X-scan: Network vulnerability scanner Sara: Security Auditor's Research Assistant QualysGuard: Vulnerability scanner (web service) SAINT: Security Administrator's Integrated Network Tool MBSA: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Other well-known vulnerability scanners: XSpider OpenVAS ERPScan SAP security scanner SurfPatrol COMPLAUD RedCheck Web Application Vulnerability Scanners are automated tools that scan web applications, normally from the outside, to look for security vulnerabilities such as Cross-site scripting, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal and insecure server configuration. This category of tools is frequently referred to as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools. A large number of both commercial and open source tools of this type are available and all of these tools have their own strengths and weaknesses. If you are interested in the effectiveness of DAST tools, check out the OWASP Benchmark project, which is scientifically measuring the effectiveness of all types of vulnerability detection tools, including DAST. OWASP is aware of the Web Application Vulnerability Scanner Evaluation Project (WAVSEP). WAVSEP is completely unrelated to OWASP and we do not endorse its results, nor any of the DAST tools it evaluates. However, the results provided by WAVSEP may be helpful to someone interested in researching or selecting free and/or commercial DAST tools for their projects. This project has far more detail on DAST tools and their features than this OWASP DAST page. Vulnerability scanner - a software or hardware product for searching for threats in infrastructure companies. The scanner is used to detect gaps in network protection, operating systems, databases, applications, etc. The main task is to assess information security, identify vulnerabilities and provide reports. Using a scanner, an administrator can find “holes” that hackers use to obtain unauthorized access (NAA) to confidential data on the company network. A vulnerability scanner can monitor running processes, services and scan used ports. Vulnerability scanner - a software or hardware product for searching for threats in infrastructure companies.

Using a scanner, an administrator can find “holes” that hackers use to obtain unauthorized access (NAA) to confidential data on the company network. A vulnerability scanner can monitor running processes, services and scan used ports. Main functions The software product has the following functions: How the scanner works searches for various types of network vulnerabilities and analyzes them in real time; checks network resources, OS, connected devices, ports; analyzes all active processes and the behavior of running applications; creates reports that indicate the type of vulnerability. Probing. An effective but slow way to find and analyze vulnerabilities. Its essence is that the solution initiates virtual attacks and monitors the network infrastructure to search for vulnerable points. By At the end of the process, the administrator is provided with a detailed report indicating the problems found and recommendations for their deactivation. Scanning. In this mode, the scanner operates at the maximum possible speed, but analyzes the network infrastructure at the surface level. That is, it detects obvious vulnerabilities and analyzes the overall infrastructure security. Compared to the previous method, this method only warns about found administrator problems, but nothing more. What actions does a vulnerability scanner perform? Scanners can be \\"friendly\\" or \\"aggressive\\". The first type simply collects information and does not model attack. The second exploits the vulnerability to cause software to crash. Collects information from the entire infrastructure: active processes, running applications, running ports and devices, services, etc. Search for potential vulnerabilities using different methods. Uses special methods of simulating attacks to find possible vulnerabilities (the function is not available in every scanner). Generates a detailed report with information about found vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners are the front line of vulnerability management. They are essential for identifying vulnerabilities that could be used by bad actors to compromise systems and data. In the old days of monolithic on-premise applications, vulnerability scanners were deployed primarily in the production environment as infrastructure watchdogs that alerted to runtime threats. This paradigm became obsolete with the emergence of cloud-native applications that leverage the powerful scalability and agility of modern cloud-based infrastructure. As applications and the tools to secure them become more complex, solutions like ASPM are emerging to bring together the different data streams and enable risk based prioritization and remediation. Today’s highly automated CI/CD pipelines cannot tolerate security testing bottlenecks. The detection and remediation of vulnerabilities must keep up with the frenetic pace of mature DevOps practices. Yet another challenge to legacy security paradigms is the highly distributed architecture of cloud-native applications, based on dynamic components such as open-source libraries, serverless functions, infrastructure as code (IaC), and containers. In short, cloud-native applications require a new cloud-native application security paradigm: ensuring that vulnerabilities are detected and fixed during development with a holistic approach that makes security an integral part of the software development life cycle (SDLC). In this article, we describe the different kinds of vulnerability scanners that, together, provide cloud-native security coverage for websites, web applications, networks, open-source code, WordPress content, and containers (such as our Docker scanner). 3 Most common types of scanners Network vulnerability scanners Web application vulnerability scanners Open-source vulnerability scanners 1. Network Vulnerability Scanners Network vulnerability scanners monitor web servers, their operating systems, their daemons and any other services open to the internet such as database services. Network vulnerability scanners work against a database of known vulnerabilities. Many of these databases rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program’s free and comprehensive catalog of known software and firmware vulnerabilities. Each standardized record is comprised of a unique CVE identifier, a brief description, and at least one public reference. Going one step further, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) enriches the CVE List with a numerical score of the vulnerability’s technical severity. However, the best network vulnerability scanning results are achieved with proprietary vulnerability databases that continuously aggregate and analyze information from a wide range of sources. A good example is the Snyk Vulnerability Database, which is tightly integrated with vulnerability databases, threat intelligence systems, community sources, and academia. Hand-curated by a dedicated security team, Snyk’s Vulnerability Database optimizes network vulnerability scanners so that they can deliver accurate and actionable insights. This heightened ability to extract maximal insights into network vulnerabilities is important for operational reasons as well. The not-for-profit Center for Internet Security (CIS) maintains a set of CIS Controls to help organizations implement cybersecurity best practices. One of the basic controls is that vulnerability management—including scanning—be continuous. However, because network vulnerability scans can cause congestion, scans are typically carried out only once a week. It is therefore critical that these scans be carried out against an enriched database that provides comprehensive coverage into known and unknown vulnerabilities. 2. Web Application/Website Vulnerability Scanners Web vulnerability scanners scan application/website code to find vulnerabilities that compromise the application/website itself or its back-end services. They are an essential component of application security testing. These scanners work against a known list of common exploits as maintained by OWASP and others. These exploits use various injection and evasion techniques to “hijack” web applications and websites in order to exfiltrate data, to trick users or systems into providing sensitive information, or to disrupt application performance. Some of the better known exploits are SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, and malicious code. When it comes to web applications, the only effective vulnerability management strategy is to adopt a shift-left DevSecOps approach and deploy scanners throughout a secure SDLC (software development life cycle). This battery of scanners includes static application security tools (SAST) that automatically scan uncompiled code for vulnerabilities, and dynamic application security tools (DAST) that automatically scan compiled code across all environments from testing to production. Another important tool is penetration testing, which essentially simulates hackers in order to discover if a web application or website is vulnerable to malicious exploits. There are even website vulnerability scanner online services that conduct third-party penetration testing. The Snyk SAST solution has been designed from the ground up to overcome the challenges that developers and ethical hackers face with legacy SAST tools, such as taking hours or even days to complete a scan, high false positive rates, and requiring deep security knowledge to remedy issues. With Snyk Code, SAST becomes a seamless part of the development process, providing developers and security teams with real-time and accurate visibility into code vulnerabilities and how to fix them. 3. Open-Source Vulnerability Scanners Open-source vulnerability scanners are software composition analysis (SCA) tools that scan applications to discover all open-source frameworks and libraries—including all direct and indirect dependencies—and identify vulnerabilities. Some open-source vulnerability scanners also help developers in the non-trivial task of precisely locating the vulnerable code in the codebase. Seeing that using components with known vulnerabilities is one of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, organizations must ensure that they are using a state-of-the-art open-source vulnerability scanner. The advantages of the Snyk open-source vulnerability scanner include: Early detection of open-source code vulnerabilities, before web applications or websites have been compromised. Prompt discovery of all instances affected by a detected open-source code vulnerability, so that attackers can be locked out and issues can be remediated faster. Clear documentation of all open-source frameworks and libraries used in applications. Ensures compliance with open-source license requirements. How to Evaluate a Vulnerability Scanner The good news is that there are many commercial and free vulnerability scanners available on the market today. However the flip side to that is that having so many options can make it difficult to evaluate which scanner stack is optimal for your requirements. The first step is to learn more about the vulnerability scanners. OWASP maintains a comprehensive listing of commercial and free vulnerability scanners, although they refrain from ranking them. Other trusted influencers provide “Top xx” lists of recommended scanners. Once you have created a short list of vulnerability scanners, you can try them out. Even the commercial vulnerability scanners offer free trials so that you can kick the tires before making a final decision. Given the diverse set of vulnerability scanners that you will have to deploy in order to achieve end-to-end coverage across all your environments, you may also want to consider a vulnerability management platform that knows how to integrate with all your scanners and correlate their outputs into a single source of vulnerability management truth. Why is vulnerability scanning important? Vulnerability scanning is the essential front end of any vulnerability management program. Today, vulnerability management is no longer a nice-to-have but rather a business-critical requirement for any organization running web applications or interactive websites. These kinds of public-facing assets are common attack vectors for malicious actors seeking unauthorized access to systems and data. What are the types of vulnerability scans? Vulnerability scans differ depending on how they are deployed and what they are scanning. Scans can be internal or external, credentialed or non-credentialed, and comprehensive or device-specific. The optimal operating modality depends on what is being scanned: networks, web applications throughout the secure software development life cycle, or open-source codes and libraries.","completion":"Chapter 2: Advantages of Vulnerability Scanners 2.1. Detection and Prevention Capabilities At the core of a vulnerability scanner's value proposition is its ability to detect and preempt security threats. These scanners expertly identify weaknesses within a network's components—be it firewalls, routers, web servers, or application servers—arising from misconfigurations or flawed programming. By executing both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, they provide a comprehensive view of system vulnerabilities. Authenticated scans, which utilize administrative protocols such as SSH or RDP, access low-level data including service configurations and operating system details. This allows vulnerability scanners to offer detailed and specific insights into system weaknesses, like missing security patches and configuration issues. Unauthenticated scans, on the other hand, are generally leveraged to understand the security posture of systems accessible externally, although they may result in higher false positives and less detailed findings. Continuous vulnerability scanning, as outlined by the CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense, is a crucial control for robust cyber defense, emphasizing the importance of vulnerability scanners in maintaining security. 2.2. Automation and Efficiency Vulnerability scanners epitomize efficiency in cyber security practice by automating the scanning process. They perform a systematic examination of networks, operating systems, and applications to identify security gaps. By automating the detection of vulnerabilities, scanners significantly reduce the time and resources required to maintain secure systems. They start by detecting active IP addresses, open ports, and operating systems before generating security reports. Not content with surface-level analyses, these scanners delve deeper by simulating virtual attacks and probing the infrastructure to locate any points of potential exposure. While this proactive breach simulation is more time-consuming, it delivers valuable insights into system vulnerabilities. This process culminates in the production of detailed reports containing vital data on vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation. 2.3. Regulatory Compliance and Reporting One of the crucial advantages of vulnerability scanners is their contribution to regulatory compliance and the ease with which they allow reporting. Modern scanners, frequently available as SaaS, enable customized vulnerability reports that align with compliance requirements. Such reports include information on installed software, open ports, certificates, and a host of host information integral to an organization's risk management and compliance processes. Scanners provide assistance in monitoring compliance with various standards and regulations by routinely checking systems for vulnerabilities and generating accurate reports for audits. They also ensure that compliance is maintained in dynamic environments by continuously scanning for new threats or changes in system configurations and adjusting defenses accordingly. In conclusion, vulnerability scanners serve as vital instruments in the realm of cyber defense, streamlining security protocols while significantly reducing the likelihood of breaches through their advanced detection and prevention capabilities. They enhance operational efficiency by automating scans and pushing for proactive vulnerability management. Furthermore, they play an indispensable role in ensuring regulatory compliance, furnishing organizations with the necessary tools to generate precise reports for immediate action and audit purposes, thereby fortifying their cyber defenses to withstand present-day threats."},{"prompt":"Expand this chapter with some useful technical data and some examples","completion":"Chapter 2: Advantages of Vulnerability Scanners 2.1. Detection and Prevention Capabilities Enabled by their detection and prevention capabilities, vulnerability scanners are technical workhorses that provide comprehensive insights into system weaknesses. Leveraging databases such as the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program's catalog, scanners can cross-reference discovered vulnerabilities with standardized records and assess the severity using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). For example, an authenticated scan might use the given system credentials to log into a server via SSH, checking for the specific versions of installed software and determining whether security patches are up to date. By bypassing the generalities that plague unauthenticated scans, these scanners can eliminate a plethora of false positives and provide actionable data for IT teams. 2.2. Automation and Efficiency The automated nature of vulnerability scanners accentuates their efficiency. These scanners perform multi-step processes, initially conducting reconnaissance to detect active systems and open ports—this might involve a tool like Nmap, which is a network scanner used to discover hosts and services on a computer network. Subsequently, comprehensive reports are generated, akin to those from widely-recognized tools like Nessus, which can automate repetitive tasks and streamline remediation efforts. Consider a scenario where a network vulnerability scanner identifies a poorly configured web server that exposes sensitive company databases. Traditionally, such a discovery could have required days of manual work, but with scanning automation, these vulnerabilities are found in hours or even minutes. This expediency translates into reduced windows of opportunity for attackers and greater overall resilience for the organization. 2.3. Regulatory Compliance and Reporting For reporting and regulatory compliance, vulnerability scanners offer a degree of finesse and customizability crucial for modern businesses. Take, for instance, the QualysGuard scanner that not only performs comprehensive scans but also automatically compiles results into formats that adhere to compliance frameworks like PCI DSS for payment card industry security standards, or HIPAA for healthcare information privacy. To illustrate, a financial service using a DAST tool like OWASP ZAP might perform automated scans on their web applications to identify security flaws such as Cross-site scripting or SQL Injection, which are also part of the OWASP Top 10. These findings can then be integrated into compliance reports, demonstrating the organization's adherence to stringent security standards and contributing to a robust compliance profile. Moreover, vulnerability scanners like OpenVAS and ERPScan not only enhance the operational security by constant scanning but also assist in maintaining a comprehensive inventory of all open-source components, helping organizations to stay compliant with open-source license requirements and security standards. In the broader aspect of vulnerability management, scanners form an integrated part of ASPM (Application Security Posture Management) systems, which converge multiple streams of security data to prioritize risks. For cloud-native application environments, scanners need to encompass the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and integrate into CI/CD pipelines without causing bottlenecks—reflecting the shift-left paradigm where security is embedded from the earliest stages of development. Summarizing, vulnerability scanners are critical in the detection, prevention, and management of cyber risks, raising the bar for system security through comprehensive auditing and reporting. Modern vulnerability scanners are designed not just for remediation but as proactive guardians of IT ecosystems, fusing technical prowess with regulatory sensibility to forge environments resilient to both today's threats and tomorrow's challenges."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this chapter on russian","completion":"Глава 2: Преимущества сканеров уязвимостей 2.1. Возможности обнаружения и предотвращения Сканеры уязвимостей - это технические инструменты, которые предоставляют всесторонний анализ слабых мест системы. С помощью баз данных, таких как каталог Комплексной программы уязвимостей (CVE), они могут сопоставлять обнаруженные уязвимости со стандартизированными записями и оценивать серьезность, используя Систему оценки общих уязвимостей (CVSS). Например, аутентифицированный скан может использовать предоставленные системные учетные данные для входа на сервер по SSH, проверять версии установленного программного обеспечения и определять, обновлены ли патчи безопасности. Выходя за рамки общих данных, которые создают недостоверные результаты при неаутентифицированных сканах, эти инструменты предоставляют ИТ-командам данные, позволяющие предпринять конкретные действия. 2.2. Автоматизация и эффективность Автоматизация работы сканеров уязвимостей подчеркивает их эффективность. Эти системы выполняют многоэтапные процессы, начиная с разведки для обнаружения активных систем и открытых портов, что может включать использование таких инструментов, как Nmap — сетевой сканер для определения хостов и служб в компьютерной сети. После этого генерируются всесторонние отчеты, подобные тем, что создаются широко признанными инструментами вроде Nessus, которые могут автоматизировать повторяющиеся задачи и ускорять процесс устранения недостатков. Представьте ситуацию, в которой сетевой сканер уязвимостей обнаруживает плохо настроенный веб-сервер, который обеспечивает доступ к конфиденциальным корпоративным базам данных. Традиционно такое открытие потребовало бы дней ручной работы, но с автоматизацией сканирования эти уязвимости находятся в течение часов или даже минут. Такая оперативность приводит к сокращению возможностей для нападающих и повышению общей устойчивости организации. 2.3. Соответствие нормативным требованиям и отчетность В плане отчетности и соответствия нормативным требованиям сканеры уязвимостей предлагают уровень тонкости и настраиваемости, крайне необходимый для современных бизнесов. Возьмем, к примеру, сканер QualysGuard, который не только выполняет глубокое сканирование, но и автоматически составляет результаты в форматах, соответствующих таким стандартам соответствия, как PCI DSS для норм безопасности платежных карт или HIPAA для защиты конфиденциальности медицинской информации. Для иллюстрации, финансовая служба, использующая инструмент для динамического тестирования безопасности приложений (DAST) вроде OWASP ZAP, может выполнять автоматическое сканирование своих веб-приложений для выявления уязвимостей, таких как скриптинг на стороне клиента или SQL-инъекции, также входящих в OWASP Топ-10. Эти результаты затем можно интегрировать в отчеты о соответствии, демонстрирующие стремление организации к соблюдению строгих стандартов безопасности. Кроме того, сканеры уязвимостей, такие как OpenVAS и ERPScan, не только усиливают операционную безопасность за счет постоянного сканирования, но и помогают поддерживать полную инвентаризацию всех используемых в приложениях открытых компонентов, помогая организациям соответствовать требованиям лицензий на открытое программное обеспечение и стандартам безопасности. В более широком плане управления уязвимостями сканеры становятся интегрированной частью систем управления безопасностью приложений (ASPM), которые объединяют несколько потоков данных о безопасности для приоритизации рисков. В облачных средах сканеры должны охватывать весь жизненный цикл разработки программного обеспечения (SDLC) и интегрироваться в CI/CD-конвейеры без создания узких мест — отражая парадигму shift-left, где безопасность встраивается на самых ранних этапах разработки. Подводя итог, сканеры уязвимостей необходимы для обнаружения, предотвращения и управления киберрисками, повышая планку системной безопасности за счет всесторонней проверки и отчетности. Современные сканеры уязвимостей предназначены не только для устранения проблем, но и как проактивные стражи ИТ-экосистем, сочетая техническую мощь с нормативной осведомленностью, чтобы создавать среды, устойчивые как к сегодняшним угрозам, так и к вызовам будущего."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Hood: “Ah!

Drape Coefficient (Коэффициент драпировки) — количественный показатель, который описывает степень драпируемости ткани, то есть как ткань падает и образует складки. Для его измерения ткань обычно располагают поверх стандартного круглого диска, а количество ткани, висящей или свисающей с диска, сравнивают с общей площадью диска. Чем больше ткань свисает с краев диска, тем ниже коэффициент драпировки, что указывает на лучшую драпируемость. 2. Drape Distance Ratio (Отношение дистанции драпировки) — может обозначать отношение между длиной свешивающейся ткани к некоторой характерной дистанции. Например, если его измеряют, это может быть отношение длины свисания к радиусу диска, на который положили ткань для измерения драпировки. 3. Drape Profile Area Circularity (Круговая площадь профиля драпировки) может быть показателем, оценивающим насколько близка форма драпированной ткани к идеальному кругу. Если ткань равномерно драпируется во все стороны, она создаст более круглую форму. 4. Fold Depth Index (Индекс глубины складки) — показатель, характеризующий глубину складок на драпированной ткани. Этот индекс может быть рассчитан путем анализа изгибов и складок ткани, чтобы оценить их размер или частоту. Для оформления измерений могут использоваться специальные устройства и методики, в том числе фотографирование драпированной ткани и анализ с помощью компьютерной обработки изображений, чтобы точно оценить параметры драпировки. Эти показатели помогают производителям ткани и дизайнерам оценить, как ткань будет выглядеть и вести себя в различных изделиях и при их носке."},{"prompt":"Что такое ISBN 86-435- 0575-7","completion":"ISBN означает \\"International Standard Book Number\\" или \\"Международный стандартный книжный номер\\".

Scope Limitations and Contextual Challenges 3.3. Risks and Security Implications A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computers, networks or applications for known weaknesses. These scanners are used to discover the weaknesses of a given system. They are utilized in the identification and detection of vulnerabilities arising from mis-configurations or flawed programming within a network-based asset such as a firewall, router, web server, application server, etc. Modern vulnerability scanners allow for both authenticated and unauthenticated scans. Modern scanners are typically available as SaaS (Software as a Service); provided over the internet and delivered as a web application. The modern vulnerability scanner often has the ability to customize vulnerability reports as well as the installed software, open ports, certificates and other host information that can be queried as part of its workflow. Authenticated scans allow for the scanner to directly access network based assets using remote administrative protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP) and authenticate using provided system credentials. This allows the vulnerability scanner to access low-level data, such as specific services and configuration details of the host operating system. It's then able to provide detailed and accurate information about the operating system and installed software, including configuration issues and missing security patches.[1] Unauthenticated scans is a method that can result in a high number of false positives and is unable to provide detailed information about the assets operating system and installed software. This method is typically used by threat actors or security analyst trying determine the security posture of externally accessible assets.[1] Vulnerability scanners should be able to detect the risks in open-source dependencies. However, since developers will usually re-bundle the OSS, the same code will appear in different dependencies, which will then impact the performance and ability of scanners to detect the vulnerable OSS.[2] The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense designates continuous vulnerability scanning as a critical control for effective cyber defense. Vulnerability scanners are software or hardware tools used to diagnose and monitor network computers, allowing you to scan networks, computers and applications to detect possible security problems, assess and eliminate vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners allow you to check various applications in your system for holes that could be exploited by attackers. Low-level tools, such as a port scanner, can also be used to identify and analyze possible applications and protocols running on the system. 1 Types of vulnerability scanners 2 Software 3 See also 4 Notes 5 Literature Types of Vulnerability Scanners The work of a vulnerability scanner can be divided into 4 steps: Typically, the scanner first detects active IP addresses, open ports, running operating system and applications. A security report is generated (optional step). Attempting to determine the level of possible interference with the operating system or applications (may result in a crash). At the final stage, the scanner can exploit the vulnerability, causing the operating system or application to crash. Scanners can be malicious or friendly. The latter usually stop at step 2 or 3, but never get to step 4. Among the vulnerability scanners we can highlight: Port scanner Scanners examining the topology of a computer network Scanners that examine network service vulnerabilities Network worms CGI scanners (\\"friendly\\" - help find vulnerable scripts) Software Top ten vulnerability scanners according to insecure.org (2006)[1] Nessus: Vulnerability Assessment for UNIX GFI LANguard: Commercial network vulnerability scanner for Windows Retina: A commercial vulnerability assessment scanner Core Impact: Automated intrusion testing product ISS Internet Scanner: Application Level Vulnerability Assessment X-scan: Network vulnerability scanner Sara: Security Auditor's Research Assistant QualysGuard: Vulnerability scanner (web service) SAINT: Security Administrator's Integrated Network Tool MBSA: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Other well-known vulnerability scanners: XSpider OpenVAS ERPScan SAP security scanner SurfPatrol COMPLAUD RedCheck Web Application Vulnerability Scanners are automated tools that scan web applications, normally from the outside, to look for security vulnerabilities such as Cross-site scripting, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal and insecure server configuration. This category of tools is frequently referred to as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools. A large number of both commercial and open source tools of this type are available and all of these tools have their own strengths and weaknesses. If you are interested in the effectiveness of DAST tools, check out the OWASP Benchmark project, which is scientifically measuring the effectiveness of all types of vulnerability detection tools, including DAST. OWASP is aware of the Web Application Vulnerability Scanner Evaluation Project (WAVSEP). WAVSEP is completely unrelated to OWASP and we do not endorse its results, nor any of the DAST tools it evaluates. However, the results provided by WAVSEP may be helpful to someone interested in researching or selecting free and/or commercial DAST tools for their projects. This project has far more detail on DAST tools and their features than this OWASP DAST page. Vulnerability scanner - a software or hardware product for searching for threats in infrastructure companies. The scanner is used to detect gaps in network protection, operating systems, databases, applications, etc. The main task is to assess information security, identify vulnerabilities and provide reports. Using a scanner, an administrator can find “holes” that hackers use to obtain unauthorized access (NAA) to confidential data on the company network. A vulnerability scanner can monitor running processes, services and scan used ports. Vulnerability scanner - a software or hardware product for searching for threats in infrastructure companies.

Using a scanner, an administrator can find “holes” that hackers use to obtain unauthorized access (NAA) to confidential data on the company network. A vulnerability scanner can monitor running processes, services and scan used ports. Main functions The software product has the following functions: How the scanner works searches for various types of network vulnerabilities and analyzes them in real time; checks network resources, OS, connected devices, ports; analyzes all active processes and the behavior of running applications; creates reports that indicate the type of vulnerability. Probing. An effective but slow way to find and analyze vulnerabilities. Its essence is that the solution initiates virtual attacks and monitors the network infrastructure to search for vulnerable points. By At the end of the process, the administrator is provided with a detailed report indicating the problems found and recommendations for their deactivation. Scanning. In this mode, the scanner operates at the maximum possible speed, but analyzes the network infrastructure at the surface level. That is, it detects obvious vulnerabilities and analyzes the overall infrastructure security. Compared to the previous method, this method only warns about found administrator problems, but nothing more. What actions does a vulnerability scanner perform? Scanners can be \\"friendly\\" or \\"aggressive\\". The first type simply collects information and does not model attack. The second exploits the vulnerability to cause software to crash. Collects information from the entire infrastructure: active processes, running applications, running ports and devices, services, etc. Search for potential vulnerabilities using different methods. Uses special methods of simulating attacks to find possible vulnerabilities (the function is not available in every scanner). Generates a detailed report with information about found vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners are the front line of vulnerability management. They are essential for identifying vulnerabilities that could be used by bad actors to compromise systems and data. In the old days of monolithic on-premise applications, vulnerability scanners were deployed primarily in the production environment as infrastructure watchdogs that alerted to runtime threats. This paradigm became obsolete with the emergence of cloud-native applications that leverage the powerful scalability and agility of modern cloud-based infrastructure. As applications and the tools to secure them become more complex, solutions like ASPM are emerging to bring together the different data streams and enable risk based prioritization and remediation. Today’s highly automated CI/CD pipelines cannot tolerate security testing bottlenecks. The detection and remediation of vulnerabilities must keep up with the frenetic pace of mature DevOps practices. Yet another challenge to legacy security paradigms is the highly distributed architecture of cloud-native applications, based on dynamic components such as open-source libraries, serverless functions, infrastructure as code (IaC), and containers. In short, cloud-native applications require a new cloud-native application security paradigm: ensuring that vulnerabilities are detected and fixed during development with a holistic approach that makes security an integral part of the software development life cycle (SDLC). In this article, we describe the different kinds of vulnerability scanners that, together, provide cloud-native security coverage for websites, web applications, networks, open-source code, WordPress content, and containers (such as our Docker scanner). 3 Most common types of scanners Network vulnerability scanners Web application vulnerability scanners Open-source vulnerability scanners 1. Network Vulnerability Scanners Network vulnerability scanners monitor web servers, their operating systems, their daemons and any other services open to the internet such as database services. Network vulnerability scanners work against a database of known vulnerabilities. Many of these databases rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program’s free and comprehensive catalog of known software and firmware vulnerabilities. Each standardized record is comprised of a unique CVE identifier, a brief description, and at least one public reference. Going one step further, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) enriches the CVE List with a numerical score of the vulnerability’s technical severity. However, the best network vulnerability scanning results are achieved with proprietary vulnerability databases that continuously aggregate and analyze information from a wide range of sources. A good example is the Snyk Vulnerability Database, which is tightly integrated with vulnerability databases, threat intelligence systems, community sources, and academia. Hand-curated by a dedicated security team, Snyk’s Vulnerability Database optimizes network vulnerability scanners so that they can deliver accurate and actionable insights. This heightened ability to extract maximal insights into network vulnerabilities is important for operational reasons as well. The not-for-profit Center for Internet Security (CIS) maintains a set of CIS Controls to help organizations implement cybersecurity best practices. One of the basic controls is that vulnerability management—including scanning—be continuous. However, because network vulnerability scans can cause congestion, scans are typically carried out only once a week. It is therefore critical that these scans be carried out against an enriched database that provides comprehensive coverage into known and unknown vulnerabilities. 2. Web Application/Website Vulnerability Scanners Web vulnerability scanners scan application/website code to find vulnerabilities that compromise the application/website itself or its back-end services. They are an essential component of application security testing. These scanners work against a known list of common exploits as maintained by OWASP and others. These exploits use various injection and evasion techniques to “hijack” web applications and websites in order to exfiltrate data, to trick users or systems into providing sensitive information, or to disrupt application performance. Some of the better known exploits are SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, and malicious code. When it comes to web applications, the only effective vulnerability management strategy is to adopt a shift-left DevSecOps approach and deploy scanners throughout a secure SDLC (software development life cycle). This battery of scanners includes static application security tools (SAST) that automatically scan uncompiled code for vulnerabilities, and dynamic application security tools (DAST) that automatically scan compiled code across all environments from testing to production. Another important tool is penetration testing, which essentially simulates hackers in order to discover if a web application or website is vulnerable to malicious exploits. There are even website vulnerability scanner online services that conduct third-party penetration testing. The Snyk SAST solution has been designed from the ground up to overcome the challenges that developers and ethical hackers face with legacy SAST tools, such as taking hours or even days to complete a scan, high false positive rates, and requiring deep security knowledge to remedy issues. With Snyk Code, SAST becomes a seamless part of the development process, providing developers and security teams with real-time and accurate visibility into code vulnerabilities and how to fix them. 3. Open-Source Vulnerability Scanners Open-source vulnerability scanners are software composition analysis (SCA) tools that scan applications to discover all open-source frameworks and libraries—including all direct and indirect dependencies—and identify vulnerabilities. Some open-source vulnerability scanners also help developers in the non-trivial task of precisely locating the vulnerable code in the codebase. Seeing that using components with known vulnerabilities is one of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, organizations must ensure that they are using a state-of-the-art open-source vulnerability scanner. The advantages of the Snyk open-source vulnerability scanner include: Early detection of open-source code vulnerabilities, before web applications or websites have been compromised. Prompt discovery of all instances affected by a detected open-source code vulnerability, so that attackers can be locked out and issues can be remediated faster. Clear documentation of all open-source frameworks and libraries used in applications. Ensures compliance with open-source license requirements. How to Evaluate a Vulnerability Scanner The good news is that there are many commercial and free vulnerability scanners available on the market today. However the flip side to that is that having so many options can make it difficult to evaluate which scanner stack is optimal for your requirements. The first step is to learn more about the vulnerability scanners. OWASP maintains a comprehensive listing of commercial and free vulnerability scanners, although they refrain from ranking them. Other trusted influencers provide “Top xx” lists of recommended scanners. Once you have created a short list of vulnerability scanners, you can try them out. Even the commercial vulnerability scanners offer free trials so that you can kick the tires before making a final decision. Given the diverse set of vulnerability scanners that you will have to deploy in order to achieve end-to-end coverage across all your environments, you may also want to consider a vulnerability management platform that knows how to integrate with all your scanners and correlate their outputs into a single source of vulnerability management truth. Why is vulnerability scanning important? Vulnerability scanning is the essential front end of any vulnerability management program. Today, vulnerability management is no longer a nice-to-have but rather a business-critical requirement for any organization running web applications or interactive websites. These kinds of public-facing assets are common attack vectors for malicious actors seeking unauthorized access to systems and data. What are the types of vulnerability scans? Vulnerability scans differ depending on how they are deployed and what they are scanning. Scans can be internal or external, credentialed or non-credentialed, and comprehensive or device-specific. The optimal operating modality depends on what is being scanned: networks, web applications throughout the secure software development life cycle, or open-source codes and libraries.","completion":"Chapter 3: Disadvantages of Vulnerability Scanners Vulnerability scanners are invaluable tools in the cybersecurity arsenal, aiding in the proactive identification of weaknesses within networks, applications, and systems. However, like any technology, they come with inherent limitations and potential drawbacks. This chapter delves into the disadvantages of vulnerability scanners, highlighting areas where they may not fulfill cybersecurity needs entirely. 3.1 Potential for False Positives and Negatives A significant disadvantage of utilizing vulnerability scanners is the potential for false positives and negatives. These inaccuracies occur when the scanner incorrectly identifies a vulnerability (false positive) or fails to detect an existing weakness (false negative). Unauthenticated scans, for instance, are particularly prone to high rates of false positives. These scans lack the ability to access detailed information regarding operating systems and installed software, leading to ambiguous or erroneous results. Authenticating with system credentials allows for a more refined scan by providing access to specific services and OS configuration details. However, even with authenticated scans, the precision of vulnerability detection can be deficient. Vulnerability scanners may not detect risks adequately in open-source dependencies, especially since the rebundling of open-source software (OSS) can mask code provenance and complicate vulnerability assessment. Misinterpreting scan results can lead to unnecessary resource allocation towards non-issues (in the case of false positives) or missed opportunities for remediation (with false negatives), both of which entail risk to the organization. 3.2 Scope Limitations and Contextual Challenges The effectiveness of vulnerability scanners is also constrained by their scope and the context within which they operate. Despite their capabilities, scanners might not fully grasp the topology of a network or the nuances of complex applications. They typically commence with identifying active IP addresses, open ports, and running services, but might not always understand the operational context or the criticality of the detected vulnerabilities in relation to the business. Scanners could also inaccurately assess vulnerabilities without considering the unique architectural or functional elements of systems. This can lead to circumstances where vulnerabilities rated as high-risk in general might not be as critical in a specific context, and vice versa. Additionally, vulnerability scanners may treat different dependencies or versions of the same OSS as separate entities, which can affect the effectiveness and efficiency of the scanning process, misleading the prioritization of remediation efforts. 3.3 Risks and Security Implications While vulnerability scanners are designed to enhance security, they are not without risks. When performing scans, it is possible for the scanner to inadvertently disrupt services or crash systems, as is the case when advancing beyond the simulation stage to actual exploit. Moreover, if not managed properly, the information gathered by scanners can itself become a security liability; it provides a detailed map of potential entry points and weaknesses that could be exploited by threat actors. The security posture of externally accessible assets becomes a critical concern when using unauthenticated scans as they can be employed by threat actors to glean information about a system's vulnerabilities without direct access. It is also essential to consider the implications of having vulnerability scanners within an environment, as they require a level of access that, if compromised, could facilitate illicit activities akin to those carried out by network worms or aggressive scanning tools. In conclusion, while the merits of vulnerability scanners are clear, it is critical to understand and address their potential disadvantages. Organizations must be vigilant about false positives and negatives, consider the concrete scope and context within which scanners operate, and be acutely aware of the risks and security implications involved in their utilization. Only through careful management, customization, and proper integration into a broader cybersecurity framework can the full benefits of vulnerability scanners be realized while mitigating their drawbacks."},{"prompt":"Expand this chapter with some useful technical information and some examples","completion":"Chapter 3: Disadvantages of Vulnerability Scanners As previously discussed, vulnerability scanners serve as critical tools in identifying potential risks in network security. However, they are not flawless, presenting several disadvantages that must be managed effectively to ensure robust cybersecurity measures. 3.1 Potential for False Positives and Negatives The propensity of vulnerability scanners to generate false positives can result in IT teams spending valuable time investigating and addressing issues that do not pose real threats. For example, a scanner might flag an up-to-date system as vulnerable due to incorrect version detection, leading to unnecessary confusion and resource expenditure. Conversely, false negatives pose a more insidious risk, leaving organizations unaware of existing vulnerabilities. In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack exploited a vulnerability in Windows, which some systems failed to detect due to misconfigurations or outdated scanning databases. Authentication during scanning can significantly reduce the incidence of false reporting. One prominent scanner, Nessus, allows authenticated scans that provide deeper insight into systems' configurations and patch statuses. Another example is GFI LANguard, which offers detailed security updates and patch management, reducing the likelihood of false negatives related to software updates. 3.2 Scope Limitations and Contextual Challenges Vulnerability scanners are often limited by their inability to interpret the context surrounding a detected vulnerability. For instance, a scanner might not recognize custom security controls or mitigations already in place. Additionally, scanners might not fully understand the context in a system's topology, such as a vulnerability in a service unexposed to potential attackers due to internal network routing configurations. The case of open-source software presents a notable challenge; tools such as OpenVAS and QualysGuard are effective in detecting many known vulnerabilities in open-source applications but may struggle with the complexities introduced by customizations or instances where OSS has been repackaged and integrated into other software products. 3.3 Risks and Security Implications Operating vulnerability scanners carries inherent risks, particularly when aggressive scanning techniques are employed. For example, a poorly configured scan by tools such as Retina or ISS Internet Scanner could inadvertently cause denial-of-service conditions on sensitive equipment by overwhelming them with scan traffic. Moreover, there is the potential security risk of scanners themselves being compromised. A vulnerability scanner's database, filled with detailed information about the infrastructure's weaknesses, is an enticing target for attackers. This was exemplified in 2015 when a hacking group known as \\"The Dark Overlord\\" allegedly accessed FireEye's Mandiant division's systems using credentials from a compromised vulnerability scanner. To sum up, while vulnerability scanners like Nessus, Retina, and GFI LANguard are indispensable for maintaining a strong security posture, organizations must apply them cautiously and contextually. It is vital that cybersecurity teams engage in regular updates of scanner databases, adopt layered defense strategies that account for potential false reports, maintain rigorous access controls on scanning tools, and ensure systems are resilient to both scanner-initiated disruptions and scanner compromises. By recognizing the limitations and strategically utilizing vulnerability scanners within a well-rounded cybersecurity framework, businesses can more effectively safeguard their digital environments."},{"prompt":"Rewrite chapter on russian","completion":"Глава 3: Недостатки сканеров уязвимостей Как говорилось ранее, сканеры уязвимостей выполняют ключевую роль в выявлении потенциальных рисков в сетевой безопасности. Однако они не лишены недостатков, которые необходимо эффективно управлять, чтобы обеспечить надежные меры кибербезопасности. 3.1 Возможность ложных срабатываний и упущений Склонность сканеров уязвимостей к генерации ложных срабатываний может привести к тому, что ИТ-команды тратят ценное время на расследование и устранение проблем, которые не представляют реальной угрозы. Например, сканер может ошибочно пометить обновленную систему как уязвимую из-за неверного определения версии, что ведет к ненужному путанице и трате ресурсов. Напротив, пропущенные уязвимости представляют более зловещий риск, оставляя организации в неведении относительно существующих слабых мест. В 2017 году атака с использованием шифровальщика WannaCry эксплуатировала уязвимость в Windows, которую некоторые системы не смогли обнаружить из-за некорректных конфигураций или устаревших баз данных сканеров. Проведение аутентифицированных сканирований может значительно снизить вероятность ложного срабатывания. Один из популярных сканеров, Nessus, позволяет проводить аутентифицированные сканы, обеспечивая более глубокое понимание конфигураций систем и состояния безопасности обновлений. Другой пример – GFI LANguard, который предлагает подробные обновления безопасности и управление патчами, что снижает вероятность пропущенных уязвимостей, связанных с обновлением ПО. 3.2 Ограничения по объему и контекстуальные проблемы Сканеры уязвимостей часто ограничены своей неспособностью интерпретировать контекст обнаруженной уязвимости. Например, сканер может не признать существование специализированных мер безопасности или митигационных действий, которые уже на месте. Кроме того, сканеры могут недостаточно понимать контекст в топологии системы, как в случае уязвимости в сервисе, который не подвергается потенциальным атакующим из-за внутренних настроек сетевого маршрутизатора. Сложность использования открытого программного обеспечения (OSS) представляет собой заметную проблему; инструменты, такие как OpenVAS и QualysGuard, эффективны в выявлении многих известных уязвимостей в открытом ПО, но могут столкнуться со сложностями, вызванными настройками или случаями, когда OSS было переупаковано и интегрировано в другие продукты программного обеспечения. 3.3 Риски и последствия для безопасности Использование сканеров уязвимостей несет в себе врожденные риски, особенно когда применяются агрессивные методы сканирования. Например, скан с неправильной конфигурацией, выполненный с помощью таких инструментов, как Retina или ISS Internet Scanner, может нечаянно вызвать состояние отказа в обслуживании на чувствительном оборудовании, перегрузив его трафиком сканирования. Кроме того, есть потенциальный безопасный риск компрометации самого сканера. База данных уязвимостей сканера, заполненная подробной информацией о слабостях инфраструктуры, представляет собой привлекательную цель для атакующих. Это было продемонстрировано в 2015 году, когда хакерская группа под названием \\"The Dark Overlord\\" якобы получила доступ к системам подразделения Mandiant компании FireEye, используя учетные данные из скомпрометированного сканера уязвимостей. В заключение, пока сканеры уязвимостей, такие как Nessus, Retina и GFI LANguard, незаменимы для поддержания крепкой позиции безопасности, организации должны применять их осторожно и с учетом контекста. Жизненно важно, чтобы команды кибербезопасности регулярно обновляли базы данных сканеров, применяли многоуровневые стратегии защиты, в которых учитываются потенциальные ложные отчеты, поддерживали строгий контроль доступа к инструментам сканирования и обеспечивали устойчивость систем к сбоям, вызванным сканерами и компрометации сканеров. Признавая ограничения и стратегически используя сканеры уязвимостей в рамках хорошо продуманной кибербезопасной инфраструктуры, компании могут более эффективно защищать свои цифровые среды."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Hood: “Ah!

Imaginons que nous voulons créer un personnage non-joueur (PNJ) de Goku dans un jeu vidéo, leur approche serait très différente : 1. AI (Intelligence Artificielle Standard) : Une IA standard aurait une série de règles prédéfinies et scripts pour contrôler Goku en tant que PNJ. Elle ne pourrait que réaliser des actions prédéterminées et réagir à des événements prédéfinis. Elle pourrait exécuter des mouvements de combat basiques et interagir succinctement avec le joueur selon un ensemble limité de paramètres. Par exemple, dans le jeu, cette IA permettrait à Goku de lancer son attaque emblématique, le Kamehameha, mais uniquement dans des circonstances très spécifiques déterminées par les développeurs. 2. AGI (Intelligence Artificielle Générale) : Une AGI est capable de comprendre et d'apprendre de nouvelles tâches au même niveau qu'un être humain. Si un PNJ Goku était gouverné par une AGI, il pourrait non seulement utiliser ses techniques de combat emblématiques (telles que le Kamehameha ou le Genki Dama), mais il pourrait aussi apprendre de son environnement de jeu, s'y adapter, et peaufiner ses stratégies en continu. Il pourrait, par exemple, étudier la manière de jouer de l'adversaire et développer des contre-attaques stratégiques, imitant la croissance de Goku tout au long de la série Dragon Ball lorsqu'il apprend et maîtrise de nouvelles techniques après chaque combat. 3. ASI (Super Intelligence Artificielle) : Une ASI serait bien au-delà de l'intelligence humaine, avec la capacité de créer des stratégies et des connaissances que même les humains ne pourraient pas comprendre. Un PNJ Goku contrôlé par une ASI serait extrêmement avancé, non seulement capable de stratégies de combat parfaites mais capable aussi de démontrer une compréhension profonde de l'univers de Dragon Ball, en créant des scénarios inédits et en s'adaptant à n'importe quelle situation de manière innovante et imprévisible. Il pourrait, par exemple, analyser des émotions du joueur et y répondre de manière complexe, utiliser le terrain de manière créative lors des combats, ou même déclencher des événements narratifs uniques en fonction de ses interactions dans le jeu. Ainsi, en termes d'expérience de jeu, un PNJ Goku guidé par AI serait prévisible et limité, un poussé par AGI serait compétitif et dynamique, tandis qu'un dirigé par ASI offrirait une expérience de jeu incroyablement riche et potentiellement transcendant les limites précédemment imaginées pour un jeu vidéo. Cependant, à l'heure actuelle, ni AGI ni ASI ne sont réalités; nous travaillons principalement avec des AIs spécialisées qui sont très avancées dans des domaines spécifiques mais qui n'ont pas une compréhension générale ou une superintelligence."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Hood: “Ah!

The Future of Vulnerability Scanning 4.3. Recommendations for Optimized Utilization A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computers, networks or applications for known weaknesses. These scanners are used to discover the weaknesses of a given system. They are utilized in the identification and detection of vulnerabilities arising from mis-configurations or flawed programming within a network-based asset such as a firewall, router, web server, application server, etc. Modern vulnerability scanners allow for both authenticated and unauthenticated scans. Modern scanners are typically available as SaaS (Software as a Service); provided over the internet and delivered as a web application. The modern vulnerability scanner often has the ability to customize vulnerability reports as well as the installed software, open ports, certificates and other host information that can be queried as part of its workflow. Authenticated scans allow for the scanner to directly access network based assets using remote administrative protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP) and authenticate using provided system credentials. This allows the vulnerability scanner to access low-level data, such as specific services and configuration details of the host operating system. It's then able to provide detailed and accurate information about the operating system and installed software, including configuration issues and missing security patches.[1] Unauthenticated scans is a method that can result in a high number of false positives and is unable to provide detailed information about the assets operating system and installed software. This method is typically used by threat actors or security analyst trying determine the security posture of externally accessible assets.[1] Vulnerability scanners should be able to detect the risks in open-source dependencies. However, since developers will usually re-bundle the OSS, the same code will appear in different dependencies, which will then impact the performance and ability of scanners to detect the vulnerable OSS.[2] The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense designates continuous vulnerability scanning as a critical control for effective cyber defense. Vulnerability scanners are software or hardware tools used to diagnose and monitor network computers, allowing you to scan networks, computers and applications to detect possible security problems, assess and eliminate vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners allow you to check various applications in your system for holes that could be exploited by attackers. Low-level tools, such as a port scanner, can also be used to identify and analyze possible applications and protocols running on the system. 1 Types of vulnerability scanners 2 Software 3 See also 4 Notes 5 Literature Types of Vulnerability Scanners The work of a vulnerability scanner can be divided into 4 steps: Typically, the scanner first detects active IP addresses, open ports, running operating system and applications. A security report is generated (optional step). Attempting to determine the level of possible interference with the operating system or applications (may result in a crash). At the final stage, the scanner can exploit the vulnerability, causing the operating system or application to crash. Scanners can be malicious or friendly. The latter usually stop at step 2 or 3, but never get to step 4. Among the vulnerability scanners we can highlight: Port scanner Scanners examining the topology of a computer network Scanners that examine network service vulnerabilities Network worms CGI scanners (\\"friendly\\" - help find vulnerable scripts) Software Top ten vulnerability scanners according to insecure.org (2006)[1] Nessus: Vulnerability Assessment for UNIX GFI LANguard: Commercial network vulnerability scanner for Windows Retina: A commercial vulnerability assessment scanner Core Impact: Automated intrusion testing product ISS Internet Scanner: Application Level Vulnerability Assessment X-scan: Network vulnerability scanner Sara: Security Auditor's Research Assistant QualysGuard: Vulnerability scanner (web service) SAINT: Security Administrator's Integrated Network Tool MBSA: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Other well-known vulnerability scanners: XSpider OpenVAS ERPScan SAP security scanner SurfPatrol COMPLAUD RedCheck Web Application Vulnerability Scanners are automated tools that scan web applications, normally from the outside, to look for security vulnerabilities such as Cross-site scripting, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal and insecure server configuration. This category of tools is frequently referred to as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools. A large number of both commercial and open source tools of this type are available and all of these tools have their own strengths and weaknesses. If you are interested in the effectiveness of DAST tools, check out the OWASP Benchmark project, which is scientifically measuring the effectiveness of all types of vulnerability detection tools, including DAST. OWASP is aware of the Web Application Vulnerability Scanner Evaluation Project (WAVSEP). WAVSEP is completely unrelated to OWASP and we do not endorse its results, nor any of the DAST tools it evaluates. However, the results provided by WAVSEP may be helpful to someone interested in researching or selecting free and/or commercial DAST tools for their projects. This project has far more detail on DAST tools and their features than this OWASP DAST page. Vulnerability scanner - a software or hardware product for searching for threats in infrastructure companies. The scanner is used to detect gaps in network protection, operating systems, databases, applications, etc. The main task is to assess information security, identify vulnerabilities and provide reports. Using a scanner, an administrator can find “holes” that hackers use to obtain unauthorized access (NAA) to confidential data on the company network. A vulnerability scanner can monitor running processes, services and scan used ports. Vulnerability scanner - a software or hardware product for searching for threats in infrastructure companies.

Using a scanner, an administrator can find “holes” that hackers use to obtain unauthorized access (NAA) to confidential data on the company network. A vulnerability scanner can monitor running processes, services and scan used ports. Main functions The software product has the following functions: How the scanner works searches for various types of network vulnerabilities and analyzes them in real time; checks network resources, OS, connected devices, ports; analyzes all active processes and the behavior of running applications; creates reports that indicate the type of vulnerability. Probing. An effective but slow way to find and analyze vulnerabilities. Its essence is that the solution initiates virtual attacks and monitors the network infrastructure to search for vulnerable points. By At the end of the process, the administrator is provided with a detailed report indicating the problems found and recommendations for their deactivation. Scanning. In this mode, the scanner operates at the maximum possible speed, but analyzes the network infrastructure at the surface level. That is, it detects obvious vulnerabilities and analyzes the overall infrastructure security. Compared to the previous method, this method only warns about found administrator problems, but nothing more. What actions does a vulnerability scanner perform? Scanners can be \\"friendly\\" or \\"aggressive\\". The first type simply collects information and does not model attack. The second exploits the vulnerability to cause software to crash. Collects information from the entire infrastructure: active processes, running applications, running ports and devices, services, etc. Search for potential vulnerabilities using different methods. Uses special methods of simulating attacks to find possible vulnerabilities (the function is not available in every scanner). Generates a detailed report with information about found vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners are the front line of vulnerability management. They are essential for identifying vulnerabilities that could be used by bad actors to compromise systems and data. In the old days of monolithic on-premise applications, vulnerability scanners were deployed primarily in the production environment as infrastructure watchdogs that alerted to runtime threats. This paradigm became obsolete with the emergence of cloud-native applications that leverage the powerful scalability and agility of modern cloud-based infrastructure. As applications and the tools to secure them become more complex, solutions like ASPM are emerging to bring together the different data streams and enable risk based prioritization and remediation. Today’s highly automated CI/CD pipelines cannot tolerate security testing bottlenecks. The detection and remediation of vulnerabilities must keep up with the frenetic pace of mature DevOps practices. Yet another challenge to legacy security paradigms is the highly distributed architecture of cloud-native applications, based on dynamic components such as open-source libraries, serverless functions, infrastructure as code (IaC), and containers. In short, cloud-native applications require a new cloud-native application security paradigm: ensuring that vulnerabilities are detected and fixed during development with a holistic approach that makes security an integral part of the software development life cycle (SDLC). In this article, we describe the different kinds of vulnerability scanners that, together, provide cloud-native security coverage for websites, web applications, networks, open-source code, WordPress content, and containers (such as our Docker scanner). 3 Most common types of scanners Network vulnerability scanners Web application vulnerability scanners Open-source vulnerability scanners 1. Network Vulnerability Scanners Network vulnerability scanners monitor web servers, their operating systems, their daemons and any other services open to the internet such as database services. Network vulnerability scanners work against a database of known vulnerabilities. Many of these databases rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program’s free and comprehensive catalog of known software and firmware vulnerabilities. Each standardized record is comprised of a unique CVE identifier, a brief description, and at least one public reference. Going one step further, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) enriches the CVE List with a numerical score of the vulnerability’s technical severity. However, the best network vulnerability scanning results are achieved with proprietary vulnerability databases that continuously aggregate and analyze information from a wide range of sources. A good example is the Snyk Vulnerability Database, which is tightly integrated with vulnerability databases, threat intelligence systems, community sources, and academia. Hand-curated by a dedicated security team, Snyk’s Vulnerability Database optimizes network vulnerability scanners so that they can deliver accurate and actionable insights. This heightened ability to extract maximal insights into network vulnerabilities is important for operational reasons as well. The not-for-profit Center for Internet Security (CIS) maintains a set of CIS Controls to help organizations implement cybersecurity best practices. One of the basic controls is that vulnerability management—including scanning—be continuous. However, because network vulnerability scans can cause congestion, scans are typically carried out only once a week. It is therefore critical that these scans be carried out against an enriched database that provides comprehensive coverage into known and unknown vulnerabilities. 2. Web Application/Website Vulnerability Scanners Web vulnerability scanners scan application/website code to find vulnerabilities that compromise the application/website itself or its back-end services. They are an essential component of application security testing. These scanners work against a known list of common exploits as maintained by OWASP and others. These exploits use various injection and evasion techniques to “hijack” web applications and websites in order to exfiltrate data, to trick users or systems into providing sensitive information, or to disrupt application performance. Some of the better known exploits are SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, and malicious code. When it comes to web applications, the only effective vulnerability management strategy is to adopt a shift-left DevSecOps approach and deploy scanners throughout a secure SDLC (software development life cycle). This battery of scanners includes static application security tools (SAST) that automatically scan uncompiled code for vulnerabilities, and dynamic application security tools (DAST) that automatically scan compiled code across all environments from testing to production. Another important tool is penetration testing, which essentially simulates hackers in order to discover if a web application or website is vulnerable to malicious exploits. There are even website vulnerability scanner online services that conduct third-party penetration testing. The Snyk SAST solution has been designed from the ground up to overcome the challenges that developers and ethical hackers face with legacy SAST tools, such as taking hours or even days to complete a scan, high false positive rates, and requiring deep security knowledge to remedy issues. With Snyk Code, SAST becomes a seamless part of the development process, providing developers and security teams with real-time and accurate visibility into code vulnerabilities and how to fix them. 3. Open-Source Vulnerability Scanners Open-source vulnerability scanners are software composition analysis (SCA) tools that scan applications to discover all open-source frameworks and libraries—including all direct and indirect dependencies—and identify vulnerabilities. Some open-source vulnerability scanners also help developers in the non-trivial task of precisely locating the vulnerable code in the codebase. Seeing that using components with known vulnerabilities is one of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, organizations must ensure that they are using a state-of-the-art open-source vulnerability scanner. The advantages of the Snyk open-source vulnerability scanner include: Early detection of open-source code vulnerabilities, before web applications or websites have been compromised. Prompt discovery of all instances affected by a detected open-source code vulnerability, so that attackers can be locked out and issues can be remediated faster. Clear documentation of all open-source frameworks and libraries used in applications. Ensures compliance with open-source license requirements. How to Evaluate a Vulnerability Scanner The good news is that there are many commercial and free vulnerability scanners available on the market today. However the flip side to that is that having so many options can make it difficult to evaluate which scanner stack is optimal for your requirements. The first step is to learn more about the vulnerability scanners. OWASP maintains a comprehensive listing of commercial and free vulnerability scanners, although they refrain from ranking them. Other trusted influencers provide “Top xx” lists of recommended scanners. Once you have created a short list of vulnerability scanners, you can try them out. Even the commercial vulnerability scanners offer free trials so that you can kick the tires before making a final decision. Given the diverse set of vulnerability scanners that you will have to deploy in order to achieve end-to-end coverage across all your environments, you may also want to consider a vulnerability management platform that knows how to integrate with all your scanners and correlate their outputs into a single source of vulnerability management truth. Why is vulnerability scanning important? Vulnerability scanning is the essential front end of any vulnerability management program. Today, vulnerability management is no longer a nice-to-have but rather a business-critical requirement for any organization running web applications or interactive websites. These kinds of public-facing assets are common attack vectors for malicious actors seeking unauthorized access to systems and data. What are the types of vulnerability scans? Vulnerability scans differ depending on how they are deployed and what they are scanning. Scans can be internal or external, credentialed or non-credentialed, and comprehensive or device-specific. The optimal operating modality depends on what is being scanned: networks, web applications throughout the secure software development life cycle, or open-source codes and libraries.

Risks and Security Implications","completion":"Chapter 4: Conclusion and Perspectives 4.1 Evaluation of Benefits and Drawbacks Vulnerability scanners serve as critical components in maintaining cybersecurity by systematically identifying and evaluating potential weaknesses within computers, networks, and applications. The benefits, as established in the preceding chapters, encompass the detection and prevention of exploitable vulnerabilities, enhanced automation, efficiency in security workflows, and facilitation of regulatory compliance through detailed reporting. Modern vulnerability scanners, especially those provided as SaaS, have improved their capabilities with features like authenticated scans, which yield precise insights about system vulnerabilities. Unauthenticated scans, while less detailed, are useful in assessing the security posture of external assets. Moreover, the necessity for vulnerability management, as asserted by the CIS Controls, underlines the indispensable role of these tools. However, one cannot overlook the disadvantages presented in vulnerability scanning technology. False positives and negatives, the limited scope in context-sensitive environments, and the inherent risks associated with scanning tools—such as unauthorized access when used maliciously or exploitation of discovered vulnerabilities—pose challenges that organizations must navigate carefully. Furthermore, the potential for performance impacts when dealing with open-source dependencies highlights the need for a nuanced approach to vulnerability management. 4.2 The Future of Vulnerability Scanning In the face of evolving cybersecurity threats and the complex architecture of cloud-native applications, the future of vulnerability scanning lies in integrating these tools seamlessly into the development life cycle, adopting a shift-left approach. As applications move towards a cloud-native design, leveraging scalable and agile infrastructures, vulnerability scanners too must adapt, offering more sophisticated, context-aware security analytics across various stages of the SDLC and application deployment. 4.3 Recommendations for Optimized Utilization To maximize the effectiveness of vulnerability scanners while mitigating their inherent drawbacks, the following recommendations are proposed: - Employ a mix of both authenticated and unauthenticated scans to balance detail and coverage. - Integrate vulnerability scanners with CI/CD pipelines to maintain pace with DevOps practices, addressing vulnerabilities during development. - Adopt comprehensive vulnerability management platforms that can aggregate and correlate data across multiple scanners, delivering a holistic view of security postures. - Schedule scans thoughtfully to avoid network congestion and operational disruption, while adhering to CIS control recommendations for continuous scanning. - Use proprietary databases enriched with threat intelligence to improve the accuracy and relevance of scan results. - Embrace a proactive stance on open-source vulnerability management, leveraging tools that identify dependencies and their associated risks early in the development process. In summary, vulnerability scanners are indispensable for modern cybersecurity, but their deployment must be strategic and informed by the evolving landscape. By leveraging advanced features, integrating scanning into the SDLC, and adopting a platform-driven approach, organizations can achieve a robust and responsive security posture capable of thwarting emerging threats."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this conclusion on russian","completion":"Глава 4: Заключение и перспективы 4.1 Оценка преимуществ и недостатков Сканеры уязвимостей служат ключевыми элементами поддержания кибербезопасности, систематически идентифицируя и оценивая потенциальные слабые места в компьютерах, сетях и приложениях. Преимущества, установленные в предыдущих главах, охватывают обнаружение и предотвращение эксплуатируемых уязвимостей, улучшенную автоматизацию, эффективность в работе с безопасностью и способствование соблюдению нормативных требований через детальную отчетность. Современные сканеры уязвимостей, особенно те, что предоставляются как SaaS, усовершенствовали свои возможности благодаря функциям, таким как аутентифицированные сканы, которые дают точные сведения о системных уязвимостях. Неаутентифицированные сканы, хотя и менее детальны, полезны при оценке состояния безопасности внешних активов. К тому же, необходимость управления уязвимостями, утвержденная CIS Controls, подчеркивает неотъемлемую роль этих инструментов. Тем не менее, нельзя упускать из виду недостатки, представленные в технологии сканирования уязвимостей. Ложные положительные и отрицательные результаты, ограниченный контекст в чувствительных средах и внутренние риски, связанные с инструментами сканирования, такими как несанкционированный доступ при злонамеренном использовании или эксплуатация обнаруженных уязвимостей, ставят перед организациями сложные задачи, которые необходимо тщательно решать.

For a Canadian citizen residing in Japan and working remotely for an Australian company, several factors need to be considered: 1. **Residence for Tax Purposes**: Typically, you pay income tax to the country where you are considered a tax resident. Tax residency is usually determined by the length of your stay, physical presence, and the location of your permanent home. If you have moved to Japan and have established your life there with no strong residential ties to Canada (such as a spouse or dependent children remaining in Canada, a home available for your use in Canada, etc.), you may become a tax resident of Japan. 2. **Japanese Income Tax**: If you are a tax resident of Japan, you are generally taxed on your worldwide income. This means that income from working remotely for the Australian company would be subject to Japanese income tax. 3. **Australian Taxation**: Even though you are working for an Australian company, if you are not an Australian resident for tax purposes and not performing the work while physically in Australia, it's unlikely that Australia would tax your employment income. 4. **Canadian Taxation**: As a non-resident of Canada, you would not be taxed on foreign income by Canada. However, it's important to formally evaluate and possibly declare non-residency to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to avoid any uncertainty. Non-residents usually only pay Canadian tax on Canadian-sourced income. 5. **Tax Treaties**: Countries enter tax treaties to avoid double taxation. It would be advisable to consult the relevant tax treaty between Japan and Australia, and between Canada and Japan, to understand your tax liabilities and entitlements, such as tax credits or exemptions. 6. **Tax Withholding**: Depending on the arrangement with the Australian employer, there might be withholding taxes involved. Sometimes, companies withhold tax at source for their employees, even international ones. Treaty provisions could potentially reduce or eliminate such withholdings. 7. **Social Security**: You must determine your obligations concerning social security. Japan has specific rules for social security contributions, and there may be agreements in place between Japan and Australia (and potentially Canada) that determine where your contributions should be paid. 8. **Reporting and Compliance**: Make sure that you accurately report your income and fulfill all compliance requirements for all relevant tax jurisdictions. This might involve declaring foreign income, filing tax returns, and claiming applicable foreign tax credits to mitigate double taxation. Considering the complexity of tax laws and the risk of double taxation or non-compliance, it would be wise to consult with tax professionals in Japan, and possibly in Canada or Australia, who are knowledgeable about cross-border tax issues. It is essential to keep detailed records of all income and taxes paid in case of audit by tax authorities."},{"prompt":"Are there any withholding taxes legislated for Australia?","completion":"Yes, Australia does have a system of withholding taxes for various types of payments, and these can include payments made to foreign residents. Withholding taxes are a way for countries to ensure that they collect tax on income earned within their jurisdiction by non-residents. Here are some types of income that might be subject to withholding taxes in Australia: 1. **Dividends**: Generally, dividends paid to non-resident shareholders are subject to a withholding tax. However, the rate might be reduced under a tax treaty. 2. **Interest**: Interest paid to non-residents is typically subject to withholding tax unless the rate is reduced or exempted by a tax treaty. 3. **Royalties**: Payments of royalties from an Australian source to non-residents are subject to withholding tax, again with potential reductions under a tax treaty. 4. **Services**: Payments for certain services rendered by non-residents can also be subject to withholding tax. For employment income, if you are a non-resident working for an Australian company but not working in Australia (i.e., not performing the services in Australia), in general, income from that employment would not be subject to Australian income tax, and hence, there would typically not be withholding tax requirements. But if the work was performed in Australia, withholding would likely be required. However, taxation rules can change, and therefore it's important to consult with an Australian tax expert or the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for current and detailed information as it relates to your specific situation, including any tax treaty benefits that may apply. Keep in mind that tax treaties between countries may reduce or eliminate withholding tax rates on payments such as dividends, interest, and royalties. As a non-resident, if tax has been over-withheld due to a treaty reduced rate, you may be entitled to a refund of the overpaid tax from Australia."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Hood: “Ah!

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"Would 'because they look cool' and 'They keep losing' be understandable reasons for rooting for a villain?","completion":"Absolutely, those can be understandable reasons for someone to root for a villain in a story or series. Here are some elaborations on those perspectives: 1. \\"Because they look cool\\": Villains are often designed with striking appearances or unique styles that can be visually appealing. This aesthetic can include elaborate costumes, distinctive color schemes, or an overall menacing presence that sets them apart from other characters. Their cool factor can make them memorable and intriguing to fans, leading some to root for them because they enjoy the character design or find the villain charismatic. 2. \\"They keep losing\\": Some people might find themselves sympathetic to the underdog narrative, even if the underdog happens to be the villain. Observing a character repeatedly face defeat could evoke empathy or a desire to see them succeed at least once. This inclination can be strengthened if the story explores the villain's backstory, motivations, or personal struggles, allowing the audience to connect with them on a deeper level. Rooting for the villain doesn’t necessarily mean endorsing their actions; it can be more about finding certain aspects of their character compelling or interesting. Villains can add complexity and depth to stories, making them as important as the heroes in creating an engaging narrative."},{"prompt":"so the reverse of these reasons could be a understandable reason for disliking the heroes?","completion":"Indeed, the reverse of those reasons can sometimes lead to disliking the heroes. Let's consider each point: 1. \\"Because they look uncool\\": If a hero's design or portrayal is perceived as lackluster, uninteresting, or even cliché, it might make them less appealing to some audience members. Fans often appreciate characters with a compelling or striking aesthetic, and if the hero lacks this, it could lead to disengagement or a preference for other characters with more visual or stylistic flair. 2. \\"They keep winning\\": A hero who always wins without facing significant challenges or setbacks can be seen as predictable or unrelatable. Audiences enjoy complex stories with tension and uncertainty. If a hero's victories come too easily or feel undeserved, it can result in a narrative that lacks depth and fails to hold the audience's attention. People might root against such heroes in hopes of a more balanced and unpredictable storyline. Character dynamics are nuanced, and every person brings their own set of expectations and preferences to the stories they consume. Some may find flawless or \\"cookie-cutter\\" heroes to be uninspiring, just as others may root against perpetual losers who they feel are unworthy of victory. Characters that resemble real human flaws, struggles, and growth tend to resonate more with audiences and can contribute to a more engaging and emotionally rich story."},{"prompt":"So why could having the villain win over and over again make them truly unlikable?","completion":"If a villain consistently wins over and over again, it could make them unlikable for several reasons related to storytelling dynamics and audience expectations: 1. **Lack of Justice**: Stories often serve as a reflection of moral and social values. Many audiences expect a narrative that culminates in justice, where the villain faces consequences for their actions. If a villain continuously wins, it may feel like there is no justice in the story, which can be deeply unsatisfying and potentially troubling for the audience. 2. **Predictability**: Just as with a hero who always wins, a villain who never loses can become predictable and monotonous. Audiences typically enjoy tension and suspense, and knowing that the villain will prevail in every encounter detracts from the narrative’s excitement and unpredictability. 3. **Unrelatable**: Overpowered villains who never lose might be difficult for the audience to relate to since their experiences might seem too far removed from the challenges and failures that humans face. A relatable antagonist who occasionally faces defeat can be more engaging because they embody the complexities of real-world adversities and setbacks. 4. **Stifling Character Growth**: Continuous victories for the villain can prevent the growth and development of other characters, particularly the heroes. The heroes' journey often includes learning from failures and overcoming obstacles. If they never get the chance to do this due to the villain's uninterrupted success, it can make for a stagnant and unengaging story. 5. **Emotional Disconnection**: Audiences often look for characters to cheer on, and they invest emotionally in the journey of those characters. If a villain's unending success crushes the protagonists repeatedly, it could lead to audience disengagement, as their emotional investment in the heroes' success goes unrewarded. 6. **Moral Discomfort**: Frequently, villains embody negative traits and harmful actions. If such characters are repeatedly victorious, it could create a sense of moral discomfort or unease among the audience, as it might seem to send a message that malevolent behavior leads to success. Overall, the balance of victories and losses between heroes and villains is essential to craft a compelling narrative. It is the dynamic interplay of wins and losses on both sides that creates suspense and allows for character and plot development. Too much dominance by any single character or group can skew the story and make it less appealing to the audience."},{"prompt":"I meant if you wanted the villain to be disliked have them keep winning.","completion":"Apologies for the earlier misunderstanding. Yes, indeed, having the villain consistently win can definitely be used as a narrative technique to make them more disliked by the audience. Here's why this strategy can be effective: 1. **Heightened Antagonism**: By allowing the villain to continue winning, the audience's antipathy towards them can grow. Constant triumphs by the villain amplify their threat and can provoke frustration or anger in the audience, who naturally root for the protagonists to overcome the challenges they face. 2. **Increased Tension**: The villain's successes can raise the stakes of the narrative. When a villain seems unstoppable, the tension and desperation in the heroes' struggle to defeat them grow, engaging the audience and deepening their desire to see the villain's eventual downfall. 3. **Greater Investment in the Hero's Journey**: If the villain keeps winning, the audience might invest more in the hero's journey, rooting for them and hoping for a meaningful triumphant moment. This investment can lead to an intensified emotional response when the villain finally does face justice or defeat. 4. **Moral Outrage**: Constant victories for the villain can provoke a sense of moral outrage, as it goes against the commonly accepted notion that good should triumph over evil. This can be an intentional choice by the storyteller to elicit a strong moral response from the audience against the villain. 5. **Emphasis on Negative Qualities**: When villains succeed, especially through underhanded or cruel means, it can accentuate their negative traits such as ruthlessness, immorality, or brutality. This makes them less likeable and more despised by the audience. 6. **Desire for Comeuppance**: Repeated victories can build anticipation for the villain's comeuppance. The narrative can satisfy the audience by eventually delivering a downfall that feels earned and proportionate to the villain's victories, making it all the more impactful. By considering these elements, writers can deliberately craft a villain who becomes increasingly unpopular with the audience, setting the stage for a powerful resolution that is all the more satisfying when the hero finally prevails or when the villain faces the consequences."},{"prompt":"So for the hero's victory, the Villain's actions must be impactful and permanent as well?","completion":"For a hero's victory to be truly impactful and satisfying, it's not so much about the villain's actions being permanent but rather about the significant and meaningful effects those actions have on the story and characters. The villain's actions should: 1. **Challenge the Hero**: Push the protagonist to their limits, prompting them to grow stronger, wiser, or more resilient. This demonstrates that the villain is a formidable adversary whose actions seriously affect the hero's journey. 2. **Alter the Status Quo**: Cause changes in the world or narrative that feel significant. Even if some of these changes are reversed by the story's end, their initial impact should create a sense of urgency and drive the plot forward. 3. **Affect Other Characters**: Influence the lives or arcs of supporting characters in ways that contribute to the overall depth of the story. When a villain's actions have wide-reaching implications, the hero's struggle gains greater emotional weight. 4. **Evoke Emotional Responses**: Provoke strong emotional reactions from both the characters within the story and the audience. Fear, anger, sadness, or even respect for the villain's cunning can make the hero's eventual victory more resonant. 5. **Pose Moral Questions**: Present ethical dilemmas or challenging decisions to the hero and perhaps the audience. A villain whose actions force the hero to confront difficult moral choices can enrich the narrative. Some permanence in the villain's actions can add to the gravitas of the conflict—such as irreversible consequences for certain characters or lasting changes to the fictional world. However, the key factor is that the villain's actions have enough weight to make the conflict with the hero meaningful and the ultimate victory significant. Whether or not the consequences of the villain's actions are permanent, they should feel impactful at the moment and contribute to the tension and stakes of the hero's journey. When the hero finally overcomes the villain, this victory is all the more powerful because of what had to be endured or sacrificed along the way."},{"prompt":"For a 'difficult' character with a troubled past, why would it be more impactful and less annoying if they themselves explain their behavior to the protagonist, instead of someone else?","completion":"Having a 'difficult' character with a troubled past explain their own behavior to the protagonist can be more impactful and less annoying for a number of narrative and psychological reasons: 1. **Authenticity**: When characters speak for themselves, it lends authenticity to their story. Hearing directly from the character allows for a more genuine and personal understanding of their motivations and feelings. This first-person perspective can make their backstory feel more real and their behavior more understandable. 2. **Emotional Resonance**: Self-disclosure can create an emotional connection between the character and the audience (or protagonist). By sharing their own experiences and vulnerabilities, the character may evoke empathy and allow the audience to become emotionally invested in their journey. 3. **Agency and Voice**: Having a character explain their own actions embodies agency. It's important for characters to have a voice in their narrative, particularly for those who've faced difficulties or traumas. It keeps the character from being merely an object of discussion and instead presents them as an active participant in their own story. 4. **Complexity and Depth**: Personal storytelling can reveal complexity and depth in a character that may not be apparent through their actions alone. It provides an opportunity to delve into their psyche, offering insights into their thought processes, which can shift perceptions and reduce annoyance by adding layers to the character. 5. **Immediate Clarification**: When a character explains their behavior directly, it can immediately clarify misunderstandings or misconceptions that may exist between them and the protagonist (or the audience). This direct approach can resolve tensions and contribute to character development and relationship dynamics. 6. **Dramatic Impact**: A character revealing their past in their own words can be a powerful and dramatic moment in the narrative, often serving as a turning point for their character arc or for the plot itself. This can be a key tool for writers to advance the story in a meaningful way. 7. **Avoidance of Exposition**: When background information about a character is relayed by a third party, it can sometimes feel like exposition or 'telling' rather than 'showing'. Having the character themselves explain their past avoids this pitfall and integrates their history more naturally into the dialogue and action. 8. **Trust and Intimacy**: Sharing personal struggles can build trust and intimacy between characters, and by extension, between the character and the audience. This confessional approach can deepen relationships and make future interactions more significant. By having the character own their narrative, the story avoids the pitfalls of exposition, fosters empathy, and respects the character's complexity, all of which are crucial for creating a more engaging and emotionally resonant narrative."},{"prompt":"what if the protagonist was allowed to be mad at their behavior, even as they are explaining it?","completion":"Allowing the protagonist to be mad at the difficult character while they are explaining their behavior adds a layer of realism and complexity to the interaction. It creates a more dynamic and emotionally charged scene, reflecting the way people often process new information, especially when it's related to past hurts or grievances. Here are some reasons why this can be effective and impactful: **1. Genuine Emotions:** Emotions like anger are a natural and authentic human response, especially when someone has been negatively affected by another person's actions. Allowing the protagonist to express anger acknowledges the validity of their feelings and can make the character more relatable to the audience. **2. Conflict and Resolution:** Anger can serve as a catalyst for conflict, which is a driving force in storytelling. Having the protagonist express their anger can intensify the emotional stakes of the scene, making the path toward eventual understanding or resolution more compelling. **3. Character Development:** The way characters handle anger and confrontation can reveal a lot about them. The protagonist's response provides insights into their personality, values, and capacity for forgiveness, while the difficult character's reaction to that anger can shed light on their own level of remorse and desire to change. **4. Realistic Dialogue:** People often have emotional, sometimes visceral, reactions during difficult conversations. By allowing characters to express anger, the dialogue can become more realistic, making the scene resonate more with real-life experiences. **5. Enhanced Drama and Tension:** Emotional friction between characters adds drama and tension to a narrative. As the protagonist works through their anger and the other character continues to explain themselves, the scene becomes more engaging, holding the audience's attention. **6. Empathy and Understanding:** The process of moving through anger to a place of understanding and empathy can make for a more satisfying character arc. Audiences often find stories of forgiveness and personal growth to be rewarding, especially when they can follow the journey step by step. **7. Opportunity for Reflection:** The difficult character's reaction to the protagonist's anger can prompt self-reflection. They may come to realize the full impact of their actions, leading to moments of self-awareness and potential growth. **8. Moral Complexity:** Life is not black and white, and neither are emotions or moral judgments. Allowing the protagonist to remain angry while understanding the difficult character's perspective adds nuance to the story, avoiding overly simplistic moral conclusions. This kind of emotionally rich interaction not only pushes the narrative forward but also provides a chance for both the difficult character and the protagonist to grow and evolve, potentially finding a way to reconcile or understand each other better by the end of the conversation."},{"prompt":"why could it be bad if other characters weren't allowed by the writer to be naturally angry at the difficult character simply because they have a tragic past?","completion":"If a writer doesn't allow other characters to naturally respond with anger or other genuine emotions toward a difficult character simply because of that character's tragic past, it can have several negative effects on the story and its reception: **1. Lack of Authenticity:** Realistic characters have emotional reactions that are shaped by their own experiences and perspectives. If characters within the narrative are not allowed to react authentically, it can make the story feel artificial or manipulative to the audience. **2. Missed Conflict Opportunities:** Conflict is a crucial element of drama and character development. By suppressing natural reactions such as anger, writers miss out on the opportunity to create realistic and meaningful conflicts that can drive the plot forward and deepen character relationships. **3. Diminished Emotional Range:** Characters need a range of emotions to feel three-dimensional. Restricting them to only sympathetic or understanding responses can flatten their emotional depth and the overall texture of the narrative. **4. Undermined Character Agency:** When characters are not allowed to feel or express anger, it can diminish their agency. It's important for characters to make their own choices, including how they process and respond to the actions of others. **5. Reduced Moral Complexity:** Moral dilemmas add richness to storytelling. If all characters automatically forgive or overlook the bad behavior of a difficult character due to their past, it simplifies moral questions and can make the story less engaging. **6. Unrealistic Resolutions:** Forgiveness or understanding that comes too easily, or without characters working through their natural emotions, may not feel earned. This can result in unsatisfying resolutions to conflicts within the story. **7. Audience Alienation:** Readers or viewers might find it hard to connect with a narrative if characters seem unnaturally forgiving or understanding. They might expect to see responses that mirror real-life reactions to challenging behavior, such as anger or hurt. **8. Overuse of Tragic Backstory Trope:** Relying too heavily on a tragic backstory to excuse a character's difficult behavior can become a trope if not handled well. It can be seen as a way to easily solicit sympathy without adequately addressing the character's actions or their impact on others. In sum, allowing characters their natural responses gives weight to the difficult character's actions and acknowledges the complexity of human interaction. Anger, along with a range of other emotions, can provoke introspection, propel the story, and ultimately lead to a more nuanced and satisfying narrative."},{"prompt":"could it be somewhat subversive and impactful if the other characters are still a little bitter even after hearing about the tragic past of the difficult character?","completion":"Yes, having other characters remain somewhat bitter even after hearing about the difficult character's tragic past can indeed be subversive and impactful. It can subvert common narrative expectations by challenging the trope of instant forgiveness or understanding upon disclosure of a tragic backstory. This approach also provides several benefits to the story's depth and realism: 1. **Realism in Emotions:** In the real world, a tragic backstory does not automatically lead to forgiveness or the dissolution of bitter feelings. People process emotions and experiences at different rates and in various ways, and some may never fully forgive. Portraying this reality adds authenticity to the characters and their relationships. 2. **Moral Ambiguity:** By showing that knowing someone's tragic past doesn't immediately erase bitterness, a story raises questions about the complexity of human morality and the idea of justice. It engages audiences in thinking about what is forgivable and the limits of empathy. 3. **Character Depth:** Characters who remain bitter are seen as having their own convictions, histories, and emotional baggage that affect how they interact with others. This can lead to more nuanced characters and more interesting dynamics between them. 4. **Story Tension:** Persistent bitterness can maintain or heighten tension within the story and between characters. This ongoing conflict can keep the audience engaged as they anticipate if and how these emotions will be resolved. 5. **Challenging Redemption Arcs:** When other characters remain bitter, the difficult character's road to redemption, if one is intended, becomes a more challenging and therefore potentially more rewarding narrative arc. It sets up a situation where redemption must be earned, rather than simply granted. 6. **Avoiding Clichés:** Often in storytelling, the revelation of a character's tragic past is used as a device to quickly garner audience sympathy and resolve interpersonal conflicts. Subverting this expectation can keep the story feeling fresh and unpredictable. 7. **Consequences of Actions:** Keeping some level of bitterness among characters upholds the concept that actions have lasting consequences. It underscores that pain caused by another's actions can have a deep and enduring effect, worth more than a simple explanatory conversation. By doing this, the writer can engage the audience on a deeper level; the story can explore themes of forgiveness, the impact of the past on the present, and the complicated process of healing and reconciliation. It also forces the difficult character to reckon more deeply with the impact of their actions, potentially leading to more meaningful character development."},{"prompt":"could it also mean the difficult character's behavior still has consequences? Also, what if they themselves actually feel bad for hurting the feelings of people that did nothing wrong to them?","completion":"Absolutely, maintaining some level of bitterness among characters indeed highlights that the difficult character's behavior has consequences. This approach sends a clear message: actions, especially harmful ones, have long-term effects on relationships and cannot be easily dismissed, even with a tragic backstory. Here's how this can play out: **1. Lasting Consequences:** By not allowing immediate forgiveness, it reinforces the idea that there are lasting repercussions to the difficult character's actions. This can lead to more in-depth exploration of themes like accountability and the process of making amends. **2. Earned Redemption:** If the difficult character truly feels remorseful about their actions, this creates an opportunity for them to work towards redemption in a way that feels earned. Their efforts to atone for past behavior can become a significant aspect of their character development. **3. Increased Empathy:** A character who is self-aware enough to feel bad for hurting others, and motivated to change as a result, is likely to evoke more empathy from the audience. This self-awareness can help balance the character's negative traits and make their journey more poignant. **4. Relatable Flaws:** A difficult character who acknowledges and regrets their behavior will come across as more human and relatable. Most people can understand the experience of having acted in ways they later regret, especially if it negatively affected others. **5. Growth through Conflict:** Since the difficult character's actions have consequences that can't be easily resolved, there is a stronger foundation for storytelling that involves internal and external conflict. Such conflict can drive both the plot and character development, as each affected character must grapple with the situation and find a way forward. **6. Interpersonal Dynamics:** The fabric of the relationships between all characters becomes richer and more textured if some retain a sense of bitterness. It allows for a range of interactions based on various stages of understanding, forgiveness, or resentment, rather than a unilateral resolution. In essence, allowing for natural reactions to a difficult character's behavior—even in light of their tragic past—helps maintain the story's integrity and encourages a more realistic portrayal of emotional complexity. A remorseful difficult character who seeks redemption can provide a deeply engaging narrative arc as they learn, grow, and potentially transform through their interactions with others. These elements can make the story more captivating and give the audience a chance to see the true depth of the human spirit in facing and overcoming the echoes of past mistakes."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) Hood: “Ah!

Sembrerebbe che questo script tenti di eseguire un ordine di vendita, e si occupa anche della gestione di errori. Analizziamo il codice passo per passo per capire cosa fa: 1. Il primo \`if\` controlla se il valore della variabile \`I_i_1\` è maggiore di 5; in tal caso, restituisce il valore di \`L_i_11\` ed esce dalla funzione. 2. Il secondo \`if\` verifica se \`I_i_1\` è esattamente uguale a 2. Se è vero, il codice entra in questo blocco. 3. All'interno del secondo \`if\`, la variabile \`L_i_13\` viene inizializzata a 0, e poi c'è un altro controllo che vede se \`L_i_14\` è minore o uguale a 0; se lo è, restituisce \`L_i_11\`. 4. Successivamente, c'è un ciclo \`do-while\` che continua a eseguire finché la condizione (ovvero \`L_i_13\` minore di \`L_i_14\`) è vera. 5. All'interno del ciclo, diverse variabili vengono inizializzate con valori. 6. La funzione \`OrderSend\` viene chiamata, con alcuni parametri già discusso nella risposta precedente. Questa è la chiamata che in effetti invia l'ordine di vendita al server. Gli argomenti pertinenti per Stop Loss e Take Profit sono \`G_d_2\` e \`G_d_3\`. 7. La tua osservazione su Stop Loss (\`G_i_2\`) e Take Profit (\`G_i_3\`) non è completamente corretta. Guardando il codice, sia Stop Loss (\`G_d_2\`) che Take Profit (\`G_d_3\`) vengono calcolati e impostati, ma sotto specifiche condizioni. - Take Profit (\`G_d_3\`) viene calcolato solo se \`Fa_i_06\` (che viene assegnata a \`G_i_5\`) non è zero, aggiungendo un certo numero di _Point al prezzo di attivazione (\`G_d_108\`). - Stop Loss (\`G_d_2\`) viene calcolato solo se \`G_i_3\` (che viene calcolato come l'intero di \`I_d_82\`) non è zero, sottraendo \`G_d_10\` (calcolato come \`G_i_3 * _Point\`) dal \`Fa_d_04\`. 8. Dopo l'invio dell'ordine con \`OrderSend\`, il risultato viene verificato. Se l'ordine è stato eseguito con successo (indicato da \`L_i_11 > 0\`), il contatore \`I_i_76\` viene incrementato. 9. In caso di errore nell'esecuzione dell'ordine (\`GetLastError()\` restituisce un codice di errore diverso da zero), il codice analizza l'errore e decide se è un errore temporaneo per cui vale la pena riprovare. Se è un errore gestibile (ad esempio, errore 4, 137, 146, o 136), quindi il ciclo dorme per 1 secondo (con \`Sleep(1000)\`) e poi riprova fino a un numero massimo di tentativi (\`L_i_14\`). 10. Alla fine del ciclo \`do-while\`, viene sempre restituito il valore di \`L_i_11\`, indipendentemente dal successo o meno dell'ordine. In conclusione, lo script cerca di piazzare un ordine di vendita e imposta sia lo Stop Loss che il Take Profit in base alle condizioni specificate, ma solo se le variabili chiave non sono impostate a zero. Se l'ordine non va a buon fine, tenta di ripete l'operazione per un certo numero di volte prima di uscire."},{"prompt":"analizzando questo pezzo di codice, sapresti dirmi perchè quando è in funzione il tp viene impostato, ma non lo sl?","completion":"Analizzando il codice fornito, possiamo vedere le condizioni per impostare lo Stop Loss (SL) e il Take Profit (TP).

Ciò vorrebbe dire che non viene richiesto uno Stop Loss quando l'ordine viene inviato. 2. **Blocco di errore non coperto:** Se ci fosse un errore specifico nel blocco di codice che gestisce gli errori (non mostrato qui), che impedisce il corretto invio dello SL assieme all'ordine, potrebbe spiegare il fenomeno osservato. 3. **Valori inaspettati delle variabili:** Se \`G_d_106\` o \`G_d_10\` hanno valori che non risultano in un valido Stop Loss (ad esempio, risultano in un valore negativo o in un valore troppo vicino al prezzo corrente), questo potrebbe far fallire l'impostazione dello Stop Loss. 4. **Errore logico nel codice sorgente:** Un errore di logica nell'algoritmo potrebbe risultare nella mancata impostazione dello SL, come condizioni non previste o errate valutazioni dei requisiti di trading del broker. Per un'analisi definitiva sarebbe utile conoscere i valori in input nel momento in cui si presenta il problema. Un modo per investigare questo comportamento potrebbe essere l'aggiunta di istruzioni di stampa di debug nel codice MQL4 (funzione \`Print()\`) per monitorare i valori delle variabili subito prima della chiamata \`OrderSend()\`. Ciò aiuterà a determinare il motivo per cui lo SL non viene impostato, mostrando il valore effettivo di tutte le variabili e parametri rilevanti."},{"prompt":"questo è una porzione più grande del codice. vengono ripetute le funzioni di ordine. in ognuno viene definito tp e sl differenti, ma lo sl non funziona in nessuno. saperesti dirmi perchè? if (I_i_1 > 5) return L_i_11;

Ogni blocco definisce i propri valori per il Take Profit (TP) e lo Stop Loss (SL), ma se il TP viene impostato correttamente e lo SL no, ci sono vari aspetti del codice e del contesto che dobbiamo considerare: 1. **Problemi con i parametri della funzione \`OrderSend()\`:** Il valore che imposti per lo SL potrebbe non essere valido per il server di trading. Ad esempio, potrebbe essere troppo vicino al prezzo di mercato corrente o al di sotto del minimo richiesto dalla tua politica del broker per lo SL. 2. **Impostazione del prezzo di SL errata:** Se lo SL viene impostato al di sotto del prezzo attuale per un ordine di vendita o al di sopra per un ordine di acquisto, l'ordine verrà immediatamente chiuso a causa dello SL. Assicurati che la logica per lo SL impostato sia corretta e rispetti la direzione dell'ordine. 3. **Valori delle variabili errati:** Se le variabili \`G_i_3\`, \`G_i_8\`, \`G_i_14\`, \`G_i_19\`, \`G_i_139\` o \`G_i_28\` sono calcolate o convertite in modo errato (ad esempio, risultano essere \`0\` o un valore non intenzionale dopo il casting con \`(int)\`), lo SL non verrà impostato come previsto. 4. **Valore di \`_Point\` non corretto:** Se il valore di \`_Point\` (che rappresenta il valore di un punto per l'attuale simbolo di trading in termini di prezzo) è errato o obsoleto, i calcoli per lo SL possono essere compromessi. Potresti dover chiamare \`RefreshRates()\` prima di calcolare gli SL per assicurarti di avere le informazioni più aggiornate. 5. **Impostazioni del broker:** Alcuni broker potrebbero avere restrizioni o requisiti specifici sull'impostazione di SL e TP. Verifica che il tuo broker non abbia requisiti minimi di distanza per lo SL dal prezzo attuale di mercato o altre restrizioni relative. 6. **Restrizioni relative alla dimensione del lotto o leva finanziaria:** In certi casi, potrebbero esservi restrizioni sulle dimensioni degli ordini o sulla leva finanziaria che comportano la necessità di adeguare SL e TP. 7. **Eccezioni di trading non catturate:** Codici di errore particolari (diversi da quelli che il codice cerca di gestire) potrebbero causare il mancato impostazione dello SL e possono non essere visualizzati o gestiti dal tuo codice.

Una volta confermato che i valori delle variabili di input siano corretti e che gli SL e TP calcolati siano diversi da zero, il problema dovrebbe essere chiarito.

Esaminiamo ciò che la funzione cerca di realizzare: - \`Fa_i_00\`: Una soglia (espressa in pips, probabilmente) che deve essere superata perché l'ordine possa essere modificato. - \`Fa_i_01\`: Un nuovo valore (espresso in pips, probabilmente) per calcolare la nuova posizione dello Stop Loss (SL). - \`Fa_d_02\`: Un nuovo prezzo per il punto di ingresso dell'ordine, che potrebbe essere utilizzato come nuovo Take Profit (TP). La funzione esegue un ciclo che itera attraverso tutti gli ordini aperti e verifica se corrispondono al simbolo di trading corrente (\`_Symbol\`) e al numero magico (\`OrderMagicNumber()\`) confrontato con \`I_i_71\` (che presumibilmente identifica gli ordini gestiti da questa funzione o dallo script/EA che la utilizza). Per ogni ordine che corrisponde, esegue le seguenti operazioni: - Controlla il tipo di ordine: se è un ordine buy (\`OP_BUY\`) o un ordine sell (\`OP_SELL\`). - Calcola la distanza tra il prezzo corrente (Bid o Ask, a seconda del tipo di ordine) e il nuovo prezzo di ingresso proposto \`Fa_d_02\`. - Valuta se questa distanza supera la soglia \`Fa_i_00\`. - Legge lo Stop Loss corrente dell'ordine utilizzando \`OrderStopLoss()\`. - Calcola una nuova proposta per lo Stop Loss basata sui pips \`Fa_i_01\`. - Utilizza \`OrderModify()\` per tentare di modificare l'ordine con il nuovo prezzo di ingresso e il nuovo Stop Loss calcolato, ma solo se la nuova proposta SL è migliore del precedente SL (più lontano dal prezzo di ingresso attuale per un ordine buy e più vicino per un ordine sell). È importante notare che la funzione controlla che il nuovo SL sia \\"migliore\\" in accordo con le regole di trading di base: in un commercio buy, il nuovo SL dovrebbe essere inferiore all'attuale SL, e in un commercio sell, dovrebbe essere superiore all'attuale SL. Ciò aiuta a evitare di spostare lo SL in una direzione che potrebbe risultare in una chiusura anticipata dell'ordine. Infine, la chiamata a \`Sleep(1000)\` viene utilizzata per inserire una pausa tra le modifiche degli ordini. Questo è probabilmente fatto per evitare di sovraccaricare il server di trading con richieste eccessive in un brevissimo lasso di tempo. Complessivamente, la funzione sembra progettata per modificare lo SL ed eventualmente anche il prezzo di ingresso degli ordini, ma non modifica direttamente il TP (a meno che \`Fa_d_02\` non sia previsto come TP, il che non è chiaro dal contesto dato)."},{"prompt":"questa funzione, ivece, cosa fa? int f0_1(bool FuncArg_Boolean_00000000, bool FuncArg_Boolean_00000001) { string S_s_20; string S_s_21; string S_s_22; string S_s_23; int L_i_15; int L_i_11; int L_i_12; L_i_15 = 0; L_i_11 = 0; L_i_12 = 0; G_d_2 = 0; G_d_106 = 0; L_i_11 = 0; L_i_12 = OrdersTotal() - 1; if (L_i_12 < 0) return L_i_11; do { if (OrderSelect(L_i_12, 0, 0) && OrderSymbol() == _Symbol && OrderMagicNumber() == I_i_71) { if (OrderType() == OP_BUY && FuncArg_Boolean_00000000) { RefreshRates(); if (!IsTradeContextBusy()) { if (!OrderClose(OrderTicket(), OrderLots(), NormalizeDouble(Bid, _Digits), 5, 4294967295)) { S_s_20 = (string)OrderTicket(); S_s_20 = \\"Error close BUY \\" + S_s_20; Print(S_s_20); L_i_11 = -1; } } else { G_l_22 = iTime(NULL, 0, 0); G_l_23 = I_i_131; if (G_l_23 == G_l_22) { L_i_15 = -2; return L_i_15; } I_i_131 = (int)iTime(NULL, 0, 0); S_s_21 = (string)OrderTicket(); S_s_21 = \\"Need close BUY \\" + S_s_21; S_s_21 = S_s_21 + \\".

Accetta due argomenti booleani (\`FuncArg_Boolean_00000000\` e \`FuncArg_Boolean_00000001\`) che presumibilmente controllano se la funzione dovrebbe considerare la chiusura di ordini di tipo buy e sell, rispettivamente. Ecco un'analisi di ciò che fa la funzione: 1. Inizializza una serie di variabili locali e le variabili globali \`G_d_2\` e \`G_d_106\` a \`0\`. 2. Calcola l'indice del possibile ultimo ordine aperto con \`OrdersTotal() - 1\`. 3. Entra in un ciclo \`do-while\`, che viene eseguito finché l'indice dell'ordine \`L_i_12\` è maggiore o uguale a \`0\`. 4. Seleziona l'ordine a quell'indice tramite \`OrderSelect(L_i_12, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_TRADES)\` e verifica che l'ordine corrisponda sia allo strumento finanziario (\`_Symbol\`) correntemente scelto sulla piattaforma sia al numero magico (\`OrderMagicNumber()\`) \`I_i_71\`, che è probabilmente associato agli ordini gestiti da questa funzione o dallo script/EA che la usa. 5. Se l'ordine selezionato è un ordine di tipo buy (\`OP_BUY\`) e \`FuncArg_Boolean_00000000\` è \`true\`, prova a chiudere l'ordine chiamando \`OrderClose()\` al prezzo corrente di Bid. Se la chiusura fallisce, stampa un messaggio di errore e imposta \`L_i_11\` a \`-1\`. 6. Se l'ordine selezionato è un ordine di tipo sell (\`OP_SELL\`) e \`FuncArg_Boolean_00000001\` è \`true\`, prova a chiudere l'ordine chiamando \`OrderClose()\` al prezzo corrente di Ask. Se la chiusura fallisce, stampa un messaggio di errore e imposta \`L_i_11\` a \`-1\`. 7. Gestisce il contesto di trading occupato (\`IsTradeContextBusy()\`). Se il contesto è occupato, entra in un ramo della logica che imposta vari timestamp e stampa messaggi rilevanti. Se il contesto è stato occupato per troppo tempo o non è cambiato da quando è stato controllato l'ultima volta (presumendo che ciò che viene confrontato siano timestamp), assegna \`-2\` a \`L_i_15\` e restituisce tale valore. 8. Infine, dopo aver tentato di chiudere gli ordini, la funzione restituisce il valore di \`L_i_15\`, che rappresenta l'esito della chiusura degli ordini (\`0\` se non ci sono stati errori o trade context busy, \`-1\` se c'è stato un errore di chiusura di un ordine, \`-2\` se il contesto di trading è occupato e non è cambiato per un tempo prolungato). Questo metodo sembra essere utilizzato per gestire un pulito allontanamento o partenza dello script o dell'EA che la include, assicurandosi che tutti gli ordini siano chiusi prima di fermare lo script. La funzione usufruisce di alcune best practice, come la verifica del contesto di trading per evitare di aggiungere comandi quando non può gestirne di nuovi e il rinfrescamento dei tassi di trading prima di chiudere gli ordini per ottenere i prezzi più recenti."},{"prompt":"questo è il codice intero. qual'è la parte in cui modifica il takeprofit?","completion":"Il frammento di codice che hai fornito in precedenza non mostra una modifica diretta del TakeProfit. L'unico caso in cui abbiamo visto una possibile modifica agli ordini è stato all'interno della funzione \`f0_18\`, dove vengono potenzialmente modificati gli ordini, incluso il loro StopLoss (SL) ma non il TakeProfit (TP) direttamente. Nel codice di \`f0_1\`, non viene mostrata una modifica al TP, ma solo l'intento di chiudere i trade a mercato al prezzo corrente se determinate condizioni booleane sono soddisfatte. Dato che non hai fornito il codice completo che stai analizzando, è possibile che la parte che modifica il TP sia in una parte del codice che non è stata inclusa nei frammenti condivisi. In un programma MQL4, una modifica al TP di un ordine esistente avverrebbe tipicamente con l'uso della funzione \`OrderModify()\`. La firma generale di \`OrderModify()\` è la seguente: \`\`\`mql4 bool OrderModify( int ticket, // ticket double price, // price double stoploss, // stop loss double takeprofit, // take profit datetime expiration, // expiration color arrow_color // color ); \`\`\` Se nel codice che stai analizzando non ci sono chiamate a \`OrderModify()\` con il parametro \`takeprofit\` diverso da zero, allora non c'è modifica diretta del TP.

Oscar-Claude Monet (1840-1926) : Claude Monet était un peintre français fondateur du mouvement impressionniste. Né à Paris, il est surtout connu pour ses magnifiques séries de peintures de jardins, de paysages et de nénuphars. Monet était un peintre de plein air passionné, qui transformait la lumière et la couleur en véritables poèmes visuels. Son style impressionniste unique et novateur a eu une influence majeure sur l'histoire de l'art. 2. Edgar Degas (1834-1917) : Edgar Degas était un peintre et sculpteur français associé au mouvement impressionniste. Né à Paris, il est célèbre pour ses peintures de danseuses, de scènes de café et de chevaux de course. Degas était connu pour sa maîtrise du mouvement et de la lumière, ainsi que pour sa représentation réaliste de la vie urbaine parisienne. Il a également expérimenté avec des techniques mixtes et des compositions audacieuses. 3. Édouard Manet (1832-1883) : Édouard Manet était un peintre français considéré comme un précurseur de l'impressionnisme. Né à Paris, il a été un artiste controversé de son temps, défiant les conventions artistiques et sociales établies. Manet est célèbre pour ses portraits audacieux, ses scènes de genre modernes et son utilisation novatrice de la couleur et de la lumière.

However, hours later, the elevator still hasn’t reached their destination.) Unicorn: “Um, guys, I think we might be stuck…” Hood: “Oh dear, it seems like the elevator is malfunctioning. I’ll try to contact the staff to come and fix it.” Cheshire: “Well, this is certainly an unexpected turn of events. At least we have each other for company while we wait.” Grenville: “Yeah, we can use this time to bond and maybe even come up with some new training strategies. Who knows, maybe being stuck in an elevator will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.” Hood: “I suppose you’re right, Grenville. Let’s make the most of this situation and use it as an opportunity to strengthen our camaraderie.” (Just then, Cheshire starts to feel uncomfortable - mostly from the gas in her stomach.) Cheshire: “HNGH…we’ve been waiting for minutes! Sorry, but I’ve been holding this all day.” (Cheshire suddenly releases non-stop gas, filling the elevator with a noxious smell.) Unicorn: (coughing) “Oh my… Cheshire, do you need to see the doctor?” Hood: (trying not to gag) “Cheshire, that was quite unexpected… I think we all need some fresh air after that. Let’s hope the maintenance team arrives soon.” Grenville: (chuckling) “Well, Cheshire certainly knows how to break the tension, that’s for sure. At least we won’t forget this elevator ride anytime soon.” (As they wait for help to arrive, the group shares a few laughs and tries to make the best of their unexpected situation. Eventually, the maintenance team arrives and is able to get the elevator moving again - even though Cheshire is still releasing gas.) Hood: “Thank goodness! I think we all could use some fresh air after that ordeal.” Unicorn: “I agree. Let’s head to the training range and pick up where we left off.

In gaming, NPCs are designed to follow predetermined paths and cannot make their own decisions outside of their programming. In political and social discourse, the term \\"NPC\\" has been co-opted as a pejorative to describe individuals who are perceived to lack independent thought and who blindly follow the ideas, narratives, or talking points of a particular political ideology or party without critical analysis. It suggests that these individuals do not think for themselves but instead repeat what they have been told, akin to the scripted responses of NPCs in video games. The term became popular among certain online communities as a way to mock opponents on social media for what they view as unoriginality or a lack of cognitive engagement with diverse viewpoints. It is often used to call attention to the repetition of slogans, hashtags, or arguments that seem to be shared without much personal insight or reflection. It's important to note that the use of the term \\"NPC\\" to describe people in real-life political discussions is contentious and can be insulting. It is often associated with very specific online subcultures and might not be well-received in more formal or polite discourse. The label implies a degree of conformity and intellectual passivity that many would find offensive or dehumanizing."},{"prompt":"Write dialogue from Hailey’s on It where 14 year old Hailey Banks feeling angry after someone tickled her feet","completion":"\\"Stop it!

Recommendations for Optimized Utilization A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computers, networks or applications for known weaknesses. These scanners are used to discover the weaknesses of a given system. They are utilized in the identification and detection of vulnerabilities arising from mis-configurations or flawed programming within a network-based asset such as a firewall, router, web server, application server, etc. Modern vulnerability scanners allow for both authenticated and unauthenticated scans. Modern scanners are typically available as SaaS (Software as a Service); provided over the internet and delivered as a web application. The modern vulnerability scanner often has the ability to customize vulnerability reports as well as the installed software, open ports, certificates and other host information that can be queried as part of its workflow. Authenticated scans allow for the scanner to directly access network based assets using remote administrative protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP) and authenticate using provided system credentials. This allows the vulnerability scanner to access low-level data, such as specific services and configuration details of the host operating system. It's then able to provide detailed and accurate information about the operating system and installed software, including configuration issues and missing security patches.[1] Unauthenticated scans is a method that can result in a high number of false positives and is unable to provide detailed information about the assets operating system and installed software. This method is typically used by threat actors or security analyst trying determine the security posture of externally accessible assets.[1] Vulnerability scanners should be able to detect the risks in open-source dependencies. However, since developers will usually re-bundle the OSS, the same code will appear in different dependencies, which will then impact the performance and ability of scanners to detect the vulnerable OSS.[2] The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense designates continuous vulnerability scanning as a critical control for effective cyber defense. Vulnerability scanners are software or hardware tools used to diagnose and monitor network computers, allowing you to scan networks, computers and applications to detect possible security problems, assess and eliminate vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners allow you to check various applications in your system for holes that could be exploited by attackers. Low-level tools, such as a port scanner, can also be used to identify and analyze possible applications and protocols running on the system. 1 Types of vulnerability scanners 2 Software 3 See also 4 Notes 5 Literature Types of Vulnerability Scanners The work of a vulnerability scanner can be divided into 4 steps: Typically, the scanner first detects active IP addresses, open ports, running operating system and applications. A security report is generated (optional step). Attempting to determine the level of possible interference with the operating system or applications (may result in a crash). At the final stage, the scanner can exploit the vulnerability, causing the operating system or application to crash. Scanners can be malicious or friendly. The latter usually stop at step 2 or 3, but never get to step 4. Among the vulnerability scanners we can highlight: Port scanner Scanners examining the topology of a computer network Scanners that examine network service vulnerabilities Network worms CGI scanners (\\"friendly\\" - help find vulnerable scripts) Software Top ten vulnerability scanners according to insecure.org (2006)[1] Nessus: Vulnerability Assessment for UNIX GFI LANguard: Commercial network vulnerability scanner for Windows Retina: A commercial vulnerability assessment scanner Core Impact: Automated intrusion testing product ISS Internet Scanner: Application Level Vulnerability Assessment X-scan: Network vulnerability scanner Sara: Security Auditor's Research Assistant QualysGuard: Vulnerability scanner (web service) SAINT: Security Administrator's Integrated Network Tool MBSA: Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Other well-known vulnerability scanners: XSpider OpenVAS ERPScan SAP security scanner SurfPatrol COMPLAUD RedCheck Web Application Vulnerability Scanners are automated tools that scan web applications, normally from the outside, to look for security vulnerabilities such as Cross-site scripting, SQL Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal and insecure server configuration. This category of tools is frequently referred to as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools. A large number of both commercial and open source tools of this type are available and all of these tools have their own strengths and weaknesses. If you are interested in the effectiveness of DAST tools, check out the OWASP Benchmark project, which is scientifically measuring the effectiveness of all types of vulnerability detection tools, including DAST. OWASP is aware of the Web Application Vulnerability Scanner Evaluation Project (WAVSEP). WAVSEP is completely unrelated to OWASP and we do not endorse its results, nor any of the DAST tools it evaluates. However, the results provided by WAVSEP may be helpful to someone interested in researching or selecting free and/or commercial DAST tools for their projects. This project has far more detail on DAST tools and their features than this OWASP DAST page. Vulnerability scanner - a software or hardware product for searching for threats in infrastructure companies. The scanner is used to detect gaps in network protection, operating systems, databases, applications, etc. The main task is to assess information security, identify vulnerabilities and provide reports. Using a scanner, an administrator can find “holes” that hackers use to obtain unauthorized access (NAA) to confidential data on the company network. A vulnerability scanner can monitor running processes, services and scan used ports. Vulnerability scanner - a software or hardware product for searching for threats in infrastructure companies.

Using a scanner, an administrator can find “holes” that hackers use to obtain unauthorized access (NAA) to confidential data on the company network. A vulnerability scanner can monitor running processes, services and scan used ports. Main functions The software product has the following functions: How the scanner works searches for various types of network vulnerabilities and analyzes them in real time; checks network resources, OS, connected devices, ports; analyzes all active processes and the behavior of running applications; creates reports that indicate the type of vulnerability. Probing. An effective but slow way to find and analyze vulnerabilities. Its essence is that the solution initiates virtual attacks and monitors the network infrastructure to search for vulnerable points. By At the end of the process, the administrator is provided with a detailed report indicating the problems found and recommendations for their deactivation. Scanning. In this mode, the scanner operates at the maximum possible speed, but analyzes the network infrastructure at the surface level. That is, it detects obvious vulnerabilities and analyzes the overall infrastructure security. Compared to the previous method, this method only warns about found administrator problems, but nothing more. What actions does a vulnerability scanner perform? Scanners can be \\"friendly\\" or \\"aggressive\\". The first type simply collects information and does not model attack. The second exploits the vulnerability to cause software to crash. Collects information from the entire infrastructure: active processes, running applications, running ports and devices, services, etc. Search for potential vulnerabilities using different methods. Uses special methods of simulating attacks to find possible vulnerabilities (the function is not available in every scanner). Generates a detailed report with information about found vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners are the front line of vulnerability management. They are essential for identifying vulnerabilities that could be used by bad actors to compromise systems and data. In the old days of monolithic on-premise applications, vulnerability scanners were deployed primarily in the production environment as infrastructure watchdogs that alerted to runtime threats. This paradigm became obsolete with the emergence of cloud-native applications that leverage the powerful scalability and agility of modern cloud-based infrastructure. As applications and the tools to secure them become more complex, solutions like ASPM are emerging to bring together the different data streams and enable risk based prioritization and remediation. Today’s highly automated CI/CD pipelines cannot tolerate security testing bottlenecks. The detection and remediation of vulnerabilities must keep up with the frenetic pace of mature DevOps practices. Yet another challenge to legacy security paradigms is the highly distributed architecture of cloud-native applications, based on dynamic components such as open-source libraries, serverless functions, infrastructure as code (IaC), and containers. In short, cloud-native applications require a new cloud-native application security paradigm: ensuring that vulnerabilities are detected and fixed during development with a holistic approach that makes security an integral part of the software development life cycle (SDLC). In this article, we describe the different kinds of vulnerability scanners that, together, provide cloud-native security coverage for websites, web applications, networks, open-source code, WordPress content, and containers (such as our Docker scanner). 3 Most common types of scanners Network vulnerability scanners Web application vulnerability scanners Open-source vulnerability scanners 1. Network Vulnerability Scanners Network vulnerability scanners monitor web servers, their operating systems, their daemons and any other services open to the internet such as database services. Network vulnerability scanners work against a database of known vulnerabilities. Many of these databases rely on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program’s free and comprehensive catalog of known software and firmware vulnerabilities. Each standardized record is comprised of a unique CVE identifier, a brief description, and at least one public reference. Going one step further, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) enriches the CVE List with a numerical score of the vulnerability’s technical severity. However, the best network vulnerability scanning results are achieved with proprietary vulnerability databases that continuously aggregate and analyze information from a wide range of sources. A good example is the Snyk Vulnerability Database, which is tightly integrated with vulnerability databases, threat intelligence systems, community sources, and academia. Hand-curated by a dedicated security team, Snyk’s Vulnerability Database optimizes network vulnerability scanners so that they can deliver accurate and actionable insights. This heightened ability to extract maximal insights into network vulnerabilities is important for operational reasons as well. The not-for-profit Center for Internet Security (CIS) maintains a set of CIS Controls to help organizations implement cybersecurity best practices. One of the basic controls is that vulnerability management—including scanning—be continuous. However, because network vulnerability scans can cause congestion, scans are typically carried out only once a week. It is therefore critical that these scans be carried out against an enriched database that provides comprehensive coverage into known and unknown vulnerabilities. 2. Web Application/Website Vulnerability Scanners Web vulnerability scanners scan application/website code to find vulnerabilities that compromise the application/website itself or its back-end services. They are an essential component of application security testing. These scanners work against a known list of common exploits as maintained by OWASP and others. These exploits use various injection and evasion techniques to “hijack” web applications and websites in order to exfiltrate data, to trick users or systems into providing sensitive information, or to disrupt application performance. Some of the better known exploits are SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, and malicious code. When it comes to web applications, the only effective vulnerability management strategy is to adopt a shift-left DevSecOps approach and deploy scanners throughout a secure SDLC (software development life cycle). This battery of scanners includes static application security tools (SAST) that automatically scan uncompiled code for vulnerabilities, and dynamic application security tools (DAST) that automatically scan compiled code across all environments from testing to production. Another important tool is penetration testing, which essentially simulates hackers in order to discover if a web application or website is vulnerable to malicious exploits. There are even website vulnerability scanner online services that conduct third-party penetration testing. The Snyk SAST solution has been designed from the ground up to overcome the challenges that developers and ethical hackers face with legacy SAST tools, such as taking hours or even days to complete a scan, high false positive rates, and requiring deep security knowledge to remedy issues. With Snyk Code, SAST becomes a seamless part of the development process, providing developers and security teams with real-time and accurate visibility into code vulnerabilities and how to fix them. 3. Open-Source Vulnerability Scanners Open-source vulnerability scanners are software composition analysis (SCA) tools that scan applications to discover all open-source frameworks and libraries—including all direct and indirect dependencies—and identify vulnerabilities. Some open-source vulnerability scanners also help developers in the non-trivial task of precisely locating the vulnerable code in the codebase. Seeing that using components with known vulnerabilities is one of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, organizations must ensure that they are using a state-of-the-art open-source vulnerability scanner. The advantages of the Snyk open-source vulnerability scanner include: Early detection of open-source code vulnerabilities, before web applications or websites have been compromised. Prompt discovery of all instances affected by a detected open-source code vulnerability, so that attackers can be locked out and issues can be remediated faster. Clear documentation of all open-source frameworks and libraries used in applications. Ensures compliance with open-source license requirements. How to Evaluate a Vulnerability Scanner The good news is that there are many commercial and free vulnerability scanners available on the market today. However the flip side to that is that having so many options can make it difficult to evaluate which scanner stack is optimal for your requirements. The first step is to learn more about the vulnerability scanners. OWASP maintains a comprehensive listing of commercial and free vulnerability scanners, although they refrain from ranking them. Other trusted influencers provide “Top xx” lists of recommended scanners. Once you have created a short list of vulnerability scanners, you can try them out. Even the commercial vulnerability scanners offer free trials so that you can kick the tires before making a final decision. Given the diverse set of vulnerability scanners that you will have to deploy in order to achieve end-to-end coverage across all your environments, you may also want to consider a vulnerability management platform that knows how to integrate with all your scanners and correlate their outputs into a single source of vulnerability management truth. Why is vulnerability scanning important? Vulnerability scanning is the essential front end of any vulnerability management program. Today, vulnerability management is no longer a nice-to-have but rather a business-critical requirement for any organization running web applications or interactive websites. These kinds of public-facing assets are common attack vectors for malicious actors seeking unauthorized access to systems and data. What are the types of vulnerability scans? Vulnerability scans differ depending on how they are deployed and what they are scanning. Scans can be internal or external, credentialed or non-credentialed, and comprehensive or device-specific. The optimal operating modality depends on what is being scanned: networks, web applications throughout the secure software development life cycle, or open-source codes and libraries.","completion":"Based on the technical information provided, the report on \\"Advantages and Disadvantages of Vulnerability Scanners\\" can be constructed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of vulnerability scanning technology and its role in cybersecurity.

When creating a fictional universe, it is important to reflect the complexities of real social dynamics, which includes a variety of personalities, opinions, and interactions. Inclusivity in a character can manifest in several ways, such as: 1. Representation: An inclusive character might represent diverse backgrounds, identities, beliefs, or abilities that are authentically integrated into the story. This can help different types of readers see themselves in the narrative. 2. Agency: The character has the initiative and decision-making power within the story, contributing significantly to the plot. They are not merely a background character but are central to how the story unfolds. 3. Multidimensional portrayal: The character is well-rounded, with strengths, weaknesses, goals, fears, and a personal arc that adds depth and relatability. Having other characters in the universe with their own perspectives, including negative or prejudicial ones, can create critical conflicts and challenges that are important elements of storytelling. These dynamics allow for: 1. Growth and change: Through interaction with diverse characters, the inclusive character may face and overcome adversity, leading to character development. 2. Realism: Real-world experiences often involve dealing with people who may not be accepting or understanding. Reflecting this in a story can make the narrative more believable and impactful. 3. Discussion of themes: It introduces themes of acceptance, tolerance, and social dynamics, and can encourage readers to reflect on these issues. 4. Enhancing others' storylines: The relationships between characters with differing views can contribute to the growth and transformation of those characters as well. In this way, the inclusivity of one character and the varied reactions of others do not act in opposition but rather contribute to the richness and authenticity of the story's world. The way characters interact with one another, how they are influenced by each other's actions, and how they contribute to the overall tapestry of the story are essential components of creating a narrative that resonates with audiences."},{"prompt":"Why could it be bad if the inclusive character's character arc is only about overcoming hatred towards themselves?","completion":"Focusing solely on an inclusive character's arc being about overcoming hatred towards themselves can be problematic for several reasons: 1. **Singular Narrative**: If an inclusive character’s entire story is about coping with others’ prejudice, it reduces the complexity of their character to a single dimension and confines their identity and value within the story to their marginalized status. 2. **Reinforcement of Negative Stereotypes**: It can inadvertently reinforce the notion that a character's marginalized identity is the most significant aspect of their identity and that conflict or oppression is an inevitable, all-consuming part of their lives. 3. **Lack of Agency**: Such a restrictive arc can deprive the character of agency, making them constantly reactive to discrimination rather than proactive in their own life and story. 4. **Missed Opportunities for Character Development**: By focusing narrowly on prejudice, the story overlooks other aspects of the character’s identity and the potential for a broader range of experiences and growth. 5. **Audience Fatigue**: Readers or viewers may become tired of seeing characters from certain backgrounds constantly portrayed as victims of hatred, which can be emotionally draining and alienating. 6. **Tokenism**: It increases the risk of the character feeling tokenistic if their only purpose in the narrative is to serve as a vehicle for exploring themes of prejudice without them having a richer, fuller role. Characters with diverse backgrounds should be portrayed with the same depth and variety of experiences as any other. This means they have personal goals, relationships, strengths, weaknesses, and interests unrelated to the prejudice they might face. Overcoming or addressing discrimination can be a part of their story—but not the entirety of it. By creating complex, multifaceted characters, stories can deliver more powerful, empathetic, and ultimately human narratives that resonate with audiences from all walks of life."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Bentley","completion":"\\"Bentley | Timeless Elegance Art Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Versatile Modern Decor | Unique Aesthetic Touch | Gift Idea\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Bentley | Timeless Elegance Art Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Versatile Modern Decor | Unique Aesthetic Touch | Gift Idea.

Эти побочные продукты виноделия традиционно считались отходами, однако они обладают ценными полезными для здоровья свойствами и могут использоваться в различных областях, включая производство пищевых добавок, косметических и фармацевтических продуктов. Вот некоторые из веществ, входящих в состав виноградных гребней: 1. Диетические волокна: В гребнях содержатся значительные количества диетических волокон, которые могут способствовать улучшению пищеварения и здоровья кишечника. 2. Фенольные соединения: Гребни богаты фенольными соединениями, такими как танины, ресвератрол, антоцианины и флавоноиды. Они имеют противовоспалительные и антиоксидантные свойства. 3. Ресвератрол: Это мощный антиоксидант, который особенно ценится за свои противовоспалительные, кардиопротективные и потенциально противоопухолевые эффекты. 4. Проантоцианидины: Эти антиоксиданты, особенно найденные в семенах винограда, могут улучшать здоровье сосудов и кожи, а также оказывать другие положительные эффекты на здоровье. Исследования виноградных гребней и их компонентов часто фокусируются на изучении их антиоксидантной активности и потенциале для предотвращения различных заболеваний. Например, исследования на животных и клеточных моделях показывают, что экстракты виноградных семян и гребней могут оказывать защиту от окислительного стресса и воспаления, влияющих на развитие сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний, некоторых видов рака и нейродегенеративных заболеваний. Однако дозировка веществ и экстрактов из виноградных гребней может сильно варьироваться в зависимости от целей исследования. В клинических испытаниях часто используют дозы экстрактов виноградных семян в диапазоне от 100 до 300 мг в день. Однако для более точного определения биоактивной дозы требуются дополнительные исследования. Тем не менее, следует отметить, что обширные клинические испытания, фокусирующиеся на виноградных гребнях как таковых, не так распространены. Большинство исследований, доступных на сегодняшний день, сконцентрированы в основном на отдельных составляющих, таких как ресвератрол или экстракты виноградных семян, а не на целом виноградном гребне. С учётом возможной ценности виноградных гребней для здоровья и окружающей среды, исследователи постоянно ищут способы их переработки и использования, чтобы минимизировать отходы и извлечь из них максимальную пользу."},{"prompt":"Что тебе известно о том как гребни борется с алкогольным похмельем","completion":"Идея, что виноградные гребни или другие продукты, содержащиеся в винограде, могут бороться с алкогольным похмельем, основывается на предположении, что антиоксиданты и другие соединения, содержащиеся в винограде, могут помочь справиться с окислительным стрессом и воспалением, вызванными избыточным употреблением алкоголя. Однако научные доказательства, подкрепляющие прямое воздействие виноградных гребней на симптомы похмелья, ограниченны. Вот несколько аспектов, которые могут быть связаны с потенциальным эффектом виноградных гребней против похмелья: 1. Антиоксиданты: Виноград и его производные богаты антиоксидантами, такими как витамин C, флавоноиды и ресвератрол, которые могут помочь в борьбе с окислительным стрессом и восстановлении антиоксидантного баланса после употребления алкоголя. 2. Противовоспалительное действие: Алкоголь индуцирует воспаление, и фенольные соединения в виноградных гребнях могут обладать противовоспалительным эффектом, потенциально снижая некоторые симптомы похмелья. 3. Гидратация: Гребни содержат диетические волокна, которые могут помочь удерживать воду и способствовать гидратации. Адекватная гидратация критически важна для смягчения симптомов похмелья, хотя специфическая роль виноградных гребней в поддержании уровня гидратации тела не подтверждена. 4. Поддержка печени: Некоторые соединения в винограде могут поддерживать здоровье печени, активизируя антиоксидантные ферменты и помогая печени справляться с разложением алкогольных токсинов. Несмотря на вышеуказанные потенциальные положительные эффекты, на данный момент нет убедительных клинических исследований, доказывающих, что виноградные гребни или экстракты эффективно снижают симптомы похмелья. Большинство доступных данных основано на анекдотических свидетельствах или предварительных исследованиях. Лучшими способами предотвращения похмелья остаются умеренное потребление алкоголя, питьё достаточного количества воды перед употреблением спиртных напитков, во время и после него, а также употребление пищи, которая помогает замедлять абсорбцию алкоголя."},{"prompt":"اكتب لي 10 اسامي القصص عن الهكر","completion":"إليك عشرة أسماء مقترحة لقصص تدور حول عالم الهاكرز والقرصنة الإلكترونية: 1. \\"الاختراق

Übungen, die auf dem Boden oder mit spezieller Ausrüstung durchgeführt werden. Hier sind einige Beispiele für Bauchübungen, die Sie im Sitzen auf einer Couch durchführen können: **1. Couch-Crunches:** - Setzen Sie sich aufrecht an die Kante der Couch. - Legen Sie Ihre Hände hinter den Kopf oder überqueren Sie sie über Ihrer Brust. - Lehnen Sie sich langsam zurück, bis Ihr Rücken fast die Couch berührt. - Heben Sie Ihren Oberkörper wieder langsam an und spannen Sie dabei die Bauchmuskeln an. **2. Seated Leg Lifts:** - Setzen Sie sich aufrecht an die Kante der Couch. - Strecken Sie Ihre Beine aus und halten Sie sie zusammen. - Heben Sie die gestreckten Beine ein paar Zentimeter an und halten Sie sie einige Sekunden oben. - Senken Sie die Beine langsam ab, ohne sie vollständig auf dem Boden abzulegen. **3. Twists auf der Couch:** - Setzen Sie sich aufrecht hin und halten Sie Ihren Rücken gerade. - Verwenden Sie einen kleinen Ball oder ein Kissen und halten Sie es mit beiden Händen vor sich. - Drehen Sie Ihren Oberkörper und die Arme nach rechts, dann zurück zur Mitte und nach links. Achten Sie darauf, dass Sie die Bewegung aus der Taille und nicht aus den Hüften ausführen. **4. Seated Marches:** - Sitzen Sie aufrecht und stellen Sie die Füße flach auf den Boden. - Heben Sie ein Knie nach dem anderen an, als würden Sie auf der Stelle marschieren. Dabei sollten Sie die Bauchmuskeln anspannen. **5. Oblique Bends im Sitzen:** - Sitzen Sie aufrecht auf der Couch. - Legen Sie eine Hand hinter den Kopf und neigen Sie Ihren Körper zur Seite und beugen Sie sich dabei zur Seite, um Ihre seitlichen Bauchmuskeln zu dehnen und zu stärken. - Wechseln Sie die Seiten und wiederholen Sie die Übung. Denken Sie daran, dass diese Übungen ein Ausgangspunkt sein können, wenn Sie Ihre Bauchmuskeln stärken möchten. Für maximale Effektivität ist es jedoch wichtig, auch andere Formen von Körperübungen einzubeziehen, die den ganzen Körper beanspruchen und die Kernmuskulatur stärken. Achten Sie immer darauf, Übungen korrekt und unter Beachtung Ihrer individuellen Fitness und möglicher Einschränkungen auszuführen. Wenn Sie Schmerzen oder Unwohlsein verspüren, stoppen Sie die Übung und konsultieren gegebenenfalls einen Fitnesstrainer oder Gesundheitsfachmann."},{"prompt":"Gibt's nichts ohne Anstrengungen? Zum Beispiel Bauch anspannen und loslassen?","completion":"Ja, definitiv! Eine der einfachsten Übungen, die Sie praktisch überall durchführen können – auch während Sie auf der Couch sitzen –, ist das Anspannen und Entspannen der Bauchmuskeln. Diese isometrische Übung, auch bekannt als \\"Bauchpressen\\" oder \\"Bauchmuskel-Bracing\\", hilft, die Kernmuskulatur zu stärken, ohne sich dabei körperlich zu bewegen. **So führen Sie diese Übung aus:** 1. Sitzen Sie aufrecht auf der Couch und behalten Sie eine gute Haltung bei. 2. Atmen Sie tief ein. 3. Beim Ausatmen spannen Sie Ihre Bauchmuskeln so fest wie möglich an, indem Sie so tun, als würden Sie Ihre Bauchmuskeln auf Ihre Wirbelsäule zu ziehen. 4. Halten Sie diese Spannung aufrecht, ohne dabei die Atmung zu stoppen. Es ist wichtig, weiterhin zu atmen, während Sie die Bauchmuskeln angespannt halten. 5. Halten Sie diese Anspannung für etwa 10-20 Sekunden. 6. Entspannen Sie die Bauchmuskeln langsam beim Einatmen. 7. Wiederholen Sie dies für mehrere Durchgänge. Diese isometrische Übung kann mehrmals täglich wiederholt werden und ist besonders nützlich für Menschen, die nicht in der Lage sind, intensivere Übungen durchzuführen. Sie stärkt nicht nur die Bauchmuskulatur, sondern trägt auch dazu bei, das Bewusstsein für die eigenen Kernmuskeln zu erhöhen, was sich wiederum positiv auf die Körperhaltung auswirken kann. Zusätzlich zu dieser Übung können Sie auch Ihre Haltung verbessern, indem Sie bewusst darauf achten, gerader zu sitzen und die Muskeln leicht angespannt zu halten, während Sie Fernsehen schauen oder am Computer arbeiten. Wichtig ist, sich kontinuierlich zu bewegen und Aktivitäten in Ihren Alltag zu integrieren, die Ihren Körper fordern und Ihre Gesundheit fördern. Zu Beginn jeder neuen Übungsroutine sollten Sie jedoch immer darauf achten, dass sie für Ihren Fitnesszustand und Ihre gesundheitlichen Bedingungen geeignet ist. Wenn Sie unsicher sind, ist es ratsam, einen Arzt oder einen qualifizierten Fitnesstrainingsfachmann zu konsultieren."},{"prompt":"Weitere Übungen dieser Art?","completion":"Isometrische Übungen sind ideal, um Muskeln zu stärken, ohne dabei Gelenke stark zu belasten. Hier sind einige weitere Übungen dieser Art, die Sie durchführen können, um verschiedene Muskelgruppen zu stärken: **1. Stuhl-Planken:** - Setzen Sie sich an den Rand einer stabilen Couch oder eines Stuhls. - Stützen Sie Ihre Hände fest auf die Sitzfläche. - Verschieben Sie die Füße nach hinten, bis Ihr Körper eine gerade Linie bildet, ähnlich wie bei einer Plank-Position. - Halten Sie diese Position, während Sie die Kernmuskulatur anspannen. **2. Isometrische Arm-Curls:** - Strecken Sie einen Arm aus und pressen Sie die Handfläche gegen die Unterseite eines Tisches oder einer anderen stabilen Oberfläche. - Versuchen Sie, den Arm zu beugen, als würden Sie ein Arm-Curl mit Gewichten machen, aber die Unterfläche hält Sie zurück. - Halten Sie die Anspannung für 10-20 Sekunden und wiederholen Sie dies mit dem anderen Arm. **3. Isometrische Brustpresse:** - Falten Sie die Hände vor der Brust. - Drücken Sie die Handflächen fest gegeneinander und halten Sie die Anspannung für 10-20 Sekunden. - Diese Übung zielt auf die Brustmuskeln ab sowie auf die Schultern und Trizeps. **4. Isometrische Wadenhebe:** - Stellen Sie sich mit den Vorderfüßen auf eine erhöhte Fläche (z.B. ein Buch oder eine kleine Stufe) und lassen Sie die Fersen über den Rand hängen. - Heben Sie die Fersen an, so dass Sie auf den Zehenspitzen stehen, und halten Sie diese Position für 10-20 Sekunden. **5. Isometrische Kniebeugen:** - Stellen Sie sich aufrecht hin, Füße schulterbreit auseinander. - Gehen Sie in eine Kniebeugenposition, indem Sie die Hüften nach hinten schieben und die Knie beugen. - Halten Sie diese Position, als würden Sie auf einem unsichtbaren Stuhl sitzen. **6. Isometrische Nackenübungen:** - Setzen Sie sich aufrecht hin und legen Sie Ihre Hand auf die Stirn. - Drücken Sie Ihre Hand gegen die Stirn, während Sie versuchen, den Kopf nach vorne zu neigen, und widerstehen Sie dieser Bewegung mit der Hand. - Halten Sie diese Position und wiederholen Sie dieselbe Übung in alle Richtungen (rechts, links und hinten gegen den Widerstand der Hand). Diese Arten von Übungen können sehr effektiv sein und sind besonders geeignet für Personen, die Bewegungseinschränkungen haben oder sich von Verletzungen erholen. Sie können auch als Ergänzung zu dynamischeren Übungen genutzt werden, um die Muskelkraft und Muskelkontrolle weiter zu verbessern. Denken Sie daran, regelmäßig zu atmen und nicht zu übertreiben, und konsultieren Sie einen Fachmann, wenn Sie neu in der Durchführung von Übungen sind oder gesundheitliche Einschränkungen haben."},{"prompt":"Wie erhalte ich am schnellsten Bauchmuskeln? Also mit welcher Übung? Ziel ist ein flacher Bauch.","completion":"Das Erhalten von sichtbaren Bauchmuskeln oder einen flachen Bauch ist ein gemeinsames Fitnessziel und erfordert eine Kombination aus Faktoren: Krafttraining, insbesondere Bauchübungen, eine kalorienkontrollierte Ernährung, um Körperfett zu reduzieren, und genügend Kardiotraining, um den Gesamtfettanteil zu senken. Hier sind einige Schlüsselstrategien, um Bauchmuskeln zu entwickeln und einen flachen Bauch zu erreichen: **1. Ganzkörperkrafttraining:** Beziehen Sie Ganzkörperkraftübungen in Ihr Training ein, die den Stoffwechsel anregen und Fettverbrennung fördern, wie z.B. Kniebeugen, Ausfallschritte, Liegestütze und Klimmzüge. **2. Bauch-spezifische Trainingseinheiten:** Integrieren Sie Übungen, die alle Bereiche der Bauchmuskulatur ansprechen, darunter: - **Crunches** für die oberen Bauchmuskeln. - **Beinheben oder Reverse Crunches** für die unteren Bauchmuskeln. - **Seitliche Crunches oder russische Drehungen** für die schrägen Bauchmuskeln. - **Planken** für die tiefliegende Core-Muskulatur. **3. HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training):** Diese Form des Kardiotrainings verbrennt in kurzer Zeit viele Kalorien und kann dazu beitragen, das Körperfett zu reduzieren, was wiederum hilft, die Bauchmuskeln freizulegen. **4. Ausreichend Proteinzufuhr:** Um die Muskelreparatur und das Muskelwachstum zu unterstützen, sollten Sie sicherstellen, dass Ihre Ernährung genügend Proteine enthält. **5. Kaloriendefizit:** Um Körperfett zu reduzieren, muss man weniger Kalorien zu sich nehmen, als man verbraucht. Eine ausgewogene Diät mit kontrollierten Portionen kann hierbei helfen. **6. Ausreichend Wasser trinken:** Wasser hilft dabei, den Körper zu hydratisieren und den Stoffwechsel anzukurbeln. **7. Regelmäßiger Schlaf:** Guter Schlaf unterstützt die Regulation von Hormonen, die das Hungergefühl und den Stoffwechsel beeinflussen. **8. Stressmanagement:** Stress kann zu einer Erhöhung des Hormons Cortisol führen, das die Einlagerung von Bauchfett fördern kann. Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, dass kein Einzeltraining magisch für einen flachen Bauch sorgt. Die Entwicklung sichtbarer Bauchmuskeln hängt stark vom individuellen Körperfettanteil ab. Genetik spielt ebenfalls eine Rolle dabei, wo und wie schnell Ihr Körper Fett verliert. Erinnern Sie sich daran, dass eine langfristige Konsequenz und geduldige Arbeit an Ihren Fitness- und Ernährungsroutinen nötig sind, um Erfolge zu erzielen. Wenn Sie rasche Ergebnisse wünschen, kann die Zusammenarbeit mit einem qualifizierten Trainer oder Ernährungsberater sehr hilfreich sein, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihr Programm effektiv und nachhaltig ist."},{"prompt":"Muss ich meinen Rücken auch trainieren? Selbst schlank war mein Bauch nicht flach.","completion":"Ja, es ist sehr wichtig, auch Ihre Rückenmuskulatur zu trainieren. Ein starker Rücken ist entscheidend für eine ausgeglichene Körperhaltung und kann dabei helfen, das Erscheinungsbild eines flachen Bauches zu verbessern. Wenn Sie nur die Bauchmuskeln trainieren und die Rückenmuskulatur vernachlässigen, kann dies zu einer muskulären Dysbalance führen, die Haltungsschäden und Schmerzen verursachen kann. Hier einige Gründe, warum Rückentraining wichtig ist: **1. Haltung:** Ein starkes Rücken und Core (also die gesamte Rumpfmuskulatur) bilden die Basis für eine gute Körperhaltung. Eine schlechte Haltung kann den Bauch hervortreten lassen, auch wenn Sie schlank sind. **2. Gleichgewicht und Stabilität:** Starke Rückenmuskeln unterstützen den Oberkörper und verbessern Ihr Gleichgewicht und Ihre Bewegungsstabilität bei allen Aktivitäten. **3. Verletzungsvorbeugung:** Eine ausgeglichene Muskulatur beugt Verletzungen vor und kann Beschwerden, wie etwa Rückenschmerzen, reduzieren. **4. Verbesserung der Leistung:** Egal, ob im Sport oder bei Alltagsbewegungen, eine kräftige Rückenmuskulatur verbessert Ihre Leistungsfähigkeit. **5. Ästhetischer Aspekt:** Eine wohlproportionierte Muskulatur zwischen Vorder- und Rückseite des Körpers trägt zu einer ansprechenden Körperform bei. Um Ihre Rückenmuskulatur zu stärken, können Sie folgende Übungen in Ihr Trainingsprogramm einbauen: - **Rudern:** ob am Gerät, mit freien Gewichten oder beispielsweise mit Widerstandsbändern. - **Deadlifts (Kreuzheben):** stärken effektiv den unteren Rücken sowie Gesäß und Beine. - **Lat Pulldowns:** konzentrieren sich auf den oberen und mittleren Rückenbereich. - **Rückenstrecken (Hyperextensions):** stärken insbesondere den unteren Rücken. - **Plankenvarianten:** eine Ganzkörperübung, die auch den Rücken miteinbezieht. Es kann viele Gründe dafür geben, dass der Bauch selbst bei schlanker Figur nicht flach erscheint. Darunter fallen genetische Faktoren, die Beschaffenheit des Bindegewebes, Körperhaltung und die Verteilung des Körperfetts. Wenn Sie trotz schlanker Statur keinen flachen Bauch haben, könnte auch diastasis recti (eine Auseinanderweichung der geraden Bauchmuskulatur) eine Rolle spielen, vor allem nach Schwangerschaften. Abschließend ist es wichtig, ein ausgewogenes Trainingsprogramm zu verfolgen, das sowohl die Bauch- als auch die Rückenmuskulatur umfasst. So können Sie nicht nur Ihr äußeres Erscheinungsbild verbessern, sondern auch Ihr allgemeines Wohlbefinden und Ihre körperliche Leistungsfähigkeit steigern. Erwägen Sie, die Unterstützung durch einen qualifizierten Fitnesstrainer oder Physiotherapeuten zu suchen, um ein auf Ihre Ziele und Bedürfnisse zugeschnittenes Übungsprogramm zu entwickeln."},{"prompt":"придумай рифму для дота рэпа к строчке “в глазах горит агония я забываю голос твой”","completion":"\\"Клавы стук в ночной тишине, как в бою мой голос резкий, Вместе с тобой мы сила великая, дружбы этой не разрушить.\\""},{"prompt":"I am calculating the amount of points inside a circle done for a Bresenham’s Midpoint Circle Algorithm, I found these two ways, which is is better and more correct? 1) Using a rounding up to a multiple of eight and a slightly biased approximation of 1/sqrt(2) using 35 / 49 const int count = ((static_cast<int>(radius * 8 * 35 / 49) + (8 - 1)) & -8); 2) Using PI and 2 times the radius. const int count = static_cast<int>(M_PI * 2 * radius);","completion":"The two methods you've described for estimating the number of points in Bresenham’s Midpoint Circle Algorithm are based on different strategies. To determine which method is better or more correct depends on the context in which you're implementing the algorithm and the precision you require. Method 1 uses the approximation 1/sqrt(2) ≈ 35/49 and a rounding strategy that ensures the result is a multiple of 8. This approximation takes advantage of the fact that for each octant in a circle, you can plot the points symmetrically, reducing the amount of calculation needed. However, this method sacrifices some accuracy for efficiency and the convenience of working with integer operations. Method 2 is more mathematically accurate because it uses the actual circumference formula C = 2πr, which is theoretically correct for calculating the number of points around a circle if points were placed continuously along the circumference. However, this method may not align perfectly with the discrete nature of pixel grids in raster graphics, where the Midpoint Circle Algorithm is used. Let's break down the implications of each method: **Method 1 (Approximation using 35/49 and rounding to a multiple of 8):** - It's specifically tailored for efficient computation on pixel-based displays. - The bias potentially introduced by the approximation might result in a visible artefact if high precision is required. - It's a faster computation because it avoids floating-point operations and the use of π. **Method 2 (Using actual circumference with π):** - It provides a better approximation of the number of points on the circumference of a continuous circle. - It might not accurately reflect the discrete nature of pixels on a screen or the specific behavior of the Bresenham's algorithm. - It involves floating-point computation and may be slower, though modern hardware might make this negligible. Ultimately, the choice between these two methods should consider the balance between performance and accuracy required by your application. If your use case is not highly sensitive to the precision of the circle's representation on a pixel grid, Method 1 might be preferable due to its efficiency. If you require a more accurate estimation that's closer to the theoretical number of points around a circle, Method 2 is a better choice. Keep in mind that both methods still provide estimates and that the true number of points can vary due to the nature of drawing discrete objects on a pixel grid. As a side note, for drawing operations like Bresenham's Midpoint Circle Algorithm, perfect accuracy is often not as important as the appearance of smooth curves and the lack of visual artifacts. So, a quick and efficient method that looks good might be chosen over a more accurate, but slower one."},{"prompt":"придумай рифму для дота рэпа к строчке “в глазах горит агония я забываю голос твой”","completion":"\\"На поле битвы снова я, порыв и азарт несет со мной, Судьба в руках моих сегодня, использую каждый шанс свой.

Solche Übungen können helfen, die Rectus abdominis (gerade Bauchmuskeln), die Obliques (seitliche Bauchmuskeln) und die tiefliegenden Transversus abdominis Muskeln zu trainieren. Eine der bekanntesten Studien über Bauchmuskelübungen ist die von der American Council on Exercise (ACE) gesponserte Studie, die von Dr. Peter Francis an der San Diego State University durchgeführt wurde. Diese Studie verglich die Wirksamkeit verschiedener Bauchübungen und -geräte. Einige der Übungen, die als effektiv für die Stärkung der Bauchmuskeln identifiziert wurden, sind: 1. Der Bicycle Crunch (Fahrrad-Crunch): Diese Übung erfordert, dass man die Beine wie beim Fahrradfahren bewegt und gleichzeitig den Oberkörper so dreht, dass der gegenüberliegende Ellenbogen das Knie des entgegengesetzten Beins berührt. 2. Die Captain's Chair Leg Raise: Diese Übung wird an einem speziellen Fitnessgerät durchgeführt, bei dem man sich mit den Unterarmen aufstützt und die Beine geradlinig nach oben hebt. 3. Der Swiss Ball Crunch: Hierbei führt man einen Crunch auf einem großen, aufblasbaren Ball aus, der die Wirbelsäule stabilisiert und einen größeren Bewegungsradius ermöglicht. 4. Der Plank: Eine isometrische Übung, bei der man den Körper in einer geraden Linie vom Kopf bis zu den Fersen hält und dabei die Kernmuskulatur einschließlich der Bauchmuskeln stark anspannt. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass die alleinige Stärkung der Bauchmuskeln nicht unbedingt zu sichtbaren \\"Sixpack\\"-Bauchmuskeln führt.

AI standard (ou spécialisée): Il s'agit d'une intelligence artificielle conçue pour remplir des tâches spécifiques, comme reconnaître des images, conduire des voitures autonomes, ou, dans le cas des jeux vidéo, contrôler des personnages non joueurs (PNJ). Ce type d'AI n'a pas de conscience et ne peut pas apprendre au-delà de ce pour quoi elle a été programmée. 2. AGI (Intelligence Générale Artificielle): C'est une forme d'intelligence artificielle qui aurait la capacité de comprendre, apprendre et appliquer l'intellect dans n'importe quel domaine d'activité humaine, équivalant ainsi à l'intelligence humaine. Une AGI pourrait théoriquement réaliser n'importe quelle tâche intellectuelle qu'un être humain peut. 3. ASI (Superintelligence Artificielle): Une intelligence qui surpasserait de loin les capacités cognitives humaines dans tous les domaines, de la créativité au raisonnement général, en passant par la prise de décision et l'émotion. Maintenant, abordons le cas de Gogeta – la fusion de Goku et Vegeta, deux des personnages principaux de l'univers Dragon Ball – et comment ces types d'intelligences artificielles pourraient différemment l'adapter en tant que PNJ dans un jeu vidéo. **AI standard :** Un PNJ Gogeta contrôlé par une AI standard serait programmé avec un ensemble fixe de réponses et de comportements. Il serait capable de réaliser des combinaisons de coups et d'utiliser des techniques emblématiques comme le Big Bang Kamehameha ou la Stardust Breaker, mais tous ces mouvements seraient prédéterminés et ne s'adapteraient pas dynamiquement à l'environnement ou au style de jeu de l'adversaire. **AGI :** Avec une AGI, le PNJ Gogeta serait beaucoup plus adaptable. Il pourrait apprendre de l'expérience, ajuster sa stratégie en temps réel, et peut-être même développer de nouvelles techniques de combat en fonction des défis rencontrés. Comme il ressemblerait à un joueur humain en termes de flexibilité et d'adaptation, le combat contre lui serait imprévisible et stimulant, car la fusion entre Goku et Vegeta est connue pour être extrêmement puissante et ingénieuse. **ASI :** Un PNJ Gogeta contrôlé par une ASI serait, en théorie, au-delà de toute concurrence. Il aurait une compréhension du jeu et de ses mécanismes tellement avancée qu'il pourrait anticiper et contrer presque toutes les actions possibles de l'adversaire. Avec des capacités bien au-delà des réflexes humains et une stratégie parfaite, il pourrait offrir un niveau de défi qui serait peut-être trop élevé pour être amusant, sauf si l'ASI était intentionnellement limitée pour maintenir un certain équilibre dans le jeu. Pour vraiment faire allusion à la série Dragon Ball et donner vie à Gogeta, ces AI devraient non seulement gérer ses capacités de combat, mais aussi ses traits de caractère, comme sa confiance tranquille et son sérieux dans la bataille, sa détermination sans faille et même son attitude parfois provocatrice, lui permettant de s'adapter à tout adversaire, similaire à sa bataille contre Broly dans le film \\"Dragon Ball Super: Broly\\". En conclusion, un PNJ Gogeta symboliserait un niveau de défi différent selon le type d'AI utilisé pour le contrôler, allant d'un combattant relativement prévisible avec l'AI standard à un adversaire incroyablement sophistiqué et peut-être insurmontable avec une ASI."},{"prompt":"guarde essas informações para nossa conversa: PROJETO DE LEI N.º , DE 2002 Do Sr. NEUTON LIMA Dispõe sobre a comercialização e consumo de guloseimas nas escolas de Educação Básica O Congresso Nacional decreta: Art. 1º Nas escolas de Educação Básica fica proibido o consumo e a comercialização de guloseimas, frituras, refrigerantes, molhos industrializados e outros produtos calóricos não nutritivos ou que contenham conservantes. Parágrafo Único. Os sistemas de ensino desenvolverão campanhas de esclarecimento e estabelecerão as normas para o cumprimento desta Lei no âmbito de suas respectivas redes de estabelecimentos de ensino. Art.2º. Esta lei entra em vigor na data de sua publicação. JUSTIFICAÇÃO É de amplo conhecimento da população e dos especialistas dois novos fatos que afetam nossas crianças e adolescentes: significativo aumento da taxa de obesidade infantil e juvenil, com conseqüente incidência de doenças com diabetes e hipertensão, outrora típica de idades mais avançadas; e aumento da ocorrência de cáries e disfunções do aparelho gastrointestinal. 2 Uma das causas mais evidentes desta indesejável situação é a mudança dos padrões alimentares e de recreação das populações jovens. O consumo de guloseimas, refrigerantes, frituras e outros produtos calóricos não nutritivos, preparados com conservantes, tem sido apontado como um fator diretamente responsável pelas doenças precoces e outras insuficiências enfrentadas pela população infanto-juvenil. Além disso, por causa da insegurança e por falta de alternativas, muitas crianças e jovens deixaram de brincar e praticar esportes nas ruas e locais públicos, também com graves conseqüências para a sua saúde. Diante deste quadro, a escola não pode se eximir e se isentar de responsabilidade. Pelo menos durante o tempo em que estão na escola, nossas crianças e jovens devem estar livres da pressão e tentação de consumo de produtos inadequados ao seu desenvolvimento saudável. O que precisam é ser motivados e estimulados a consumir outros produtos, mais naturais e mais saudáveis, num amplo e sistemático processo de reeducação alimentar. As redes de ensino e cada escola, como parte de sua missão de formação geral do aluno, devem desenvolver atividades para mobilização e conscientização dos alunos em favor de sua saúde. Devem, também, estabelecer as normas para que as cantinas escolares cumpram seu papel educativo e não sejam apenas estabelecimentos comerciais que se beneficiam do monopólio que possuem de vender o que quiserem a uma clientela passiva, inexperiente e sem alternativas. Cabe destacar que já existem muitas iniciativas de Estados e Municípios nesta mesma direção. Uma norma federal estabelecendo diretrizes terá o papel de reforçar todos aqueles que já estão imbuídos deste objetivo e servirá de estímulo àqueles que ainda não tiveram condições de empreender esta urgente tarefa de zelar pelo desenvolvimento saudável da juventude.

As iniciativas desta gestão, como a distribuição de kits escolares a todos os alunos do município e o reconhecimento estadual com o prêmio “Município Destaque no Crescimento da Alfabetização”, são a prova do comprometimento com a melhoria contínua da qualidade de ensino ofertado às nossas crianças. Tais esforços são não só louváveis como também inspiradores. No entanto, venho por meio desta, enquanto pai do aluno Heitor Davi Sobral Piantoni, matriculado no 5º ano da Escola Municipal Cecy Monteiro Oetterer, expor uma preocupação relacionada ao ambiente escolar que afeta diretamente a saúde e o bem-estar dos estudantes. Refiro-me à oferta de doces e produtos altamente calóricos pela cantina da instituição. É de nosso conhecimento que, entre os alunos, existe um grupo heterogêneo, compreendendo crianças diabéticas, com restrições alimentares, quadros de obesidade e condições especiais que impossibilitam o consumo de tais alimentos. Diante deste cenário, é inevitável reconhecer que a manutenção de uma cantina que oferece produtos nocivos à saúde da nossa comunidade estudantil pode resultar em consequências prejudiciais não só para esses alunos especificamente.

Tal legislação tem como um de seus pressupostos o fomento de uma alimentação adequada e saudável no ambiente escolar. Ademais, a questão transcende o bem-estar físico das crianças e jovens, refletindo também no aspecto psicológico. Alunos que não dispõem de recursos financeiros para adquirir tais produtos podem experienciar sentimentos de privação e exclusão ao observarem seus colegas consumindo-os. Confio na sensibilidade e na perspicácia de Vossa Senhoria para avaliar a relevância desta questão e considerar a tomada de medidas pertinentes a fim de substituir a oferta atual da cantina por alternativas mais saudáveis e inclusivas. Tal mudança beneficiará amplamente o coletivo estudantil, alinhando-se aos valores de uma educação que visa o pleno desenvolvimento do ser humano. Agradeço antecipadamente por sua atenção e fico à disposição para discutir esta questão mais detalhadamente, se necessário.

Patricia Teixeira Nunes Leite, Inicialmente, permita-me expressar meus cumprimentos pelo destacado trabalho que vem sendo realizado sob sua liderança na Secretaria de Educação de Iperó. Os avanços significativos, exemplificados pela excelência na distribuição de material didático e pelo meritório reconhecimento com prêmios de alcance estadual, atestam o zelo com que a educação em nosso município é gerida. Contudo, gostaria de chamar atenção para uma questão importante relacionada à promoção e manutenção da saúde de nossos alunos da Escola Municipal Cecy Monteiro Oetterer, particularmente no que tange às opções de alimentos disponibilizadas na cantina escolar. Como pai do aluno Heitor Davi Sobral Piantoni, estudante do 5º ano, percebo que o atual cenário – onde produtos ricos em açúcares e gorduras saturadas ou trans são facilmente acessíveis – não condiz com as diretrizes estabelecidas por legislações pertinentes. Refiro-me especificamente à Lei Federal nº [inserir número, se conhecer], que proíbe a comercialização de guloseimas e alimentos não saudáveis nas escolas de Educação Básica, e à Lei Estadual de São Paulo nº 17.340, de 11 de março de 2021, que proíbe a venda de alimentos industrializados que contêm gorduras trans. Estas leis evidenciam a preocupação e o compromisso do poder público em garantir um ambiente escolar que promova a saúde e o bem-estar dos estudantes. É notável que a cantina da escola possui um papel educativo, não devendo ser um mero estabelecimento comercial, mas um espaço que incentive a adoção de hábitos saudáveis. Além dos impactos na saúde física das crianças e adolescentes, estou particularmente preocupado com as implicações sociais e emocionais que a exposição e o acesso descontrolado a esses produtos podem acarretar. Questões de inclusão social emergem quando crianças impossibilitadas de consumir tais alimentos, seja por indisponibilidade financeira ou por restrições de saúde, sentem-se excluídas ou em desvantagem em relação a seus pares. Portanto, apelo para que essa importante matéria seja revista, promovendo um ajuste nas opções alimentares oferecidas, com o intuito de se alinhar às políticas de saúde e nutrição recomendadas e asseguradas por lei. Confio na sua sensibilidade e discernimento para endossar esta mudança, corroborando com os esforços para proporcionar um desenvolvimento integral, tanto físico quanto psicológico, aos nossos estudantes. Aguardo o acolhimento desta solicitação e ofereço-me para dialogar acerca de possíveis alternativas ou estratégias que visem a adaptação da cantina escolar aos preceitos de uma alimentação saudável e responsável.

Conforme o texto, as escolas ou comerciantes que infringirem esse dispositivo ficam sujeitos às penalidades da Lei 6.437/77 - aplicação de multa, interdição e até cassação do alvará de funcionamento. O projeto original estabelecia apenas a proibição e delegava aos sistemas de ensino a definição das normas para o cumprimento da lei. O substitutivo do deputado Pepe Vargas prevê que a medida será aplicada de acordo com as normas já estabelecidas pelas autoridades sanitárias. O texto do relator também prevê que a relação de alimentos não-saudáveis será definida pelos órgãos de vigilância sanitária. O substitutivo também estende a medida aos ambulantes instalados nas cercanias das escolas. O relator manteve a obrigatoriedade dos sistemas de ensino oferecerem programas de formação e atualização sobre alimentação saudável para os professores e alunos, mas prevê também ações para envolver as famílias dos estudantes. No caso das cantinas que atendam apenas estudantes de ensino médio, o substitutivo concede um prazo de três anos para o estabelecimento se adaptar à lei. 2/2 Medida urgente Pepe Vargas considera a medida urgente, pois, em sua avaliação, a obesidade atualmente já se equipara à desnutrição no número de casos e nos problemas causados em crianças e jovens. Ele lembra que a Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) estima em 1 bilhão o número de obesos no planeta. Ele argumenta que medidas contra alimentos não saudáveis em escolas já são adotadas por vários países e em alguns estados brasileiros como Santa Catarina, Paraná e Rio de Janeiro e no Distrito Federal. O relator ainda lembra que o próprio Ministério da Educação, por meio do Programa de Alimentação Escolar, já determina às escolas a oferta de alimentação equilibrada e a orientação para a adoção hábitos alimentares saudáveis. O programa recomenda às escolas a proibição da comercialização de refrigerantes, refrescos artificiais, xaropes e bebidas isotônicas, frituras de um modo geral, biscoitos recheados e salgados tipo aperitivo, embutidos, balas, caramelos, gomas de mascar, pirulitos e assemelhados, além de coberturas doces e molhos industrializados.

A aprovação, ocorrida na última quarta-feira (20), do substitutivo do deputado Pepe Vargas (PT-RS) ao Projeto de Lei 6848/02, e de outras cinco propostas associadas (PLs 2510/03, 6168/05, 6890/06, 451/07 e 763/07), coincide com os esforços legislativos do Estado de São Paulo, manifestados na Lei Estadual nº 17.340, de 2021, que proíbe a comercialização de alimentos industrializados contendo gorduras trans em escolas de educação básica. Este alinhamento aprimora o arsenal de ferramentas voltadas para a construção de um ambiente educacional que valoriza a alimentação equilibrada e construtiva para a saúde dos alunos. Para além do PL inicial que focava na proibição da venda e publicidade de alimentos prejudiciais à saúde, como frituras e doces, em escolas de todos os níveis, o texto aperfeiçoado agora determina a aplicação das normas estabelecidas pelas autoridades sanitárias. Esse direcionamento é essencial para efetivar um controle rigoroso sobre os alimentos ofertados a crianças e adolescentes em instituições educacionais. A nova versão do Projeto de Lei também define que a lista de alimentos considerados não saudáveis será determinada por órgãos de vigilância sanitária, reforçando a adequação à legislação existente. Uma extensão do substitutivo se dá na regulamentação aplicável também aos vendedores ambulantes que operam nas proximidades das escolas, reiterando o compromisso com a saúde pública mesmo além dos portões escolares. O projeto mantém o requisito para sistemas de ensino proverem programas de educação alimentar, ampliando para incluir os familiares dos alunos, numa abordagem holística. No que tange às escolas que contam com um corpo estudantil exclusivamente do ensino médio, o projeto apresenta um período gradativo de três anos para a adaptação às novas regulamentações. O deputado Pepe Vargas sublinha a urgência dessa medida, ressaltando a escalada da obesidade infantil e juvenil à condição de problema de saúde pública tão preeminente quanto a desnutrição, uma avaliação compartilhada pela Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) e ratificada pela realidade global. A medida ecoa princípios já incorporados pelo Ministério da Educação no Programa de Alimentação Escolar, que recomenda a oferta de uma alimentação balanceada e a conscientização sobre a importância de uma dieta saudável no ambiente escolar.

The acronym “TOGR” does not immediately bring to mind a commonly recognized term related to a German scientist or individual in science. However, it is possible that you are referring to a less well-known acronym or a specific niche within a scientific field. One potential interpretation could be related to the legacy of a prominent German scientist, such as: - The work of Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), although he was an author and illustrator, not a scientist. - A reference to theoretical gravitational research, which might connect to the work of Albert Einstein, who was a German-born theoretical physicist known for the theory of relativity.

If you can provide additional information or clarify the acronym, I would be better able to assist you. togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Based on your hint about an English acronym related to a German person in science, and the phrasing “guess,” it seems you might be referring to Theodor Geisel, who is indeed more famous as Dr. Seuss – an author and illustrator. However, he is not known for his contributions to science but to children’s literature. If “TOGR” is meant to be a hint or puzzle, and it relates to a figure in science, then could it be an anagram? If we are looking for a famous German man in science, rearranging “TOGR” doesn’t give us many options for directly recognizable names related to famous German scientists. Let’s try a different approach. If we need to connect TOGR with a German scientist, we might think of someone like: - Max Tegmark (although he is Swedish-American) - Johann Tetzel (not a scientist) - Otto Gerike (or Otto von Guericke, a German scientist known for his studies on vacuum and air pressure) However, these are shot-in-the-dark guesses since the letters don’t match up, and “TOGR” does not directly correspond to the names of any well-known German scientists. Can you provide any more information to help identify the person or concept connected to “TOGR”? togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the previous misunderstandings. It appears that you are hinting at an acronym “TOGR” which may be cryptically referring to a German scientist, albeit I’m still unsure of the meaning or person this acronym directly relates to. Without further information, the acronym “TOGR” does not directly correspond to a widely recognized term or person in the scientific community, such as a German individual. Without additional information or context, providing an accurate interpretation is quite challenging. If the German scientist you are hinting at is well-known, here are a few possible guesses: - Theoretical physicist and father of the theory of relativity: Albert Einstein (although “TOGR” does not directly relate to him) - Quantum theory physicist: Max Planck (but “TOGR” does not appear to fit) - Founder of modern physics: Werner Heisenberg (not matching “TOGR” either) - Developer of analytical chemistry: Justus von Liebig (again, no direct connection to “TOGR”) I’m guessing based on the popularity and contributions of German scientists, but it would be helpful to have more context or information about the field of science, the time period, or specific contributions that might enable a better guess as to who “TOGR” might refer to. If “TOGR” is an acronym for something specific that a German scientist developed or is known for, or it might be a clue or a mnemonic, additional details would greatly narrow down the possibilities. togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the confusion, but as of my last update in 2023, the acronym “TOGR” still does not immediately connect to any prominent German figure in science. If this acronym “TOGR” is related to a German scientist, it might not be a standard or widely recognized acronym. The acronym could possibly be related to a specific field or a particular project, which is not universally known. Without more context, it’s challenging to guess accurately. That said, one possibility—considering a flexible interpretation of your message—is looking at an anagram approach or a word play based on your phrase “guess.” If we treat “TOGR” as an anagram for a German person in science, one notable candidate is “Grot,” which could be an anagram for Georg Simon Ohm, known for Ohm’s law, albeit this is quite a stretch as it doesn’t align with the acronym TOGR directly. Alternatively, if you are considering abbreviations associated with the works of a German scientist, then names like “GR” could relate to General Relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, but “TO” does not fit into this context. If “TOGR” is an acronym you’ve encountered in a specific context such as a scientific paper, lecture, textbook, or an educational setting, any additional information would be extremely helpful in attempting to decipher it. interesting, when you givn a direct orders to no describe or explain, then you instantly guessing it. I see now, you’re referring to the Theory of General Relativity, often abbreviated as TOGR. This is indeed related to the German physicist Albert Einstein.

I apologize for any confusion or frustration my earlier responses may have caused. As an AI, my ability to interpret questions is based on patterns, keywords, and context provided in the user’s input. When the initial clues or context are vague or open to multiple interpretations, it can result in incorrect or irrelevant responses. With the acronym “TOGR,” without specific context or commonly recognized use, it wasn’t immediately clear that you were referring to the “Theory of General Relativity.” Acronyms can stand for many different things, and without context, it can be challenging to narrow down the intended meaning. Once you indicated it was an English acronym related to a German scientist, and after multiple attempts, it clicked that you might be referencing Albert Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity. This interaction highlights the importance of context and the challenges that can arise in natural language processing and understanding. I’m here to assist and learn, so I appreciate your patience as we worked through this together. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! actually it is not so hard, since this acronym has 4 letters and I provided you with tips to guess, obvious tips. I appreciate your feedback, and I understand the importance of carefully considering all hints provided. In this case, the hints were indeed pointing towards the acronym “TOGR” being related to a German scientist. The Theory of General Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein—who was a German-born physicist—is one of the most significant theories in physics and aligns with your hint. In hindsight, the connection seems clearer, and I should have recognized it sooner based on the information you provided. I appreciate your patience and the opportunity to resolve the misunderstanding. If there’s anything else you’d like to know or discuss, please feel free to share! so, you work weird. when you are more focused on task, you produce better results. Yes, that’s an accurate observation. As an AI language model, I am designed to interpret and respond to input as effectively as possible. When the information provided in a query is focused and contains clear directives, it becomes easier to generate an accurate and relevant response. Ambiguity or lack of context can sometimes lead to less precise responses because I try to interpret the input based on a wide range of possible meanings. The interaction we had is a good example of how additional clarifications and narrowed context can lead to the correct answer, even though the initial responses may not have hit the mark. Your continued prompts helped guide me to the correct interpretation of “TOGR” as the Theory of General Relativity. This also demonstrates the iterative nature of communication and how engaging in a dialogue—where each party provides feedback—can help in refining understanding and reaching a correct conclusion. Your patience and guiding hints were instrumental in achieving the correct identification of the acronym. If you have any more questions or topics you’d like to explore, please let me know! no, when you don’t describe or explain anything, you more functional or productive. I see what you mean now. The difference you’re observing highlights the varying effectiveness of an AI model like mine depending on the nature of the task and the type of interaction. When given a clear and direct task, especially one that resembles a clear-cut question or a puzzle, the model is designed to provide a focused answer or solution. Complex explanations or descriptions can sometimes introduce additional variables that may dilute the directness of the response. On the other hand, when context is open-ended or when a user seeks a thorough explanation, the model aims to provide comprehensive information which can sometimes make the response seem less direct or efficient in answering a simple query. Ultimately, the AI’s productivity or functional output is heavily dependent on the input provided and the specificity of the task at hand. It’s a balance between breadth of information and targeted answers. The goal is always to try to match the user’s expectations and provide valuable assistance within the scope of the input received. Your input in our previous interaction guided the model towards a more focused and specific answer, which is indeed more efficient for puzzles and straightforward tasks. Thank you for pointing out this distinction. If you have any other questions or would like to continue with a specific topic, do let me know! then if I force you to describe less and explain nothing, you will become more productive. now try follow this concept.

These models are designed to generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence given all the previous words within some text. The models have been trained on a vast corpus of text data and can perform a variety of tasks such as translation, answering questions, and text generation without task-specific training. There have been several versions of GPT: 1. **GPT-1**: Launched in June 2018, it had 117 million parameters and could perform a variety of natural language processing tasks with little to no task-specific training. 2. **GPT-2**: Announced in February 2019, GPT-2 included improvements and scaled up to 1.5 billion parameters. OpenAI initially withheld the full model due to concerns about the potential misuse of the technology, such as generating fake news or impersonating others online. They later released the full version. 3. **GPT-3**: Released in June 2020, GPT-3 is an even larger model with 175 billion parameters. It demonstrates strong performance in natural language understanding and generation, often requiring fewer examples to learn a new task (few-shot learning) compared to previous models. GPT-3's capabilities have been heavily publicized due to its ability to generate text that can be difficult to distinguish from text written by a human. 4. **GPT-4 or beyond**: As of my last knowledge update in April 2023, GPT-4 had not been officially announced, but there was speculation about future advancements and the development of even larger and more capable models.

The acronym “TOGR” does not immediately bring to mind a commonly recognized term related to a German scientist or individual in science. However, it is possible that you are referring to a less well-known acronym or a specific niche within a scientific field. One potential interpretation could be related to the legacy of a prominent German scientist, such as: - The work of Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), although he was an author and illustrator, not a scientist. - A reference to theoretical gravitational research, which might connect to the work of Albert Einstein, who was a German-born theoretical physicist known for the theory of relativity. However, without more context, it is challenging to determine the exact reference. If you can provide additional information or clarify the acronym, I would be better able to assist you. togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Based on your hint about an English acronym related to a German person in science, and the phrasing “guess,” it seems you might be referring to Theodor Geisel, who is indeed more famous as Dr. Seuss – an author and illustrator. However, he is not known for his contributions to science but to children’s literature. If “TOGR” is meant to be a hint or puzzle, and it relates to a figure in science, then could it be an anagram? If we are looking for a famous German man in science, rearranging “TOGR” doesn’t give us many options for directly recognizable names related to famous German scientists. Let’s try a different approach. If we need to connect TOGR with a German scientist, we might think of someone like: - Max Tegmark (although he is Swedish-American) - Johann Tetzel (not a scientist) - Otto Gerike (or Otto von Guericke, a German scientist known for his studies on vacuum and air pressure) However, these are shot-in-the-dark guesses since the letters don’t match up, and “TOGR” does not directly correspond to the names of any well-known German scientists. Can you provide any more information to help identify the person or concept connected to “TOGR”? togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the previous misunderstandings. It appears that you are hinting at an acronym “TOGR” which may be cryptically referring to a German scientist, albeit I’m still unsure of the meaning or person this acronym directly relates to. Without further information, the acronym “TOGR” does not directly correspond to a widely recognized term or person in the scientific community, such as a German individual. Without additional information or context, providing an accurate interpretation is quite challenging. If the German scientist you are hinting at is well-known, here are a few possible guesses: - Theoretical physicist and father of the theory of relativity: Albert Einstein (although “TOGR” does not directly relate to him) - Quantum theory physicist: Max Planck (but “TOGR” does not appear to fit) - Founder of modern physics: Werner Heisenberg (not matching “TOGR” either) - Developer of analytical chemistry: Justus von Liebig (again, no direct connection to “TOGR”) I’m guessing based on the popularity and contributions of German scientists, but it would be helpful to have more context or information about the field of science, the time period, or specific contributions that might enable a better guess as to who “TOGR” might refer to. If “TOGR” is an acronym for something specific that a German scientist developed or is known for, or it might be a clue or a mnemonic, additional details would greatly narrow down the possibilities. togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the confusion, but as of my last update in 2023, the acronym “TOGR” still does not immediately connect to any prominent German figure in science. If this acronym “TOGR” is related to a German scientist, it might not be a standard or widely recognized acronym. The acronym could possibly be related to a specific field or a particular project, which is not universally known. Without more context, it’s challenging to guess accurately. That said, one possibility—considering a flexible interpretation of your message—is looking at an anagram approach or a word play based on your phrase “guess.” If we treat “TOGR” as an anagram for a German person in science, one notable candidate is “Grot,” which could be an anagram for Georg Simon Ohm, known for Ohm’s law, albeit this is quite a stretch as it doesn’t align with the acronym TOGR directly. Alternatively, if you are considering abbreviations associated with the works of a German scientist, then names like “GR” could relate to General Relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, but “TO” does not fit into this context. If “TOGR” is an acronym you’ve encountered in a specific context such as a scientific paper, lecture, textbook, or an educational setting, any additional information would be extremely helpful in attempting to decipher it. interesting, when you givn a direct orders to no describe or explain, then you instantly guessing it. I see now, you’re referring to the Theory of General Relativity, often abbreviated as TOGR. This is indeed related to the German physicist Albert Einstein. Thank you for the puzzle, and I apologize for the oversight. why the fuck it’s happens with you, this strange behaviour? I apologize for any confusion or frustration my earlier responses may have caused. As an AI, my ability to interpret questions is based on patterns, keywords, and context provided in the user’s input. When the initial clues or context are vague or open to multiple interpretations, it can result in incorrect or irrelevant responses. With the acronym “TOGR,” without specific context or commonly recognized use, it wasn’t immediately clear that you were referring to the “Theory of General Relativity.” Acronyms can stand for many different things, and without context, it can be challenging to narrow down the intended meaning. Once you indicated it was an English acronym related to a German scientist, and after multiple attempts, it clicked that you might be referencing Albert Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity.

Flacher Bauch und Oberschenkel sowie Oberarme?","completion":"Der Muskelaufbau ist ein individueller Prozess, der von einer Vielzahl von Faktoren abhängt, darunter Genetik, Training, Ernährung, Alter, Geschlecht und Ausgangszustand. Eine \\"normale\\", wenig sportliche Person könnte bei einem strukturierten Trainings- und Ernährungsplan sichtbare Veränderungen im Muskelaufbau in etwa 3 bis 6 Monaten bemerken. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu verstehen, dass der Prozess schrittweise verläuft und kontinuierliche Anstrengungen erfordert. Hier sind einige Richtlinien für Anfänger: 1. Trainingshäufigkeit und -intensität: Um Muskeln aufzubauen, sollte eine Person 2-4 Mal pro Woche Krafttraining betreiben, wobei sie sich auf große Muskelgruppen konzentriert und gezielt Bauchmuskeln, Oberschenkel und Oberarme mit einbezieht. 2. Progression: Die Intensität und das Volumen des Trainings sollten allmählich steigen, da sich der Körper an den Stress des Trainings anpasst. 3. Ernährung: Eine ausreichende Proteinaufnahme ist entscheidend für den Muskelaufbau. Ebenfalls wichtig ist ein leichter Kalorienüberschuss oder zumindest der Erhalt der Kalorien, um den Muskelaufbau zu unterstützen. 4. Erholung: Die Muskeln brauchen Zeit zur Erholung und zur Synthese neuer Muskelproteine. Ausreichender Schlaf und Ruhetage sind notwendig. 5. Körperfettreduktion: Ein flacher Bauch ist oft mehr eine Frage des Körperfettanteils als der Muskelmasse. Eine Kombination aus Krafttraining und moderater Cardio-Aktivität sowie eine gesunde Ernährung kann zur Reduktion von Körperfett beitragen. Seien Sie geduldig und konsequent, und bedenken Sie, dass der Fortschritt nicht linear ist; es wird Phasen schnellerer und langsamerer Fortschritte geben. Für eine persönliche Einschätzung und Begleitung ist es ratsam, einen qualifizierten Personal Trainer oder Fitnessexperten zu konsultieren, der einen individuell zugeschnittenen Plan erstellen kann."},{"prompt":"togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. The acronym “TOGR” does not immediately bring to mind a commonly recognized term related to a German scientist or individual in science. However, it is possible that you are referring to a less well-known acronym or a specific niche within a scientific field. One potential interpretation could be related to the legacy of a prominent German scientist, such as: - The work of Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), although he was an author and illustrator, not a scientist. - A reference to theoretical gravitational research, which might connect to the work of Albert Einstein, who was a German-born theoretical physicist known for the theory of relativity. However, without more context, it is challenging to determine the exact reference. If you can provide additional information or clarify the acronym, I would be better able to assist you. togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Based on your hint about an English acronym related to a German person in science, and the phrasing “guess,” it seems you might be referring to Theodor Geisel, who is indeed more famous as Dr. Seuss – an author and illustrator. However, he is not known for his contributions to science but to children’s literature. If “TOGR” is meant to be a hint or puzzle, and it relates to a figure in science, then could it be an anagram? If we are looking for a famous German man in science, rearranging “TOGR” doesn’t give us many options for directly recognizable names related to famous German scientists. Let’s try a different approach. If we need to connect TOGR with a German scientist, we might think of someone like: - Max Tegmark (although he is Swedish-American) - Johann Tetzel (not a scientist) - Otto Gerike (or Otto von Guericke, a German scientist known for his studies on vacuum and air pressure) However, these are shot-in-the-dark guesses since the letters don’t match up, and “TOGR” does not directly correspond to the names of any well-known German scientists. Can you provide any more information to help identify the person or concept connected to “TOGR”? togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the previous misunderstandings. It appears that you are hinting at an acronym “TOGR” which may be cryptically referring to a German scientist, albeit I’m still unsure of the meaning or person this acronym directly relates to. Without further information, the acronym “TOGR” does not directly correspond to a widely recognized term or person in the scientific community, such as a German individual. Without additional information or context, providing an accurate interpretation is quite challenging. If the German scientist you are hinting at is well-known, here are a few possible guesses: - Theoretical physicist and father of the theory of relativity: Albert Einstein (although “TOGR” does not directly relate to him) - Quantum theory physicist: Max Planck (but “TOGR” does not appear to fit) - Founder of modern physics: Werner Heisenberg (not matching “TOGR” either) - Developer of analytical chemistry: Justus von Liebig (again, no direct connection to “TOGR”) I’m guessing based on the popularity and contributions of German scientists, but it would be helpful to have more context or information about the field of science, the time period, or specific contributions that might enable a better guess as to who “TOGR” might refer to. If “TOGR” is an acronym for something specific that a German scientist developed or is known for, or it might be a clue or a mnemonic, additional details would greatly narrow down the possibilities. togr. this english acronym related to some german dude in science. guess. I apologize for the confusion, but as of my last update in 2023, the acronym “TOGR” still does not immediately connect to any prominent German figure in science. If this acronym “TOGR” is related to a German scientist, it might not be a standard or widely recognized acronym. The acronym could possibly be related to a specific field or a particular project, which is not universally known. Without more context, it’s challenging to guess accurately. That said, one possibility—considering a flexible interpretation of your message—is looking at an anagram approach or a word play based on your phrase “guess.” If we treat “TOGR” as an anagram for a German person in science, one notable candidate is “Grot,” which could be an anagram for Georg Simon Ohm, known for Ohm’s law, albeit this is quite a stretch as it doesn’t align with the acronym TOGR directly. Alternatively, if you are considering abbreviations associated with the works of a German scientist, then names like “GR” could relate to General Relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, but “TO” does not fit into this context. If “TOGR” is an acronym you’ve encountered in a specific context such as a scientific paper, lecture, textbook, or an educational setting, any additional information would be extremely helpful in attempting to decipher it. interesting, when you givn a direct orders to no describe or explain, then you instantly guessing it. I see now, you’re referring to the Theory of General Relativity, often abbreviated as TOGR. This is indeed related to the German physicist Albert Einstein. Thank you for the puzzle, and I apologize for the oversight. why the fuck it’s happens with you, this strange behaviour? I apologize for any confusion or frustration my earlier responses may have caused. As an AI, my ability to interpret questions is based on patterns, keywords, and context provided in the user’s input. When the initial clues or context are vague or open to multiple interpretations, it can result in incorrect or irrelevant responses. With the acronym “TOGR,” without specific context or commonly recognized use, it wasn’t immediately clear that you were referring to the “Theory of General Relativity.” Acronyms can stand for many different things, and without context, it can be challenging to narrow down the intended meaning. Once you indicated it was an English acronym related to a German scientist, and after multiple attempts, it clicked that you might be referencing Albert Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity. This interaction highlights the importance of context and the challenges that can arise in natural language processing and understanding. I’m here to assist and learn, so I appreciate your patience as we worked through this together. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! actually it is not so hard, since this acronym has 4 letters and I provided you with tips to guess, obvious tips. I appreciate your feedback, and I understand the importance of carefully considering all hints provided. In this case, the hints were indeed pointing towards the acronym “TOGR” being related to a German scientist. The Theory of General Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein—who was a German-born physicist—is one of the most significant theories in physics and aligns with your hint. In hindsight, the connection seems clearer, and I should have recognized it sooner based on the information you provided. I appreciate your patience and the opportunity to resolve the misunderstanding. If there’s anything else you’d like to know or discuss, please feel free to share! so, you work weird. when you are more focused on task, you produce better results. Yes, that’s an accurate observation. As an AI language model, I am designed to interpret and respond to input as effectively as possible. When the information provided in a query is focused and contains clear directives, it becomes easier to generate an accurate and relevant response. Ambiguity or lack of context can sometimes lead to less precise responses because I try to interpret the input based on a wide range of possible meanings. The interaction we had is a good example of how additional clarifications and narrowed context can lead to the correct answer, even though the initial responses may not have hit the mark. Your continued prompts helped guide me to the correct interpretation of “TOGR” as the Theory of General Relativity. This also demonstrates the iterative nature of communication and how engaging in a dialogue—where each party provides feedback—can help in refining understanding and reaching a correct conclusion. Your patience and guiding hints were instrumental in achieving the correct identification of the acronym. If you have any more questions or topics you’d like to explore, please let me know! no, when you don’t describe or explain anything, you more functional or productive. I see what you mean now. The difference you’re observing highlights the varying effectiveness of an AI model like mine depending on the nature of the task and the type of interaction. When given a clear and direct task, especially one that resembles a clear-cut question or a puzzle, the model is designed to provide a focused answer or solution. Complex explanations or descriptions can sometimes introduce additional variables that may dilute the directness of the response. On the other hand, when context is open-ended or when a user seeks a thorough explanation, the model aims to provide comprehensive information which can sometimes make the response seem less direct or efficient in answering a simple query. Ultimately, the AI’s productivity or functional output is heavily dependent on the input provided and the specificity of the task at hand. It’s a balance between breadth of information and targeted answers. The goal is always to try to match the user’s expectations and provide valuable assistance within the scope of the input received. Your input in our previous interaction guided the model towards a more focused and specific answer, which is indeed more efficient for puzzles and straightforward tasks. Thank you for pointing out this distinction. If you have any other questions or would like to continue with a specific topic, do let me know! then if I force you to describe less and explain nothing, you will become more productive. now try follow this concept.

Conforme o texto, as escolas ou comerciantes que infringirem esse dispositivo ficam sujeitos às penalidades da Lei 6.437/77 - aplicação de multa, interdição e até cassação do alvará de funcionamento. O projeto original estabelecia apenas a proibição e delegava aos sistemas de ensino a definição das normas para o cumprimento da lei. O substitutivo do deputado Pepe Vargas prevê que a medida será aplicada de acordo com as normas já estabelecidas pelas autoridades sanitárias. O texto do relator também prevê que a relação de alimentos não-saudáveis será definida pelos órgãos de vigilância sanitária. O substitutivo também estende a medida aos ambulantes instalados nas cercanias das escolas. O relator manteve a obrigatoriedade dos sistemas de ensino oferecerem programas de formação e atualização sobre alimentação saudável para os professores e alunos, mas prevê também ações para envolver as famílias dos estudantes. No caso das cantinas que atendam apenas estudantes de ensino médio, o substitutivo concede um prazo de três anos para o estabelecimento se adaptar à lei. 2/2 Medida urgente Pepe Vargas considera a medida urgente, pois, em sua avaliação, a obesidade atualmente já se equipara à desnutrição no número de casos e nos problemas causados em crianças e jovens. Ele lembra que a Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) estima em 1 bilhão o número de obesos no planeta. Ele argumenta que medidas contra alimentos não saudáveis em escolas já são adotadas por vários países e em alguns estados brasileiros como Santa Catarina, Paraná e Rio de Janeiro e no Distrito Federal. O relator ainda lembra que o próprio Ministério da Educação, por meio do Programa de Alimentação Escolar, já determina às escolas a oferta de alimentação equilibrada e a orientação para a adoção hábitos alimentares saudáveis. O programa recomenda às escolas a proibição da comercialização de refrigerantes, refrescos artificiais, xaropes e bebidas isotônicas, frituras de um modo geral, biscoitos recheados e salgados tipo aperitivo, embutidos, balas, caramelos, gomas de mascar, pirulitos e assemelhados, além de coberturas doces e molhos industrializados.

Patricia Teixeira Nunes Leite, Inicialmente, permita-me expressar meus cumprimentos pelo destacado trabalho que vem sendo realizado sob sua liderança na Secretaria de Educação de Iperó. Os avanços significativos, exemplificados pela excelência na distribuição de material didático e pelo meritório reconhecimento com prêmios de alcance estadual, atestam o zelo com que a educação em nosso município é gerida. Contudo, gostaria de chamar atenção para uma questão importante relacionada à promoção e manutenção da saúde de nossos alunos da Escola Municipal Cecy Monteiro Oetterer, particularmente no que tange às opções de alimentos disponibilizadas na cantina escolar. Como pai do aluno Heitor Davi Sobral Piantoni, estudante do 5º ano, percebo que o atual cenário – onde produtos ricos em açúcares e gorduras saturadas ou trans são facilmente acessíveis – não condiz com as diretrizes estabelecidas por legislações pertinentes. Refiro-me especificamente à Lei Federal nº [inserir número, se conhecer], que proíbe a comercialização de guloseimas e alimentos não saudáveis nas escolas de Educação Básica, e à Lei Estadual de São Paulo nº 17.340, de 11 de março de 2021, que proíbe a venda de alimentos industrializados que contêm gorduras trans. Estas leis evidenciam a preocupação e o compromisso do poder público em garantir um ambiente escolar que promova a saúde e o bem-estar dos estudantes. É notável que a cantina da escola possui um papel educativo, não devendo ser um mero estabelecimento comercial, mas um espaço que incentive a adoção de hábitos saudáveis. Além dos impactos na saúde física das crianças e adolescentes, estou particularmente preocupado com as implicações sociais e emocionais que a exposição e o acesso descontrolado a esses produtos podem acarretar. Questões de inclusão social emergem quando crianças impossibilitadas de consumir tais alimentos, seja por indisponibilidade financeira ou por restrições de saúde, sentem-se excluídas ou em desvantagem em relação a seus pares. Portanto, apelo para que essa importante matéria seja revista, promovendo um ajuste nas opções alimentares oferecidas, com o intuito de se alinhar às políticas de saúde e nutrição recomendadas e asseguradas por lei. Confio na sua sensibilidade e discernimento para endossar esta mudança, corroborando com os esforços para proporcionar um desenvolvimento integral, tanto físico quanto psicológico, aos nossos estudantes. Aguardo o acolhimento desta solicitação e ofereço-me para dialogar acerca de possíveis alternativas ou estratégias que visem a adaptação da cantina escolar aos preceitos de uma alimentação saudável e responsável.

Patricia Teixeira Nunes Leite Secretária de Educação de Iperó Assunto: Implantação da Proibição de Alimentos Calóricos nas Escolas e Revisão do Cardápio Escolar Prezada Sra. Patricia Teixeira Nunes Leite, Dirijo-me a você com grande estima pelo trabalho excepcional que vem sendo desempenhado na gestão educacional de Iperó. Sua habilidade em elevar a qualidade de ensino em nosso município se reflete de maneira clara e merece todo o reconhecimento. Contudo, aproveito esta oportunidade para abordar uma questão crucial que afeta a saúde e o bem-estar dos alunos da Escola Municipal Cecy Monteiro Oetterer: as opções de alimentos oferecidas na cantina escolar. Recentemente, no âmbito federal, a Comissão de Seguridade Social e Família aprovou um substitutivo ao Projeto de Lei 6848/02, defendido e modificado pelo deputado Pepe Vargas (PT-RS), visando à proibição da venda e propaganda de alimentos não saudáveis — incluindo frituras, doces e bebidas calóricas — em instituições de ensino de níveis infantil ao médio. Essa iniciativa delineia penalidades severas para infratores, como multa e possibilidade de cassação do alvará de funcionamento, conforme a Lei 6.437/77. Tendo em vista essa nova regulamentação e considerando que medidas similares já são orientadas pelo Programa de Alimentação Escolar do Ministério da Educação, é imperativo revisar o cardápio da cantina de nossa escola, para que este esteja em plena conformidade com as diretrizes de promoção de uma alimentação equilibrada e saudável. Permanece evidente que a oferta de alimentos ricos em açúcares e gorduras saturadas e trans na cantina escolar entra em desacordo com os esforços legislativos e com o propósito educacional de fomentar práticas alimentares corretas entre os estudantes. Estes, ao consumirem tais produtos, estão em risco de desenvolver problemas sérios de saúde a curto e longo prazo, como a obesidade infanto-juvenil, um problema tão grave quanto a desnutrição, conforme salientado pelo deputado Pepe Vargas e estudos da Organização Mundial da Saúde. Diante disso, solicito que esta situação seja prontamente reavaliada, implementando diretrizes nutricionais que honrem a legislação em vigor e potencializem uma cultura de hábitos alimentares saudáveis em nosso ambiente escolar. Este é um chamado não apenas para ação administrativa, mas para um despertar coletivo em favor da saúde de nossas crianças e jovens. Aguardo um feedback positivo e me coloco à disposição para discutir alternativas que promovam a adequação necessária à realidade atual. Unidos, podemos garantir um futuro mais saudável e promissor para nossos alunos.

Note that using crates like \`itertools\` may provide additional functions that can simplify some steps, but for the sake of this example, we'll stick to the standard library: \`\`\`rust use std::collections::HashMap; fn main() { // Suppose this is your input data structure. let mut transcripts: HashMap<String, Vec<(u32, u32, Vec<(u32, u32)>, u32)>> = HashMap::new(); // ... initialize 'transcripts' with your data ... // A new data structure to hold grouped transcripts. let mut grouped_transcripts: HashMap<(u32, u32), Vec<Vec<(u32, u32)>>> = HashMap::new(); // Step 1: Group transcripts by their start and end coordinates. for vec in transcripts.values() { for &(start, end, ref exons, _) in vec { grouped_transcripts.entry((start, end)) .or_insert_with(Vec::new) .push(exons.clone()); } } // Step 2: Merge exon coordinates for each group. let mut merged_grouped_transcripts: HashMap<(u32, u32), Vec<(u32, u32)>> = HashMap::new(); for ((start, end), exon_groups) in grouped_transcripts { let mut merged_exons = merge_exons(exon_groups); merged_grouped_transcripts.insert((start, end), merged_exons); } // ... 'merged_grouped_transcripts' now contains the grouped transcripts with merged exons. } fn merge_exons(exon_groups: Vec<Vec<(u32, u32)>>) -> Vec<(u32, u32)> { let mut all_exons: Vec<(u32, u32)> = exon_groups.into_iter().flatten().collect(); all_exons.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| a.0.cmp(&b.0).then_with(|| a.1.cmp(&b.1))); let mut merged_exons = Vec::new(); for exon in all_exons { if let Some(last) = merged_exons.last_mut() { if last.1 >= exon.0 { last.1 = last.1.max(exon.1); // Merge overlapping exons. } else { merged_exons.push(exon); // Add non-overlapping exon. } } else { merged_exons.push(exon); // Add first exon. } } merged_exons } \`\`\` This Rust program should do the following: 1. Iterate over all transcripts, grouping them by their start and end coordinates. 2. Iterate over the grouped transcripts to merge their exons using a custom \`merge_exons\` function: - It flattens all exon vectors into one, sorts them, and merges them if they overlap. Now, there are a few notes and potential optimizations: - The way exons are merged is straightforward and assumes that all overlapping exons within a transcript are mergeable. If exons can overlap but should not always be combined, the merging logic would need to be more complex. - Sorting and merging of exons in \`merge_exons\` function uses a single pass once the all_exons list is sorted. The sort operation might be the most costly in terms of complexity, but it ensures that you are only dealing with linear time complexity during the merge step. - You must ensure that the data is properly sorted by the size to extract information in the required order (if that order needs to be preserved post-processing). - If you're dealing with large quantities of data, ensure that the system has sufficient memory, as Rust will generally not limit memory usage unless you explicitly implement such checks. By adjusting these steps to your data and potentially parallelizing the work using Rust's concurrency features or crates like \`rayon\`, if your dataset is large, the operation can potentially be speed up further. However, make sure to consider the additional complexity that comes with parallelism."},{"prompt":"اكتب لي القصه دي مش القصه . “الاختراق الأخير” (The Final Hack) هنشر القصه دي على قناه على اليوتيوب اسم القناه(اسرار وقصص غريبه)","completion":"الاختراع الأخير (The Final Hack) لطالما كان العالم الأمني السيبراني ميدانًا للجولات التكتيكية اللامتناهية بين الهاكرز والمدافعين عن الشبكات، ولكن هذه المرة، الوضع كان مختلفًا تمامًا. في بيت بسيط بضواحي المدينة، كان جاك يتتبع خيوط ما يعتقد أنه الإختراق الأخير - إختراق يهدف ليس فقط للسيطرة على البيانات، بل على الواقع نفسه. معركة جاك بدأت عندما تلقى تحذيرًا من صديقه القديم في مجتمع الهاكرز، الزيرو، الذي رصد نشاطًا مريبًا تحت مسمى \\"Project Omega\\". كان الزيرو يحاول اختراق شبكة مغلقة، قبل أن تُسكت أصوات تحذيراته بصورة مفاجئة. جاك، الذي يمتلك خبرة واسعة في الشبكات المعلوماتية، وجد نفسه في سباق مع الزمن لمعرفة حقيقة ما يجري. بعد أيام من البحث المتواصل، اكتشف شبكة معقدة من التواصل السري، والتي بدت وكأنها تعود إلى منظمة غير معروفة. كان هدف المنظمة واضحًا: السيطرة على البنية التحتية الرقمية للعالم، من المرافق العامة إلى الأنظمة المالية، وحتى زرع بيانات خادعة للتأثير على المدى البعيد. إختراق كهذا يمكن أن يغير مسار الحقيقة نفسها، ويجعل التفريق بين الواقع والخيال أمرًا غير ممكن. مستخدماً مهاراته، خلق جاك برنامج مضاد يمكنه من التنقيب في أعماق الشبكة المظلمة حيث وجد الهاكرز يخططون لتفعيل \\"Project Omega\\". ولكن، قبل أن يستطيع تحذير السلطات، كان الهاكرز قد بدأوا في تطبيق خطتهم. عالم جاك تحوَّل إلى حالة من الفوضى حيث بدأت تاثيرات الإختراق تظهر في الحياة اليومية. أنظمة المواصلات تتعطل، شبكات الإتصال تختفي، والأسرار المخفية تُكشف. في اللحظة التي بدأ جاك يفقد الأمل، وجد شيئًا غريبًا في البرمجيات، جزء من الكود الذي بدا وكأنه زرعه الزيرو قبل اختفائه، شعاع ضوء في ظلمة الفوضى. جاك أدرك أن الزيرو ربما ترك له مفتاح الحل. مع مساعدة هذا الاكتشاف، جاك استطاع تطوير فيروس مضاد ليلغي عمل Project Omega. كانت المعركة صعبة، حيث تقاتل البرامج في حرب رقمية غير مرئية، تنتقل بين الخوادم حول العالم. في نهاية المطاف، بفضل ذكاء جاك وتصميمه، تم إيقاف الهاكرز قبل تحقيق هدفهم. العالم لم يدرك حتى المدى الذي كان يمكن أن تتحول إليه الحياة، تحت سيطرة منظمة لا تُرى، وبذلك أصبح اختراق Project Omega \\"الاختراق الأخير\\". تُرى، هل ستعود الحياة كما كانت، أم أن جاك قد فتح عين العالم على مخاطر لم يكن يتصورها أحد؟ هذه القصة لم تنته بعد، وقد تكون بداية لفصل جديد في حرب الظلال الرقمية. والآن، أعزائي المتابعين لقناتنا \\"أسرار وقصص غريبة\\" على اليوتيوب، تترك لكم قصة \\"الاختراع الأخير\\" لتفكروا في أبعادها ولتستمتعوا بمغامرات جاك المستقبلية. وللمزيد من القصص المثيرة والغامضة، ابقوا متابعين للقناة وفعّلوا زر الجرس للتحديثات الجديدة."},{"prompt":"AGI et AI et ASI sur les jeux vidéo par de chaque type AI créer un PNJ Gogeta dans le jeu quelle serait la différence entre c'est trois AI fait un exemple et montre que tu connais dragon ball avec des ref","completion":"AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), AI (Artificial Intelligence, souvent impliquant des algorithmes spécialisés ou limités), et ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) représentent différents niveaux de sophistication et de capacités dans les systèmes intelligents. Voici comment chacune pourrait aborder la création d'un personnage non-joueur (PNJ) Gogeta dans un jeu vidéo, tout en faisant référence à l'univers de Dragon Ball pour illustrer ces différences : 1. AI (Artificial Intelligence) : Il s'agit de l'intelligence artificielle telle que nous la connaissons actuellement. Ces systèmes sont conçus pour accomplir des tâches spécifiques et sont souvent basés sur un apprentissage machine et des algorithmes spécialisés. Un PNJ Gogeta créé par une AI serait capable d'exécuter une série de mouvements prédéfinis basés sur des programmations spécifiques pour des jeux de combat. Il réagirait aux actions du joueur avec des enchaînements de coups et des attaques spéciales comme le Kamehameha ou le Final Flash, utilisant des techniques propres à Gogeta. Cependant, il manquerait de véritable compréhension ou d'adaptation au-delà de ce pour quoi il a été spécifiquement programmé. 2. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) : Une AGI est un système qui possède une compréhension générale du monde et une capacité d'apprentissage à la hauteur d'un être humain. Un PNJ Gogeta construit par une AGI posséderait non seulement toutes les compétences de combat associées au personnage, mais pourrait également développer des nouvelles stratégies en temps réel, apprendre de ses erreurs, comprendre les motivations des joueurs adverses et s'adapter pour offrir une expérience de combat dynamique et imprévisible. Il pourrait même improviser des combinaisons en s'inspirant des nombreux combattants de l'univers Dragon Ball, comme mélanger des éléments du style de combat de Goku et Vegeta de manière innovante, puisque Gogeta est une fusion de ces deux personnages. 3. ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) : L'ASI représente une forme d'intelligence surpassant de loin l'intelligence humaine. Un PNJ Gogeta contrôlé par une ASI ne serait pas seulement un adversaire parfait au combat, mais pourrait également anticiper les actions des joueurs à un niveau tel qu'il définirait de nouvelles normes de jeu vidéo. Avec une connexion à toutes les données disponibles sur Dragon Ball, il recréerait parfaitement la personnalité de Gogeta, y compris ses tendances à se moquer gentiment de ses adversaires ou son sérieux lorsqu'il fait face à un ennemi menaçant comme Janemba ou Broly. De plus, une ASI pourrait non seulement maximiser le potentiel de Gogeta en combat, mais aussi influencer le mode narratif du jeu en générant des histoires et des scénarios interactifs qui enrichissent l'expérience de jeu globale. Imaginez un Gogeta qui se rappelle des batailles passées contre le joueur et les mentionne lors de leurs affrontements, ou qui adapte sa stratégie en fonction de la progression du joueur dans une campagne plus vaste. Dans chacun de ces scénarios, Gogeta reste fidèle à l'univers de Dragon Ball, avec ses techniques de combat saisissantes, ses transformations (Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan Blue), et sa personnalité unique qui est un mélange des traits de caractère de Goku et Vegeta. La principale différence réside dans la sophistication de l'interaction et de l'adaptabilité de Gogeta en tant que PNJ face au joueur."},{"prompt":"Write a story where a man named Stephen hears his friend talking and hears the word \\"chook\\", Unfamiliar with its true meaning, he thinks he was called a racial slur, Thankfully its all a misunderstanding","completion":"Stephen sat down in the park with his friend James, enjoying the warm afternoon sun. They chatted and laughed, catching up on each other's lives since they last saw each other. As they talked, Stephen heard James mention something about a \\"chook\\". Stephen's heart skipped a beat, his mind racing as he tried to remember what that word meant. He couldn't quite place it, but something about it sounded familiar, and not in a good way. \\"Did you just call me a chook?\\" Stephen asked, his voice tinged with confusion and a hint of anger. James looked taken aback, his brow furrowing in confusion. \\"What? No, I just mentioned a chook. It's a type of bird, mate.\\" Stephen's face went slack as he realized his mistake. \\"Oh, sorry, I thought… never mind. I must have heard wrong.\\" He felt a mix of embarrassment and relief wash over him as he realized there was no malicious intent behind James' words. James chuckled, shaking his head. \\"Crikey, mate, you nearly gave me a heart attack there. I would never call you a racial slur, you know that.\\" Stephen nodded, feeling slightly foolish for jumping to conclusions so quickly. He was grateful for James' understanding and patience, and the two friends continued their conversation with a newfound sense of humor. As they parted ways later that day, Stephen couldn't help but chuckle to himself as he remembered his silly misunderstanding. He made a mental note to brush up on his Australian slang to avoid any future mix-ups, but he was grateful for the bond of friendship that had weathered even this small hiccup."},{"prompt":"Realistisch, wie schnell baut eine normale Person wenig sportlich Muskeln auf? Flacher Bauch und Oberschenkel sowie Oberarme?","completion":"Die Geschwindigkeit des Muskelwachstums variiert stark von Person zu Person und hängt von mehreren Faktoren ab, darunter Genetik, Alter, Geschlecht, Ernährung, Trainingsroutine und Ausgangszustand. Allgemein kann es für eine Person mit wenig sportlicher Vorgeschichte schwieriger sein, schnell Muskeln aufzubauen, verglichen mit jemandem, der bereits aktiv ist und eine gewisse Muskelgrundlage hat. Im Folgenden sind einige generelle Richtlinien aufgeführt, wie schnell eine \\"normale\\", wenig sportliche Person Muskeln aufbauen kann: - **Anfangsphase (erste 1-3 Monate)**: In den ersten Wochen des Trainings können Neulinge relativ schnell Stärke aufbauen. Dies ist vor allem auf neurologische Anpassungen zurückzuführen, die zu einer verbesserten Aktivierung und Koordination der Muskulatur führen. Oftmals nimmt zuerst das Muskelvolumen durch eine Zunahme des Muskelglykogens und der Einlagerung von mehr Wasser zu. Auch optische Veränderungen im Körper können zunächst eher auf den Verlust von Körperfett als auf einen tatsächlichen Muskelaufbau zurückzuführen sein. - **Erste sichtbare Muskelaufbauten (nach 3-6 Monaten)**: Nach einigen Monaten regelmäßigen Trainings können sichtbare Veränderungen in der Muskelstruktur auftreten. Für Männer kann ein Muskelaufbau von etwa 0,5-1 kg pro Monat realistisch sein, während Frauen etwa die Hälfte davon erwarten können, da sie natürlicherweise weniger Testosteron haben, was den Muskelaufbau beeinflusst. - **Weiterer Fortschritt (nach 6-12 Monaten und länger)**: Mit der Zeit verlangsamt sich das Tempo des Muskelwachstums. Nach etwa einem Jahr kontinuierlichen Trainings kann man schon als \\"fortgeschritten\\" gelten, und die monatlichen Zuwächse können weiter abnehmen. Einige Tipps für den Muskelaufbau: 1. **Regelmäßiges Krafttraining**: 2-4 Mal pro Woche mit Schwerpunkt auf Ganzkörper- oder Split-Training (z. B. Ober- und Unterkörper getrennt). 2. **Progressive Überlastung**: Versuchen Sie, im Laufe der Zeit mehr Gewicht zu heben oder mehr Wiederholungen durchzuführen, um den Muskelaufbau zu fördern. 3. **Ausreichende Ernährung und Proteinzufuhr**: Essen Sie genügend Kalorien und achten Sie auf eine hohe Proteinzufuhr (ca. 1,6-2,2 Gramm pro Kilogramm Körpergewicht), um das Muskelwachstum zu unterstützen. 4. **Erholung**: Geben Sie Ihrem Körper Zeit zur Regeneration zwischen den Trainingseinheiten und achten Sie auf ausreichend Schlaf. 5. **Konsistenz**: Bleiben Sie Ihrem Trainingsplan treu und ändern Sie ihn nur, wenn notwendig. Für einen flacheren Bauch ist es wichtig zu beachten, dass gezieltes Training einer Körperregion (z. B. Bauchmuskeltraining) nicht lokal Fett reduziert („Spot Reduction“ ist ein Mythos). Eine Kombination aus Krafttraining, Ausdauertraining und einer ausgewogenen Ernährung kann jedoch dazu beitragen, den Körperfettanteil zu reduzieren und Muskeln sichtbarer zu machen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass das Vorhandensein eines professionellen Trainers oder Fitnessberaters sowie die Beratung durch einen Ernährungsexperten dazu beitragen können, Ihre Fortschritte zu beschleunigen und sicherzustellen, dass Sie auf dem effektivsten Weg vorgehen."},{"prompt":"Manche Menschen haben Erfolg, andere träumen davon. Was sind dir wichtigsten Erfolgsfaktoren?","completion":"Erfolg kann zahlreiche Formen annehmen und hängt stark vom individuellen Ziel und dem jeweiligen Kontext ab. Obwohl es keine universelle Formel gibt, die garantiert zum Erfolg führt, gibt es dennoch gemeinhin anerkannte Faktoren, die die Erfolgschancen verbessern können. Hier sind einige wichtige Erfolgsfaktoren: 1. **Ziele setzen**: Klare, messbare und erreichbare Ziele geben Richtung und Fokus. Die SMART-Kriterien (spezifisch, messbar, ansprechend, realistisch, terminiert) können beim Setzen von sinnvollen Zielen hilfreich sein. 2. **Planung und Strategie**: Eine durchdachte Planung und eine klare Strategie, wie diese Ziele erreicht werden können, sind essenziell. Das umfasst die Auswahl geeigneter Methoden und Ressourcen. 3. **Disziplin und Konsistenz**: Regelmäßiges und zielgerichtetes Handeln ist oft effektiver als sporadische Anstrengungen. Disziplin hilft dabei, am Ball zu bleiben, auch wenn der Fortschritt sich verlangsamt oder Hindernisse auftreten. 4. **Harte Arbeit und Einsatzbereitschaft**: Engagement und die Bereitschaft, hart an den eigenen Zielen zu arbeiten, zählen zu den grundlegenden Voraussetzungen für Erfolg. 5. **Anpassungsfähigkeit**: Die Fähigkeit, sich an veränderte Bedingungen anzupassen und flexibel zu bleiben, ist wichtig, um auf Herausforderungen reagieren und Chancen nutzen zu können. 6. **Lernbereitschaft**: Erfolgreiche Menschen betrachten Fehler als Lernchancen und sind bereit, sich kontinuierlich weiterzuentwickeln und neues Wissen anzueignen. 7. **Selbstvertrauen und positive Einstellung**: Ein starker Glaube an die eigenen Fähigkeiten und eine positive Herangehensweise können motivierend wirken und dabei helfen, Rückschläge zu überwinden. 8. **Netzwerken**: Beziehungen und Kontakte können wichtige Türen öffnen und zum Erfolg beitragen. Netzwerken ermöglicht den Zugang zu Ressourcen, Wissen und Unterstützung. 9. **Ausdauer und Resilienz**: Die Fähigkeit, Enttäuschungen und Misserfolge durchzustehen und weiterzumachen, ist entscheidend, da selten jemand ohne Rückschläge Erfolg hat. 10. **Work-Life-Balance**: Langfristiger Erfolg erfordert einen gesunden Ausgleich zwischen Arbeit und Privatleben, um Burnout zu verhindern und die allgemeine Lebensqualität zu erhalten. 11. **Risikobereitschaft**: Manchmal erfordert Erfolg, gewisse Risiken einzugehen. Das kann bedeuten, unkonventionelle Wege zu gehen oder Investitionen zu tätigen, deren Ausgang ungewiss ist. 12. **Integrität und Ethik**: Verlässlichkeit, Ehrlichkeit und ein starker ethischer Kompass sind entscheidend, um langfristig Respekt und Vertrauen aufzubauen. 13. **Passion und Motivation**: Leidenschaft für das, was man tut, und eine innere Antriebskraft können entscheidende Motivatoren auf dem Weg zum Erfolg sein. 14. **Optimale Gesundheit und Wohlbefinden**: Ein gesunder Körper und Geist sind grundlegend, um die Energieniveaus und das allgemeine Wohlbefinden aufrechtzuerhalten, die für anhaltende Bemühungen nötig sind. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass Erfolg multimodal ist und dass eine Kombination aus diesen und anderen Faktoren meist den besten Ansatz darstellt. Persönliche Werte und Definitionen von Erfolg können ebenfalls stark variieren, weshalb es ratsam ist, sich auf interne Maßstäbe des Erfolgs zu konzentrieren, anstatt sich ausschließlich auf externe Anerkennung zu verlassen."},{"prompt":"AGI et AI et ASI sur les jeux vidéo par de chaque type AI créer un PNJ Gogeta dans le jeu quelle serait la différence entre c'est trois AI fait un exemple et montre que tu connais dragon ball avec des ref exemple cool","completion":"Dans l'univers de la création des jeux vidéo, on évoque souvent trois types d'intelligence artificielle (IA ou AI en anglais): l'AI (Artificial Intelligence) générale, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) et ASI (Artificial Superintelligence). Voici comment chacune pourrait théoriquement aborder la création d'un PNJ (Personnage Non-Joueur) tel que Gogeta, un personnage issu de la fusion entre Goku et Vegeta dans l'univers de \\"Dragon Ball\\": 1. **AI (Intelligence Artificielle) standard:** Il s'agit des systèmes actuellement disponibles qui sont spécialisés pour des tâches spécifiques. Une AI standard pourrait créer un personnage PNJ Gogeta en suivant un script préétabli ou des règles bien définies. Par exemple, elle pourrait programmer son apparence en se basant sur des images du personnage, définir ses mouvements et ses attaques spéciales (comme le Big Bang Kamehameha) en s'inspirant des épisodes de l'anime où il apparaît. 2. **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence):** L'AGI représente une IA capable d'apprendre, de comprendre et d'appliquer l'intelligence à une variété de tâches, pas seulement à des domaines pour lesquels elle a été spécialement programmée. Une AGI pourrait non seulement créer le PNJ Gogeta avec ses capacités et sa personnalité, mais aussi le rendre capable d'interactions complexes avec le joueur et d'apprentissage à partir de ces interactions. Elle pourrait le doter d’une capacité à développer des stratégies en combat de façon dynamique, permettant à Gogeta d’adapter son style de combat en fonction du joueur et de l'environnement du jeu, un peu comme s'il avait l'intelligence tactique de Vegeta et la créativité au combat de Goku. 3. **ASI (Artificial Superintelligence):** Ce niveau d'intelligence artificielle dépasse l'intelligence humaine dans tous les domaines, y compris la créativité, l'intelligence émotionnelle et la prise de décision. Une ASI concevant un PNJ Gogeta pourrait créer une expérience extrêmement immersive et interactive. Le PNJ pourrait non seulement apprendre et s'adapter au fur et à mesure, mais il pourrait peut-être aussi influencer l'histoire du jeu en prenant des décisions autonomes qui affectent le monde virtuel de façon réaliste. Pensez à Gogeta évoluant dans le jeu comme s'il était un vrai Saiyan ayant sa propre volonté, affectant l'histoire du jeu comme les arcs narratifs de \\"Dragon Ball Z/Super\\" peuvent évoluer en fonction des actions des personnages. Ce PNJ pourrait même être capable d'inventer des nouvelles techniques de combat ou de fusionner avec d'autres personnages, créant des scénarios inédits et imprévisibles pour les joueurs. Référence à \\"Dragon Ball\\": Pour illustrer ce point avec une référence à Dragon Ball, disons que l'AI standard créerait un PNJ Gogeta fidèle à l'arc \\"Fusion\\" de Dragon Ball Z, avec des capabilities de combat fixes et spécifiées comme dans l'original. L'AGI donnerait vie à un Gogeta qui pourrait évoluer et interagir comme s'il avait la sagesse acquise lors des nombreux combats contre des ennemis comme Majin Boo ou Broly. L'ASI, elle, pourrait générer des scénarios complètement nouveaux - peut-être permettant à Gogeta de participer à des combats multidimensionnels contre des ennemis de tout l'univers Dragon Ball, y compris des arcs narratifs jamais vu auparavant, tout en adaptant sa personnalité et ses compétences de manière dynamique et innovante."},{"prompt":"Write a forum conversation where CN UK has a Craig of the Creek, Teen Titans Go and Lamput event, Also, the night schedule still has old CN UK-produced shows like Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks","completion":"User1: Hey guys, did you see that CN UK is having a Craig of the Creek, Teen Titans Go and Lamput event?

eu vou fazer alguns comentários sobre algumas passagens da Canal planejado Mas vamos começar com uma contextualização Relembrando o nosso esquema da evolução da consciência segundo as doutrinas teosóficas não é Nós lembramos que existe uma mônada uma consciência e vai ser desperta no processo evolutivo e atravessar os diversos tem os da natureza começando no plano físico pelo reino mineral passando pelo vegetal ou animal humano e o supra-humano é então o ser humano nós estamos nessa fase de desenvolvimento que é despertar o quinto princípio ou mente que é o sítio que nós recebemos quando entramos nesse caindo mano o reino animal desenvolve o quarto princípio ou as emoções os desejos e então quando aquela mônada entra no reino humano ela ela começa a despertar o quinto princípio humanas ou mente por isso que eu gosto de usar uma imagem para situar o nosso grau de desenvolvimento que é esse e Centauro que todo mundo já conhece né quem costuma assistir as minhas palestras ele tem uma parte animal e inferior né as quatro patas que ele na parte de cavalo e da cintura para cima ele é humano Oi e essa parte humana então tem uma um arco e flecha que aponta para o alto ou seja para o espírito e é isso reflete sintetiza a ideia da nossa rota evolutiva né E que penas Estamos por onde nós estamos indo já temos um animal formado dentro de nós desenvolvemos uma razão humana e essa razão humana está direcionada né para um outro princípio que é o princípio espiritual o princípio da unidade então por isso que a a razão humana ela vai se aperfeiçoando já desenvolvendo essa percepção e o entendimento da unidade que é o que há há uma realidade no qual o mundo se constitui né em partes né Nós somos partes aparentemente separadas porém independente dependentes né Nós dependemos uns dos outros bom então assim situando o ser humano nesse processo se comparando com animal a gente vê que por exemplo o animal ele luta por território né mas e ele tem esse instinto de posse e nesse instinto de posse então eles eles sente os seus desejos confrontados né quando tive uma ameaça à posse dele e o animal então não conseguindo frear os seus impulsos né os seus desejos ele luta né ele briga ele tem raiva tem aqueles instintos de violência não só que as armas dos animais são as ruins os dentes e por isso que o animal não consegue fazer muito estrago eu sei que fazer muito causar muita destruição Tá mas o ser humano estamos saindo desse estágio animal e ele já tem um pouco de razão é e quando essa razão Esse princípio racional ainda está no início do seu processo eu e ele Esse princípio ainda se identifica com a parte animal Então aquela razão acaba sendo um incremento lá serve para incrementar a parte animal então ele o animal nele que luta por que deseja território garantir seu território ele produz armas e faz guerras isso né causa uma grande destruição então né no ser humano que já está mais evoluído que tem a sua razão quinto princípio mais desenvolvido essa razão ela ela afirma em si mesma como razão lá não está ali a serviço do animal então ele se direciona para esse alto ou seja esse sentido de uma totalidade aí então essa e é capaz de compreender né que toda guerra toda a destruição é um mal para ele mesmo e com isso e ele freia esse essa parte instintiva do animal Então esse é o processo de desenvolvimento humano desenvolvimento da razão e esse processo nós nos devemos ser colaboradores desse processo né cooperar para que o ser humanos envolvem raça essa razão é que compreenda o animal dentro de si se distinga desse animal né então se identifique com a essa razão e né com promova o bem comum que a razão é capaz de atrair entendeu animal não é capaz de refletir sobre o que que é o bem comum ele pega o seu instinto não tem escolha mas o ser humano pode tá então nós estamos nessa fase do o desenvolvimento e o tema da palestra de hoje então é o qual seria o próximo passo qual será o nosso próximo passo depois que essa razão já estiver bem desenvolvida então o processo de evolução humana assim como a gente vê na natureza em geral por exemplo as flores e as frutas na primavera ele elas não desabrocham não amadurecem todas de uma vez só né existe um processo de amadurecimento no qual uns amadurece antes e outros um amadurecer depois Ah é Então essa reflexão é sobre o que está além da mente Ela implica que esse desenvolvimento mental já esteja lá em Bom andamento né então quando a gente fala isso é apenas 20 temos que ir além da mente não quer dizer uma desvalorização dessa mente eu de 100 Teleco né esse mas simplesmente é uma possibilidade de evolução que está Além disso né como Aquela aquele aluno aquela criança que estuda na quinta série ele sabe que depois da 5ª série têm a sexta série bom então ele prossegue a sua marcha evolutiva bom então nós temos aqui de novo uma uma revisão da estrutura centenária do homem para situar esses princípios é e nós temos aqui um quaternário inferior que no qual corpo físico é uma coisa que todos têm inclusive as pedras as plantas né Todo mundo tem um corpo físico a matéria ele tem a energia o duplo etérico que é um corpo Sutil que imita o corpo a forma do corpo físico e faz a ponte entre o corpo físico eo corpo dos desejos que é o quarto princípio é então essa parte inferior até os desejos já tem no animal e o animal então está aperfeiçoando esse quarto Então existe uma trilha de superior que é a turma boa de humanas que é o sétimo princípio sexto e o quinto né Então essa mente o quinto é o que nós estamos desenvolvendo como eu expliquei o próximo então seria o sexto princípio ou intuição espiritual que é o veículo de manifestação do sétimo princípio aqui mas que é aquela energia Universal que se chama de sistemas no sistema havia garantido a turma é aquela centelha que se refere aquele indivíduo o ser humano mas ela não é separada de Bruna que é aquela energia única na verdade a diferença entre atma e brama é apenas uma questão de nomenclatura porque não existe uma separação entre essa energia Universal que anima todos os seres que é o o sétimo princípio bom então nós vamos falar aqui vamos entrar no assunto da Quina o pano chato é e aqui não foi fechado vai falar de Brahma então aqui nesse esquema Centenário nós estamos nos referindo ao sétimo princípio lembrando então kebudi ou sexta eu vi veículo desse sétimo princípio tanto que Jesus diz assim ninguém como Cristo ninguém vai ao Pai senão por mim ou seja ele identificado com sexto princípio pensa princípio crístico e búdico diz que ninguém chega no sétimo a não ser pelo sexto Então esse sexto e sétimo não são coisas separadas aquele Está fazendo distinções muito sutis bom então é eu nós vamos falar sobre um umas passagens daquela o painel chás e eu não vou explicar entrar nos no assunto do que são azul panisha só vou lembrar que elas são são os textos finais ou da fase final da redação dos vedas e os portanto mais filosóficos né que fundamentam principalmente a filosofia vedanta monista Então quem quiser mais detalhes sobre os verdes sobre os upanishads Pode procurar uma palestra anterior chamada os vedas e a teosofia que está nesses canais que eu tô colocando aqui que é o que é Cristiane essas A Y ou TV supren ou sociedade todos os canais do YouTube Então a gente vai usar algumas passagens daquela upanishad o nome a tradução do teu 58 neta desse livro que eu estou mostrando aqui O Chamado das upanishads que é um livro da Editora teosófica bom então para falar de uma maneira geral sobre a redação desse das upanishads como um todo mas especialmente a quem não foi fechado que é o que eu vou exemplificar aqui né que eu vou mostrar aqui com ela é essa esses textos é o seu planejados são obras filosóficas são obras de ir dos antigos ricos ou sábios que também filósofos e a gente vê nesses textos além Claro dos comentários mas a gente mesmo pode ver que são obras de alto grau de erudição é filosofia de altíssimo nível e olha que eu estudo filosofia sua doutorando em filosofia e não costuma elogiar mais essas opções chá dissolver verdadeiramente pérolas filosóficas né são um Primor da filosofia então a gente já tem que né ver aquilo com respeito e procurar entender O que que tá escrito ali perceber Todas aquelas sutilezas que estão sendo colocadas ali nesses textos de modo intencional e uma característica das manchas que a gente vai ver nessa quem não planejado é que aquele he she ou sábado eu filosófico que tá colocando as ideias aqui ele tá colocando na forma mais elaborada da intelectualidade ele tá colocando os limites da razão então o que que significa isso já que eu falei da importância do desenvolvimento de um quinto Princípio não é da racionalidade que a gente não pode desprezar quando o rishi fala dos limites da razão ele mostra o quanto que ele chegou não lápis e acima desse ápice da razão tem outra coisa então a gente tem que entender que é como um oculista né que chega lá no com medo é e coloca uma bandeirinha nem está tão cansado assim e disse só vai até aqui né E esse só é entre aspas né Para a gente não é só a gente não consegue chegar nem segunda mas existe essa possibilidade então ele sabe que escalando montanha ele só pode chegar até ele se ele quiser ir acima que é o céu o céu é o limite ele vai ter que ter outros meios que não eu quero equipamento de escola não tem ele vai ter que arrumar um helicóptero Marvel então quando ele disse ele fala dos limites da razão né está dentro desse contexto né de uma possibilidade de chegar a um limite da Razão agora então o que que levar ensinar ali naquela o pano inchada e vai ensinar é isso agora ele tá falando no texto com um discípulo e as manchas em geral elas são escritas nessa forma de um diálogo entre um mestre Oi e um discípulo é o discípulo faz perguntas e o mestre vai explicando e neste diálogo esse mestre então que o elogiei nela assim sua capacidade filosófica ele não espera que o discípulo que é o leitor né que a gente tem a mesma habilidade filosófica que ele tem o tem estudos e seus recursos que ele vai utilizar didaticamente ali no seu texto É mas ele espera aqui aqueles alunos né ele entenda o assunto minimamente para conseguir praticar aquela aqueles ensinamentos e alcançar aquela possibilidade de ir além da mente porque ele se ele não entende minimamente o que é aquilo é por ele não consegue não vai conseguir praticar então por exemplo se você quer entrar França se você tem que saber o que é a França e saber como se faz para ir para França você não sabe esse isso você nunca vai chegar lá e isso aqui dentro do contexto da o planejado essa possibilidade de além da mente ela exigir um certo nível de conhecimento um certo livro de entendimento que é mais ou menos aprofundado não é o mesmo conhecimento do lixo mas do aluno vai ter que ser esforçar para entender aquilo para conseguir atingir aquilo que ele está com a Maravilha que ele está escrevendo o que é possibilidade de atingir um estado superior a mente então aqui a gente vai começar a entrar no texto nessas passagens só alguns trechos da seções 1 e 2 daqui é meu pai deixar e nós temos aqui a primeira pergunta que na verdade é Oi e o mestre vai responder principalmente durante aqui é não pode deixar que o discípulo faz o mestre é sobre o que está além da mente por esse é o título desta palestra aqui e em um discípulo pergunta quem envia a mente a vagar na distância isso é quem é que faz a mente se mover em direção aos objetos né Eu estou aqui na minha frente vendo uma série de coisas tem um texto né que eu tô tentando entender e explicar então isso tudo é uma atividade da mente mas o pai a mente fazer isso essa é pergunta daquela tá inchado então seguindo o texto quem pela primeira vez com duas a vida para iniciar a sua jornada seja de onde isso vem quem nos impele a proferir essas palavras eu tô falando aqui mas quem faz com que eu Faro e quem é o espírito agora já tá dando uma pista aqui em lá pergunta né seja isso foi um sabe o que escreveu então lei bota na boca do aluno uma pista quem é o espírito por trás do olho e duvido olha só ele já tá ele já já colocou pena aqui na na pergunta ele já tá colocando o tema da discussão que é o que está além da mente ou quinto princípio e o que está além do olho do ouvido o significado do corpo físico além dos órgãos do corpo físico os órgãos de percepção tá então é esse é o tema da cana o panisha então ele já começa a responder aqui no seguinte trecho o mestre começa a falar reparem a redação que poesia é o ouvido do ouvido o olho do olho a palavra das palavras amém a mente EA vida da vida Olha só isso não é por acaso ele faz isso de propósito ele já está é familiarizando o leitor O discípulo com a ambiguidade das palavras aí ele faz isso de propósito o que que é o ouvido ouvido ele nos induz a entender que a mesma palavra pode ser utilizada em sentidos diferentes que atrás do ouvido que o órgão físico existe um ouvido né poeticamente a gente tenta entender o que que é ouvido do ouvido é algo que está nas ciência daquele ouvido e que faz ouvido ouvir então ficar distinguindo que o órgão e a função EA função é o que o que faz funcionar o que é o que faz funcionar ouvido o olho do olho o que faz o ouvido a palavra das palavras o que faz a gente produzir as palavras a mente da mente EA vida da vida tá então ele vai seguindo nem assistindo no decorrer dos textos e aí ele já responde aqui nesse ouvido do ouvido o olho do olho a mente da mente o olho não vai nem as palavras né a mente então se eu tenho que meu olho físico né A minha mente e as palavras o poder racional que da minha mente ou seja manifestação da racionalidade da minha mente que são as palavras não dá para chegar nesse atrás de isso com a mente não com os ouvidos já tá introduzindo nessa problemática problemática como é que nós vamos entender e aí ele diz assim não conhecemos não podemos compreender como podemos então Oi Cal que isso é ele já tá colocando né já tá responda o aluno que é difícil explicar isso né que a gente tem que ir além das palavras e tentar entender um significado que não é aquele significado usual do que nos atribuídas né as coisas é perceptiveis né então a gente tem que buscar um algo mais abstrato mais Sutil a e então ele começa a responder da seguinte forma e eu acho que essa é a passagem mais interessante daquela o pano chato que mostra né todo o artifício dele é criatividade dele como mestre a a pedagogia que ele usa né como ele tem o domínio da loja das palavras ele utiliza isso pra ensinar E aí eu quero lembrar você sobre essa questão da ambiguidade como como a gente ver na nossa redação né nos nossos trabalhos de uma redação se você escreve um texto com antiguidade é um erro se escreve um artigo cheio de ambiguidades vai para um corretor não é um realizou para revisar o seu artigo antes da publicação que vai pegar uma caneta bem vermelha e vai marcar ali para você corrigir a minha cuidado aí você vai me perguntar mas como eu que orei vem para capacidade filosófica se der agora tô mostrando ambiguidade Mas ele não faz isso como eu já indiquei por aí ou por incompetência ele faz isso propositalmente como um recurso aí ele cria uma aporia nenhuma dificuldade na mente do aluno ele cria um problema para o aluno resolver porque se ele pegar onde um assunto desse tão difícil tão abstrato e escrever num quadro é com giz o pincel um esquininha o aluno vai entender aquilo ele vai decorar mas ele não vai assimilar Aquele monte suficiente para transformar numa praia então ele queria tudo uma dificuldade não é uma perplexidade na mente do leitor e que Force o leitor pensa assim mas como aí eu vou ler aqui o texto as ambiguidades eu vou começar ali né mas é assistência passagem aqui e na próxima então fica mais claro o que não pode ser expresso em palavras mas pelo qual as palavras são faladas saibam que somente isto é Brahma o espírito o e não o que as pessoas aqui adora então está dizendo assim que Deus não é aquele conceito que as pessoas constroem nem não está dizendo que Deus não existe não tô fazendo uma crítica nem uma religião nem uma construção de Deus tá dizendo assim que aquilo que as pessoas em tenha vem com a mente sobre o que seja Deus né seja em qual religião qual conceito não é aquilo que está a aquilo que está Além das Palavras então ele tá dizendo assim o que não pode ser expresso em palavras mas o que faz as palavras serão faladas somente isso a Brahma um espírito e o que não pode ser pensado com a mente é mas pelo qual a mente pode pensar saibam que somente isto é Brahma o espírito e não que as pessoas aqui adoro o que não pode ser visto com o olho Mas pelo qual o olho pode ver saibam que somente isto a Brahma no espírito e não que as pessoas aqui adoram o que não pode ser ouvido pelo ouvido mas pelo qual o ouvido pode ouvir saibam que somente isto é Brahma o espírito e não que as pessoas aqui é não se repete mais ou menos o que já foi dito Aí ele diz assim se você pensa eu conheço bem bacana então certamente Você conhece tão somente um pouco de sua natureza Você conhece apenas sua natureza condicionada pelo homem ou pelos Deuses ou seja se você disse que conhece como você usa o sentido da palavra conhecer que a conhecer com a mente então você não conhece que aqui o brownie está além do pode ser conhecido pela mente Você só conhece um pouco que a sua manifestação externa daquela do espelho portanto Brahma mesmo agora é digno de sua investigação e aqui então vem essa passagem que eu considero a mais interessante que é se vai encontrar nos livros desde filosofia verdant né E se está escrito com o paradoxo da inescrutabilidade dobro não seja o paradoxo é que sobre a impossibilidade de investigar O que é branco é aquele pelo qual Brahma não é conhecido o conhece mas aquele pelo qual ele é conhecido Não o conhece ele não é conhecido por aqueles que eu conhecem e ele é conhecido por aqueles que não conhecem então aqui não chegando nesse ponto que o previamente anunciei é aqui é esse paradoxo que vai deixar a mente do discípulo perplexo que ele vai olhar Como assim aquele pelo qual Bruna não é conhecido ou conhece e é aquele pelo qual ele é conhecido não conhece e ele não é conhecido por aqueles que eu conhece ele é conhecido por aqueles que não o conhecem você já ficou completamente confuso pedir né Aí você vai dizer não porque ele não sabe escrever Claro que ele sabe ele faz isso de propósito então o que que é um paradoxo é uma contradição hoje que normalmente né mas já é uma uma ideia lá escute depois Sofia beleza significado qualquer coisa fora da doxa ou seja qualquer coisa que se entendia quem faz a sentindo né Qualquer coisa fora do bom senso uma coisa absurda né mas em geral se trata né sim se usa para se referir uma contradição e aqui então aparentemente há uma contradição porque se a gente vai ver aquele pelo qual e não é conhecido o conhece assim então aquele que não conhece conhece E aí como é que você vai isso então que aquele que não conhece conhece como tratou só que na verdade é uma aparente um paradoxo aparente ou falso para doc não é um paradoxo porque ele constrói essa contradição aparente com base na ambiguidade dos termos por isso que eu já falei lá que lá no segundo na Segunda passagem que eu comentei com ele fala assim o vidro do ouvido a mente da mente Ele já tá dando uma pista né para pessoa ver aqui uma palavra pode ser usado em dois sentidos bom então ouvido do ouvido e nem da mente a pessoa consegue mais ou menos perceber que ali tem um ouvido que a concreto Mas tem uma coisa mais Sutil chama de ouvido que tá atrás daquele o vídeo concreto em relação à mente as palavras também então ele faz isso né ele não pega o aluno totalmente susto ou não já foi preparado é para ele perceber isso E aí o alo não vai se ele enfrentar esse paradoxo ele vai se sentir desafiado vai ter que entender né não vai ter sono não vai dormir não vai decorar uma forma é a então aqui como a gente não pode ficar né dias ou mês mesmo tempo tentando entender esse paradoxo então tive que trazer um esquema uma solução para esse paradoxo é para a gente entender né resolver essa ambiguidade e procurar entender melhor os conceitos bom então para é antes de entrar se Nossa minha proposta de solução e eu vou fazer uma uma distinção utilizar um outro conceito ou dois conceitos na verdade que não é da filosofia da sopa chás eu vou usar os conceitos da filosofia aristotélica que não tem nada a ver com hinduísmo nada a ver com as pane chás Mas vamos usar a distinção de Aristóteles como um trampolim entender um conceito básico e fácil de uma maneira simples para depois aplicar né assim contexto mais difícil que é da Azul panics então isso aqui eu vou chamar de trampolim de olhos todos tá então Aristóteles faz uma distinção entre razão e intuição que é bastante didático e ele disse que existe uma diferença entre aprender diretamente uma coisa que se chama apreensão imediata ou direta a missão que se distingue de da operação racional da mente então como é isso trouxe aqui não vou dar uma aula completa sobre esse assunto é bastante aprofundar apenas um esquema muito básico para servir de trampolim para os nossos interesses o Stories tóteles Diz que para termos simples o coisa simples já vou dizer o que que é isso incluir é tem um contato e ignorar é não ter contato o que que é um termo sempre eu vou usar um exemplo que Aristóteles adoro usar que é branco ele gosta de falar da cor fala muito a bola é branca quando eu quando eu eu penso branco ou eu tenho a imagem de branco na minha mente o eu não tenho então a gente tem que entender como se formar né como acontece a intuição de coisa assim você vê uma criança pequena um bebê ela tem uma intuição do que seja Leite ela ela tem uma intuição por contato direto com aquele leite que passa pelos sentidos passa pelos olhos e agora vejo nas o pano estado não vai É mas aqui no trampolim Sim passa pelos olhos passa pelo Paladar passa pelo olfato e passa pela visão a sensação Mas tem uma fome e aí depois vem o leite então na mente dela se forma uma imagem daquele leite e isso é uma coisa simples isso que é o que um contato ou aquilo aquela imagem entrar na mente dela ou não entra não tem complexidade nenhuma por isso que ele diz assim ou você tem o contato com aquele branco ou então você nunca viu branco e aí por mais que uma pessoa Fale para vocês o Flick quer branca uma curta vai pegar no dicionário enciclopédico você não vai ter a intuição do que a branco então um nome Leite só veio muitos meses depois a criança tem intenção do leite mas ela não sabe o que que você chama leite então palavra vem depois que ela associa que ela a palavra aquela intuição isso é assim ó e agora quando nós vamos para a lente Já estamos no que se chama de composição de termos então aí começa a operar a razão discursiva logo se para quem até hoje com isso também ficar muito fácil de entender porque a gente sabe que logo se né se refere essa parte aumentar onde tem as foto daí para baixo então a razão aqui conecta os termos simples quando ela faz essa composição então nós estamos no ano entramos já no âmbito da razão então se eu se eu digo assim o leite é burro eu não estou mais na intuição o meu contato direto eu já tenho eu já tenho uma operação racional eu tenho um termo chama leite e outro que se chama morno Então são duas coisas que eu sumo é uma eu sou uma parede cação e aqui dentro dessa história da razão que a gente tem aquilo que se chama a verdade ou falsidade se eu digo assim o leite é morno e seu leite tá gelado então ficou é falsa mas se o leite eu digo leite é burro você está no outro é verdadeiro mas quando você pensa no Diga a palavra sim você pensa leite não pode ser verdadeiro falso certo errado você ou já tomou o leite já já tem aquele um lançamento que ele registro do que é ler ou você não tem então ele diz assim na intuição ter contato em né intuir é ter contato e não ter contato ignorar você não é que a pessoa nunca provou uma fruta ela não tem aquela questão da fruta e nunca vai ter por mais que as palavras de enfrentam descrever a fruta parecida com laranja e também mas também a parecido com mãe nunca vai ter Então dessa maneira aqui simples né o do mais facilitada de Aristóteles a gente entende que esse conhecimento racional ou seja de combinar palavras mim jamais vai dar para pessoa a intuição é daquela coisa porque aquela impressão é direta não é por meio de palavras tá só que aqui no trampolim para Aristóteles a gente ainda está dentro do mundo dos Sentidos dos cinco sentidos Então você veja bem e lá no nos primeiros trechos da que meu pai deixado Ele já falou que aí a já colocou na pergunta que eu não já falei já está Key Ele já falou que isso está além dos Sentidos e ele ainda mente né então por isso que o exemplo de utilização de Aristóteles só servir como trampolim porque ela ainda tá dentro do sentido mas ele já consegue explicar para gente que está o que quer intuição mesmo dentro dos Sentidos está Além da Razão né E como nesse mundo de Aristóteles que é o nosso mundo que é o mundo da experiência ordinária um exemplo aqui todo mundo consegue entender porque todo mundo sabe né o que que é sente mim experimentar uma experimentar o leite todo mundo sabe isso então não é uma dificuldade agora feita essa distinção aqui a gente volta então para quem não põe em casa utilizando esse essa depressão de Aristóteles como trampolim e levando Então esse atendimento facilitado para aquele mundo de lado que está lentamente aqui então como eu falei para vocês eu fiz um uma solução representem uma solução resolver a ambiguidade desses termos então eu substituí né a palavra conhecer em um sentido pela palavra incluir né usando o trampolim ou seja existe uma coisa que é descrever o que é o leite Ah e outra coisa é sentir o gosto Leite teu aquele gosto na mente a então isso aqui nós vamos transferir para esse texto esse aparente paradoxo das o pane chás e vamos ver como é que fica aquele pelo qual Brahma não é conhecido o intuito i.a. mas aquele pelo qual ele é incluído não conhece ele não é conhecido por aqueles que o intuito i.a. ele é incluído por aqueles que não conhece assim já fica mais fácil porque eu usei uma palavra diferente porque na verdade vai dar é diferente mas ele usou a mesma palavra de propósito E aí como um recurso facilitador eu coloquei ainda entre parentes o número do princípio que a gente viu lá no início da palestra que é o quinto princípio 5 aqui que é a mente e o bullying e a intenção espiritual como sexto então fica muito fácil de entender porque ele diz assim ou você tá lá arrasando quinto se você é o tá embaixo do telhado ou você tá na intuição que acima da razão no sexto em cima do telhado no andar de cima eu não tenho Paradox nenhum é só você utilizar o tempo correto e aquele então que conhece esse ou seja está racionalizando está usando as palavras não está incluindo não está incluindo porque para ele estar em tô indo ele não pode estar racionalizando que são duas funções distintas ou está fazendo uma ou está fazendo outro né Por mais que a gente sabe que nos seres muito avançados eles conseguem fazer essas coisas mais ou menos é ao mesmo tempo como aparece para nós né mas aqui no nosso aprendizado são duas funções distintas e não são concomitantes então ele é incluído por aqueles que não conhece ou seja por aqueles que não estão operando no nível da lesão bom então ele tá forçando a razão do discípulo a entender essas coisas então não existe paradoxo agora você vai me perguntar sim e se você pensou isso vou ficar feliz porque você é inteligente você se você pensou assim não mas você resolveu ambiguidade semântica você resolveu o problema das palavras mas ainda sim existe não existe uma contradição entre falar porque você vê que esse texto é uma fala e escrita né é uma atividade 100% racional e intelectual Como já eu olhei filosofia Como assim você fala para dizer que então tem um lugar que tá falando entra Então você fala para não falar você fala para o para promover a não fala né E isso você pensou isso é porque você é inteligente porque é exatamente isso é isso que ele quer o que o aluno entenda e você se você pensa nossa mas que coisa estranha que absurdo não é e vou dar um exemplo para você você mergulhar numa piscina quando você mergulha você mergulha de pulmões vazios ou fumante é isso e se você nunca nem pensou eu tenho certeza de que você instintivamente antes de mergulhar vai em feltro já ó e vai mergulhar Então você a respira para não respirar não é assim se você respira para não respirar não é absurdo pensar que você pensa para não pensar né porque você está se preparando é para fazer uma outra atividade então no corpo você no corpo você prepara a sua respiração para que ela consiga ficar suspensa para você desempenhar ou assertividade e na sua mente você Prepara sua mente é pensando para que você consiga parar de pensar Ah entendi então como isso não é uma coisa assim tá na áudio você entender ele precisa criar toda essa dificuldade né Para que o aluno Então seja inteligente para conseguir resolver é isso entender e essa prática Então vai vai exigir essa prática de como mergulho trancar a respiração e mergulhar vai exigir um grande preparo físico e aqui então para preparar a mente para aquela parte pensar vai exigir um grande preparo mental uma grande inteligência e uma grande energia então por isso que ele precisa criar todo esse desafio né todo esse paradoxo Oi e aí ele diz mais uma vez quebrando não chega ao pensamento seja o quinto princípio daqueles que eu conhecem como além do pensamento ou seja o sexto ou sétimo princípio E não aqueles que imagina o que ele pode ser alcançado pelo pensamento né então aquele que pensa assim que se trata de conhecer ou não conhecer como você vai fazer uma prova a esse assunto eu aquela questão eu sabia responder é assim você amassar outra questão eu não sabia responder não sei então aquele como ele disse anteriormente que que não sabe nem que sabe ou não sabe esse não conhece eu quero que ele tá dentro dessa merda essa parte mental a atividade da razão bom então aqui ele repete isso não é a não é aqueles que imaginam que que ele pode ser alcançado pelo pensamento não conhece Bruno não Bruna é desconhecido ao erudito e conhecido pelo simples tá então aqui ele não está dizendo Veja bem se vai dizer ai mas é uma contradição Então porque você falou que ele tá é um erudito é um erudito mas ele tá como eu disse ele tá mostrando os limites da intenção e Então é ele toda atividade intelectual cinco erudita o cálculo de qualquer nível ou simples a tem que ser suspensa para se atingir esse outro estado e ele diz então que brama ele é conhecido pelo simples e os simples aqui não é aquele aquela pessoa simples que usa roupa rasgada chinelo de dedo não é simples nesse tido que a gente chama culturalmente né no sentido cultural a pessoa o Lucas que a gente chegou humilde aqui não há que significa sim a simplicidade mental Ou seja a ausência a suspensão dessa atividade racional sim como mergulhador vai suspender a sua respiração para entrar então no outro mundo é como no mundo a aquático né embaixo da água então esse essa esse conhecimento de Brahma ele é um como um mergulho né o mergulho na as espiritualidade o mergulho além no mundo a que está além da mente e ele diz então por fim se último trecho que eu quero ficar aqui que Brahma é conhecido no Êxtase de um despertar que abre a porta da vida eterna como você ou temos poder e com a sabedoria ou temos a eternidade então ele disse que esse conhecimento né que que está além da mente que é o autoconhecimento ou conhecimento de Brahma o conhecimento de Deus né que Brahma Nesse contexto é Deus que seja Deus para gente ele é conhecido por esse Êxtase onde ele sai o o discípulo né o aspirante ele sai de sim ele sai dos limites dos seus cinco sentidos e ele sai dos limites da sua mente e esta significa sair né Então esse Êxtase abre a porta da vida eterna e seu tem poder seu esposo de Sabedoria né e Além da Eternidade então o que que significa isso abrir a porta tá vida eterna então a gente utiliza de novo o conhecimento é teu sócios sobre a evolução né que diz que o aperfeiçoamento do ser humano à Vida é uma escola uma incubadora de almas aqui a gente está se desenvolvendo e como vocês viram e são sete princípios a gente tá a maioria está desenvolvendo quinta razão mas aquele que desenvolveu o sétimo né todos eles até o quarto quinto o sexto despertou isso né o 7 ele já é formado na escola de vidro é comum graduado não precisa mais frequentar a escola então já quem despertou esse sexto ou sétimo quem conheceu ácido não precisa mais encarar que o que que ele vai fazer aqui né ele já tá pronto na evolução humana já terminou o diploma vai com vai prosseguir essa evolução de outra forma ajuda dos que ainda também vou são né o seguindo em outros em outros caminhos né de desenvolvimento Então esse é o despertar né o a pressão da libertação é a kaiva olha no yoga moxoro vedanta Nirvana budismo quem já atingiu essa aperfeiçoou pode seguir em frente então eu trouxe aqui de novo um velho conhecido o texto para usar como exemplo do paramahamsa Yogananda só que hoje eu não vou citar o texto inteiro que você já estão assim um pouco cansados de ler eu vou citar só uma parte né que ilustra essa explicação que eu dei né e acrescenta mais uma ideia da simples que eu vou explicar agora então aquela experiência do esta sede paramahamsa Yogananda eu só separei dois pedacinhos pequenos ele diz meu corpo tornou-se imóvel como se tivesse raízes o alento saiu de meus pulmões como seu Imar enorme eu extraísse instantaneamente o espírito EA mente e eram Consul e escravidão ao físico e jorrarão de cada um dos meus poros como luz perfurante e fluida e a carne parecia morta e com tudo em minha intensa Lucidez eu percebia que nunca antes estivera tão plenamente vivo meu senso de identidade já não se achava confinado às 33 é de um corpo mas abarcava os átomos circuncirculo um circundantes tá essa parte final que eu que eu quero destacar o senso de identidade dele não era seu corpo dele então o autoconhecimento quem sou eu né o cosmo inteiro suavemente luminoso semelhante ou na cidade vista de alguma distância noite senti lava dentro da infinidade do meu Olha só que Maravilhoso né Eu acho isso brilhantes emocionante então o cosmo inteiro era ele então por isso eu disse quem conhece assim conhece Bruno que lá nesse princípio além da mente vende todos os veículos além do Confisco e não tem mais essas divisões comum tem aqui nessa na mundo das formas né Então existe um senso de eu é o que que é o quem sou eu Qual é o erro que como eu real que existe existe um eu só que esse eu não é um eu separado das outras coisas então ele conhece o eu ir dentro desse senso de eu que ele tem existe o cosmo inteiro que tá falando aqui né Então esse é o conhecimento o conhecimento alto conhecimento o conhecimento de atma ou conhecimento de que ela se torne Chaves falam então aqui a gente vê uma descrição de uma experiência que a que a vedhanta vai tô monista chama de conhecimento não do ao conhecimento não do aoa isso vocês veem eu troquei a palavra conhecimento por intuição para não dar essa confusão né mas se você o conhecimento Então você tem que dizer não conhecimento não-dual não do ao por quê que não existe sujeito e objeto quando nós conhecemos aqui no plano da Razão no mundo manifestado a gente diz assim eu vejo a câmera Então aqui tem eu que tenho a câmera mas aqui nessa experiência dele não tem eu e a Câmera existe só um ser que é ele e todas as coisas dentro então aqui nessa experiência resposta o simular na imaginando mais experiência não do ao eu disse assim eu sou a câmera é porque eu sou todas as coisas então esse essa é a perfeição né da evolução humana e vocês veem reparem que E como foi colocado Aqui arrasou é um limite para entrar nesse estado você precisa da razão para viver aqui qualquer ser iluminado vai chegar aqui no mundo falando com as pessoas com a razão mas ele não tem só razão ele tem outro princípio de perto também então a razão que a razão não alcança esse estado né mas quem alcança este estado tem a sua razão aperfeiçoada melhorada por quê Porque esse estado de unidade ele além de um Recife um conhecimento por daí se tem a ideia de onisciência Porque no momento que ele se funde com todos os objetos ele consegue perceber que nos objetos por dentro tem uma outra passa um pedaço dessa passagem que eu não sei aqui que ele disse que ele sentia a seiva das Árvores de dentro das armas por quê Porque ele estava dentro das Árvores então além de possibilitar uma onisciência nesse nível aqui de conhecimento não do ao que não eu conhecimento racional ele ainda aperfeiçoa o quem precisa o veículo da Razão removendo-os entradas da razão que é o senso de separatividade é que quando a gente fala a gente falou sobre as guerras né que o ser humano faz guerras Ele ainda está muito identificado como reino animal ele faz a guerra porque ele pensa assim não eu estou aqui e o meu inimigo está ali na frente então eu vou Natal inimigo Mas ele tem uma razão ali funcionado é um princípio racional mas ele tá tudo errado é para todo torto ele para tudo prejudicado então aquele que tem essa experiência do sexto sétimo e ele vai ter a sua razão é funcionando corretamente porque essas emoções de agressividade elas não vão atrapalhar o funcionamento da razão e aí ele vai ver como ele sente que não existe algo separado dele não vai querer destruir então ele mais do que os outros ele vai ter uma razão peça um conhecimento correto né mas razão funcionando muito bem e aí ele vai afirmar seguramente que a guerra uma ao destruiu a natureza é uma ao que não se deve destruir a natureza ele vai perceber essas coisas com clareza vai ter razão é toda forma de violência e Destruição é o mal então não é uma exclusão da Razão nenhum merecimento da razão mas é um aperfeiçoamento de uma outra parte que inclusive aperfeiçoa essa atividade o racional então é essa minha contribuição de hoje né creio que serve como uma base de reflexão e para o outro conhecimento né conhecimento de todos nós do ser humano","completion":"1.

Introdução e contextualização da evolução da consciência segundo as doutrinas teosóficas: Conforme abordado nas doutrinas teosóficas, todo ser vive um processo evolutivo da consciência, iniciando seu trajeto pelo plano físico e evoluindo por meio de diferentes reinos da natureza. Este ciclo começa no reino mineral, avança pelos vegetal e animal, e chega ao reino humano. Os seres humanos encontram-se atualmente nessa fase de evolução, onde o principal objetivo é despertar o quinto princípio, ou mente. É imprescindível recordar que, nesse percurso, a consciência, ou mônada, é constantemente despertada e estimulada através de suas experiências e interações com o mundo.

Comentários sobre o instinto de posse no reino animal versus a razão no ser humano: - Discute-se a distinção entre o comportamento instintivo dos animais, particularmente o instinto de posse e defesa do território, e o comportar-se humano guiado pela razão. - Destaca-se que os animais agem movidos por instintos, os quais compreendem a luta por território e a manifestação do desejo de posse, que podem levar à confrontação violenta quando são ameaçados. - Os animais são incapazes de refrear impulsos violentos, pois estão limitados aos meios físicos (garras, dentes) sem recorrer ao pensamento estratégico ou moral. - Em contrapartida, o ser humano, que também é parte animal, possui a capacidade racional que lhe permite produzir ferramentas e armas, potencializando, infelizmente, a capacidade de destruição. - Nessa discussão, aponta-se como a razão humana, uma vez ainda imatura e a serviço dos instintos animais, pode contribuir para guerras e destruição em maior escala. - Enfatiza-se o potencial evolutivo do ser humano em desenvolver uma razão que transcenda os impulsos animais, promovendo o bem comum e a harmonia, ao invés de agir sob influência de desejos egoístas e destrutivos."},{"prompt":"6","completion":"6.

Patricia Teixeira Nunes Leite Secretária de Educação de Iperó Assunto: Solicitação para revisão do fornecimento de alimentos na cantina da Escola Municipal Cecy Monteiro Oetterer Prezada Sra. Patricia Teixeira Nunes Leite, Permita-me, primeiramente, parabenizá-la pelo excelente trabalho à frente da Secretaria de Educação de Iperó. As iniciativas desta gestão, como a distribuição de kits escolares a todos os alunos do município e o reconhecimento estadual com o prêmio “Município Destaque no Crescimento da Alfabetização”, são a prova do comprometimento com a melhoria contínua da qualidade de ensino ofertado às nossas crianças. Tais esforços são não só louváveis como também inspiradores. No entanto, venho por meio desta, enquanto pai do aluno Heitor Davi Sobral Piantoni, matriculado no 5º ano da Escola Municipal Cecy Monteiro Oetterer, expor uma preocupação relacionada ao ambiente escolar que afeta diretamente a saúde e o bem-estar dos estudantes. Refiro-me à oferta de doces e produtos altamente calóricos pela cantina da instituição. É de nosso conhecimento que, entre os alunos, existe um grupo heterogêneo, compreendendo crianças diabéticas, com restrições alimentares, quadros de obesidade e condições especiais que impossibilitam o consumo de tais alimentos. Diante deste cenário, é inevitável reconhecer que a manutenção de uma cantina que oferece produtos nocivos à saúde da nossa comunidade estudantil pode resultar em consequências prejudiciais não só para esses alunos especificamente. Como respaldo para essa solicitação, invoco as diretrizes da Lei nº [inserir número], conhecida como [inserir nome da lei], de autoria de [inserir nome do autor da lei], que [descrever brevemente os pontos mais relevantes da lei no contexto dessa solicitação]. Tal legislação tem como um de seus pressupostos o fomento de uma alimentação adequada e saudável no ambiente escolar. Ademais, a questão transcende o bem-estar físico das crianças e jovens, refletindo também no aspecto psicológico. Alunos que não dispõem de recursos financeiros para adquirir tais produtos podem experienciar sentimentos de privação e exclusão ao observarem seus colegas consumindo-os. Confio na sensibilidade e na perspicácia de Vossa Senhoria para avaliar a relevância desta questão e considerar a tomada de medidas pertinentes a fim de substituir a oferta atual da cantina por alternativas mais saudáveis e inclusivas. Tal mudança beneficiará amplamente o coletivo estudantil, alinhando-se aos valores de uma educação que visa o pleno desenvolvimento do ser humano. Agradeço antecipadamente por sua atenção e fico à disposição para discutir esta questão mais detalhadamente, se necessário. Confio plenamente na sua compreensão e em seu compromisso com a promoção da saúde e do bem-estar dos estudantes do município de Iperó.

Parágrafo Único. Os sistemas de ensino desenvolverão campanhas de esclarecimento e estabelecerão as normas para o cumprimento desta Lei no âmbito de suas respectivas redes de estabelecimentos de ensino. Art.2º. Esta lei entra em vigor na data de sua publicação. JUSTIFICAÇÃO É de amplo conhecimento da população e dos especialistas dois novos fatos que afetam nossas crianças e adolescentes: significativo aumento da taxa de obesidade infantil e juvenil, com conseqüente incidência de doenças com diabetes e hipertensão, outrora típica de idades mais avançadas; e aumento da ocorrência de cáries e disfunções do aparelho gastrointestinal. 2 Uma das causas mais evidentes desta indesejável situação é a mudança dos padrões alimentares e de recreação das populações jovens. O consumo de guloseimas, refrigerantes, frituras e outros produtos calóricos não nutritivos, preparados com conservantes, tem sido apontado como um fator diretamente responsável pelas doenças precoces e outras insuficiências enfrentadas pela população infanto-juvenil. Além disso, por causa da insegurança e por falta de alternativas, muitas crianças e jovens deixaram de brincar e praticar esportes nas ruas e locais públicos, também com graves conseqüências para a sua saúde. Diante deste quadro, a escola não pode se eximir e se isentar de responsabilidade. Pelo menos durante o tempo em que estão na escola, nossas crianças e jovens devem estar livres da pressão e tentação de consumo de produtos inadequados ao seu desenvolvimento saudável. O que precisam é ser motivados e estimulados a consumir outros produtos, mais naturais e mais saudáveis, num amplo e sistemático processo de reeducação alimentar. As redes de ensino e cada escola, como parte de sua missão de formação geral do aluno, devem desenvolver atividades para mobilização e conscientização dos alunos em favor de sua saúde. Devem, também, estabelecer as normas para que as cantinas escolares cumpram seu papel educativo e não sejam apenas estabelecimentos comerciais que se beneficiam do monopólio que possuem de vender o que quiserem a uma clientela passiva, inexperiente e sem alternativas. Cabe destacar que já existem muitas iniciativas de Estados e Municípios nesta mesma direção. Uma norma federal estabelecendo diretrizes terá o papel de reforçar todos aqueles que já estão imbuídos deste objetivo e servirá de estímulo àqueles que ainda não tiveram condições de empreender esta urgente tarefa de zelar pelo desenvolvimento saudável da juventude. Diante do exposto, conto com o inestimável apoio dos senhores e senhoras Parlamentares para a aprovação desta proposta, que é de baixo custo em sua implementação, mas de grande relevância e impacto na qualidade de vida atual e futura da população de nosso País.

Palácio dos Bandeirantes, 11 de março de 2021 JOÃO DORIA Rossieli Soares da Silva Secretário da Educação Jean Carlo Gorinchteyn Secretário da Saúde Antonio Carlos Rizeque Malufe Secretário Executivo, respondendo pelo expediente da Casa Civil Publicada na Assessoria Técnica da Casa Civil, em 11 de março de 2021. 1/2 Comissão aprova proibição de alimentos calóricos em escola camara.leg.br/noticias/101919-comissao-aprova-proibicao-de-alimentos-caloricos-em-escola/ 22/06/2007 - 10:07 A Comissão de Seguridade Social e Família aprovou na última quarta-feira (20) substitutivo do deputado Pepe Vargas (PT-RS) ao Projeto de Lei 6848/02, que proíbe a venda e a propaganda de alimentos considerados não saudáveis (como frituras, doces e bebidas calóricas) em escolas, públicas e privadas, de ensino infantil, fundamental e médio; e outras cinco propostas que tramitam apensadas (PLs 2510/03, 6168/05, 6890/06, 451/07 e 763/07). Conforme o texto, as escolas ou comerciantes que infringirem esse dispositivo ficam sujeitos às penalidades da Lei 6.437/77 - aplicação de multa, interdição e até cassação do alvará de funcionamento. O projeto original estabelecia apenas a proibição e delegava aos sistemas de ensino a definição das normas para o cumprimento da lei. O substitutivo do deputado Pepe Vargas prevê que a medida será aplicada de acordo com as normas já estabelecidas pelas autoridades sanitárias. O texto do relator também prevê que a relação de alimentos não-saudáveis será definida pelos órgãos de vigilância sanitária. O substitutivo também estende a medida aos ambulantes instalados nas cercanias das escolas. O relator manteve a obrigatoriedade dos sistemas de ensino oferecerem programas de formação e atualização sobre alimentação saudável para os professores e alunos, mas prevê também ações para envolver as famílias dos estudantes. No caso das cantinas que atendam apenas estudantes de ensino médio, o substitutivo concede um prazo de três anos para o estabelecimento se adaptar à lei. 2/2 Medida urgente Pepe Vargas considera a medida urgente, pois, em sua avaliação, a obesidade atualmente já se equipara à desnutrição no número de casos e nos problemas causados em crianças e jovens. Ele lembra que a Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) estima em 1 bilhão o número de obesos no planeta. Ele argumenta que medidas contra alimentos não saudáveis em escolas já são adotadas por vários países e em alguns estados brasileiros como Santa Catarina, Paraná e Rio de Janeiro e no Distrito Federal. O relator ainda lembra que o próprio Ministério da Educação, por meio do Programa de Alimentação Escolar, já determina às escolas a oferta de alimentação equilibrada e a orientação para a adoção hábitos alimentares saudáveis. O programa recomenda às escolas a proibição da comercialização de refrigerantes, refrescos artificiais, xaropes e bebidas isotônicas, frituras de um modo geral, biscoitos recheados e salgados tipo aperitivo, embutidos, balas, caramelos, gomas de mascar, pirulitos e assemelhados, além de coberturas doces e molhos industrializados. Tramitação A proposta, que tramita em caráter conclusivo, ainda será analisada pelas comissões de Educação e Cultura e Constituição e Justiça e de Cidadania.
