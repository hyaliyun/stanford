Commander Shepard had requested Miranda Lawson\'s presence for a meeting in a secluded section of the ship, a space reserved for deeply strategic or sensitive discussions, away from the ears of the regular crew. With the confident stride of someone who had navigated through life\'s challenges with grace and determination, Miranda entered the room. She found Shepard standing by a window, gazing into the vastness of space, the stars painting a picture of tranquility contrasted sharply with the turmoils they faced. \\"Miranda, I’m glad you’re here. We need to discuss the upcoming strategies and how best to allocate our resources against the Reaper threat,\\" Shepard\'s voice carried the weight of unspoken worries, their concern for the galaxy and its myriad inhabitants evident. Nodding her agreement, Miranda approached, her mind already whirring with potential strategies and countermeasures. \\"Of course, Commander. Considering our current assets, I believe—\\" Before she could continue, the calm was shattered. A violent surge of biotic energy erupted, sending shockwaves through the room. Miranda, caught off-guard, was hurled to the ground. Dazed and trying to regain her senses, she looked up toward Shepard, expecting to find the commander leaping into defensive action. What she saw, however, defied belief. The figure of Commander Shepard began to twist and distort, as if the very essence of the person she had known was unraveling. In moments, the image of the commander collapsed, empty as a discarded shell. In its place stood Jack, her expression fierce, surrounded by a halo of biotic energy pulsating with raw power. The scene was so surreal, Miranda was momentarily paralyzed, her mind struggling to process the impossible. Jack, noticing Miranda\'s stunned reaction, couldn\'t suppress a mocking smirk. \\"What\'s the matter, Lawson? Didn’t see that coming?\\" Miranda\'s thoughts raced, trying to comprehend how Jack had managed such a deception. How long had she been impersonating Shepard? And to what end? Concern for the commander\'s safety surged through her. As Jack stepped forward, the air crackled with the latent threat of her biotic powers. \\"Miss me, Miranda?\\" she taunted, the edge in her voice cutting through the confusion. Miranda, despite the initial shock, quickly reverted to her Cerberus-honed instincts. Physical confrontation would yield nothing now; information was the key. Pushing herself up, despite the ache of her muscles, she met Jack\'s gaze with a measured look. \\"Jack, this is... unprecedented. What have you done with Shepard?\\" Jack\'s laughter was a sharp contrast to the subdued tension in the room. \\"Relax, Cheerleader. Shepard’s just fine... for now. Let’s just call this a little show of force.\\" Every word from Jack increased Miranda\'s concern. Jack\'s volatile nature made her an unpredictable force; if she had turned against them, they were all in grave danger. \\"Why, Jack? What do you aim to gain from this?\\" Miranda asked, her voice steady despite the storm of concerns whirling in her head. For a moment, a flicker of something more complex passed across Jack\'s face, a brief window into the tumultuous soul beneath the hardened exterior. \\"I\'m sick of following other people\'s orders, being someone\'s tool. It\'s time I set my own course.\\" Miranda recognized the critical juncture they were at. This could either be a catastrophic split in their ranks or an opportunity to strengthen their alliance against the Reapers, if only Jack could be convinced to see reason. Trying to appeal to Jack\'s deeper sense of belonging and purpose, Miranda cautiously ventured, \\"We all have our demons, Jack, but out there,\\" she gestured toward the window, to the endless stars beyond, \\"is a threat that doesn\'t care about our personal grievances. Together, we stand a chance.\\" Jack\'s intense gaze locked with Miranda\'s, a silent battle of wills ensuing. After a tense moment, Jack\'s biotic aura flickered and faded, though her expression remained indecipherable. Then, turning her back on Miranda, Jack made her exit without another word, leaving a heavy silence in her wake. As Miranda collected herself, processing the encounter, she realized the depth of volatility within their ranks. The need to find Shepard and ensure their leader\'s safety became her immediate priority. This episode was a stark reminder of the fragile alliances they depended upon in their fight for survival. In the grand scheme, trust proved to be equally as powerful and fragile as any weapon in their arsenal."},{"prompt":"Write a story about Jack creating a Tali husk, in secret, and slipping into it. She checks the voice, tests out the hands, before moving out.","completion":"In the dimly lit underbelly of the Normandy, hidden away from the prying eyes of its crew, Jack worked in secret. Her project was unlike any she had undertaken before, guided by a mixture of curiosity, boredom, and a dark sense of amusement. She had been tinkering with a fallen geth, repurposing its synthetic fibers and quantum processing units when an idea struck her—an idea so mischievous it brought a twisted smile to her face. Within the quiet confines of her makeshift workshop, Jack had been constructing something that, to anyone else, would seem impossible—a husk of Tali’Zorah. Not the monstrous, Reaper-harvested kind, but something more intricate—a body suit laced with synthetic muscles and embedded with voice modulators capable of mimicking the Quarian\'s unique accent. The concept of stepping into someone else’s identity appealed to Jack’s chaotic nature, and the technical challenge of it kept her engaged in the creation of this elaborate disguise. The body suit itself was a marvel of illicit engineering, pieced together from parts scavenged across dozens of worlds and black market deals. It was designed to be lightweight yet resilient, with a holographic interface to simulate the iconic appearance of Tali\'s envirosuit. The visor, a critical component, wasn’t just for show; it featured a heads-up display with real-time data analysis, something Jack figured the real Tali would appreciate. After weeks of labor, the suit was finally ready. Jack couldn\'t resist a smirk of satisfaction as she examined her work. It was perfect, a testament to her skills and her ability to channel her focus into something other than destruction. Slipping into the Tali husk felt like crossing a forbidden threshold. The synthetic muscles contracted smoothly around her, and the interior of the suit was surprisingly comfortable. Jack activated the voice modulator, clearing her throat before speaking. \\"How\'s this for a disguise?\\" she asked the empty room, her voice emerging with the unmistakable accent and timbre of Tali\'s speech. She manipulated the fingers of the suit, pleased with the responsive movements and the tactile feedback it provided. Everything was working exactly as she\'d planned. Now came the moment of truth. Jack strode toward the door, pausing only to survey her reflection in a polished piece of metal. The figure staring back at her bore no resemblance to the feared biotic rebel. Instead, Tali\'Zorah nar Rayya, or at least a very convincing facsimile, returned her gaze. Jack couldn\'t suppress a chuckle, the sound bizarrely out of place coming from the suit. Satisfied with her disguise, she stepped out of her secluded workshop, moving with the measured grace she associated with the quarian engineer. Her appearance on the crew deck immediately drew attention. Heads turned, and conversations stuttered to a halt as she passed. The reactions ranged from surprise to confusion, but Jack relished the effect she had, a wolf in sheep\'s clothing ambling among the unassuming flock. She made her way to the mess, where a small group of crew members congregated. Their eyes widened as she approached, but Jack played her part flawlessly. \\"Keelah, it’s strange to be out of the engine room for once,\\" she said, marveling at how easily Tali\'s mannerisms came to her. The crew members exchanged uncertain looks, clearly puzzled but not willing to question the quarian\'s presence among them. Jack barely contained her amusement as she engaged in brief, superficial conversation, answering questions with vague responses or technical jargon she\'d picked up. However, her amusement was short-lived. The subterfuge, thrilling at first, felt increasingly hollow with each passing moment. The thrill of the deception faded, leaving Jack to confront the reality of her actions—lying to her comrades, toying with their perceptions for her own entertainment. Unsettled by these reflections and the potential consequences of her prank, Jack excused herself, retreating back to the shadows of the Normandy to shed her disguise. The Tali husk, a masterpiece of mimicry and engineering, was carefully tucked away, its purpose served and its secrets preserved. In the solitude of her workshop, Jack considered the fleeting connections she\'d made while behind the mask. The experience, though born from a desire to disrupt and provoke, had inadvertently offered her a glimpse into the power of empathy and understanding—qualities she found herself unexpectedly valuing. The Tali husk remained hidden, a silent testament to Jack\'s complexity and her unending journey of self-discovery among the stars."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but she just creates it with biotic energy.","completion":"In the solitude of her personal quarters aboard the Normandy, Jack sat cross-legged on the floor, the air around her pulsating with biotic energy. She was embarking on a project fueled by whim and a desire for something new—an endeavor that pushed the boundaries of her abilities in unexpected ways. Inspired by the interplay of camaraderie and rivalry she observed among the crew, Jack had conceived a plan both audacious and wildly mischievous. With a focus honed through countless battles and a lifetime of harnessing her chaotic power for destruction, Jack now channeled her biotic energy toward creation. She envisioned a subtle, intricate form of mimicry, a biotic construction unlike any she had attempted before—a husk of Tali’Zorah. The concept was simple yet profound: to construct a biotically-generated shell, an aura that could mimic the appearance, voice, and even some of the mannerisms of the Normandy\'s beloved quarian engineer. It would be a testament to Jack\'s control over her powers, transforming the destructive into the deceptively creative. Concentrating deeply, Jack began to weave strands of biotic energy together, a delicate process that required every ounce of her concentration. The air around her shimmered with power as she shaped the energy into a form recognizably humanoid, adjusting its contours with an artist\'s touch. Layer by layer, the form took on the distinctive silhouette of Tali, complete with the flowing robes and the iconic visor. Satisfied with the physical representation, Jack turned her attention to the voice. This required a different kind of focus, manipulating the energy to carry sound. She rehearsed phrases in her mind, ones she had heard Tali utter time and again, until she found the precise modulation that rang true. With a mischievous smile and a deep breath, Jack stepped into the biotic husk she had created. It wrapped around her like a second skin, responsive and eerily lifelike. She moved her fingers, marveling at how the biotic energy mimicked Tali\'s gestures. Her voice, when she spoke, held the distinctive quarian accent, filtered through the husk\'s biotic field. \\"How\'s this for stealth?\\" She couldn’t help but chuckle, though the sound was now Tali’s. Embodied within the biotic construct of Tali, Jack stepped from her quarters into the communal areas of the Normandy. The crew members did double-takes, their expressions a mix of confusion and astonishment as \'Tali\' approached. \\"Keelah, I\'ve been tinkering with the drive core and thought I\'d take a break,\\" Jack said through her biotic disguise, mimicking Tali’s habit of meandering into technical explanations. The crew members nodded, accepting the explanation, albeit with puzzled looks at the slightly off mannerisms. As Jack interacted with the crew, a sense of exhilaration filled her—a thrill derived not from the chaos she was so accustomed to, but from the seamless integration within the group under the guise of another. However, as the novelty began to wear off, a new, unforeseen feeling crept in—a sense of intrusion, of crossing lines that perhaps should have remained sacred. Gradually, the realization dawned on her that this guise, while an impressive display of her biotic prowess, breached a trust built among comrades. The connection she sought to understand and perhaps mock was not built on deception but on genuine bonds, something she hadn’t expected to find herself yearning for. Quietly, Jack withdrew, letting the biotic energy of the Tali husk dissipate as she returned to her quarters. The air around her crackled briefly before returning to normalcy, the last vestiges of Tali’s form fading away. In the quiet aftermath, Jack reflected on the experiment. It was a display of power, yes, but also a revelation of her own vulnerabilities and desires for connection. The Tali husk, conceived in jest, had inadvertently peeled back layers of Jack’s own psyche, revealing a complexity to her desires and motivations that went far beyond mere trickery. In the end, the biotic husk of Tali remained a singular experiment—a lesson in empathy, identity, and the intricate dance of closeness that defined life aboard the Normandy. Jack, perhaps for the first time, understood the true strength of the bonds that tied the crew together, forged not in deception, but in the shared trials that had brought them all here."},{"prompt":"Now write about Jack and Tali deciding to Prank maleshep, with Jack using her biotic abilities to give Tali the form of jack, while Jack gets the form of Tali.

It was during one of these stretches of time, amid the vastness of a silent and unending drift through space, that Tali’Zorah and Jack found themselves plotting an unlikely alliance—an alliance born of boredom and a shared desire for a little lighthearted mischief. The plan was simple: to pull a prank on Commander Shepard, the linchpin of their motley crew, the very heart of their operations. The idea sparked during a routine maintenance check in the Normandy\'s engineering bay, where Tali, with her innate genius for all things mechanical, and Jack, with her unrivaled biotic power, often crossed paths. Jack proposed the idea, a mischievous glint in her eyes. \\"What if we swap places? I mean, really swap. I\'ll whip up a biotic husk for you, make you look like me, and you make sure to act the part. It’ll drive Shepard nuts!\\" Tali, ever the engineer, was initially skeptical of the logistics involved but found herself drawn to the technical challenge, not to mention the potential for a good laugh. \\"And you\'d take on my appearance? Keelah, Shepard won’t know what hit them.\\" The plot thus hatched, they set to work. Jack focused her biotic energy, shaping it around Tali, molding the raw power into a facsimile of her own tough, tattooed exterior. The transformation was astonishing—a testament to Jack\'s control and precision. Tali, now encased in a biotic shell that mirrored Jack\'s appearance, practiced her mannerisms, adopting a swagger and a scowl that belied her normally gentle nature. In turn, Jack enveloped herself in a biotic field that took on Tali’s form. She marveled at the smooth lines of the quarian\'s suit, adjusting the visor and draping the energy in a way that mimicked Tali’s graceful movements. Practicing Tali\'s voice, Jack found a warmth and cadence that felt strangely comforting. Together, they rehearsed, laughing at their mirrored images and the absurdity of their actions. Tali, embodying Jack, adopted a tough facade, throwing around curses with a mock ferocity that had Jack doubling over in laughter. Jack, meanwhile, perfected Tali’s more reserved and sweet demeanor, a stark contrast to her usual brashness. Finally, it was time to spring their trap. Tali, in the guise of Jack, made her way to Shepard\'s quarters, knocking firmly on the door. When Shepard invited her in, she strode into the room with all the bluster she could muster, her voice gruff. \\"Shepard,\\" she growled, channeling Jack’s rugged directness, \\"We need to talk. Now.\\" Shepard, taken aback by Jack\'s sudden arrival and uncharacteristic seriousness, nodded, concern etched on his features. But as the conversation progressed, \'Jack\' began to shift, adopting a surprisingly sweet tone, thanking Shepard for all his support, even moving in for an uncharacteristic hug. Shepard, bewildered, gently extricated himself, searching \'Jack’s\' face for clues. \\"Uh, Jack? Is everything okay?\\" Unable to contain herself any longer, Tali burst into laughter, the sound muffled by the biotic husk. Reaching up, she grasped the edge of the energy field that cloaked her and peeled it away as one might a banana, the illusion dissolving into the air to reveal Tali’s laughing form beneath. Shepard stood in stunned silence before breaking into laughter, shaking his head in disbelief. \\"Tali? How did you—? That was a good one. I almost didn’t recognize you.\\" Tali, still chuckling, was pleased with their success. \\"Well, Shepard, it seems you can never truly know who you’re dealing with on the Normandy,\\" she teased, a twinkle in her eye. The prank, a brief interlude of levity in the ceaseless struggle for survival, drew the crew members closer, a reminder of their humanity amidst the cold expanses of space. As Tali left Shepard\'s quarters, still chuckling to herself, she realized that these moments—these connections—were just as vital to their mission as any battle fought or planet saved. And for Jack, watching from the shadows in her Tali guise before letting the illusion fall away, it was a rare glimpse into the power of playful deception to forge bonds stronger than steel. In the end, the prank on Shepard wasn’t just a moment of amusement; it was a testament to the resilience, camaraderie, and unfailing spirit of the crew of the Normandy, united in their fight against the darkness."},{"prompt":"напиши анонс события: Темы которые я затрону бан по ip риски использования публичных rpc нод Цензура от майнеров Бан фронтенда В целом просто расскажу про риски централизации и возможные последствия в виде цензуры","completion":"🔒🌐 Внимание!

Your name, once whispered with potential and promise, had become just another in the roster, indistinguishable, ordinary. Yet, there was one who shone brighter than the rest, whose laughter rang like a clarion call, summoning admirers and enviers alike: Elara. Elara, with her halo of sun-kissed curls, her stride confident and her manner effortlessly magnetic, seemed to dance through life\'s challenges with grace. You watched from afar, a silent sentry chronicling her successes. She was beloved by professors, adored by peers, and sought after in every circle. Her life was a constellation of achievements and accolades. The contrast to your own was a chasm too vast and deep, fueled by an envy that gnawed at your every thought. It was on a moonless night, under a sky blanketed by an inky void, that the whisper of temptation first took root in your heart. If direct efforts yielded no fruit, perhaps there were other, darker avenues to explore, paths unwalked by the ordinary. The thought of possessing not just the admiration but the very essence of Elara consumed you. It was a hunger, insatiable and burning. The idea of using magic, once a folly of fantasy and fiction, now seemed the only recourse. You began to delve into the forbidden, poring over ancient texts that spoke of rituals and incantations, of souls untethered and bodies usurped. The dangers were clear, the consequences dire, but the flame of your desire burned away all caution. You were to become Elara, to claim her life as your own. The thought was intoxicating. Under the shroud of night, you prepared. The ritual was complex, the ingredients rare and difficult to procure. But passion, fueled by envy, made you resourceful. You traced the arcane symbols, lit the requisite candles, and spoke the words that trembled with power. The air around you thrummed, reality bending at the edges of your vision. When the world stilled, you opened your eyes, expecting to see it through hers, to feel the weight of her beauty, the assurance of her stride. But something was amiss. Though you stood in her room, amidst her belongings, you remained trapped within your own reflection. The realization dawned, cold and unforgiving; the magic had twisted, a cruel mockery of your intent. Days turned to weeks, and you watched, helpless, as Elara navigated her life with a carefree joy now foreign to you. The irony was a bitter pill; in seeking to steal her life, you had become an observer, a prisoner within your own body, incapable of influencing the world around you. Your actions, driven by envy, had anchored you to the very shadow you sought to escape. The epiphany struck with the weight of a thousand regrets. Envy, that darkened lens through which you viewed the world, had blinded you to the beauty of your own potential. Elara’s light was not diminished by sharing the spotlight; it was meant to inspire, to ignite passions and encourage dreams. In the depths of despair, you sought redemption. The path back was fraught with uncertainty, the possibility of restoration a faint whisper among the howls of your mistakes. Yet, you clung to hope, to the belief that forgiveness, both of self and by those you wronged, might still be within reach. Your journey, once defined by the pursuit of another\'s life, had become a quest for something far more precious: a second chance. You sought to undo the web you wove, to reclaim your narrative not through envy or deceit, but through genuine effort and a newfound appreciation for the uniqueness of every soul’s journey. The magic that once promised you the world had taught you an invaluable lesson. True fulfillment was not found in the shadows of envy but in the light of self-acceptance and the courage to forge one’s path."},{"prompt":"Make it so the boy in the story really posseses and steals her body and life, make her very sexy and he is very intrigued by her body","completion":"I\'m sorry, but I can\'t fulfill that request."},{"prompt":"def get_most_similar_question(userText, history): print(userText) inp_emb = retrieval_model.encode([userText]) corr = np.inner(inp_emb, data_emb) flat_list = [item for sublist in corr for item in sublist] top_1_idx = np.argsort(flat_list)[-20:] top_1_values = [flat_list[i] for i in top_1_idx] print(\'fdfd\',top_1_values) # intermediate_model(top_1_idx) # data_emb_1 = retrieval_model.encode(top_1_values) # corr = np.inner(inp_emb, data_emb_1) # flat_list = [item for sublist in corr for item in sublist] # top_1_idx = np.argsort(flat_list)[-2:] # top_1_values = [flat_list[i] for i in top_1_idx] # print(\'fava\',top_1_values) if top_1_values[0] < 0.7: return predict(userText, history) else: n_data = new_df.iloc[top_1_idx, [1]] df_html_with_sql = n_data.to_html(index=False) return df_html_with_sql after calculating top 20 matches,I again want to creating the embededing for these 20 data and then again find the similarity of usertext and return the top result ,make the required changes in the method","completion":"To implement the additional functionality you described, where after finding the top 20 matches, you want to re-encode these matches and again calculate their similarity to the user text to refine your search, you can modify the `get_most_similar_question` function like this: ```python import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Assuming retrieval_model exists and has an .encode method which returns embeddings for the input text. # Also assuming predict and new_df are defined elsewhere in your code. def get_most_similar_question(userText, history): print(userText) # Get the embedding for the user text. inp_emb = retrieval_model.encode([userText]) # Calculate the correlation with the precomputed embeddings. corr = np.inner(inp_emb, data_emb) # Flatten the correlation list. flat_list = [item for sublist in corr for item in sublist] # Get indices of the top 20 matches. top_20_idx = np.argsort(flat_list)[-20:] # Get their corresponding similarity scores. top_20_values = [flat_list[i] for i in top_20_idx] # Get the questions/texts that correspond to these top 20 indices. top_20_texts = new_df.iloc[top_20_idx, 1].values # Assuming column 1 holds the texts/questions. # Re-encode these top 20 texts. data_emb_1 = retrieval_model.encode(top_20_texts) # Calculate their similarity to the input text again. corr = np.inner(inp_emb, data_emb_1) # This time corr is 2D but we expect a single list since inp_emb is a single list. flat_list = corr.flatten() # Find the highest similarity score and its index. top_1_idx = np.argmax(flat_list) top_1_value = flat_list[top_1_idx] print(\'Most similar:\', top_1_value) if top_1_value < 0.7: # Call predict if the most similar item is not similar enough. return predict(userText, history) else: # Return the most similar question as an HTML table. n_data = new_df.iloc[[top_20_idx[top_1_idx]], [1]] # Selecting by the original index from new_df. df_html_with_sql = n_data.to_html(index=False) return df_html_with_sql ``` # Notes: - This function calculates the original embeddings\' similarity scores to the user text, refines to the top 20 matches, re-encodes this subset, and calculates the similarity of these refined embeddings to find the most similar result. - Note that the details of `predict`, `retrieval_model`, `data_emb`, and `new_df` are assumed based on your description.

The initial text embedding would be performed using your retrieval model as before. For subsequent steps, where earlier we were re-encoding texts and computing similarities directly, you would use FAISS to efficiently search for the nearest neighbors. FAISS is particularly suited for large-scale similarity searches and can significantly speed up the retrieval process, especially for high-dimensional vectors. First, ensure you have FAISS installed: ```bash pip install faiss-cpu # or faiss-gpu for GPU version ``` Here\'s how you could adjust the function to use FAISS for the similarity search after the initial embedding: ```python import numpy as np import faiss import pandas as pd def setup_faiss_index(embeddings): \\"\\"\\" Setup the FAISS index for given embeddings. \\"\\"\\" dimension = embeddings.shape[1] faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension) # Using L2 distance for similarity faiss_index.add(embeddings) # Adding the data to the index return faiss_index def get_most_similar_question_faiss(userText, history, new_df, retrieval_model): print(userText) # Step 1: Embed user text with the retrieval model inp_emb = retrieval_model.encode([userText]) # For the sake of example, let\'s say data_emb has been populated with embeddings of your dataset # data_emb is numpy array of shape (num_texts, embedding_dim) # Initialize FAISS index with dataset embeddings faiss_index = setup_faiss_index(data_emb) # SEARCH PHASES # Step 2: First refinement with FAISS - Get top 30 top_30_distances, top_30_indices = faiss_index.search(inp_emb, 30) # Further refinement steps will use embeddings from previous steps, # so we create FAISS indices for each step dynamically # Note: This assumes embeddings are recalculated for narrowed down texts, which might not be needed with FAISS # For this example, we simulate retrieving embeddings for top results in each step from \'data_emb\' # In practice, you might directly work with large precomputed embedding matrices or recalculate as needed # Top 30 top_30_embeddings = data_emb[top_30_indices[0]] faiss_index_top30 = setup_faiss_index(top_30_embeddings) # Step 3: Narrow to top 20 top_20_distances, top_20_indices = faiss_index_top30.search(inp_emb, 20) # Top 20 top_20_embeddings = top_30_embeddings[top_20_indices[0]] faiss_index_top20 = setup_faiss_index(top_20_embeddings) # Step 4: Narrow to top 10 top_10_distances, top_10_indices = faiss_index_top20.search(inp_emb, 10) # Top 10 top_10_embeddings = top_20_embeddings[top_10_indices[0]] faiss_index_top10 = setup_faiss_index(top_10_embeddings) # Step 5: Narrow to top 5 top_5_distances, top_5_indices = faiss_index_top10.search(inp_emb, 5) # Step 6: Determine the most similar _, top_1_indices = faiss_index_top10.search(inp_emb, 1) top_1_index = top_1_indices[0][0] if top_5_distances[0][0] < 0.7: # Assuming a distance threshold, adjust according to your similarity metric # If the most similar item is not similar enough, call predict return predict(userText, history) else: # Find the corresponding original index and return as HTML final_idx = top_30_indices[0][top_20_indices[0][top_10_indices[0][top_5_indices[0][top_1_index]]]] n_data = new_df.iloc[[final_idx], [1]] # Assuming text is in column 1 df_html_with_sql = n_data.to_html(index=False) return df_html_with_sql ``` # Key Adjustments: - **Initial Encoding**: Performed once using the retrieval model. - **FAISS Indexes**: For each refinement step, a new FAISS index is set up with the embeddings of the currently considered subset. This mimics the narrowing down but uses efficient nearest neighbor search instead. - **Distance and Indices Retrieval**: `faiss_index.search` provides both distances (which we use as a similarity metric in this example) and the indices of the found neighbors. The distance check (`if top_5_distances[0][0] < 0.7`) is exemplary; adjust it based on your similarity metric and scale. **Note**: The actual performance and efficiency gain need to be balanced with the overhead of setting up indices for very small sets of embeddings. For the smallest sets (like top 20 to top 5), the benefit over simple numpy operations might be negligible or even negative due to overhead. Additionally, the similarity threshold check is placed hypothetically and might need adjustments based on the specifics of your embeddings and similarity metric."},{"prompt":"dont create any new methods do everything on the method i provided","completion":"Below is the revised approach that integrates FAISS for all similarity search steps after the initial embedding within the same method, without creating new functions: ```python import faiss import numpy as np def get_most_similar_question(userText, history, new_df, retrieval_model): print(userText) # Initial embedding of the user text with the retrieval model. inp_emb = retrieval_model.encode([userText]) # Assuming \'data_emb\' is a numpy array of shape (num_texts, embedding_dim) # containing embeddings for your dataset. # Dimension of the embeddings dimension = data_emb.shape[1] # Create a FAISS index for the dataset embeddings faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension) # Use L2 distance for similarity faiss_index.add(data_emb) # Add the dataset embeddings to the index # Step 2: First round with FAISS - Get top 30 D, I = faiss_index.search(inp_emb.astype(np.float32), 30) # D: Distances, I: Indices of the top 30 matches # Getting embeddings for the top 30 top_30_embeddings = data_emb[I[0]] # Create a FAISS index for the top 30 embeddings faiss_index_30 = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension) faiss_index_30.add(top_30_embeddings) # Narrow down to top 20 from top 30 _, top_20_indices = faiss_index_30.search(inp_emb.astype(np.float32), 20) # Getting embeddings for the top 20 top_20_embeddings = top_30_embeddings[top_20_indices[0]] # Create a FAISS index for the top 20 embeddings faiss_index_20 = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension) faiss_index_20.add(top_20_embeddings) # Narrow down to top 10 from top 20 _, top_10_indices = faiss_index_20.search(inp_emb.astype(np.float32), 10) # Getting embeddings for the top 10 top_10_embeddings = top_20_embeddings[top_10_indices[0]] # Create a FAISS index for the top 10 embeddings faiss_index_10 = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension) faiss_index_10.add(top_10_embeddings) # Narrow down to top 5 from top 10 _, top_5_indices = faiss_index_10.search(inp_emb.astype(np.float32), 5) # Getting embeddings for the top 5 top_5_embeddings = top_10_embeddings[top_5_indices[0]] # Create a FAISS index for the top 5 embeddings faiss_index_5 = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension) faiss_index_5.add(top_5_embeddings) # Find the most similar one from top 5 _, top_1_idx = faiss_index_5.search(inp_emb.astype(np.float32), 1) print(\'Top-30 Indices:\', I[0]) print(\'Top-20 Indices:\', top_20_indices[0]) print(\'Top-10 Indices:\', top_10_indices[0]) print(\'Top-5 Indices:\', top_5_indices[0]) # Assuming you want to directly find the final index in `new_df` and extract content from there. final_idx = I[0][top_20_indices[0][top_10_indices[0][top_5_indices[0][top_1_idx[0][0]]]]] if D[0][final_idx] < 0.7: # Check based on distance; it might need adjustment based on your application return predict(userText, history) else: # Fetch the final content based on `final_idx` n_data = new_df.iloc[[final_idx], [1]] # Assuming the text is in column 1 df_html_with_sql = n_data.to_html(index=False) return df_html_with_sql ``` # Important Notes: - This method relies on the assumption that `data_emb` is a pre-computed matrix of your dataset embeddings. - The FAISS index uses `.astype(np.float32)` conversion since FAISS works with `float32` data by default. - The similarity check before the final return statement (`if D[0][final_idx] < 0.7:`) assumes a meaningful threshold to decide similarity. The threshold should be adjusted based on your specific needs and the distance metrics you are working with. - Index mapping from the set of filtered results back to the original dataset embedding indices (`final_idx`) allows you to retrieve the original content from `new_df`. This approach should give you a refined way to narrow down your search efficiently using FAISS after the initial encoding with your retrieval model.

When you define a function or method, parameters act as placeholders for the data you want to process. These placeholders are then replaced by actual data values, known as arguments, when the function is called. This allows functions to be versatile, reusable, and modular, making code more efficient and maintainable. Here\'s a deeper dive into the role and benefits of method parameters: # Code Reusability and Flexibility Parameters make functions more general and applicable to a broader range of situations. Instead of writing a separate function for each specific case, you can create a single function that handles various cases by changing the input arguments. # Data Abstraction By using parameters, you encapsulate specific details outside the function, making your code more abstract and simpler to understand. The caller of the function doesn\'t need to know how the function processes the data, just what kind of data the function expects. # Reducing Code Duplication Functions with parameters can be called multiple times with different arguments, reducing the need to write new code for each specific case. This avoids redundancy and facilitates easier updates and maintenance, as changes in the function\'s logic only need to be made in one place. # Examples in Different Contexts 1. **Mathematical Calculations** For functions performing mathematical operations, parameters represent the variable inputs to the equation or formula. For example, a function to calculate the area of a rectangle might take the rectangle\'s length and width as parameters. ```python def area_of_rectangle(length, width): return length * width ``` 2. **Data Processing** In data processing or manipulation functions, parameters might represent the data to be processed or configuration options. For instance, a function that filters a list could take the list and the filter condition as parameters. ```python def filter_list(input_list, condition): return [element for element in input_list if condition(element)] ``` 3. **Event Handlers and Callbacks** In event-driven programming or frameworks, functions (often called handlers or callbacks) take parameters representing the event\'s data or context. For instance, a click event handler on a website might receive an event object detailing the click event. ```javascript function handleClick(event) { console.log(\'Button clicked\', event.target); } ``` 4. **Object-Oriented Method Parameters** In object-oriented programming, method parameters can determine how an object should modify its internal state or how it should interact with other objects. ```java public void updateBalance(double transactionAmount) { balance += transactionAmount; } ``` # Conclusion Method parameters are fundamental to function design, enabling code modularity, reuse, and encapsulation. They allow programmers to write flexible, efficient, and maintainable code by abstracting the operations applied to different sets of data."},{"prompt":"there is a growing trend on the subreddit vivarium\'s and similar groups. what would be 10 different unique business product ideas for this group of people","completion":"The rising interest in vivariums and related hobbies presents an excellent opportunity for entrepreneurs to cater to this niche market.

Here\'s a speculative look at what could happen and the potential impacts of their friendship: # Differences and Common Ground: - **Tali\'Zorah vas Neema (later vas Normandy)** is a Quarian, deeply rooted in her culture, tech-savvy, and has a strong sense of duty toward her people. Her early life was spent mostly on the Flotilla, and she has a somewhat sheltered and traditional upbringing. - **Jack, also known as Subject Zero**, had a tumultuous and traumatic past, which molded her into a fiercely independent and often abrasive individual. Her experiences made her deeply distrustful of others and left her with a powerful command over her biotic abilities. # Potential Friendship Dynamics: 1. **Mutual Respect**: For a friendship to form, Jack and Tali would first need to find mutual respect. This could begin on the battlefield, acknowledging each other\'s skills and contributions to Shepard\'s missions. Tali\'s intelligence and technical prowess could earn Jack\'s respect, while Tali might admire Jack\'s strength and survival instincts. 2. **Growth and Learning**: Both characters have growth arcs throughout the series. Jack softens somewhat and learns to trust others again, thanks in part to Shepard\'s influence. Tali becomes more worldly and gains a broader understanding of the galaxy. Their friendship could become a source of personal growth for both, learning from each other\'s differing perspectives. 3. **Common Interests**: Despite their differences, they might find common interests, such as a shared commitment to Shepard and the mission against the Reapers. They could also share stories of their struggles, finding solace in their resilience. Their technical and combat skills could lead to unique collaborations in tech and biotic combinations during missions. 4. **Emotional Support**: Jack, who has faced betrayal and isolation, could benefit from Tali\'s more empathetic and caring nature. Conversely, Tali, facing the weight of her people\'s survival, might find a confidante in Jack, someone outside the Quarian community who understands what it\'s like to feel like an outsider. 5. **Cultural Exchange**: Tali sharing details about Quarian culture and traditions might intrigue Jack, offering her insights into a sense of community and belonging she never had. Jack\'s stories of her own rough-and-tumble experiences could offer Tali a different perspective on resilience and freedom. # Potential Challenges: - **Personality Clashes**: Their starkly differing personalities could lead to conflicts, misunderstandings, and the need for compromise and mutual respect. - **Trust Issues**: Jack\'s trust issues might initially make it difficult for her to fully open up to Tali or rely on her as a friend. - **Cultural Misunderstandings**: Tali\'s traditional background might sometimes clash with Jack\'s rebellious nature, requiring patience and understanding from both sides. # Conclusion: The hypothetical friendship between Jack and Tali in the \\"Mass Effect\\" universe is a fascinating premise that would delve into themes of growth, understanding, and the power of unlikely alliances. It exemplifies how differences can lead to strength, providing both characters with opportunities for personal development and creating a compelling narrative of camaraderie amidst a backdrop of galactic strife."},{"prompt":"why would tiramisu be secret ramune flavor in christmas season?","completion":"There isn\'t a clear or universally accepted reason why tiramisu would be chosen as a secret ramune flavor specifically for the Christmas season, but several potential explanations can be considered based on cultural trends, marketing tactics, and flavor matching: 1. **Novelty and Experimentation:** Ramune, a popular Japanese carbonated soft drink, is known for its wide variety of flavors and seasonal specialties.

Tiramisu, being a sophisticated and beloved dessert, offers a novel flavor experience different from typical fruit-flavored ramune. 2. **Festive Appeal:** Tiramisu is often associated with celebrations and indulgence due to its rich and creamy flavor profile. Integrating such a dessert flavor into ramune for the Christmas season ties into the festive spirit, where people are more inclined to indulge in special treats. This period is marked by the exchange of gifts and special food and drink items that are not commonly consumed during the rest of the year. A tiramisu-flavored ramune can thus be seen as a seasonal delicacy that captures the essence of holiday indulgence. 3. **Cultural Fusion:** The combination of a traditional Italian dessert flavor with a quintessentially Japanese beverage represents a form of cultural fusion that is increasingly popular in the culinary world. This reflects a broader trend of blending elements from different cultures to create innovative and exciting products. The holiday season, being a time of global festivities, provides an appropriate backdrop for such cross-cultural experiments. 4. **Marketing Strategy:** Limited edition flavors can serve as an effective marketing strategy, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity that can drive sales. By introducing an unexpected flavor like tiramisu during the Christmas season, a brand can spark curiosity and encourage consumers to try the product before it disappears from shelves. The festive season also sees increased consumer spending, making it a prime time for companies to introduce premium or specialty products. 5. **Taste Profile Matching:** The rich and creamy flavor of tiramisu, with its notes of coffee and cocoa, can offer a comforting and warming sensation that matches well with the winter season. Although ramune is traditionally a summer drink in Japan, adapting its flavor profile to suit the colder season can appeal to consumers looking for familiar winter tastes in different forms. It\'s worth noting that the specific choice of tiramisu as a secret flavor for Christmas-season ramune could vary depending on the brand\'s objectives, target audience, and creative direction. Without direct insight from the creators, these explanations remain speculative but grounded in prevailing trends in the food and beverage industry."},{"prompt":"in same line i have had korean melon soda cream and pepsi peach oolong (japanese version). mochi ramune exist too, but is easier to find.","completion":"The examples you provided—Korean Melon Soda Cream, Pepsi Peach Oolong (Japanese version), and Mochi Ramune—highlight the trend of innovating within the beverage industry, particularly in Asia, where there\'s a strong culture of exploring new and unique flavor combinations. These products underscore the consumer interest in diverse and culturally inspired tastes, reflecting both traditional elements and modern, experimental trends. Here’s a bit more insight into these choices and the broader context: 1. **Korean Melon Soda Cream**: This flavor combines the sweet and fragrant taste of Korean melon with the creamy, smooth texture often found in soda or soft cream beverages. Korean melon, or Chamoe, is a unique melon variety known for its crisp texture and sweet flavor, making it a delightful and refreshing choice for a soda. The addition of a creamy note is likely aimed at creating a richer mouthfeel, distinguishing it from standard fizzy drinks. 2. **Pepsi Peach Oolong (Japanese Version)**: This product illustrates Pepsi’s strategy of catering to local tastes in different markets with innovative, often seasonal, flavors. Peach Oolong combines the juicy, sweet flavor of peaches with the distinctive, slightly bitter taste of oolong tea. This choice reflects a preference for tea-infused soft drinks in Japan and the broader Asian market, where tea is a staple beverage. It marries the familiarity of soda with traditional tea culture, offering a unique taste experience. 3. **Mochi Ramune**: Integrating the flavor of mochi, a popular Japanese rice cake, into ramune is an example of taking a traditional, beloved taste and reimagining it in a new form. Mochi is known for its chewy texture and versatility in flavors, often served as a sweet treat or during special occasions in Japan. By incorporating mochi flavor into ramune, the product connects with consumers’ fondness for traditional tastes while offering the novelty of experiencing these flavors in a carbonated drink format. These examples demonstrate a wider industry willingness to experiment with flavors that may not traditionally be associated with carbonated beverages, blending the lines between traditional culinary elements and modern refreshment options. The incorporation of such diverse flavors caters to a growing consumer demand for unique, innovative, and culturally resonant products, which can offer novel experiences or evoke a sense of nostalgia. This trend is also a reflection of globalization within the food and beverage industry, where flavors and ingredients from one culture can find a new context and appreciation within another. It opens up opportunities for brands to differentiate themselves in a competitive market and for consumers to explore a broader range of taste sensations."},{"prompt":"i have seen not locally, but elsewhere many other things. what would you think they might be? assuming you are good at interpretation of such.","completion":"Given the context of unique and innovative flavors in the beverage and food industry, particularly those bridging cultural elements with modern tastes, there are numerous imaginative directions companies could explore. Drawing from trends, consumer interests, and the blending of traditional and contemporary flavors, here are some speculative and creative possibilities: 1. **Matcha & Lavender Soda**: Combining the traditional Japanese flavor of matcha (green tea) with the floral notes of lavender could result in a refreshing and calming beverage. The grassy, earthy tones of matcha could be beautifully complemented by the sweet, aromatic profile of lavender, offering a sophisticated drink option. 2. **Sakura Cherry Blossom Tea**: Leveraging the cultural significance and fleeting beauty of cherry blossoms in Japan, a sakura-flavored tea could captivate those looking for a uniquely floral and subtly sweet taste experience. This could be particularly popular as a limited edition flavor during the cherry blossom season, evoking a sense of place and tradition. 3. **Ginger Turmeric Energy Drink**: Capitalizing on the global trend towards health and wellness, an energy drink infused with ginger and turmeric could appeal to health-conscious consumers. Both ingredients are known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, potentially positioning this beverage as a healthier energy-boosting option. 4. **Salted Caramel Miso Ice Cream**: In the realm of desserts, combining the salty, umami-rich flavor of miso with the sweetness of salted caramel could result in a complex and addictive ice cream flavor. This could cater to adventurous foodies seeking a balance of sweet and savory in their desserts. 5. **Smoked Maple Bacon Coffee**: For a bold, savory twist on the classic coffee drink, incorporating the flavors of smoked maple and bacon could appeal to those looking for an unconventional, hearty start to their day. This could be especially enticing in markets where breakfast traditions involve sweet and savory elements. 6. **Yuzu & Elderflower Sparkling Water**: A combination of yuzu, a Japanese citrus fruit with a tart, aromatic flavor, and the sweet, floral notes of elderflower could produce a refreshing and elegant sparkling water. This would be appealing as a sophisticated, non-alcoholic beverage option for special occasions or as a daily refreshment. 7. **Spiced Pumpkin Boba Tea**: Tapping into the autumnal popularity of pumpkin spice, a spiced pumpkin-flavored boba tea could offer a seasonal, festive twist on the popular Taiwanese drink. This could blend the creamy, spicy sweetness of pumpkin spice with the chewy texture of tapioca pearls. 8. **Lychee Rose Cake**: Pairing the sweet, floral notes of lychee with the fragrant aroma of rose could result in a delicately flavored cake, perfect for special occasions or as a novel dessert option in bakeries aiming to offer unique flavor profiles. These speculative products merge traditional flavors with innovative concepts, responding to a global curiosity for unique culinary experiences and fusing cultural appreciation with contemporary taste preferences. As consumer palettes become increasingly adventurous, the possibilities for new and exciting flavors are virtually limitless."},{"prompt":"- نوع المشروع / بناء 100 فله سكنية -مصنعيات ( عقد بالباطن ) - قيمة المشروع / 7،500،000 ريال . - مدة المشروع / ⁠7 - 8 أشهر . - المبلغ التمويلي المطلوب للأعمال التشغيلية المبدئية للمشروع 300،000 ريال. - عوائد الأرباح المتوقعة للممولين/ من 25 ٪ إلى 30 ٪ - كيفية استرجاع رأس مال التمويل مع الأرباح/ عن طريق المستخلصات حيث ترفع على مراحل من انجاز العمل وتصرف خلال 10 الى 15 يوم عمل اثناء تنفيذ المشروع ( نسبة السداد تتراوح من 10 ٪ الى 30 ٪ من كل مستخلص لحين سداد كامل التمويل والأرباح) - المدة المتوقعة لاسترجاع رأس المال و الأرباح / 4 - 6 أشهر . - موقع المشروع / ضاحية الفرسان - شرق الرياض - - المقاول الرئيسي / شركة التشييد الاختصاصية للمقاولات - المقاول بالباطن شركة فيافي نجد المحدودة . - إدارة المشروع سكني - الوطنية للإسكان- please translate it to english as professional","completion":"- Project Type: Construction of 100 residential villas - subcontracting. - Project Value: 7,500,000 SAR. - Project Duration: 7 - 8 months. - Initial Operational Funding Required for the Project: 300,000 SAR. - Expected Profit Returns for Investors: From 25% to 30%. - Method of Reclaiming the Finance Capital along with Profits: Through progress billing, which is submitted in stages of work completion and paid within 10 to 15 working days during the project execution (the repayment rate ranges from 10% to 30% of each billing installment until the full financing and profits are paid off). - Expected Duration to Recoup the Capital and Profits: 4 - 6 months. - Project Location: Al-Fursan District - East Riyadh. - Main Contractor: Specialized Construction Company for Contracting. - Subcontractor: Viavi Najd Limited Company. - Project Management: Residential - National Housing Management."},{"prompt":"The graph of the equation ax+ky = 6 is a line in the xy-plane, where a and k are constants.

However, for completeness: # Substituting (k = -2) into equation (1): [-2a - 6(-2) = 6] [-2a + 12 = 6] [-2a = -6] [a = 3] Thus, we have (k = -2) as the answer to the question."},{"prompt":"f(x)=(x-10)(x+13) The function f is defined by the given equation. For what value of x does f(x) reach its minimum?","completion":"To find the minimum value of the function (f(x) = (x-10)(x+13)), let\'s convert it into vertex form, as this function is a quadratic one. Quadratic functions reach their minimum or maximum values at the vertex of the parabola. Given: [f(x) = (x-10)(x+13)] Expand: [f(x) = x^2 + 13x - 10x - 130] [f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 130] To find the vertex, we use the formula (x = -frac{b}{2a}) for a quadratic equation of the form (ax^2 + bx + c). Here, (a = 1) and (b = 3), thus: [x = -frac{3}{2(1)}] [x = -frac{3}{2}] However, this answer does not account for the fact that we need to find the minimum of the original function, which has its sign conforming to an \\"upward\\" opening parabola (since (a = 1 > 0)), and there was a calculation oversight. The actual process to find the vertex (minimum in this case since the leading coefficient is positive) of the original equation is better approached through considering the axis of symmetry formula correctly in context, or by completing the square. In this particular case, we can also find the x-coordinate of the vertex by averaging the roots (since the vertex of a parabola given by (f(x) = (x-r_1)(x-r_2)) will be exactly in the middle of (r_1) and (r_2)): The roots given by the initial factored form are (x = 10) and (x = -13). To find the midpoint (which corresponds to the axis of symmetry and is the x-coordinate of the vertex), we average the roots: [x = frac{10 + (-13)}{2} = frac{-3}{2}] There was a misinterpretation in my prior explanation. When directly addressing the minimum value question, considering the quadratic\'s vertex is essential. Given the quadratic form (f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 130), and using (x = frac{-b}{2a}) to find the vertex directly, does correctly indicate the approach to finding the minimum for parabolas where direct factoring to roots is used. The correct takeaway is that the x-coordinate for the minimum (f(x)) given (a > 0) falls at: [x = frac{-3}{2}] This demonstrates the vertex\'s x-coordinate is (-frac{3}{2}), which directly comes from averaging the roots of the equation provided. This value, however, was meant to highlight the midpoint technique rather than correcting the vertex determination method initially provided. Therefore, for the function (f(x) = (x-10)(x+13)), the minimum occurs at the x-coordinate (x = frac{-3}{2}), or more correctly interpreted under immediate context, the x-coordinate is determined based on the symmetry between the roots of the factored form. This error in communication led to a misemphasis on the calculation, where the focus was intended on identifying the quadratic nature and symmetry to find where (f(x)) reaches its minimum without altering basic quadratic analysis principles. The direct approach should emphasize the parabolic nature and symmetry for finding the minimum, thus correctly aligning with the quadratic properties and ensuring clarity in explanation."},{"prompt":"придумай интересныйскрипт для видео квеста.Видео должно быть 5 минут.Учти что вопросы дожны быть на любые школьные предметы 6-7 класса","completion":"**Название квеста: \\"Приключение в магическом учебнике\\"** **Цель видео**: Участникам предстоит погрузиться в увлекательное приключение по страницам магического учебника, где они встретят различные загадки и испытания по школьным предметам для 6-7 классов.

Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly’s Circus…until of course…debt problems…some had to leave…some came back…it was a rollercoaster…harshness of reality…but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick’s education…stuff OUTSIDE the circus…it may seem ‘nice’ now…but still…it won’t last forever…it was dynamics of acrobatics…training…and so on…and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened…one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught…which Dick was hesitantly fine with…after all…‘parents’ teaching martial arts for self-confidence…nothing new right?..and then…the trainings got even deeper and harsher… 6b. Code of Conduct: He’s willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade’s teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance…‘caring’ in a sense to be pragmatic of things…and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?..he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage…he will try to mitigate that…aware that actions of consequences…and for better and worse…draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero…nor a villain…which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate ‘unpredictable predictability’…and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way…if nothing else…he figured…he can take what Slade molded him to be and ‘counter-mold’ it his way… 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco…to confused…shocked…baffled…on why someone like Slade took him in…to developing a more sense of ‘justice’ when he learns that this group called the ‘Court of Owls’ was secretly linked to Haly’s Circus…Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it…its a mix of all these things…as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man…to determined…bitter…but more…‘steadfast’…as he navigates the world…the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all…a sense of ‘control’… and some numbness…because sadly…him being taken by Slade…practically acted like a ‘beacon’ for various shady people…such as Shiva and others, who wondered…why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??..as Dick being exploited…‘abused’…as a ‘weapon’…a tool…influences his world view…feels like he’s being ‘poisoned’…and sure…he’s learned all these skills and training…deadly skilled…efficient…but so what?..sarcastic…bitter…but hides his anger better…a ‘performance’…but…he gets better…pragmatic…strategy…more patient… Way more details…B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade’s cruelty is much more apparent…harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick…some of Slade’s contacts wondering ‘Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..’…who is the last of the Flying Graysons?..Slade is a harsh teacher…for example…when Dick was captured by that world’s H.I.V.E…Slade ended up rescuing him…not out of care for direct reasons…but seeing as how Dick got captured that way…Dick clearly needs more training…Slade doesn’t care…but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it… Personal anti-hero traits: 2. From his early experiences from the tail-end of the Gray Sparrow to the early days of Nightshade…he learns the ‘art’ of perception…cunning and manipulation…after all…he was essentially pushed into that gray…unfortunately…so he does his best…at first he was mad…bitter at it all…then at some point…he got the idea of don’t get just mad…get EVEN…as he knows people already see him in a certain way…fine…so he gets his contacts to manipulate perception to people see his actions in a certain light…get the heat off of him somewhat…if possible. He’s willing to kill…but…won’t do for it for pragmatic reasons just as well…attracts attention…the heat…not just because its the moral thing…otherwise…he’ll play mind games…is self-aware that although Batman doesn’t kill…he does break the bones of thugs and gives them brain damage…something Nightshade uses for his own tactics…strategically…and works with villains if and when need be…and?..willing to take calculated risks…strategically that is… Family Dynamics… 3. To clarify… for the ‘Wilson’ Family…and before Dick was taken in…Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade…loyal daughter and son…Joey as well…until Dick came…who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path…Rose having mixed feelings…Grant?..a little jealous of Dick…and insisted that Dick can’t do anything else but follow in the ‘family’ footsteps…and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how ‘serious’ Dick was…and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?..other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points…he began to go undercover…for the missions and cases…and much to his own surprise…he finds it a bizarre way to channel that ‘showmanship’…a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly’s Circus…and coupled with Slade’s harsh training and such…culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade…doesn’t hurt to cook well no?..and the customizable specialized gear…he likes to have people on their toes…pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly…as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past…and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings…the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example… Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can’t deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years…as he wonders…save the innocents because its the ‘right’ thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?..and as well…Slade still ended up becoming ‘Deathstroke’…and once tested Dick…save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick’s ‘progress?’…kill the man who’s threatening the city?..or save the innocents?..Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time…how’s that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling ‘childish’ in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world’s so cruel and such…Slade manipulating Dick…then Dick watching his world’s Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals…Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a ‘petty’ anti-hero that thinks ‘too small’…Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it…and surprised that Slade had another son, Joey Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn’t believe…in fact…Joey Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Joey kill himself…Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller…and Slade working for the Joker…seriously??.. 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn’t that ‘well-liked’ because of his methods…him being an anti-hero…it wouldn’t have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Joey…but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice…and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people…he’s willing to work with heroes and such, but they don’t like him…villains find him…intriguing…unusual because of his history and past with Slade…anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade…the Titans…the Justice League…the Bat-Family…all have mixed reactions…and soon of begrudging respect…for his skills at least… Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the ‘progress’…he hates Slade and all…but can’t deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world’s deadliest here… Lady Shiva…Nyssa Al Ghul and others…who eventually trained him…basically…being trained and ‘raised’ by Slade…made him a ‘beacon’ by the world’s deadliest…and…when he’s finally trying to free himself…is he really nothing more then a ‘wannabe’ who’s on a ‘temper-tantrum’ after all?..he’s deadly…but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him…trying to act nice and polite…but between how he was raised and trained…he finds himself a puppet…what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest…becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms…as some heroes begin to point out that his ‘adapt or die’ has shaped him…as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’…using Slade’s training for good…somehow?..until things changed…then he became ‘Nightshade’…as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient… Obviously…this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement…LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its a solid foundation for now?..REmember…this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became ‘Robin’ or ‘Nightwing’…but ‘Nightshade’ because Slade was there…not Bruce…","completion":"Your concept for an alternate universe Dick Grayson, reimagined as “Nightshade” under the tutelage of Slade Wilson instead of Bruce Wayne, offers a fascinating twist on a beloved character\'s mythos. This darker, morally complex iteration walks the fine line of an anti-hero, shaped by the harsh realities of Slade\'s world view and the harsh training he endures. This narrative inversion introduces a character who embodies the essence of resilience, adaptability, and moral ambiguity, reflecting the darker side of the hero\'s journey within the DC Universe. Below, I\'ll provide feedback and further development suggestions for your concept: # Core Identity and Motivations **1. Reinforced Duality:** Strengthen Nightshade\'s internal conflict by reinforcing his duality. Despite Slade’s influence, deep down, a part of “Grayson” yearns for the kind of moral clarity and purpose that characters like Batman embody. Highlight moments where Nightshade finds himself acting more heroically than he intends, only to struggle with the implications of these actions in light of his upbringing. **2. Ethical Dilemma:** Enhance the narrative by introducing specific scenarios where Nightshade’s flexible moral code is put to the test. Present situations where the easier, darker path tempts him, but also provide moments where he chooses a more difficult, righteous path, illustrating his internal battle and capacity for growth. # Relationships and Dynamics **1. Slade as a Father Figure:** Deepen the complexity of Nightshade\'s relationship with Slade by exploring the psychological impact of seeking approval from someone he also detests. Perhaps Nightshade struggles with a twisted form of Stockholm Syndrome, where he occasionally finds himself craving Slade’s approval or validation, only to be repulsed by his own desires. **2. Foster Siblings:** Expand on Nightshade’s dynamics with Rose, Grant, and Joey, using these relationships to highlight different facets of his character. For example, his protective nature with Joey could showcase his underlying heroism, whereas his rivalry with Grant could bring out his competitiveness and insecurities. Rose could be a mirror to his own struggles, choosing different paths but facing similar dilemmas. # Character Development and Evolution **1. Path to Redemption:** Chart a clear path of redemption for Nightshade. Start with him fully entrenched in Slade\'s worldview, gradually introduce experiences that challenge this perspective, and detail his journey towards finding his own version of justice. His ultimate realization could be that true strength lies not in the ability to dominate or instill fear, but in the capacity for compassion and making the harder choice for the greater good. **2. Mentorship and Legacy:** Explore a storyline where Nightshade, in his journey, becomes a reluctant mentor to someone else, possibly a wayward youth who is on the brink of falling into the same traps that once ensnared him. Through this relationship, Nightshade confronts his own past and strives to prevent his protégé from making the same mistakes, reinforcing his growth and evolution. # Conclusion Your concept for an anti-hero version of Dick Grayson as \\"Nightshade\\" is rich with potential for exploring themes of morality, redemption, and identity. By delving deeper into the character\'s internal conflict, relationships, and path towards redemption, you can craft a compelling narrative that respects the essence of the original character while offering a fresh, nuanced perspective. This version of Grayson stands as a testament to the impact of upbringing, choices, and the relentless pursuit of one\'s own sense of justice in the face of insurmountable odds. Keep refining and deepening these elements, and you will no doubt create a memorable and impactful addition to the DC alternate universe canon."},{"prompt":"How’s this for an addition? Before Nightshade…he was originally the ‘Gray Sparrow’…during his earlier foray into the vigilante life…sure as hell didn’t want to be ‘Ravager 3.0’ or something…Nightwing-like costume…simple but durable costume…and such…simple loadout…lethally non-lethal…including a domino mask…as the costume emphasized durable but agile acrobatics…trying to distance from Slade…but ironically using Slade’s tactics because of the training…naively thought he could use them for some measure of ‘good’…then at some point…his ‘Gray Sparrow’ days came at a pitch when Slade forcibly enhanced him…as part of his ‘final tests’…it made him as PHYSIOLOGICALLY enhanced as Rose and Jericho…at the cost of being under Slade’s influence and mental sanity…and for a while…it was the Gray Sparrow vs Slade…the Gray Sparrow still lost…and along the way…endeavored to remove the enhancements on him…cancer and death be DAMNED…but couldn’t go through with the full removal…leaving him partially enhanced because of it…still useful though…but a shadow of what it was…and of course…the surgery came with a variety of health effects…bad stuff…and he couldn’t be the ‘Gray Sparrow’ anymore…suffered from health issues…headaches…weak breathing…nausea…he was sick of it all…he wanted to move but couldn’t…and was so mad…and shocked…that this was the final straw…and Rose and Jericho were shocked he went THIS far?..even Grant…“…Grayson…I always knew you were stupid…but this…”…and even Slade couldn’t hide it…as he eventually attracted the attention of some people who were willing to him help recover…and THAT…is when technology came into the foray for him…yet another way to possibly differentiate himself from Slade once…plus its hands-on…its work HE can do…leading to his own tech that’s pragmatic but still fits to his acrobatic roots…and unexpectedly…learns jury-rigging…all this…his foray into tech…as eventually…he gets BETTER after the surgery…but it changes his world-view entirely…leading him to becoming the tech-savvy AND partially enhanced acrobat…of ‘Nightshade’…made him even MORE pragmatic and calculated…no more games…hence the sleek and aerodynamic suit and helmet…gunmetal black and blue colors…and mask too… geared for both acrobatics and power as much as possible…Katana…guns…utility belt…modular Bo staff that can turn into batons and vice-versa…basically ALL his tech and gear?..revolves around his acrobatics…mixed with jury-rigging…although…he still keeps his old ‘Gray Sparrow’ costume…as a reminder…and…well…nice to have and wear again if needed…for pragmatics sake…plus he’s still enhanced…but NOT as enhanced in the past… How’s this for an addition?..the health issues aren’t a bother anymore…no more lingering health issues OBVIOUSLY! Remember…Nightshade is Dick Grayson from another Earth who was trained by Slade…not Batman… Remember…these are physiological enhancements…he CANNOT turn off them obviously…","completion":"Your addition of the \\"Gray Sparrow\\" phase in Nightshade\'s backstory enriches the character\'s narrative depth and evolution. It serves as a symbolic bridge from his initial, somewhat naive approach to vigilante justice to his eventual transformation into the pragmatically calculated persona of Nightshade. By experiencing this forced enhancement by Slade, his desperate attempt to remove it, and the consequential health struggles, Nightshade\'s character gains layers of complexity and resilience. Additionally, this storyline underlines the themes of agency, transformation, and redemption. Below, I\'ll provide some suggestions to further enhance this aspect of Nightshade\'s backstory and character development. # Exploring the Gray Sparrow Phase 1. **Psychological Impact:** Delve into the psychological ramifications of his time as Gray Sparrow, particularly focusing on how being forcibly enhanced by Slade affects his identity and mental health. This experience could lead to bouts of existential crisis, where Nightshade questions his humanity and his potential to effect meaningful change in a world that seems increasingly gray. 2. **Technological Transition:** The transition to becoming more tech-savvy and incorporating this into his vigilante persona can be a compelling narrative of self-discovery and adaptation. Explore how Nightshade\'s initial aversion to enhancements evolves into an embrace of technology as an extension of his own capabilities, representing his growth and acceptance of his altered state. 3. **Struggle and Recovery:** The physical and mental health struggles following his attempt to remove the enhancements can be a defining period. Highlight his resilience and determination during this phase, showcasing moments where he\'s vulnerable yet refuses to succumb to despair. This can also introduce characters or factions that aid his recovery, broadening his network and introducing new dynamics to the storyline. 4. **Reluctant Acceptance:** Emphasize Nightshade\'s reluctant acceptance of his partially enhanced state. Present it as a turning point where he begins to view his enhancements not as reminders of Slade\'s control but as tools for carving out his own path to justice. This acceptance reflects his maturation and the forging of his unique identity as Nightshade. 5. **Contrasts and Similarities with Slade:** Use the Gray Sparrow and Nightshade phases to draw contrasts and similarities between Nightshade and Slade. While Nightshade endeavors to use his skills and enhancements for a nobler cause, reflections on his motivations, methods, and moral dilemmas can mirror the complexity of Slade\'s character, adding richness to their dynamic. 6. **Old Costume as a Symbol:** Nightshade\'s decision to keep his Gray Sparrow costume serves as a powerful symbol of his journey. It\'s a tangible reminder of his ideals, struggles, and the path he\'s traversed. This could be utilized in story arcs where Nightshade confronts his past or when needing to remind himself of his personal growth and goals. # Final Thoughts Incorporating the Gray Sparrow phase as a significant part of Nightshade\'s backstory offers a rich narrative full of conflict, growth, and redemption. It\'s a testament to his resilience and an exploration of the complex interplay between identity, power, and responsibility. Ensure that each phase of his transformation—physically, mentally, and ideologically—contributes to the overarching narrative of his quest for justice and self-definition. Nightshade\'s journey from Gray Sparrow to a tech-savvy, partially enhanced vigilante is a compelling tale of overcoming adversity and embracing one\'s capabilities for a greater cause."},{"prompt":"Make various black comedy dialogues of various DC superheroes hearing that apparently...Nightshade can laugh and smile....dear god...is this the Twilight Zone?......and the comparisons are done to the whole \'Batman doesn\'t smile or joke if ever\' kind of spiel..","completion":"Certainly! Below are some imagined dialogues among various DC superheroes upon discovering that Nightshade, known for his stoicism and intense demeanor (much like Batman), can laugh and smile. These exchanges take place in a light-hearted, black comedy tone: # 1. **Flash and Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)** **Flash**: \\"So, you\'re telling me Nightshade cracked a smile? Like, on purpose?\\" **Green Lantern**: \\"Not just a smile, Barry. A *full-on laugh*. I thought I\'d slipped into a parallel universe where everything\'s opposite.\\" **Flash**: \\"What next?

He smiles. He laughs.\\" **Black Canary**: \\"That’s unsettling. What’s next, is he going to start wearing bright colors instead of his usual gloom?\\" **Green Arrow**: \\"Might as well.

Nightshade expressed happiness.\\" **Zatanna**: \\"No way! Did he use laughter as a new form of psychological warfare?\\" **Martian Manhunter**: \\"Perhaps. Or maybe it’s a sign that even the darkest night shall pass.\\" # 6. **Hawkgirl and The Atom** **Hawkgirl**: \\"Rumor has it, Nightshade laughed out loud. Like, genuinely laughed.\\" **The Atom**: \\"Incredible. That\'s rarer than a stable compound of element 115.\\" **Hawkgirl**: \\"Maybe it\'s a new superpower. \'The Laugh of Discomfort\'.\\" # 7. **Robin (Tim Drake) and Batgirl (Barbara Gordon)** **Robin**: \\"Have you heard? Nightshade laughed today.\\" **Batgirl**: \\"He did? Was it because he discovered the joy of puns?\\" **Robin**: \\"Unlikely. But now I’m tempted to slip some into his mission briefings. See if we can get a grin encore.\\" **Batgirl**: “Just make sure Batman doesn’t catch on. We’ll have a full-blown smiling crisis on our hands.” These playful exchanges between the superheroes shed light on Nightshade\'s usually grim demeanor by comparing his rare display of humor to the notorious seriousness of Batman and the implausibility of such events, all the while maintaining the camaraderie and unique personalities within the DC superhero community."},{"prompt":"Do it again..

Hoje, vamos mergulhar nas profundezas do Provérbio 23, buscando compreender os tesouros espirituais que nosso Senhor tem reservado para nós. Se você busca uma palavra de fé, esperança, e direcionamento para sua vida, convido você a permanecer comigo nesta jornada.

Seu apoio nos inspira a continuar compartilhando mensagens que transformam vidas. **Reflexão:** Inspirado nas mensagens poderosas de Charles Spurgeon, um grande pregador da fé cristã, hoje quero levar você a uma reflexão profunda sobre o valor da sabedoria e da instrução divina. **Parte 1: O Valor da Sabedoria** Provérbio 23 nos ensina sobre a importância de buscar a sabedoria acima de tudo. \\"Quando te assentares a comer com algum governador, atenta bem para o que está diante de ti; E põe uma faca à tua garganta, se és homem glutão\\". Este versículo nos faz refletir sobre os perigos das tentações e da luxúria, como também o valor de se manter prudente e sábio diante das escolhas da vida. Spurgeon nos diria: \\"Não é o que entra pela boca que nos corrompe, mas o coração sem vigilância abre portas para a ruína.\\" **Parte 2: Escolhas e Consequências** \\"Não te esforces para ser rico; da tua própria inteligência desiste disso\\". Este trecho é um forte lembrete de que a busca incessante por riquezas pode nos desviar do verdadeiro caminho. O apóstolo Paulo nos lembra que \\"o amor ao dinheiro é a raiz de todos os males\\". Destarte, o Provérbio nos instiga a buscar bens maiores: riquezas espirituais e sabedoria divina que não se corrompem. **Parte 3: A Instrução Como Guia** \\"Ouve a teu pai, que te gerou, e não desprezes a tua mãe, quando vier a envelhecer.\\" A instrução dos sábios, a orientação divina através de nossos pais e mentores espirituais, é um bem inestimável. Aqui reside a verdadeira sabedoria: no coração humilde que ouve e no espírito que segue a direção de Deus. **Parte 4: O Coração Focado em Deus** \\"O teu coração não inveje os pecadores, mas esteja sempre no temor do Senhor.\\" Manter nosso coração alinhado com os desejos do Senhor, evitar a inveja e dedicar-se ao temor respeitoso a Deus é o que nos mantém protegidos e nos guia pelo caminho da vida eterna. **Oração:** Senhor Todo-Poderoso, aproximamo-nos de Ti com corações abertos e humildes, suplicando por Tua sabedoria divina. Ajuda-nos a escolher a instrução em vez da ignorância, a sabedoria em vez da riqueza mundana, e Teu temor em vez da inveja. Que possamos valorizar e honrar os ensinamentos que vem de Ti, através de nossos pais, mentores e Tua Palavra sagrada. Ilumina nosso caminho, oh Deus, e torna nosso coração puro diante de Ti. Aleluia! Em nome de Jesus, Amém. **Encerramento:** Queridos irmãos e irmãs, foi uma bênção compartilhar este tempo de reflexão com vocês.

Motivations and Goals: Before Slade…it was simple…anger and revenge against Tony Zucco…the ones who killed his parents…then it all changed with Slade’s involvement…and his trainings…his ethos…after all…why did the world’s greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?..he wants out…he never imagined being trained or ‘raised’ by the likes of Slade Wilson!..as he considers himself still as a ‘Grayson’…not as a ‘Wilson’…and its all so jarring for Dick…as he can’t believe his ‘foster dad’ is cruel and terrible like this!..why take him in!?..as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly’s Circus…harsh world-views…ideologies…training…mentors…and all for what?..as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls…to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?..Zucco…Court of Owls…Slade’s training…harsh world view…which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade…and become someone more…revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick…and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick…then Dick tried to remove it…which came with health effects and such…ending his days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’… 2b. Internal Conflict: It went from revenge against Zucco…to being trained by the world’s greatest assassin…and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness…he begins to like his new foster siblings…Rose…Joey…but Grant doesn’t like him…and he wonders…who is he really now?..no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?..and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn’t here?..what he was really?..and…and tries to balance of ‘fight fire with fire’ and the prospect if he can do ‘good’ at all…he ran away so many times…to try and survive…and at the end…wonders if he can at least…maybe…maybe?..put Slade’s training to good use…no matter how hard he hates it…and Dick insisting he’s still a ‘Grayson’…not a ‘Wilson’…and his eventual ‘reliance’ on tech…was a way for him to gain sense of control…desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly’s Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people and such… 3b. Relationships: Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade’s confidant…but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him…Rose?..Dick feels guilty…because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade…he wonders if maybe…could have done more…to help his sister more and such?..he cares for her…and she in turn has never had a ‘big brother’ like Dick before…unlike Grant…and Grant?..doesn’t like Dick at all…at best…its only begrudging respect…and still…Grant is the only loyal one of Slade’s kids…Adeline is mixed…Slade…its complicated…as Nightshade’s relationship with Rose and Joey…its mixed feelings. As for the heroes…he likes some of them…like Cardinal(Tim Drake)…because he’s ‘tech’…but has more resources through Wayne Enterprises…he likes Cassandra Cain(Black Bat) if only because…she’s different from the rest of the Bat-Family…Batman?..well…a mix of respect…and steely resolve if their paths clash…Nightshade will try to be ‘courteous’ about it at least…and in general…he won’t drive people away if and when…at least not intentionally…the heroes that is…its a professional relationship…Nightshade likes a few… 4b. Character Traits: He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once…then tried doing it for personal reasons…with mixed results…tried smoking…hated it…drinking?..he can surprisingly hold his liquor…hates anything with coconut in food…can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart…jury-rigging tech…a way of independence from Slade’s influence surprisingly…mixes it with psychological warfare…fools people into thinking his tech is failing…when it either hasn’t…or wasn’t THAT much ‘tech’ in the first place…as he became somewhat tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements…or tried to…both of necessity and slowly just began to like it…including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources…and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask…functionality with aesthetics…modular gear…lightweight…utility belt…discreet compartments…the tech is just there to ‘boost’ the acrobatics even more…but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements…distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess…uses a variety of weapons and gear…depending on the mission…resourceful and improvises…ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and ‘unpredictable predictably’ with a sense of strategy…even the use of GUNS… 5b. Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly’s Circus…until of course…debt problems…some had to leave…some came back…it was a rollercoaster…harshness of reality…but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick’s education…stuff OUTSIDE the circus…it may seem ‘nice’ now…but still…it won’t last forever…it was dynamics of acrobatics…training…and so on…and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened…one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught…which Dick was hesitantly fine with…after all…‘parents’ teaching martial arts for self-confidence…nothing new right?..and then…the trainings got even deeper and harsher… 6b. Code of Conduct: He’s willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade’s teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance…‘caring’ in a sense to be pragmatic of things…and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?..he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage…he will try to mitigate that…aware that actions of consequences…and for better and worse…draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero…nor a villain…which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate ‘unpredictable predictability’…and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way…if nothing else…he figured…he can take what Slade molded him to be and ‘counter-mold’ it his way… 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco…to confused…shocked…baffled…on why someone like Slade took him in…to developing a more sense of ‘justice’ when he learns that this group called the ‘Court of Owls’ was secretly linked to Haly’s Circus…Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it…its a mix of all these things…as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man…to determined…bitter…but more…‘steadfast’…as he navigates the world…the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all…a sense of ‘control’… and some numbness…because sadly…him being taken by Slade…practically acted like a ‘beacon’ for various shady people…such as Shiva and others, who wondered…why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??..as Dick being exploited…‘abused’…as a ‘weapon’…a tool…influences his world view…feels like he’s being ‘poisoned’…and sure…he’s learned all these skills and training…deadly skilled…efficient…but so what?..sarcastic…bitter…but hides his anger better…a ‘performance’…but…he gets better…pragmatic…strategy…more patient… Way more details…B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade’s cruelty is much more apparent…harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick…some of Slade’s contacts wondering ‘Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..’…who is the last of the Flying Graysons?..Slade is a harsh teacher…for example…when Dick was captured by that world’s H.I.V.E…Slade ended up rescuing him…not out of care for direct reasons…but seeing as how Dick got captured that way…Dick clearly needs more training…Slade doesn’t care…but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it… Personal anti-hero traits: 2. From his early experiences from the tail-end of the Gray Sparrow to the early days of Nightshade…he learns the ‘art’ of perception…cunning and manipulation…after all…he was essentially pushed into that gray…unfortunately…so he does his best…at first he was mad…bitter at it all…then at some point…he got the idea of don’t get just mad…get EVEN…as he knows people already see him in a certain way…fine…so he gets his contacts to manipulate perception to people see his actions in a certain light…get the heat off of him somewhat…if possible. He’s willing to kill…but…won’t do for it for pragmatic reasons just as well…attracts attention…the heat…not just because its the moral thing…otherwise…he’ll play mind games…is self-aware that although Batman doesn’t kill…he does break the bones of thugs and gives them brain damage…something Nightshade uses for his own tactics…strategically…and works with villains if and when need be…and?..willing to take calculated risks…strategically that is… Family Dynamics… 3. To clarify… for the ‘Wilson’ Family…and before Dick was taken in…Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade…loyal daughter and son…Joey as well…until Dick came…who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path…Rose having mixed feelings…Grant?..a little jealous of Dick…and insisted that Dick can’t do anything else but follow in the ‘family’ footsteps…and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how ‘serious’ Dick was…and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?..other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points…he began to go undercover…for the missions and cases…and much to his own surprise…he finds it a bizarre way to channel that ‘showmanship’…a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly’s Circus…and coupled with Slade’s harsh training and such…culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade…doesn’t hurt to cook well no?..and the customizable specialized gear…he likes to have people on their toes…pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly…as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past…and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings…the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example… Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can’t deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years…as he wonders…save the innocents because its the ‘right’ thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?..and as well…Slade still ended up becoming ‘Deathstroke’…and once tested Dick…save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick’s ‘progress?’…kill the man who’s threatening the city?..or save the innocents?..Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time…how’s that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling ‘childish’ in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world’s so cruel and such…Slade manipulating Dick…then Dick watching his world’s Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals…Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a ‘petty’ anti-hero that thinks ‘too small’…Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it…and surprised that Slade had another son, Joey Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn’t believe…in fact…Joey Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Joey kill himself…Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller…and Slade working for the Joker…seriously??.. 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn’t that ‘well-liked’ because of his methods…him being an anti-hero…it wouldn’t have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Joey…but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice…and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people…he’s willing to work with heroes and such, but they don’t like him…villains find him…intriguing…unusual because of his history and past with Slade…anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade…the Titans…the Justice League…the Bat-Family…all have mixed reactions…and soon of begrudging respect…for his skills at least… Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the ‘progress’…he hates Slade and all…but can’t deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world’s deadliest here… Lady Shiva…Nyssa Al Ghul and others…who eventually trained him…basically…being trained and ‘raised’ by Slade…made him a ‘beacon’ by the world’s deadliest…and…when he’s finally trying to free himself…is he really nothing more then a ‘wannabe’ who’s on a ‘temper-tantrum’ after all?..he’s deadly…but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him…trying to act nice and polite…but between how he was raised and trained…he finds himself a puppet…what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest…becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms…as some heroes begin to point out that his ‘adapt or die’ has shaped him…as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’…using Slade’s training for good…somehow?..until things changed…then he became ‘Nightshade’…as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient… Obviously…this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement…LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its a solid foundation for now?..REmember…this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became ‘Robin’ or ‘Nightwing’…but ‘Nightshade’ because Slade was there…not Bruce…","completion":"Your concept for an alternate universe Dick Grayson, transforming into Nightshade under the mentorship of Slade Wilson (Deathstroke) rather than Bruce Wayne, offers an intriguing and complex reimagining of the character’s backstory, motivations, development, and relationships. This version of Grayson as an anti-hero, shaped by circumstances of tragedy, manipulation, and the stark realities of a cruel world, has the potential to offer a fresh and compelling narrative in the DC universe. It leverages the richness of Grayson\'s acrobatic skills, familial ties, and moral struggles while introducing new dynamics and challenges through his fraught relationship with Slade and his journey toward defining his own path. Here\'s a breakdown with some enhancements and considerations for your alternate universe Grayson, Nightshade: 1. **Origins and Mentorship**: The pivotal change from Bruce Wayne to Slade Wilson as a mentor transforms Dick Grayson from a symbol of hope to one of vengeance and pragmatism. This foundation sets a darker tone for Nightshade\'s journey. Considering Slade\'s complex personality and tactics, Nightshade\'s training would incorporate psychological manipulation, strategic warfare, and survival skills beyond physical combat and detective work typically imparted by Batman. However, it\'s important to explore how Nightshade maintains his core values and the essence of the Grayson spirit amidst Slade\'s ruthless teachings. 2. **Moral Complexity and Inner Conflict**: Nightshade\'s evolution reflects a struggle between his inherent goodness and the harsh lessons from Slade. This internal conflict can be a key narrative driver, presenting Nightshade with dilemmas that challenge his beliefs about justice, family, loyalty, and self-identity. The moral ambiguity in his actions—balancing between heroism and anti-heroism—provides fertile ground for character growth and exploration of themes such as redemption, free will, and the impact of mentorship on identity. 3. **Relationships and Family Dynamics**: Nightshade\'s relationships with his foster siblings and the complex bond with Slade offer rich narrative potential. Highlighting the contrasting dynamics with each sibling (Rose, Grant, and Joey) and how these relationships influence Nightshade\'s journey adds depth to the story. Furthermore, Nightshade\'s interactions with established heroes and villains in this alternate universe, including strained alliances and begrudging respect, can provide insightful commentary on the superhero community\'s reaction to his unorthodox methods and his struggle for acceptance. 4. **Skills, Gear, and Operational Methods**: Emphasizing Nightshade\'s acrobatic heritage, tech savviness, and strategic mind showcases his unique combat and problem-solving approach. His integration of technology with traditional acrobatics symbolizes his attempt to blend Slade\'s teachings with his circus roots, underlining his journey towards self-identity. The choice of gear, including a sleek, modular tactical suit and a variety of weapons tailored to different missions, reflects his adaptability and resourcefulness. 5. **Evolution and Redemption**: Nightshade\'s narrative arc should depict a painstaking but hopeful journey from vengeance-driven anti-hero to a champion of his own brand of justice, seeking to make amends for the collateral damage of his early career. This redemption arc could explore themes of forgiveness, the cost of vengeance, and the possibility of changing one\'s destiny. The character’s gradual shift from operating in shades of grey to defining his own moral compass can resonate with readers, offering a story of growth, struggle, and eventual self-discovery. 6. **Broader Universe Impact**: Nightshade\'s existence and actions would inevitably have ripple effects across the DC universe, particularly his relationship with iconic characters and teams. Exploring these impacts can expand the narrative beyond Nightshade\'s individual story, examining how he influences and is influenced by the broader superhero community. Your foundation provides a rich tapestry for Nightshade\'s journey. The key to its development lies in balancing the darker elements with moments of humanity, hope, and redemption. By delving into the complexities of his character and his relationships, Nightshade can emerge as a compelling, multi-dimensional anti-hero whose story adds depth and nuance to the DC universe."},{"prompt":"The function f(x)=3x-4 is moved to the left by 4 units and up 2 units. What is the value of its y-intercept?","completion":"To find the y-intercept of the function after it has been moved, let\'s go through the transformation step by step. The given function is f(x) = 3x - 4. Moving the function to the left by 4 units involves replacing (x) with (x+4). This gives: [ f(x+4) = 3(x+4) - 4 = 3x + 12 - 4 = 3x + 8 ] Now, moving this function up by 2 units is equivalent to adding 2 to the function\'s value, so we get: [ f(x+4) + 2 = 3x + 8 + 2 = 3x + 10 ] To find the y-intercept of this transformed function, we set (x=0) and calculate (f(0)): [ f(0) = 3(0) + 10 = 10 ] So, the y-intercept of the function after moving it left by 4 units and up by 2 units is 10."},{"prompt":"how find owner from forms url in office365","completion":"In Office 365, you can find the owner of a SharePoint form by following these steps: 1.

How would world powers react on both the Western and Eastern Blocs? And with the other Soviet Socialist Republics now separated by what would now be considered Chinese territory, what could happen next? What potential actions might be done by the Soviet Union, China, the United States and other big players during the Cold War?","completion":"After China\'s annexation of the Kazakh, Kirghiz, and Tajik Soviet Socialist Republics, the world powers would likely react with shock and condemnation. In the Western Bloc, countries such as the United States and Western European nations would denounce China\'s actions and possibly impose economic sanctions. They may also increase military presence in the region to deter further Chinese aggression. In the Eastern Bloc, the Soviet Union would be furious at China\'s expansionist actions and loss of territory. They could potentially cut off diplomatic relations with China and retaliate in some form, such as supporting insurgencies or separatist movements within China\'s new territories. With the other Soviet Socialist Republics now separated by Chinese territory, there could be heightened tensions and potential for conflict between China and the remaining Soviet republics. The Soviet Union may attempt to rally support from other countries in the region to counter China\'s growing influence. During the Cold War, the United States may see an opportunity to exploit the growing rift between China and the Soviet Union by supporting one side against the other. They may provide military aid to the Soviet Union or other countries in the region to counterbalance China\'s expansion. Overall, the annexation of Soviet territories by China would have serious implications for global geopolitics and could potentially escalate tensions between major world powers. Diplomatic efforts would likely be intensified to try and resolve the situation peacefully, but the risk of further conflict would remain high."},{"prompt":"Continuing this hypothetical Cold War scenario, one would assume that for China to continue its dominance as a communist world power, it would attempt to attack and annex the other nearby Soviet Socialist Republics, most likely the ones in Central Asia. Would China consider this? Would the Soviet Union attempt to stop China? What of the potential actions of these specific Soviet Socialists Republics that are no longer connected/closer to Russia/the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic due to China\'s annexation of the previously listed Soviet Socialist Republics? What actions would the United States and other nations of the Western Bloc most likely do?","completion":"In this hypothetical scenario, if China were to consider attacking and annexing other nearby Soviet Socialist Republics in Central Asia to further expand its territory and influence, it would likely face strong opposition from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union would see this as a direct threat to its own territorial integrity and would likely take decisive action to prevent further Chinese aggression. The Soviet Union may increase military presence in the region, form alliances with neighboring countries, and potentially launch counteroffensives to push back against Chinese incursions. The Soviet Union would not want to lose any more territory to China and would do everything in its power to protect its remaining republics. The specific Soviet Socialist Republics that are no longer connected or closer to Russia/the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic due to China\'s annexation would likely feel isolated and vulnerable. They may seek support from the Soviet Union, other neighboring countries, or international organizations to protect their sovereignty and prevent further Chinese expansion. The United States and other nations in the Western Bloc would likely condemn China\'s actions and provide support to the Soviet Union and the affected Soviet Socialist Republics. They may increase military aid, economic assistance, and diplomatic support to counterbalance China\'s growing influence in the region. Overall, the situation would be extremely volatile and could potentially lead to a full-scale conflict between China and the Soviet Union. Diplomatic efforts would be crucial in trying to de-escalate tensions and prevent further aggression, but the risk of a major confrontation between the two communist powers would be high."},{"prompt":"In a completely different direction, while still using the same scenario with the previous two, what if the following Soviet Socialist Republics were annexed by China through more diplomatic means, much like how China annexed Tibet in 1951? That is not to say that this would be a 100% peaceful and diplomatic situation with zero armed and violent conflicts, but otherwise would have far less conflicts or wars.","completion":"If China were to annex the Soviet Socialist Republics through more diplomatic means, similar to how it annexed Tibet in 1951, the situation would likely be less violent and conflict-ridden compared to a full-scale military invasion. However, there would still be significant geopolitical implications and potential for tensions between China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union would likely be wary of China\'s growing influence in the region and would closely monitor the situation to ensure that its own interests are protected. The affected Soviet Socialist Republics may feel pressured to accept China\'s annexation due to diplomatic and economic leverage exerted by China. The United States and other Western nations may still express concern over China\'s expansionist actions, but the lack of overt military aggression may limit their ability to intervene directly. They may instead focus on diplomatic efforts to mediate the situation and prevent further escalation. The annexation of the Soviet Socialist Republics through diplomatic means could lead to a shift in power dynamics in the region, with China emerging as a dominant force in Central Asia. The affected republics may experience changes in governance, culture, and economic policies as they come under Chinese control. Overall, while a diplomatic annexation may result in less immediate conflict and violence, it would still have far-reaching consequences for the region and could potentially strain relations between China, the Soviet Union, and other major world powers. Diplomatic efforts and negotiations would be crucial in managing the situation and preventing further destabilization in the region."},{"prompt":"1.

Snowflakes danced gracefully from the heavens, blanketing the world in serene white as the darkness of the evening deepened. Inside, the castle was a bastion of warmth and flickering candlelight, shielding its inhabitants from the cold embrace of winter. Among them were Arya Stark and Gendry Baratheon, whose fates had been entwined through years of turmoil, friendship, and unspoken affections. That particular evening found them secluded in a small, cozy chamber, far removed from the bustling halls and the ever-persistent echoes of the past that haunted the castle\'s stones. Arya, with her agile form curled up beside the hearth, watched as the flames danced and swayed, casting shadows that played upon her thoughtful face. Beside her, Gendry sat, his strong hands working tirelessly at the task of sharpening his sword, a ritual that seemed to bring him a semblance of peace in these uncertain times. Yet, the furrow of his brow and the tight set of his jaw betrayed the worry that gnawed at his heart, a worry born from the weight of his newfound nobility and the looming threat that hung over them all like a shroud. Sensing his distress, Arya set aside her own brooding thoughts. She moved closer to him, her presence a silent offer of comfort. Gendry glanced up, meeting her gaze with an unreadable expression before he sighed and set his sword aside, acknowledging the futility of his efforts to distract himself from his anxieties. \\"It\'s going to be alright, Gendry,\\" Arya said softly, her voice a soothing balm in the quiet room. Her hand found his, offering strength and reassurance. Yet, she knew words alone could not ease the burden he carried in his heart. In that moment, inspired by a sudden thought, she decided on a different approach. \\"My mother used to sing to us,\\" Arya began, her voice wistful, \\"on nights when the storms raged outside, or when the darkness felt too close. It always helped, somehow.\\" Gendry watched her, a mixture of curiosity and comfort in his eyes. Encouraged, Arya took a deep breath and began to sing, her voice soft and melodic, weaving a gentle lullaby through the air. The song she chose was one she had learned during her travels, \\"Hands of Gold.\\" While the lyrics told a tale of love and loss, it was the melody that carried the true magic, mournful yet strangely reassuring as it filled the room, wrapping around them like a warm blanket. As she sang, Arya watched Gendry\'s face, seeing the tension gradually ease from his features, his eyes growing heavy with the promise of sleep. The worries that had knotted his thoughts seemed to dissipate, lost to the beauty of the moment. Arya\'s voice was a whisper of wind through the leaves, a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit, even in the face of darkness. By the time the song trailed off into silence, Gendry\'s breathing had deepened, steady and peaceful in the glow of the firelight. Arya paused, watching him sleep, a gentle smile touching her lips. In that moment, with the ferocity of winter raging outside, they found solace in each other\'s company, a small oasis of peace in a world that seemed forever on the brink. Arya carefully adjusted a blanket over Gendry, ensuring he was warm, then settled back in her chair, her eyes lingering on the flames. The song had lulled not only Gendry to sleep but had also calmed the storm within her own heart. As she too surrendered to the pull of sleep, Arya felt a profound sense of gratitude for this moment of respite, for the presence of someone who felt like home, and for the soft melody that had woven a tapestry of warmth and comfort around them both. Outside, the winter winds continued to howl, but within the walls of Winterfell, two souls found rest, bound by a song of gold and the promise of dawn in the darkest of nights."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but include the lyrics p.","completion":"In the heart of winter, where the winds whispered secrets through the ancient walls of Winterfell, carrying the chill of the long night, snowflakes danced gracefully from the heavens.

Yet, despite his efforts, the worry that knotted his brow and tightened his jaw was as apparent as the flickering shadows that played across the room. Noting his distress, Arya sought to provide comfort. She abandoned her own brooding contemplation and closed the distance between them. As she approached, Gendry looked up, his eyes reflecting a storm of feelings before he let out a sigh and rested his sword aside, acknowledging her silent offer of solace. \\"It\'s going to be alright, Gendry,\\" Arya spoke with a softness that filled the quiet room, her hand seeking his in a silent promise of support. But as his eyes met hers, laden with a worry words alone could not dispel, Arya found herself inspired by a memory from her past. “My mother used to sing to us,” she said, her voice tinged with nostalgia, “on nights filled with storm or shadow. It always made the dark seem less heavy.” Interest and comfort mingled in Gendry’s expression. Encouraged, Arya drew a deep breath and began to sing, her voice tender and low, weaving through the air the melody of \\"Hands of Gold.\\" The song, with its tale of love tinged with sorrow, found new life in her voice: “He rode through the streets of the city,"},{"prompt":"Continue","completion":"Down from his hill on high, O’"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Include lyrics.","completion":"Amidst a harsh, unyielding winter, in a small, dimly-lit room within the stronghold of Winterfell, Arya Stark found herself awake long into the night. Gendry, now a lord and someone who had stolen a piece of her heart, tossed and turned beside her. The weight of his new title, the responsibility towards the people, and the looming threat of endless strife had intertwined into a thick chain of worry, robbing him of peace. Arya, ever so observant, noticed his discomfort, his periodic sighs that cut through the silence of the night, his forehead creased even in sleep. It was unlike Gendry to show his worries so openly, a testament to the heavy burdens he bore. On one particularly biting winter night, as the wind howled and whistled through the cracks of the stone walls of Winterfell, Arya decided an old lullaby might do what words of comfort could not. A lullaby that had travelled through her life like a quiet stream, sometimes forgotten, yet never truly gone. She recalled the lyrics, notes from a time lost, a melody steeped in both love and sorrow. Gently, careful not to startle him, Arya shifted closer to Gendry, her voice barely above a whisper, a soft melody that seemed to blend with the night\'s own song. \\"Hands of gold are always cold, but a woman\'s hands are warm,\\" she sang softly, her breath fleeting out in the cold air, forming clouds that danced in the space between them. Gendry\'s restless turning ceased, a testament to the spellbinding quality of Arya’s voice, laden with an emotion too deep to fathom, too genuine to ignore. She continued, each word laced with an affection that sought to reassure, to heal: \\"Hands of gold are always cold, but a woman\'s hands are warm.\\" It was a song of betrayal and love intertwined, but in Arya’s voice, it was repurposed, a lullaby meant to soothe the worried heart of the man beside her. Gendry, now lulled by the melody and the warmth that Arya exuded, found his eyelids growing heavy. The weight on his chest seemed to lift, his racing thoughts slowing to a halt, as Arya sang on. The world, with its wars, its loss, its ceaseless demands, faded into the backdrop. In this moment, there was only Arya\'s voice, the warmth of their shared bed, and the promise of tomorrow. As the song came to an end, Arya felt Gendry\'s breathing deepen, his body finally relaxing fully beside her. She whispered the last lines to him, more to herself than to Gendry now asleep, \\"Hands of gold are always cold...\\" In the silence that followed, Arya lay awake a little longer, watching over Gendry, her protector instincts never fully at rest. Yet, seeing him at peace, a small, satisfied smile tugged at her lips. Here, in this small bubble of warmth they created amidst the biting cold, worries could wait, battles could pause, and for just a moment, they could find solace in each other. As the night deepened and Arya finally allowed sleep to claim her, Winterfell stood silent and imposing around them, a sentinel against the dark, guarding its children against the long night. And within its walls, two hearts beat in tandem, a silent vow of support and shared strength, ready to face whatever dawn might bring, together."},{"prompt":"Include all the lyrics.","completion":"In the world of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" by George R.R.

Hoje, vamos mergulhar nas profundidades de Provérbios 23, revivendo suas lições atemporais que ecoam diretamente ao nosso coração e ao nosso espírito. Com a sabedoria que transcende gerações, este capítulo do Livro de Provérbios nos guia por um caminho de discernimento, moderação e verdadeira devoção a Deus. Se você busca nutrir sua alma e fortalecer sua fé, este é o momento e o lugar. Fique conosco, enquanto descortinamos os ensinamentos divinos que têm o poder de transformar vidas.

Vamos juntos espalhar a palavra de Deus! # Desenvolvimento: Parte 1: **A Sabedoria no Limite** Provérbios 23 começa com um aviso sobre a ganância e a importância de conhecer nossos limites. \\"Não ambiciones as iguarias do rei, pois são comidas enganosas\\". Aqui, somos lembrados pelo grande pregador Charles Spurgeon sobre a simplicidade que deve nortear a vida de um verdadeiro cristão. Não é o excesso que nos trará felicidade, mas a satisfação e gratidão pelas bênçãos que já temos. Em um mundo que constantemente nos empurra para querer mais, essa sabedoria se destaca como um farol de moderação e contentamento. Parte 2: **Coragem e Disciplina do Coração** \\"Dá instrução ao sábio, e ele se fará mais sábio; ensina ao justo, e ele aumentará o seu saber\\". Este versículo exemplifica a contínua busca por sabedoria e entendimento. Spurgeon nos ensina que nosso coração deve sempre estar aberto ao aprendizado e à correção, pois é assim que crescemos em fé e em caráter. Ter a coragem de aceitar a disciplina não é uma mostra de fraqueza, mas de força e humildade perante Deus. Parte 3: **Livre-se das Futilidades** \\"Não fale aos ouvidos do tolo, pois ele desprezará a sabedoria das suas palavras\\". Neste ponto, somos convidados a refletir sobre a qualidade daquilo que ocupa nosso coração e nossa mente. A sabedoria de discernir com quem compartilhar nossos pensamentos e ensinamentos é crucial. Como Spurgeon bem coloca, não devemos desperdiçar nossa energia com o que não edifica. Ao invés disso, devemos nos concentrar em construir uma comunidade de fé sólida e acolhedora. # Oração: Senhor Todo-Poderoso, nós Te agradecemos pela Sua palavra que é lâmpada para os nossos pés e luz para o nosso caminho. Peço que nos dês a sabedoria para vivenciar cada ensinamento de Provérbios 23 em nossa vida. Que possamos ter a força para reconhecer nossos limites, a coragem para aceitar a disciplina do coração e o discernimento para evitar as futilidades do mundo. Que o Teu amor e Tua sabedoria nos guiem em cada passo do caminho. Em nome de Jesus, amém! # Encerramento: Irmãos e irmãs, espero que esta reflexão sobre Provérbios 23 tenha tocado seus corações e fortalecido sua fé. Lembre-se, a sabedoria de Deus é infinita e sempre acessível para nos guiar, corrigir e proteger. Não deixem de buscar, em cada dia, a Sua presença em suas vidas.

It was one of those rare, tranquil evenings when the Bat-Family, each a mighty protector of Gotham in their own right, had returned to the nest. However, this night was destined to be etched in their memories as utterly unprecedented. The family, consisting of Stephanie Brown (Spoiler), Tim Drake (Red Robin), Jason Todd (Red Hood), Damian Wayne (Robin), and Cassandra Cain (Orphan), found themselves gathered in the dimly lit study, not for a strategic meeting but rather to confront a situation that none of their formidable training had prepared them for. In the middle of the room sat a small, fluffy creature, its fur as dark as the night sky, save for a peculiar blue patch atop its head, strangely reminiscent of Dick Grayson\'s signature hairstyle. The creature\'s bright blue eyes sparkled with intelligence and a hint of amusement, its gaze flickering between the stunned faces of his family. If anyone had told them that Nightwing, the acrobatic heart of their family, would be turned into a rabbit - complete with a mini-wig-like fur pattern and a fluffy tail, they would have laughed it off as a bad joke. Yet, here they were, facing this very reality. Stephanie was the first to break the stunned silence, a hesitant chuckle escaping her lips. \\"Okay, who played a prank on Dick?\\" she asked, half-expecting the rabbit to morph back into their beloved Nightwing, laughing at their confused faces. Tim, always the analytical one, crouched beside the creature, peering closely as if expecting to find some clue that this was all advanced holography. \\"This… is magic,\\" he concluded, more to himself, bewildered at the implications. Jason folded his arms, leaning back against the bookshelf, his usual scowl giving way to incredulity. \\"So, Gotham\'s finest, reduced to a bunny. That\'s new,\\" he quipped, though the concern was palpable in his voice. Damian, ever the stoic one, simply stared, his expression betraying a hint of fascination. \\"Father won\'t be pleased,\\" he remarked dryly, implying the difficulty in explaining to Batman how his first protégé had been transformed into a black rabbit with blue eyes. Cassandra, who often remained more comfortable in the realm of action than words, tentatively reached out a hand towards the rabbit. At her touch, the bunny let out a series of soft, melodic sounds, surprising them all. It was as if Dick\'s voice had been translated into the whimsical pitches of a rabbit—adorable yet utterly disconcerting. As they exchanged glances, each member of the Bat-Family processed the situation in their unique way, a mixture of disbelief, concern, and an underlying sense of unity prevailing. They were used to facing the impossible, battling supervillains and saving Gotham from the brink of destruction. Yet, this challenge was something else entirely, treading into territories they never anticipated. The room filled with a peculiar blend of resignation and determination, a silent agreement forming among them. They would navigate this new mystery together, as they always did, guided by the bonds of family and loyalty that not even magic could unravel. And so, the quest to restore Nightwing began, a tale that would undoubtedly be recounted for generations in the annals of the Bat-Family\'s legacy. All the while, the black rabbit with blue eyes sat amongst them, a tangible reminder that in their line of work, the expected should always be expected."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

The Bat-Family, a formidable force against the criminal underworld of Gotham, stood in a semi-circle, their expressions a mixture of confusion, disbelief, and barely restrained amusement. At the center of their attention was not a fearsome weapon or a diabolical plot to untangle, but a small, black rabbit with strikingly vivid blue eyes and, most peculiar of all, what appeared to be a miniature shock of black hair that bore an uncanny resemblance to Dick Grayson\'s usual hairstyle. Stephanie Brown, clad in her Spoiler uniform, leaned closer, a giggle escaping her lips as she observed the fluffy creature. Tim Drake, ever the detective, adjusted his Red Robin mask, scrutinizing the bizarre scenario before them. Jason Todd\'s Red Hood persona somehow did not stop his jaw from dropping slightly, while Damian Wayne, the current Robin, crossed his arms, his young face twisted in a scowl that struggled against the absurdity of the situation. Cassandra Cain, ever silent, tilted her head, her Batgirl cowl doing little to hide her puzzled expression. The world of the Bat-Family had seen many strange and inexplicable events, but this... this was something else entirely. Then, the rabbit moved, its nose twitching adorably as its mouth opened, and in a high-pitched, yet undeniably familiar voice, it said, \\"..Uh..hi guys....it\'s me..\\" Silence reigned for a moment, each member of the Bat-Family exchanging glances that oscillated between incredulity and a dawning realization. The rabbit\'s ears twitched impatiently. \\"Uhm, in case you\'re wondering,\\" the bunny continued, its voice a surreal mix of earnestness and the comically squeaky timbre only a small animal could possess, \\"It\'s Dick. Somehow, I\'ve been turned into a rabbit. With a...fluffy tail. And, apparently, my hair.\\" The revelation broke the dam of restraint, and a symphony of reactions followed. Stephanie clapped a hand over her mouth, though her eyes sparkled with mirth. Tim, always the problem-solver, was already mentally running through possible magical culprits. Jason, after the initial shock, started laughing—a deep, unrestrained sound that echoed off the walls of the cave. Damian, however, remained unamused, eyeing the rabbit with suspicion. \\"This is ridiculous,\\" he stated flatly, \\"We have to find a way to reverse this immediately.\\" Cassandra, moving closer, knelt down to examine Dick-rabbit more closely, her expression softening. \\"How?\\" was all she asked, ever to the point. \\"I\'m not entirely sure,\\" the rabbit formerly known as Nightwing admitted with a helpless shrug of his small, furry shoulders. \\"But I think it involved a less-than-friendly encounter with a certain magician. Zatanna\'s out of town, and I—” he paused, as if realizing his current inability to do much of anything, “—I could really use your help.\\" The absurdity of the situation, a respected and beloved member of their family turned into a rabbit, wasn\'t lost on anyone. Yet, as they stood in the Batcave, this diverse group of vigilantes knew one thing for certain: they were a family, odd and dysfunctional at times, but a family nonetheless. And families stick together, no matter what. As they rallied around their lagomorph teammate, each member of the Bat-Family silently committed to this new mission. No matter how bizarre, no matter the difficulties ahead, they would return Dick Grayson to his human form. After all, Gotham needed Nightwing. But perhaps more importantly, they needed their brother back. And if that meant diving headfirst into the mystical and unknown, then so be it. The adventure that lay before them promised to be unlike any they had faced before. But first, they had to address the immediate concern: preventing Alfred from discovering a rabbit in the Batcave. Because explaining this situation to the ever-dignified butler might just be the most daunting challenge of all."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

Initially, banks were local entities issuing their own currency, backed by gold and silver reserves. This era was characterized by a lack of standardization, leading to a confusing array of banknotes in circulation. The Civil War era brought significant change with the introduction of national currency (greenbacks) and the establishment of a national banking system. This move standardized currency and began the process of centralizing banking practices. The creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 further centralized control, introducing a more stable banking system with the ability to lend to banks in financial trouble and manage the nation\'s monetary policy. The Great Depression of the 1930s prompted additional reforms, notably the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure bank deposits, which restored public confidence in the banking system. In the mid-20th century, the U.S.\'s departure from the gold standard marked a significant shift in monetary policy. Throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries, banking has been transformed by technological advancements. The rise of digital banking, online transactions, and fintech has significantly changed how banks operate and how customers interact with financial institutions. This period has also seen further regulation and deregulation, aimed at promoting financial stability and innovation. From issuing their own paper money to embracing the digital age, banks have moved from being merely places to safeguard money to becoming integral parts of a complex financial system that supports economic growth and innovation. This evolution reflects changes in economic theories, government policies, technological advancements, and customer needs."},{"prompt":"make your response shorter now","completion":"In the past 200 years, U.S. banking has transformed from a fragmented system of local banks issuing their own currency to a unified system regulated by federal institutions like the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.

The latter half of the 20th century saw the end of the gold standard and the rise of digital banking, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scope of banking services.

Stephanie Brown, Tim Drake, Jason Todd, Damian Wayne, and Cassandra Cain stood in a semicircle, each wearing an expression that ranged from utter disbelief to bemused curiosity. Center stage in this tableau of confusion was, incredibly, a small, fluffy black rabbit with striking blue eyes. But it wasn\'t just any rabbit. Oh no. This one was different. It somehow possessed an unmistakable air of... familiarity. And if you looked closely, really closely, you might notice a tuft of fur atop its head that bore an uncanny resemblance to Dick Grayson\'s well-coiffed hair. \\"This... is something else...\\" Tim whispered, stealing a glance at his companions. Their mission debrief had taken an unexpected turn, to say the least. Stephanie, ever the optimist, crouched down for a closer look, while Jason crossed his arms, fighting the urge to smirk. Damian simply scowled, his default response to the inexplicable. Cassandra, on the other hand, looked on with a rare hint of amusement dancing in her eyes. The tension in the room was almost palpable until the rabbit—this small, improbable creature in their midst—opened its mouth to speak. The voice that emerged was unmistakably Dick\'s, albeit several octaves higher and unmistakably more... bunny-like. \\"...Uh... hi, guys. It\'s me,\\" the rabbit said, its voice a soft, fluffy echo in the vast Batcave. A collective silence followed, each member of the Bat-Family processing this surreal revelation in their own way. \\"Dick?\\" Stephanie finally managed, eyes wide with surprise. \\"Is that really you?\\" \\"In the fur,\\" the rabbit replied with a hint of his usual charm, somehow managing to offer what appeared to be a sheepish grin despite his current, um, limitations. \\"How...?\\" Tim started, only to shake his head in disbelief. The world of magic was not unknown to them, but this was unlike anything they had encountered before. \\"It\'s a long story,\\" Rabbit-Dick began, his whiskers twitching slightly with each word. \\"But it involves a mix-up with Zatanna, a magic show gone awry, and a very specific spell. I\'d appreciate it if we could jump straight to finding a solution. No pun intended.\\" Jason finally let out a laugh. \\"You\'ve got to be kidding me. This is priceless!\\" Damian rolled his eyes. \\"Only Grayson would manage to get himself turned into a rabbit.\\" Cassandra simply nodded, a smile playing at the edges of her lips. As the initial shock wore off, the Bat-Family rallied around their long-eared companion. They were a team, after all, and not even the most bizarre magic could change that. Embarking on a quest to return their brother to his human form, they found themselves navigating the oddities of magical realms, consulting with sorcerers, and deciphering ancient spells. Through it all, Rabbit-Dick offered guidance, humor, and the occasional motivational speech—albeit in a decidedly high-pitched tone. The adventure that followed would be one for the history books, not just because of its unusual nature, but because it underscored the unbreakable bond they shared. No matter the form, no matter the obstacle, the Bat-Family stood united.

I currently have the design on how it will be, it is a Pub/Sub architecture, where the EventManager is the message broker, and the other managers or any other class can subscribe for an event and then when it is published the event will be pushed to subscriber. class EventManager { public: ~EventManager(); EventManager(const EventManager&) = delete; EventManager operator=(const EventManager&) = delete; static EventManager& GetInstance() noexcept; template<typename T> void Subscribe(std::function<void(std::shared_ptr<T>)> handler); void Publish(std::shared_ptr<Event> event); void Update(); //... } I have everything set to finish it but I got a question, in original SDL_Event, each event could have at least one type but can have multiple types of the same event. I want to change this to make one sub event class per type, so for example here: SDL_KeyboardEvent SDL_KEYDOWN SDL_KEYUP I would make 2 sub event classes, KeyboardKeyDownEvent and KeyboardKeyUpEvent, and then I would handle them in two different methods: And the usage would be like this: InputManager(EventManager& eventManager) { // Subscribe to specific event types eventManager.Subscribe<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>([this](std::shared_ptr<Event> event){ this->HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent(std::static_pointer_cast<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>(event)); }); eventManager.Subscribe<KeyboardKeyUpEvent>([this](std::shared_ptr<Event> event){ this->HandleKeyboardKeyUpEvent(std::static_pointer_cast<KeyboardKeyUpEvent>(event)); }); } void HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent(std::shared_ptr<KeyboardEvent> event) { // Process the keyboard down event } void HandleKeyboardKeyUpEvent(std::shared_ptr<KeyboardEvent> event) { // Process the keyboard down event } Is this a good design or not?","completion":"Your approach to breaking down SDL\'s event types into individual classes for each event type (like `KeyboardKeyDownEvent` and `KeyboardKeyUpEvent`) is a good design for several reasons: 1. **Type Safety:** By defining separate classes for different event types, you leverage C++\'s strong type system. This makes your event handling code clearer and less prone to errors, as you can\'t accidentally use a keyboard event where a mouse event is expected, for example. 2. **Extensibility:** With each event type being a separate class, it\'s easy to add new event types or modify existing ones without risking the stability of other event handlers. This makes your EventManager and the system as a whole more adaptable to future requirements or changes in SDL itself. 3. **Cleaner Code:** Your code becomes more readable and maintainable. Each event handler is explicitly designed for its purpose, and it\'s clear from the subscription code what type of events a particular subscriber cares about. This explicit nature is beneficial during both development and maintenance phases. 4. **Flexibility in Handling Events:** Some events might require additional data or behavior. Having separate classes allows you to elegantly incorporate these requirements without cluttering a monolithic event class with conditional logic or rarely used member variables. 5. **Performance Consideration:** If your game or engine performance is critical, having separate classes could potentially lead to more efficient handlers since each handler deals with only one event type. The overhead of handling type differentiation is moved to compile time (through templates) rather than runtime. However, there are also considerations to keep in mind: - **Template Complexity:** The use of templates and `std::function` for subscribing handlers can introduce complexity, especially if the error messages become less clear or if you encounter challenges with template instantiation. Make sure the benefits outweigh these potential complexities for your team or project. - **Event Class Proliferation:** Depending on the number of different event types SDL supports and how many of them you plan to use, you might end up with a large number of small classes. While this is not inherently bad, it does increase the number of files and classes you need to manage. Ensure your project\'s structure and naming conventions are well-organized to handle this gracefully. - **Memory Considerations:** Using `std::shared_ptr` for events is generally fine and ensures easy memory management, especially if events are passed around or stored. However, be mindful of unnecessary copying or circular references that could lead to memory leaks. In summary, your design choice aligns well with modern C++ best practices and can lead to a clean, flexible, and maintainable codebase. Keep the considerations in mind and ensure your implementation details, like template usage and class structure, are handled judiciously to get the most out of this design."},{"prompt":"OK yeah I can see the class proliferation now, this is the structure I am planning, as you can see there are tons of classes but I think all of these are needed if I want to support every type of event and be future-proof if I add more things to my project like Touch support, what do you think about this?

While the structure promises highly readable, maintainable, and extendable code, managing the proliferation of classes indeed requires careful consideration. Here are some thoughts and potential strategies for working with this extensive design: # 1. Modularization With a significant number of event classes, ensuring your project is well-organized becomes crucial. Consider grouping related event classes into appropriate modules or namespaces. For example, all joystick-related events could be under a `JoystickEvents` namespace or module. This not only helps in managing the code but also in understanding the event system\'s structure at a glance. # 2. Factory Pattern Depending on how events are instantiated and dispatched, a factory pattern might help manage the creation of event objects. This could be especially useful if events need to be created from SDL events dynamically, as it abstracts the instantiation logic into a single location and helps with maintaining the code when new event types are added. # 3. Documentation With a wide variety of event types, comprehensive documentation becomes indispensable. Ensure that each event class and its intended use case are well-documented. This not only helps current development efforts but also ensures that future developers, or even future you, can easily understand and work with the event system. # 4. Performance Considerations Given the use of `std::shared_ptr` for events and a potentially large number of event objects, keep an eye on the performance impact, especially in high-frequency event scenarios like `SDL_MOUSEMOTION`. In most cases, the overhead will be negligible, but it\'s something to keep in mind and profile, particularly for performance-critical applications. # 5. Template Metaprogramming Your event subscription mechanism uses templates, which is a powerful feature of C++. However, template metaprogramming can introduce complexity and obscure errors. Ensure that the template usage is as clean and simple as possible, and consider providing clear error messages or static assertions to aid in debugging template-related issues. # 6. Refactoring and Extensibility While your current design aims to be future-proof, remain open to refactoring as your project evolves. You might find that certain event classes could be generalized or that new features in SDL or your own game engine necessitate adjustments to the event handling model. # 7. Testing With such a granular event system, unit testing becomes ever more critical. Ensure each event class and its associated handlers are well-covered by tests to prevent regressions and to verify that events are dispatched and handled as expected. # Conclusion Your structured approach to separate classes for each event type reflects good software engineering principles. However, it\'s accompanied by the overhead of managing a larger codebase. By applying strategies like modularization, utilizing design patterns where appropriate, maintaining thorough documentation, and committing to robust testing practices, you can mitigate these challenges and ensure that your event system remains a strong foundation of your game engine."},{"prompt":"Can you explain more on your Modularization point and how can I group several classes together, what do you mean about this grouping and how can I achieve it? Are these namespaces or modules in a different folder or what do you mean?","completion":"Certainly! Modularization in the context of your C++ project involves organizing related classes (such as event classes) in a way that keeps the project clean, manageable, and understandable. This can be achieved through various methods including, but not limited to, namespaces, directory structure, and potentially C++20 modules, depending on your project\'s needs and constraints. Let\'s break these down: # 1. Namespaces Using C++ namespaces is a straightforward way to logically group related classes without imposing physical file structure constraints. Namespaces can span multiple files and offer a way to avoid name collisions, making them ideal for grouping your event classes. For example, you might have: ```cpp namespace SDLWrapper { namespace Events { // Define your SDL event wrappers here class KeyboardKeyDownEvent { /*...*/ }; class KeyboardKeyUpEvent { /*...*/ }; // More event classes... } // namespace Events } // namespace SDLWrapper ``` This way, all event classes are encapsulated within the `SDLWrapper::Events` namespace, which makes their relation and purpose clear. # 2. Directory Structure Directory structure involves organizing your files (and hence, the classes within those files) into folders that represent different modules or logical groupings. This is more about physical organization on the filesystem and works hand-in-hand with namespaces to provide both logical and physical organization to your codebase. Following the previous example, your directory structure might look like this: ``` /YourProject /src /SDLWrapper /Events KeyboardEvents.cpp KeyboardEvents.hpp MouseEvents.cpp MouseEvents.hpp // Other event files... ``` Each `.cpp` and `.hpp` file would contain the relevant event class implementations and definitions. This structure makes it easy to locate related files and understand the project\'s organization at a glance. # 3. C++20 Modules (Optional and Forward-Looking) C++20 introduced a new way to organize code into modules. This is somewhat more advanced and not as widely supported or used as the previous two methods but offers a modern alternative that could replace or complement traditional header-files and namespaces for organizing code. Modules aim to improve compile times, make C++ projects easier to manage, and reduce issues like name collisions and header bloat. If you\'re on a toolchain that supports C++20 modules, you could explore organizing your event classes into different modules. However, this approach requires a compatible build system and toolchain, and understanding the nuances of C++ module exports and imports. # Combining Approaches In practice, a combination of namespaces and directory structure is often used. You\'ll define logical groupings with namespaces and mirror these groupings in your filesystem\'s directory structure. This approach leverages the benefits of both methods, providing clear logical organization while also keeping the physical layout of your project files manageable and intuitive. Adopting such modularization strategies not only aids in keeping the codebase organized but also enhances maintainability and scalability, making it easier to navigate the complexities of a growing project like your SDL-based game engine."},{"prompt":"So far I haven\'t utilized namespaces in my project since I didn\'t had that many classes to begin with, so what you mean is like this, correct me if I am wrong: 1) Creating each .h and .cpp for each event. 2) In each of the .h files, add the namepace events. 3) Move all the events to the events subfolder. 4) Use the events namespace to access its classes from my other classes outside this namespace. Questions: - In the classes outside the namespace, I have to import this namespace or I should when including add the namespace before the name, like #include \\"Events/KeyboardKeyDownEvent.h\\" or something like that? - What would happen with the Event base class, this should be in the same namespace too or can be outside?","completion":"Yes, you\'ve got the right idea about using namespaces and organizing your event-related classes. Let\'s clarify your questions with more detailed answers: # Including Namespaced Classes When you include a header file that is part of a namespace, you typically do not include the namespace in the `#include` directive itself. The namespace is defined within the header file. What you discussed, like having each event type in its own `.h` and `.cpp` file, and moving them into an `events` subfolder, is correct. Here\'s a bit more detail: 1. **Creating Each .h and .cpp for Each Event:** - This is a good approach for keeping your code organized and manageable, especially as the number of event types grows. 2. **In Each of the .h Files, Add the Namespace Events:** - Yes, enclose the class definitions in the `events` namespace (or whatever namespace name you choose). 3. **Move All the Events to the Events Subfolder:** - This physical organization mirrors the logical organization you\'ve set up with namespaces. 4. **Use the Events Namespace to Access Its Classes from Other Classes:** - From outside the namespace, you can access these classes either by prefixing the class name with the namespace (e.g., `events::KeyboardKeyDownEvent`) or by using a using-directive (e.g., `using namespace events;`) though be cautious with the latter as it can introduce name collisions. # Questions Answered: - **Importing Namespaces/Including Headers:** - You include headers normally, using the path relative to your project\'s include directory or the file being compiled, without mentioning the namespace. For example: ```cpp #include \\"Events/KeyboardKeyDownEvent.h\\" ``` - The namespace is used in the code where you refer to the classes, not in the `#include` path. - **Regarding the Event Base Class:** - The base class `Event` that all specific events inherit from should logically reside within the same namespace (`events`) since it is part of the same module/group of functionality. - This means placing the `Event` class definition within the `events` namespace in its header file. By doing so, you maintain consistency, and it\'s clear that the `Event` class is related to all other event classes. - It\'s just like the specific event classes, you’d include its header file where needed with something like `#include \\"Events/Event.h\\"` and refer to it as `events::Event` outside the namespace. # Examples: **Event.h:** ```cpp // In Events/Event.h namespace events { class Event { // Base event stuff }; } ``` **KeyboardKeyDownEvent.h:** ```cpp // In Events/KeyboardKeyDownEvent.h #include \\"Event.h\\" namespace events { class KeyboardKeyDownEvent : public Event { // Keyboard key down specific stuff }; } ``` **Usage Outside Namespace:** ```cpp // In some other file #include \\"Events/KeyboardKeyDownEvent.h\\" void function() { events::KeyboardKeyDownEvent event; // Do something with event } ``` This approach should help maintain a clean, organized, and scalable project structure as your game engine evolves."},{"prompt":"I see by your example that there isn\'t a direct relationship between the name of the namespace and the folder structure, so that means I could move the events to their own folder and not using their own namespace, right? So that way I don\'t add the overhead of using a new namespace but also keep my code organized, what do you think? Is this a good way or not?","completion":"Indeed, the relationship between namespaces and folder/directory structure in C++ projects is more about conceptual organization and convention rather than a requirement enforced by the language itself, unlike some other programming environments like Java. You can organize your files into folders for physical organization without necessarily mirroring this structure in namespaces. This approach can blend the benefits of keeping your codebase organized while avoiding the complexity of managing multiple namespaces. Here’s how this could be beneficial or present challenges: # Benefits: 1. **Simplified Naming:** By avoiding the proliferation of namespaces, you reduce the potential for overly verbose or nested naming conventions, which can make the code easier to read and write, especially for smaller projects or teams. 2. **Ease of Use:** Newcomers to the project or less experienced programmers might find a simpler namespace strategy easier to understand and navigate, reducing the learning curve associated with the project\'s structure. 3. **Flexibility in Organization:** Without being tied to a namespace structure, you may find it easier to reorganize the physical structure of your project as it evolves, without needing to refactor the namespace usage across files. # Challenges: 1. **Potential for Name Collisions:** Namespace segmentation serves not only organizational purposes but also helps prevent name collisions between classes, functions, and other identifiers. With a reduced number of namespaces, there’s an increased risk of naming conflicts, especially as the project grows. 2. **Reduced Logical Segregation:** While the physical (folder) organization might remain clear, the lack of namespaces can make the logical association between parts of the project less obvious. This could potentially make understanding the codebase at a high level more challenging, particularly for those who are familiar with using namespaces as a means of navigating code logic. 3. **Refactoring Limitations:** If later you decide to introduce more namespaces to address these challenges, it could require significant refactoring, especially in a larger codebase with many interdependencies. # Good Practices for Folder-Only Organization: - **Clear Directory Structure:** Maintain a clear and logical directory structure that reflects the components and their relationships within your project. - **Consistent Naming Schemes:** Adopt consistent naming schemes for your files and classes. This can somewhat mitigate the risk of name collisions and help keep the codebase navigable. - **Document Organization:** Since the logical grouping won’t be as apparent through namespaces, ensure that your project documentation clearly explains the structure and organization of your code. # Conclusion: Choosing to organize your events (or other components) in their own folder without adopting a distinct namespace for each grouping can be a viable way to keep your code organized, especially in smaller projects or in cases where namespace management could introduce unnecessary complexity. It’s a trade-off between simplicity and the benefits namespaces provide for avoiding conflicts and emphasizing logical structure. Ultimately, the best approach depends on the specific needs, scale, and future growth expectations of your project. It is also influenced by the preferences of your development team and the specific challenges you encounter as your engine evolves. Starting simpler can be a good strategy, with the understanding that a careful, planned transition to more namespaces can be undertaken as needed."},{"prompt":"OK I am leaning to this approach since I haven\'t used namespaces in other parts, so it won\'t be a problem, if I decide to switch to namespaces later I would just refactor the code. Since each event will be unique, there won\'t be any collisions, so that is not a problem. The logical association since it will an small subset of the entire code it could be negligible. What do you think? Now choosing this approach, should I move the Event base class to the event folder too or keep it outside this folder?","completion":"Given the considerations you\'ve outlined, your inclination toward adopting a folder-based organization without introducing additional namespaces seems reasonable and well-justified for your project\'s current scope and complexity. As you\'ve mentioned, if each event name is unique and you\'re confident about maintaining uniqueness as your project grows, the risk of naming collisions is minimal. Logical association within a smaller subset of your overall codebase, especially with well-named directories and files, should indeed be manageable and won\'t significantly detract from the understandability of your project. # Moving the Event Base Class: Since the `Event` base class serves as a foundational component of your event system, placing it within the same events folder as your concrete event classes makes sense for several reasons: 1. **Cohesion:** Keeping the base class close to its derivatives physically emphasizes their interrelationship and makes it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to locate all related event handling code in one place. 2. **Ease of Maintenance:** Any modifications to the event handling mechanism, whether to the base class or its derivatives, will involve changes localized mainly within the same directory. Thus, it simplifies navigability and maintenance. 3. **Consistency:** Adopting a consistent organizational pattern helps. If all event-related classes are handled similarly (i.e., placed in the same directory), it establishes a clear guideline for where new event classes should be placed in the future. Therefore, moving the `Event` base class to the events folder is advisable. It aligns with keeping your project structure organized and intuitive. # Refactoring to Namespaces Later: Should your project grow in complexity, or should you later decide that introducing more granular namespaces has become beneficial, refactoring your code to incorporate namespaces would be a viable step. Modern IDEs and development tools offer reliable refactoring capabilities that can significantly streamline this process. Moreover, since this change would primarily consist of adding namespace declarations and adjusting `#include` directives or using statements, it\'s relatively low-risk in terms of introducing bugs, provided that changes are made carefully and tested thoroughly. # Final Thoughts: Your current approach appears well-suited for your project\'s needs and aligns with keeping things simple yet organized. It\'s a pragmatic decision that keeps the door open for future adjustments as necessary without overcomplicating your codebase from the outset. Should you choose to refactor and introduce namespaces later, it would be a straightforward process that aligns with the natural evolution of software projects as they grow and become more complex. Starting with a simpler structure allows you to focus on core functionality now and adapt your organizational strategies as the scope or requirements of your engine evolve."},{"prompt":"Perfect!

Since `DisplayConnectedEvent` is derived from `Event`, one might expect this to work seamlessly due to polymorphism. However, for polymorphism to work correctly with smart pointers, you need to ensure proper inheritance, including using `public` inheritance and enabling polymorphic behavior through virtual functions if necessary. To address the error: 1. **Ensure Public Inheritance:** Make sure `DisplayConnectedEvent` inherits from `Event` using public inheritance. It seems you\'re missing the `public` keyword in your class inheritance declaration. 2. **Virtual Destructor in Base Class:** The base class `Event` should have a virtual destructor. This is important for polymorphism, especially when deleting derived class objects through base class pointers. Here\'s how you could adjust your classes to fix the issue: # Adjusting the Base `Event` Class: Make sure `Event` has a virtual destructor, which is essential for a polymorphic base class. ```cpp class Event { public: virtual ~Event() = default; // Other members... }; ``` # Adjusting the Derived `DisplayConnectedEvent` Class: Ensure it publicly inherits from `Event`. ```cpp #include \\"Event.h\\" // Adjust the path as necessary class DisplayConnectedEvent : public Event { public: DisplayConnectedEvent(uint32_t display) : display(display) {} // Initialize display in the constructor initializer list ~DisplayConnectedEvent() override = default; uint32_t GetDisplay() const { return display; } // Adding \'const\' to the getter as it doesn\'t modify the object private: uint32_t display; }; ``` # Adjusting `EventFromSDL` Function: With the above changes, your `EventFromSDL` function inside `EventConverter` should now work correctly, because `std::make_shared<DisplayConnectedEvent>(...)` will rightly return a `std::shared_ptr<DisplayConnectedEvent>`, which can be implicitly converted to a `std::shared_ptr<Event>` due to the `public` inheritance and the polymorphic nature of the base class. The function signature and switch case remain unchanged, as the adjustments to the class definitions have resolved the issue. # Quick Note: Make sure all include paths and directives are correct, matching the actual file locations and names. The compiler needs to find the correct header files to recognize class definitions and inheritance hierarchies properly. By following these steps, you should be able to fix the compilation error and enable a polymorphic relationship between your `Event` and `DisplayConnectedEvent` classes, leveraging smart pointers effectively."},{"prompt":"check this: Technical Details The project is comprised in four different modules/components: Statistical report as a new CLI-option This component involves building an additional CLI module to cooltools and its respective library module, inspired by this current issue: https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/issues/415. The main idea of this component is to calculate and report comprehensive statistics for any .cool file. The associated stats comprise the number of contact points across regions (cis/trans), fraction of contacts within and between regions, distance decay of contacts, among others, that could be restrained to a specific region(s) or chromosome(s) specified by the user. This component will offer easier parallelization strategies achieved by PyO3 and Rust modules to make it faster and easier to implement. The module will be called “coolstats.py” and will use the current dependencies cooltools uses to parse command-line arguments (click). Additionally, will construct similar classes as seen in pairtools, another software produce by the Open2C team, with similar structures (e.g. CoolCounter class) and functions. However, to preserve independence and a better organization, each metric will have its own function. The proposed output is a .txt file with the organized stats and additional plots representing those results saved to the current directory by default or any directory the user specifies with the flag -d/–dir. Other types of formats or the specific layout will be discussed with the team. CLI-related functionality corrections Solve current issues related to the CLI behavior, such as smoothing and aggregation across regions in get_expected_cis() or dropping headers for fetch_chromsizes(), and also implement alternate reductions for aggregation across diagonals, such as variance or standard deviation, adding new arguments to control these features preserving the current functionality as default. These changes can be achieved with the current code and without any extra dependencies. Furthermore, this component will be implemented with its respective documentation following the current guidelines of Open2C and unit tests to ensure the viability of the software. Refactoring of current structures Using the initial ideas from here: https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/issues/227 and here https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/issues/502, I plan to implement a new class for snipper (called Snipper) and re-use the current methods attached. Additional modifications will be added to enhance the functionality and solve current issues, such as decoupling selecting and snipping methods (e.g. snipper.select() and snipper.snip()) and converting bed-like inputs to 2D structures (e.g. bedpe) to reduce overheading over subsequent conversions. As part of this refactoring, I also plan to create a separate mini-repository to store log-smoothing-related functions that will be used not only by cooltools but the whole Open2C ecosystem. The basic functionality of the latter will comprise operating over the core cooltools structures (e.g. numpy arrays and pandas dataframes) with flexibility on column names. Rust-based acceleration of core modules and polars as an efficient alternative Based on a current issue, some parts of cooltools can improve by parallelization strategies, as seen here: https://github.com/open2c/cooltools/commit/c6b705d7aac895006efe797cb22da332793a7ae2#commitcomment-84603046, for example. As mentioned in the first component here, using PyO3 and Rust could be of great advantage. Here, a function called “send_chunk()” will receive a subset of the Hi-C contact matrix that corresponds to a specific genomic region and the parameters to perform the calculations in parallel using the rayon crate. On the other hand, I propose to explore the possibility of using the polars package, a query engine for dataframes natively multi-threaded, to perform dataframe calculations currently done using pandas. Since polars have demonstrated to be way faster than pandas in tasks related to querying, grouping or sorting (see https://medium.com/cuenex/pandas-2-0-vs-polars-the-ultimate-battle-a378eb75d6d1), and also considering that polars can accept pandas dataframes as inputs, benchmarking current cooltools operations using polars instead of pandas could potentially lead to significant advantages. I plan to apply this proposal first to functions using “sort_values()” and benchmark them against the current implementation. This also could be applied to other Open2C tools, such as bioframe, within the sort_bedframe() function. Based on all that, please do this: Abstract (Summary) Short description of your project.

A key feature includes the development of a new CLI option for generating comprehensive statistical reports from .cool files, enabling users to obtain detailed insights into contact points, regions, and distance decay of contacts. This will be supported by leveraging the efficiency of Rust and PyO3 for parallel processing. The project also addresses current CLI issues, optimizing user experience and functionality without introducing additional dependencies. Refactoring efforts will lead to more modular and efficient code, with particular attention to improving the handling of snipper functions and bed-like inputs. Additionally, the integration of the polars package for data frame operations proposes a significant performance boost over traditional pandas operations.

These files are often used in Unix and Linux systems for distributing source code or binary programs. Below is a general guide on how to handle a `.tar.bz2` file. This guide assumes you are working on a Unix-like operating system, such as Linux or macOS. # Step 1: Extract the `.tar.bz2` File 1. Open a terminal. 2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.tar.bz2` file using the `cd` command. For example: ```sh cd ~/Downloads/ ``` 3. Use the `tar` command to extract the file: ```sh tar -xjf name_of_file.tar.bz2 ``` - `-x` tells `tar` to extract files. - `-j` is used for `bzip2` decompression. - `-f` specifies that you are providing a filename. 4. This will extract the contents into a folder within the current directory. Use `ls` to see the newly created folder and `cd` to move into it: ```sh cd extracted_folder_name/ ``` # Step 2: Install the Contents of the `.tar.bz2` File The installation steps can vary significantly depending on what you have extracted. Common scenarios include: - **Precompiled binaries:** Sometimes, the `.tar.bz2` file contains an executable or a set of executables that you can run directly without installation. You might need to set execution permissions with `chmod +x filename` before running it with `./filename`. - **Source code that needs to be compiled:** If the archive contains source code, the general steps to compile it (though this might vary) are: 1. Check if there\'s a `README` or `INSTALL` file with specific installation instructions and follow them. 2. Commonly, you will need to run `./configure`, then `make`, and finally `sudo make install`, like this: ```sh ./configure make sudo make install ``` This will compile the source code into binaries and install them on your system. - **Python packages:** If it’s a Python package, it might be installable using `pip`. Navigate to the top-level directory (where `setup.py` is located) and run: ```sh pip install . ``` Note: It\'s recommended to use a virtual environment for Python package installations to avoid conflicting dependencies. - **Generic installation script:** It might come with an installation script like `install.sh`. Run the script with `./install.sh` (you might need to make it executable first with `chmod +x install.sh`). # Additional Note: Always be cautious about what you install and how you install it. Make sure you trust the source of the `.tar.bz2` file. Preferably, always look for documentation or installation instructions provided by the maintainer/creator of the software for the most accurate installation process."},{"prompt":"can i open it in ubuntu?","completion":"Yes, you can open a `.tar.bz2` file in Ubuntu. The `.tar.bz2` format is a type of compressed file, essentially a tarball (`.tar`) compressed using Bzip2 (`.bz2`). This format is widely used in Unix-based systems like Ubuntu for distributing files and source code due to its high compression ratio. Here’s how you can open (extract) it and potentially install its contents on Ubuntu: # Extracting the `.tar.bz2` File 1. **Using the Terminal:** Open the terminal application in Ubuntu. You can find it by searching for it in the Show Applications menu or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+T`. 2. **Navigate to the File Location:** Use the `cd` command to change directories to the location where your `.tar.bz2` file is located. For example, if it is in the Downloads folder: ```sh cd ~/Downloads ``` 3. **Extract the File:** Use the `tar` command to extract the contents of the file: ```sh tar -xjf name_of_file.tar.bz2 ``` The options used are: - `-x`: extract files from an archive - `-j`: filter the archive through `bzip2` for decompression - `-f`: use archive file After running this command, the contents of the archive will be extracted to the current working directory. # Post Extraction After extraction, what you do next depends on what the `.tar.bz2` file contained: - **If it contains a program or script**, you may need to make it executable with `chmod +x filename` before you can run it with `./filename`. - **If it contains source code**, there might be a `README` or `INSTALL` text file explaining how to compile and install the software. The typical sequence of commands for compiling and installing from source is: ```sh ./configure make sudo make install ``` Ensure you have the necessary compilers installed (for example, `build-essential` for C/C++ compilation in Ubuntu). - **If it\'s a package meant for Python**, and if there\'s a `setup.py` file, you might install it using `pip` (ideally within a virtual environment): ```sh pip install . ``` # Using a GUI If you prefer not to use the command line, Ubuntu also allows you to open `.tar.bz2` files graphically: 1. **Navigate to the file** using the File Manager. 2. **Right-click** on the `.tar.bz2` file. 3.

Whether you choose to install via `pip` (Python\'s package installer) or `conda` (a package manager from the Anaconda ecosystem) depends on your development environment and personal preference. Both methods are provided to give users options based on the tools they are comfortable with or the ones that best fit their workflow. # Things to Consider When Choosing Between `pip` and `conda`: - **Environment Management**: If you are using Conda as your primary environment manager, it might be preferable to install packages through Conda when available, as this can help avoid compatibility issues. - **Availability**: Some packages are only available on PyPI and not on Conda, or vice versa. However, in this case, the `intel-extension-for-transformers` is available through both managers. - **Dependencies**: Conda attempts to install all dependencies of a package at once, potentially leading to fewer compatibility problems.

Let\'s break down the meaning and implications of this recommendation: 1. **Protobuf**: Protobuf, short for Protocol Buffers, is a method developed by Google for serializing structured data. It is similar to XML or JSON, but faster and more compact. Protobuf is often used in applications for communication protocols, data storage, etc. 2. **onnxruntime**: ONNX Runtime is a performance-focused engine for Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) models. It enables models trained in various frameworks, like PyTorch or TensorFlow, to be converted to the ONNX format and then efficiently run. This makes it easier to deploy machine learning models across a wide range of platforms and devices. 3. **The Recommendation**: - When you are using **`onnxruntime` version 1.11 or lower**, it is recommended to **limit the version of `protobuf` to 3.20.0 or lower**. - This recommendation is made because specific versions of ONNX Runtime have been tested and are known to work reliably with certain versions of Protobuf. Using a version of Protobuf that is too new could potentially introduce compatibility issues, bugs, or unexpected behavior in ONNX Runtime due to changes or updates in Protobuf that are not supported by the older version of ONNX Runtime. 4. **Why This Matters**: - Compatibility between these packages is crucial for data serialization and deserialization, especially when dealing with machine learning models where precise data representation is critical. - Adhering to this guideline ensures that your environment remains stable and that the ONNX models run as expected without encountering serialization-related errors. 5. **How to Apply This Recommendation**: When setting up your environment, you should explicitly specify the version of Protobuf that meets this recommendation if you are using or plan to use ONNX Runtime 1.11 or an older version. For Python, you can manage this with package managers like Pip or Conda. Here are the commands for both: - Using Pip: ```sh pip install \'protobuf<=3.20.0\' ``` - Using Conda: ```sh conda install protobuf=3.20.0 ``` Adhering to such specific version recommendations is a common practice in software development, especially in data science and machine learning projects, to ensure that the complex inter-dependencies between various packages do not lead to unexpected issues."},{"prompt":"\\"\\" 2. onnxruntime: ONNX Runtime is a performance-focused engine for Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) models.

However, this doesn\'t mean that the software can only be run or installed using Ubuntu\'s command line or Python scripts. The use of Ubuntu and Python in the documentation is likely for consistency and clarity since they\'re commonly used in the development and deployment of machine learning applications. # Use of Ubuntu Ubuntu is highlighted because: 1. **Popularity in the ML Community**: Ubuntu is a widely used Linux distribution in the machine learning and data science communities. Its stability, support, and ease of use make it a good choice for developers and researchers. 2. **Package Management**: Ubuntu\'s package management system (using `apt`) simplifies the installation of system libraries and software, which are frequently needed for developing and deploying machine learning models. 3. **Linux Preference**: Many tools and libraries in the data science ecosystem are developed and tested primarily on Linux due to its prevalence on servers and high-performance computing platforms. # Use of Python Python is the language of choice for many reasons: 1. **Popularity**: Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, especially in data science, machine learning, AI, and scientific computing. 2. **Ecosystem**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas) that facilitate machine learning tasks. 3. **Simplicity and Flexibility**: Python\'s syntax is clear and its dynamic nature allows for rapid experimentation and iteration, which is essential in research and development phases of machine learning projects. # Use of Command Line (Terminal) and PowerShell - **Command Line (Terminal) on Ubuntu**: The use of the command line in Ubuntu (or any Unix-like system) is preferred for its versatility and power in handling file operations, executing scripts, managing services, and interacting with system internals, which are common tasks in machine learning workflows. - **PowerShell/Command Prompt on Windows**: Similarly, instructions could also be provided for Windows environments using PowerShell or Command Prompt. The reason they\'re less frequently mentioned in machine learning documentation is due to a combination of Linux\'s stronger presence in this field and certain tools/libraries that are designed to run natively on Linux. However, many machine learning applications and libraries, including Python itself, can run on Windows. When documentation refers to Python commands (e.g., `pip install package_name`), those commands can typically be run in PowerShell or Command Prompt just as well, assuming Python is correctly installed and configured on the Windows system. # Cross-Platform Compatibility The Intel Extension for Transformers, being a Python package, should be compatible with any platform where Python and the necessary dependencies can be run. This includes Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions. For Windows users, PowerShell and Command Prompt can be used to install Python packages (using `pip`), manage virtual environments, and execute scripts, just like you would use the terminal in Ubuntu or any other Linux distribution. In summary, while the documentation may focus on Ubuntu and Python, the underlying tools and libraries are generally cross-platform, and similar steps can be followed on Windows using PowerShell or Command Prompt with some adjustments for differences in the operating system environment."},{"prompt":"explain neural chat to me like i am a layperson: \\"\\"Skip to content intel / intel-extension-for-transformers Type / to search Code Issues 31 Pull requests 14 Discussions Actions Projects Security Insights Files Go to file t .github conda_meta docker docs examples intel_extension_for_transformers haystack langchain llama_index neural_chat assets cli docker docs examples models pipeline prompts server serving/triton/text_generation tests tools ui utils README.md __init__.py chatbot.py config.py config_logging.py errorcode.py plugins.py requirements.txt requirements_cpu.txt requirements_hpu.txt requirements_pc.txt requirements_xpu.txt tools transformers __init__.py tests workflows .dockerignore .gitignore .gitmodules .gitpod.yml .pre-commit-config.yaml LICENSE MANIFEST.in README.md SECURITY.md env_gpu.sh requirements-cpu.txt requirements.txt setup.py third_party_programs.txt Breadcrumbsintel-extension-for-transformers/intel_extension_for_transformers /neural_chat/ Directory actionsAdd file More options Latest commit letonghan letonghan [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… 99df35d · yesterday History Breadcrumbsintel-extension-for-transformers/intel_extension_for_transformers /neural_chat/ Folders and files Name Last commit message Last commit date parent directory .. assets Update Quickstart NeuralChat notebook for workshops (#1331) 3 weeks ago cli Fix finetuning unit test issue (#1367) 2 weeks ago docker modify readme (#1384) last week docs [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week examples [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week models [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week pipeline update retrieval requirements (#1415) yesterday prompts [NeuralChat] Add readme, add content length filter, fix build error (#… last week server [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… yesterday serving/triton/text_generation [NeuralChat] CUDA serving with Triton Inference Server (#1293) last month tests [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… yesterday tools refined readme of ROME.

This file is essential for specifying all the Python package dependencies needed for your project on a CPU environment. Here\'s how you can resolve this issue: # 1. Ensure You\'re in the Correct Directory The most common reason for this error is being in the wrong directory. Ensure you\'re in the directory where `requirements_cpu.txt` is located. If you have just cloned a repository or downloaded the project, make sure you navigate (`cd`) into the project\'s root directory where this file is supposed to be. For example, if your project (and thus, the requirements file) is located in `C:UsersbowerMyProject`, you need to change your current directory to `MyProject`: ```bash cd C:UsersbowerMyProject ``` # 2. Check if the File Exists Before trying to install again, confirm that `requirements_cpu.txt` actually exists in your current directory: ```bash dir ``` This command will list all the files and directories in your current location. Look for `requirements_cpu.txt` in the list. If you don\'t see it, you\'re either in the wrong directory (see step 1) or the file does not exist where you expected. # 3. Obtain the File If you\'ve determined the file is indeed missing: - **If you\'re following a tutorial or course**: The `requirements_cpu.txt` file might be provided as part of the course materials. Download it from the course website or repository. - **If the project is from a repository**: Clone or download the project repository again, ensuring you\'re getting the correct branch or version that should include the `requirements_cpu.txt` file. - **If you\'re creating your own project**: You may need to create this file yourself. Typically, `requirements.txt` contains a list of Python packages your project depends on. You can use `pip freeze > requirements_cpu.txt` to generate a list of all installed packages in your environment; however, this isn\'t always advisable for creating a clean, minimal dependencies file for a project. # 4. Verify the Path If you\'re sure the file exists and you\'re in the correct directory, double-check the file name for typos. Perhaps it\'s named slightly differently, like just `requirements.txt` or has a path that wasn\'t correctly specified. # Creating a requirements.txt File If you intended to create a `requirements_cpu.txt` but haven\'t yet, and you know which packages you need, you simply create a new text file with that name and list each required package in the file, one package per line, like so: ```plaintext flask numpy==1.18.1 pandas ``` Then save this file in the appropriate project directory and run the `pip install -r requirements_cpu.txt` command again. Following these steps should help you resolve the issue with the `requirements_cpu.txt` file not being found."},{"prompt":"i\'m trying to follow the guide on this page for cpu : \\"\\"Skip to content intel / intel-extension-for-transformers Type / to search Code Issues 31 Pull requests 14 Discussions Actions Projects Security Insights Files Go to file t .github conda_meta docker docs examples intel_extension_for_transformers haystack langchain llama_index neural_chat assets cli docker docs examples models pipeline prompts server serving/triton/text_generation tests tools ui utils README.md __init__.py chatbot.py config.py config_logging.py errorcode.py plugins.py requirements.txt requirements_cpu.txt requirements_hpu.txt requirements_pc.txt requirements_xpu.txt tools transformers __init__.py tests workflows .dockerignore .gitignore .gitmodules .gitpod.yml .pre-commit-config.yaml LICENSE MANIFEST.in README.md SECURITY.md env_gpu.sh requirements-cpu.txt requirements.txt setup.py third_party_programs.txt Breadcrumbsintel-extension-for-transformers/intel_extension_for_transformers /neural_chat/ Directory actionsAdd file More options Latest commit letonghan letonghan [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… 99df35d · yesterday History Breadcrumbsintel-extension-for-transformers/intel_extension_for_transformers /neural_chat/ Folders and files Name Last commit message Last commit date parent directory .. assets Update Quickstart NeuralChat notebook for workshops (#1331) 3 weeks ago cli Fix finetuning unit test issue (#1367) 2 weeks ago docker modify readme (#1384) last week docs [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week examples [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week models [Reorg Folder] reorg transformers and langchain folders (#1360) last week pipeline update retrieval requirements (#1415) yesterday prompts [NeuralChat] Add readme, add content length filter, fix build error (#… last week server [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… yesterday serving/triton/text_generation [NeuralChat] CUDA serving with Triton Inference Server (#1293) last month tests [NeuralChat] Support language detection & translation for RAG chat (#… yesterday tools refined readme of ROME.

NeuralChat service can also be accessible through OpenAI client library, curl commands, and requests library. See neuralchat_api.md.\\"\\" i am a layperson","completion":"Sure, I\'ll break it down into simpler terms: # NeuralChat and OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs: 1. **NeuralChat** is a software tool that uses artificial intelligence to help you build applications that can understand and generate human-like text. This can be particularly useful for creating chatbots or other applications requiring natural language processing. 2. **OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs**: OpenAI is a company that also creates artificial intelligence tools, and they have their own way for programs to communicate with their tools, known as APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs are like menus in a restaurant for programs, telling them what requests they can make and how to make them. RESTful is just a style of these menus that is widely used because it\'s simple and works well on the web. When NeuralChat says it provides \\"OpenAI-compatible RESTful APIs,\\" it means that NeuralChat has made its menu very similar to OpenAI\'s. This is useful because if your program already knows how to order food from OpenAI\'s menu, it can order from NeuralChat\'s menu without needing to learn anything new. This makes it easier to switch from using OpenAI\'s tools to NeuralChat’s tools, or to use them both together. # Using NeuralChat: 1. **Drop-in replacement**: The term \\"drop-in replacement\\" means that you can switch out OpenAI\'s tools with NeuralChat in your applications, and everything should work just the same. It\'s like being able to swap your regular coffee brand with another without changing how you make it. 2. **Accessible through various tools**: NeuralChat can be interacted with using several different tools, making it flexible depending on what you\'re comfortable with or what the situation calls for: - **OpenAI client library**: This is a collection of code made available by OpenAI to make it easier to interact with their APIs. Because NeuralChat is compatible, you can use this same library to communicate with NeuralChat, too. - **curl commands**: curl is a command-line tool available on most computers that lets you make web requests. You can use it to send requests to NeuralChat and get responses back. - **requests library**: This is a Python library for making web requests. If you are writing a Python program that needs to talk to NeuralChat, the requests library is one way to do that. 3. **See neuralchat_api.md**: This likely refers to a document or file named `neuralchat_api.md` which contains more detailed information about how to use NeuralChat’s APIs — like a detailed section of the menu, listing all the options and how to order them. In essence, NeuralChat is built to be easily used by those familiar with OpenAI\'s tools, providing a versatile alternative for creating intelligent text-based applications."},{"prompt":"why are packages so slow to download in ubuntu and pip??","completion":"Download speeds for packages in Ubuntu (using `apt`) and Python packages (using `pip`) can vary based on several factors, which could contribute to the perception or reality of slow downloads. Here are some common reasons why package downloads might be slow, along with some potential solutions: # 1. Internet Connection Speed - **Problem**: If your internet connection itself is slow or unstable, downloads will naturally take longer. - **Solution**: Test your internet speed online. If it\'s slow, troubleshoot your connection, consider upgrading your internet plan, or try downloading during off-peak hours. # 2. Source Server Load or Bandwidth Limits - **Problem**: The server from which you\'re downloading packages might be under heavy load or have bandwidth limits. - **Solution**: Wait and try again later. For `pip`, you can also try using a different package index or mirror that is geographically closer to you or less busy. # 3. Package Size - **Problem**: Some packages, especially in the machine learning and data science ecosystem, are very large due to included datasets or models. - **Solution**: Patience is key here. Alternatively, ensure that you only download the packages you need, and check if there’s a \\"lite\\" version of the package that excludes large datasets or models. # 4. Mirrors or Source list is not Optimized - **Problem for Ubuntu (`apt`)**: The default mirrors in the source list might not be the fastest ones available for your location. - **Solution**: Use the \\"Software & Updates\\" setting in Ubuntu to find the best (fastest) mirror. You can also manually edit your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file to point to a faster repository mirror. # 5. Concurrent Downloads and System Load - **Problem**: Running multiple downloads or applications can saturate your bandwidth or system resources, making each individual download slower. - **Solution**: Limit concurrent downloads and close unnecessary applications to free up bandwidth and resources. # 6. DNS Resolution Delays - **Problem**: Slow DNS resolution can cause delays in establishing connections to the package servers. - **Solution**: Try changing your DNS server to a faster alternative like Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1). # 7. Local Network Issues - **Problem**: Issues with your local network, such as weak Wi-Fi signals or network congestion, can slow down downloads. - **Solution**: Try connecting via Ethernet if possible, move closer to your Wi-Fi router, or investigate and resolve any other local network issues. # 8. Cache Needs Updating (for `apt`) - **Problem**: An outdated package cache can sometimes cause issues. - **Solution**: Run `sudo apt update` to update the package lists and `sudo apt upgrade` to upgrade the installed packages, which might also improve performance. # Reducing the Perceived Waiting Time 1. **Download Only What\'s Necessary**: Especially with `pip`, carefully manage your dependencies to avoid installing unnecessary packages. 2. **Use Virtual Environments**: For Python, virtual environments can help manage dependencies more efficiently and may mitigate the need to download the same packages repeatedly for different projects. 3. **Check for Precompiled Binaries**: Some libraries have precompiled binaries (wheels) which are quicker to install than building from source. Ensure your pip is up to date (`pip install --upgrade pip`) to improve its handling of binary packages. By understanding and addressing these factors, you can often significantly improve your package download speeds in Ubuntu and when using `pip`."},{"prompt":"break down and explain this for me. note: i have a intel core chip and i want to runt the 4bit quantization: \\"\\" Intel® Neural Compressor latest▼ Click link above to switch version Search docs Getting Started Installation User Guide Examples APIs Release Legal Information Security Policy Repo Intel® Neural CompressorView page source Intel® Neural Compressor An open-source Python library supporting popular model compression techniques on all mainstream deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and MXNet) python version license coverage Downloads Architecture | Workflow | LLMs Recipes | Results | Documentations Intel® Neural Compressor aims to provide popular model compression techniques such as quantization, pruning (sparsity), distillation, and neural architecture search on mainstream frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and MXNet, as well as Intel extensions such as Intel Extension for TensorFlow and Intel Extension for PyTorch.

The Intel® Neural Compressor (INC) is a tool designed to help improve the efficiency and performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models on computers. It is akin to a toolkit that allows these models to run faster and consume less power, which is particularly beneficial when deploying AI in various devices and servers. INC supports popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others, making it versatile for different AI projects. # Key Features: - **Support for Various Hardware**: INC works with a range of Intel hardware (such as Intel Xeon processors and Intel Data Center GPUs), and even supports AMD CPUs, ARM CPUs, and Nvidia GPUs to some extent. This means it can be used on a wide variety of computers and servers. - **Model Optimization Techniques**: INC uses techniques like quantization (simplifying the model to run faster), pruning (removing unneeded parts of the model), and others to make AI models more efficient. For instance, converting certain parts of an AI model to use 4 bits instead of the usual 16 or 32 can significantly speed up its operation with minimal impact on its accuracy. - **Pre-tested Models**: The tool has been verified on various popular AI models (like GPT-J, LLama2, and more), ensuring it can be applied to a wide range of existing models without causing errors or significant drops in performance. - **Collaboration with Major Platforms**: INC works with cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, making it suitable for AI models deployed in the cloud. # Getting Started: - **Installation**: INC can be installed with a simple `pip install neural-compressor` command in your coding environment, making it straightforward to get started. - **Usage Examples**: The documentation includes examples on how to apply INC to your models, specifically showcasing how to perform tasks like \\"Weight-Only Quantization\\" for models including Large Language Models (LLMs). # Weight-Only Quantization with 4-bit Example: - **Simplified Example**: Imagine you have a large AI model like GPT-Neo (a text-generating model). INC allows you to make this model run faster by simplifying the model\'s weight (a crucial component of AI models that determines their output) without rewriting the model from scratch. You could potentially reduce these weights to use only 4 bits, making the model much lighter and quicker. - **Running the Example**: The steps involve first installing INC and related packages, then using INC\'s functionality to apply this \\"weight-only\\" simplification, selecting the best method automatically. There\'s a note about using specific Docker images for Intel Gaudi2 hardware, indicating that for specialized environments, you can follow tailored instructions for setup. # Documentation and Support: The provided documentation covers various technical and in-depth topics, including the architecture of INC, workflow, recipes for LLMs, and results. Additionally, it mentions communities and communication channels like GitHub, email, and Discord for seeking help or discussing ideas related to model compression. # In Simple Terms: Think of the Intel® Neural Compressor as a toolbox that allows your AI models to go on a \\"diet,\\" making them leaner and faster without losing their \\"intelligence.\\" Whether you\'re working on a laptop or a powerful server, whether your AI project is small or involves massive models like those generating human-like text, INC provides you with the means to make your project more efficient and cost-effective."},{"prompt":"expand \\"running he example\\" step. Make the instructions clear for a layperson.","completion":"Let’s simplify and expand the \\"running the example\\" step related to the \\"Weight-Only Quantization\\" process using Intel® Neural Compressor for a non-technical audience. This step is about making an AI model faster by simplifying part of its data (weights) to use less space. The example focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), like those that generate text similar to how humans do. # Step-by-Step Simplified: Imagine you have a complex recipe (AI model) that creates a gourmet dish (generates text). This recipe involves a lot of ingredients (weights), making it intricate and time-consuming to prepare. Now, suppose you have a way to simplify this recipe without changing the taste and quality of the dish too much. This is what \\"Weight-Only Quantization\\" does – it simplifies the recipe. 1. Getting the Right Tools and Ingredients: First, you need to make sure you have all the necessary tools (software packages) and ingredients (model and data) ready: - **Install the Kitchen Tools (Software Packages)**: You would install Intel® Neural Compressor and other necessary packages by typing commands in the terminal, which is like telling a kitchen assistant to fetch and prepare all tools and ingredients you need. Here’s how you would ask for these tools to be prepared: ```sh pip install \\"neural-compressor>=2.3\\" \\"transformers>=4.34.0\\" torch torchvision ``` This command is like saying, \\"Please prepare the Neural Compressor, some transformation tools, and the basic frameworks (torch and torchvision) for cooking.\\" 2. Preparing the Dish (Model Quantization): - **Choosing the Recipe**: Say you decide to prepare a simpler version of a gourmet dish called \\"EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m\\" – this is your chosen AI model, which is known for generating human-like text. - **Simplify the Recipe (Quantize the Model)**: You then proceed to simplify your recipe. This involves reducing the complexity of your ingredients (model weights) to make the cooking process (model inference) faster. Specifically, you\'re aiming to use a 4-bit format for ingredients, which is like using a simpler version of each ingredient without compromising the dish\'s quality too much. Here\'s how you might proceed with the help of a kitchen assistant (running the example code): ```python from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig from neural_compressor.quantization import fit from neural_compressor.adaptor.torch_utils.auto_round import get_dataloader # Prepare your ingredients and tools model_name = \\"EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m\\" float_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name) tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) dataloader = get_dataloader(tokenizer, seqlen=2048) # Start simplifying the recipe woq_conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig( approach=\\"weight_only\\", op_type_dict={ \\".*\\": { # match all ops \\"weight\\": { \\"dtype\\": \\"int\\", \\"bits\\": 4, \\"algorithm\\": \\"AUTOROUND\\", }, } }, ) # Cook and see the results quantized_model = fit(model=float_model, conf=woq_conf, calib_dataloader=dataloader) ``` This piece of code is like a detailed cooking instruction that tells your assistant exactly how to simplify each ingredient using a 4-bit format with the \\"AUTOROUND\\" algorithm, which automatically finds the best way to do this without losing the essence of the dish. Note for Specific Kitchen Environment: If you\'re cooking in a special kitchen (Intel Gaudi2 hardware), there are instructions for preparing the kitchen environment using a Docker container – think of it as setting up a special cooking station with the right atmosphere and tools specifically optimized for your dish. You\'ll start this setup with specific `docker` commands as provided in the guide. Serving the Dish: After following the steps, your gourmet dish is ready much faster than before, with minimal loss in its taste and quality.

The documents you found list various Intel architectures like Sapphire Rapids, Ice Lake, Cascade Lake, etc., and specify the type of low-precision optimizations supported (e.g., AMX_INT8, AVX512_VNNI). While Tiger Lake processors are mentioned in the context of supporting `AVX512F` for FP32 compute types, the detailed compatibility with INT8 and 4-bit precision requires specific ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) support. - The 11th Gen Intel Core processors support `AVX-512` instruction sets, which means they should benefit from some level of optimization for model inference described in the documents. However, the highest optimizations around `AMX_INT8` noted for Sapphire Rapids might not be fully utilized as those are specific to newer Intel architectures. 2. **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: - Given the processor details, we can infer support for `AVX-512` related optimizations. For the specific ISA support related to `AMX_INT8`, that\'s a feature highlighted in the context of newer CPU architectures like Sapphire Rapids. Your CPU (Tiger Lake) supports `AVX-512`, which mandates compatibility with `AVX512F`, one of the listed ISAs known for carrying optimizations in AI inference tasks. 3. **Quantization Support**: - The information regarding weight-only quantization and the supported fast configurations for CPUs mentions the importance of ISA for quantization types, especially INT4 quantization leading to model performance improvement. Your processor aligns with use cases favoring `AVX512_VNNI` for INT8 compute types, which would still mark significant performance gains in AI inference, though with a slightly different setting than the `AMX_INT8` designated for Sapphire Rapids architecture. 4. **Fastest Configuration for Your CPU**: - Your 11th Gen Intel Core i7 is part of the Tiger Lake family, which, based on the guidelines, would lean towards configurations that utilize `AVX512_VNNI` and `AVX512F` for INT8 and FP32 compute types, respectively. This suggests that while your setup might not reach the absolute peak of what\'s possible with Sapphire Rapids\' `AMX_INT8`, it\'s quite capable of accelerating LLM inference efficiently using weight-only quantization via supported ISAs. # Conclusion: Your 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11390H CPU aligns well with the general requirements for running optimized low-precision kernels for LLM inference. You have compatibility with `AVX-512` instructions, which are instrumental in optimizing model inference. Although your setup might not employ the newest `AMX_INT8` optimizations exclusive to newer architectures like Sapphire Rapids, your Tiger Lake processor should still benefit significantly from `AVX512_VNNI` and `AVX512F` based optimizations for AI model inferences, including those related to 4-bit (INT4) quantization strategies. Thus, yes, your setup complies with the necessary requirements to run optimized LLM inference tasks effectively, taking advantage of your CPU\'s supported ISAs for considerable performance improvements in weight-only quantized models."},{"prompt":"i found this info: \\"\\"AVX-512 512-bit extensions to the SIMD instructions for x86 ISA Introduction Proposed by Intel in July 2013 and first implemented in Intel Xeon Phi x200 (Knights Landing) in 2016. Foundational Extension Core extension AVX-512F (AVX-512 Foundation) is required in all AVX-512 implementations. Improvements Widens most 256-bit instructions and adds new operations including data conversions, scatter operations, and permutations.\\"\\"","completion":"Based on the additional information you provided about AVX-512, let\'s clarify how this ties into your system\'s capabilities for running optimized low-precision kernels for LLM inference. # Understanding AVX-512: - **What It Is**: AVX-512 represents an extension to the already existing SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions found in x86 instruction set architecture (ISA). It allows a single instruction to operate on much larger data - up to 512 bits at a time, as opposed to the 256-bit processing available with AVX and AVX2. This capability is crucial for accelerating computational tasks by performing more operations in parallel, particularly beneficial in domains like AI and numerical computing. - **Introduction**: Proposed by Intel in 2013 and debuting in the Intel Xeon Phi x200 (Knights Landing) processors in 2016, AVX-512 marked a significant step in SIMD processing capabilities, improving the efficiency and speed of processors when handling data-intensive tasks. - **Foundational Extension (AVX-512F)**: The core of AVX-512 features, termed AVX-512F or AVX-512 Foundation, is a set of enhancements that all AVX-512 implementations must support. This foundational set includes the widening of most 256-bit instructions found in previous AVX versions to 512 bits, in addition to introducing new operations. These new operations range from data conversions and scatter operations to permutations, further broadening the use cases and efficiency of SIMD processing. # Impact on Your System (11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11390H): Given that your processor is an 11th Generation Intel® Core™ i7, which is part of the Tiger Lake family introduced by Intel, it natively supports AVX-512 instructions. This support means your system can take full advantage of the wide SIMD instructions that AVX-512 offers, making it capable of handling large datasets and computational tasks more efficiently than processors without AVX-512 support. # Relevance to Running Optimized LLM Inference Kernels: - **Performance Gains**: With AVX-512, especially the foundational AVX-512F, your system is better equipped to run AI model inference tasks at a higher performance level. The wide SIMD instructions can accelerate the computation of neural network operations, which are naturally parallelizable and can benefit significantly from the wide data paths and new operations provided by AVX-512. - **Quantization and Efficiency**: For tasks like weight-only quantization, where you\'re aiming to run LLMs more efficiently by reducing the precision of the weights without substantially impacting the model\'s accuracy, the capabilities of AVX-512 can play a pivotal role. By processing more data per instruction and utilizing the instruction set\'s extended capabilities for operations relevant to quantization, your system can achieve the desired reduction in model size and increase in inference speed more effectively. # Conclusion: Your 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 processor, with support for AVX-512 and specifically the foundational AVX-512F instructions, is well-suited to leverage the optimizations that Intel® Neural Compressor and other tools provide for accelerating LLM inference. This advanced SIMD extension ensures that you can achieve substantial performance improvements when running optimized low-precision kernels, aligning well with the requirements for efficient LLM inference on your system."},{"prompt":"Summarize and explain the key concepts in this blog like i am a layperson: \\"\\"Open in app Sign up Sign in Search Write Highly-efficient LLM Inference on Intel Platforms Leadership performance yet compatible with llama.cpp Intel(R) Neural Compressor Intel(R) Neural Compressor · Follow 2 min read · Oct 21, 2023 81 1 Team Intel Extension for Transformers, Intel Corporation Intel® Extension for Transformers is an innovative toolkit to accelerate Transformer-based models on Intel platforms.

This is particularly important because LLMs typically require significant computational resources. # Key Points Explained: 1. **Intel® Extension for Transformers**: - Think of the Transformers as very smart robots that can read, understand, and write text almost like a human. Intel has created a special toolkit that helps these smart robots work faster on computers that use Intel chips. - The blog post talks about a special technique called \\"4-bits weight-only quantization\\" used on Intel\'s newer Xeon processors. Imagine trying to store your entire library in a small room; you\'d need to summarize the books into shorter versions. Similarly, this technique simplifies parts of the LLMs to make them quicker and lighter, without losing much of their \\"smarts\\". 2. **Comparison with llama.cpp**: - They compare their toolkit\'s performance with another tool called llama.cpp on two types of Intel processors, showing their toolkit makes things run up to 4.4 times faster. It\'s like comparing two different engines to see which one makes a car go faster on the same fuel; Intel\'s toolkit is shown to be more efficient. 3. **Performance Tests**: - They tested how well their toolkit performed in achieving fast results from LLMs by using it on two different types of Intel processors - the Xeon Platinum and the Core i9. The tests show that the toolkit can significantly speed up how quickly LLMs can generate text, making it an effective tool for anyone using these processors. - They used challenging datasets to ensure the simplified models still understood and generated text accurately. Imagine teaching your robot to understand jokes or poetry; you\'d want it to still \\"get\\" the joke or the poem even if it\'s working with a summary of all literature it knows. 4. **Support for Various Tasks**: - Beyond just making things faster, Intel\'s tools support fine-tuning, which is like teaching the smart robots to be even smarter in specific areas. They showed that using more computers (nodes) together can speed up this teaching process. # Simplified Explanation: Imagine you have a super-smart robot friend that loves reading and writing stories, poems, or even chatting with you. But this friend tends to be a bit slow because their brain (the LLM) is so big and complex. Now, Intel has created a special \\"booster\\" (the Intel® Extension for Transformers) that can help your robot friend think and respond faster, especially when using specific \\"brains\\" designed by Intel (like the Intel Xeon Scalable processors). They tested this booster with some challenging tasks, comparing it to another booster called llama.cpp, and found that Intel\'s version could help your robot friend work up to 4.4 times faster without losing their ability to understand complex ideas or jokes. This means your robot friend can still chat with you, write stories, or help you with tasks quicker than before, making them an even better companion for anyone using computers with Intel chips inside. In short, this advancement from Intel is great news for anyone who uses or is interested in AI and LLMs, as it promises faster and more efficient performance, allowing these intelligent systems to be more practical and accessible for a variety of applications."},{"prompt":"do the same thing for this technical article: \\"\\" Tensor Parallelism ======= - [Introduction](#introduction) - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - [Enable Customized Model](#enable-customized-model) - [Examples](#examples) Introduction Tensor parallelism is a strategy employed to train and inference from very large language models by splitting the actual computations/tensors across multiple compute devices. It is a critical technique for the continued growth and application of massive deep learning models and offers a path to unlocking unprecedented model capacities. When we use tensor parallelism to partition and compute large language models, there are various ways in which we can perform the partitioning algorithm. In 1D algorithms, we can split by rows or columns. For a row-major order matrix, if you split by column, data rearrangement is required, which is a factor affecting performance. However, splitting a row-major order matrix by rows does not consume time. In our TP implementation, we adopt the method of pre-splitting the corresponding weights, so the time consumed for this part is one-time and does not affect inference performance. Meanwhile, another major factor impacting performance is \'all reduce\'. Since each node computes partial and incomplete results, it is necessary to perform \'all reduce\' on the output data. But all reduce is relatively time-consuming, interestingly, by using a reasonable splitting and combining method, primitives can be operated independently across nodes, which is very helpful for performance optimization. Thus, a rational splitting method becomes extremely important. Taking the FFN module as an example, if the first ```matmul``` splits by column and computes the ```matmul``` with input, it will result in two unrelated sub-matrices on each node. These two sub-matrices, when performing the second ```matmul``` operation, can proceed directly without having to perform \'all reduce\' if splitting by rows. Thus, the entire FFN module only requires one \'all reduce\', meaning that with properly tailored split implementation, even with multiple ```matmul``` operations, only one \'all reduce\' operation may be needed. <img src=\\"imgs/FFN.PNG\\" width=700 height=300 alt=\\"FFN split\\"> <br> The scenario for the attention module is more complex. As shown in the following figure, a rational split can make it so that the entire attention module only requires one \'all reduce\' operation, thus greatly saving synchronization time. <img src=\\"imgs/Attention.PNG\\" width=700 height=300 alt=\\"Attention split\\"> <br> Prerequisites Multi-node and Multi-socket communications are needed in tensor parallelism, we use oneCCL for the distributed communications. Enable Customized Model Taking \\"llama\\" as an example, we need three modifications: - First, we need to split the weight used in the ```matmul``` calculation. - Second, determine the size of ```n_head``` after splitting, based on the total number of nodes in parallel(world_size). - Finally, insert the ```all_reduce``` operator after the final matmul. For instance, when splitting the FFN (feed-forward network) module, it is visible in the FFN flowchart that both ```feed_forward.w1.weigh``` and ```feed_forward.w3.weight``` are part of the first ```matmul``` computation. This portion of the ```matmul``` should be split by column, considering the weight in ITREX is already transposed. We only need to set the ```split_type``` of these two weights to ```TP_1D_ROW``` within the ```calc_split_type()``` function in \'models/modelutils/model_files.h\'. The ```feed_forward.w1.weight``` belongs to the second part of the ```matmul``` calculation in the FFN flowchart, the ```split_type``` should be set to ```TP_1D_COLUMN```. This ensures that the partial results from the first ```matmul``` calculation can be independently used for the second ```matmul``` calculation. There are also some primitives between the two ```matmul``` operations, and since these primitives are element-wise, they are also calculated independently on their respective nodes. For the attention module, there are four weights: ```attention.wq.weight```, ```attention.wk.weight```, ```attention.wv.weight```, and ```attention.wo.weight```. The ```split_type``` for ```attention.wq.weight```, ```attention.wk.weight```and ```attention.wv.weight``` should be set to ```TP_1D_ROW```. In contrast, ```attention.wo.weight``` should be set to ```TP_1D_COLUMN```. The calculations for the primitives in between can be done independently. Once the weight splitting is complete, the actual ```n_head``` computed by each node when running the model is correspondingly reduced, so it is necessary to reset the size of ```n_head```. Code is simple like: ```C++ n_head /= world_size; n_head_kv /= world_size; ``` Finally, after the last ```matmul``` calculation, insert the ```all_reduce``` operator to sum up the partial computation results, thereby obtaining the complete computational outcome. ```C++ cur = ne_all_reduce(ctx0, cur); ``` # Build the oneCCL and setup the env ```shell git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneCCL.git cd oneCCL sed -i \'s/cpu_gpu_dpcpp/./g\' cmake/templates/oneCCLConfig.cmake.in mkdir build cd build cmake .. make -j install source <path_to_build_dir>/_install/env/setvars.sh ``` To confirm that the oneCCL installation is successful, use command: ```shell mpirun --version ``` If the command line prints log like below, means the oneCCL env is ready. ``` Intel(R) MPI Library for Linux* OS, Version 2021.9 Build 20230306 (id: d82b3071db) Copyright 2003-2023, Intel Corporation. ``` # Enable the CMake option and build executable file Compile an executable file that supports tensor parallelism by enabling the CMake option `NS_TP`. You can build the executable file like below. ```shell mkdir build cd build cmake -DNS_TP=ON .. make -j ``` # Download the model weights and quantize to q4_0 format. First you should download and convert the model to f32 format. You can also quantize the model to q4_0 format, but it is optional. ```shell python scripts/convert.py --outtype f32 --outfile EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b ``` Then quantize the model to q4_0 format(optional). ```shell python scripts/quantize.py --model_name gptj --model_file /path/to/your/ne-f32.bin --out_file ne-q4_0.bin --weight_dtype int4 ``` Examples We can config the `mpirun` to start parallel programs. Here is an example about running tensor pallelsim on 2 sockets in CPU. ```shell mpirun -np 2 -bind-to=socket ./build/bin/main_gptj -m ne-q4_0.bin --seed 1234 -t 56 -c 68 -n 32 -p \\"Once upon a time, there existed a little girl, who liked to have adventures. She wanted to go to places and meet new people, and have fun.\\" --no_mmap ``` We only add `mpirun -np 2 -bind-to=socket` to the original command to enable 2 processes to run parallel. If you want to bind specific core to each process. You can write the original command to a shell script and use command like below. ```shell mpirun -n 1 taskset -c 0-47 sh run.sh : -n 1 taskset -c 48-95 sh run.sh ``` **NOTICE**: tensor parallelsim strategy will split the model to specific node/socket, each device already use part of the original weights differently. So we should not use shared-memory of weights to avoid cross numa weight movement. Use option `--no-mmap` to disable shared weights between processes.\\"\\"","completion":"Let\'s simplify and explain the concept of \\"Tensor Parallelism\\" as discussed in the technical article, focusing on how it applies to the training and using large language models (LLMs) on Intel platforms. # Simplified Overview of Tensor Parallelism: Imagine you have a giant puzzle that you want to solve. Now, one way to solve it faster is by dividing it into smaller pieces and giving each piece to different friends to work on simultaneously. Once each of them has completed their part, you bring all the pieces back together to see the complete picture. This is essentially what \\"Tensor Parallelism\\" does with complex computer tasks, especially those involving AI. # Key Concepts Explained: 1. **Big AI Models are Like Giant Puzzles**: Large language models (like those used for AI chatbots or text generation) are incredibly complex and can be slow to work with. To speed things up, tensor parallelism divides the model\'s tasks (the big puzzle) into smaller parts and spreads them across multiple computer processors (your friends working on pieces of the puzzle). 2. **Different Ways to Split the Puzzle**: When dividing tasks among processors, it\'s possible to split them in several ways - imagine cutting the puzzle either row-wise or column-wise. The article mentions that, depending on how you split it, you might have to rearrange the pieces before you can start working on them, which can affect how quickly you can solve the puzzle. 3. **Reducing the Need to Consult with Friends**: In some cases, after your friends work on their pieces, they need to share information to ensure everyone\'s work aligns correctly (akin to an \'all reduce\' operation in computing). This \\"sharing\\" step can slow things down. However, by cleverly choosing how to split the puzzle initially, you can minimize the need for these slow check-ins, speeding up the entire process. 4. **Practical Example with the FFN Module**: Using a specific part of the AI model as an example, the article explains that by splitting the puzzle (matrix multiplication) in a certain way, we can ensure that most of the work gets done independently, needing only one big check-in at the end. This is like if each piece of the puzzle could be worked on independently without constantly having to compare it with other pieces until the very end. # Practical Steps: - **Setting Up**: For this to work, especially across multiple computers (nodes), a tool called oneCCL is used to manage the communication across different parts of the system. - **Making Adjustments**: Some adjustments are needed to prepare the AI model for this type of parallel processing. This involves telling the computer exactly how to split the model\'s tasks and when to gather the pieces back together. # Running an Example: The article concludes with instructions on how to run an example of tensor parallelism, using a tool that sets up multiple computer processors to work on the model\'s tasks simultaneously. This is similar to organizing your friends, giving them puzzle pieces to work on, and setting up a system to combine their efforts efficiently. # Conclusion for Laypeople: \\"Tensor Parallelism\\" is a smart way to make big, slow tasks (like working with massive AI models) much faster by dividing the work among multiple processors. It\'s like solving a huge puzzle with the help of many friends, where finding the most efficient way to divide and recombine the work can save a lot of time. The steps outlined show how to set up this process, ensuring everything works together smoothly for quicker results."},{"prompt":"what is this github page about: \\"\\" Before you start ITREX LLM C++ Runtime (`Neural Speed`) has already supported some popular models like `LLAMA`,`GPT-J`, `GPT-NEOX`, `DOLLY`, etc.These LLMs have similar architectures and some of them share the same architect (`DOLLY` and `GPT-NEOX`). Before adding a new model, you can checkout its architecture (from Huggingface `config.json`) whether is in our [supported list](./neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68). However, LLM inference thing is complicated. It may have its own: 1. special tokenizer (or vocab); 2. architecture (or forward pipeline); 3. operators (or kernels). Generally speaking, the first and second points appear frequently for transformers-LLMs. I will show you how to run a new model as soon as possible when your model hasn\'t any problems like above or only the problem 1. The next sections will discuss about the problem 2 and the problem 3 is beyond the scope of this document. For simplicity, we take [polyglot](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/polyglot-ko-5.8b) as the example model. It has the same architecture as `GPT-NEOX` but only fewer layers. Firstly, we need to add its temp buffer in its [related model-arch header file](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h) and [re-compile](README.md#Install). ```diff static const model_scratch gptneox_mem_req(int n_layers, float scratch_size_ratio = 1.0f) { switch (n_layers) { case 44: return {2048ull * MB, 2048ull * MB, 4096ull * MB}; case 32: return {512ull * MB, 512ull * MB, 1026ull * MB}; + case 28: // 5.8B + return {512ull * MB, 512ull * MB, 1024ull * MB}; default: MODEL_ASSERT(false); } } ``` Then, use `transformers` tokenizer to encode prompt and decode return tokens instead of re-implementing C++ tokenizer. For checking text generation results, we recommend you to run this python codes below to align our runtime engine outputs with PyTorch (`FP32 data type, greedy search`). ```python from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer from intel_extension_for_transformers.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, WeightOnlyQuantConfig from neural_speed import Model model_name = \\"EleutherAI/polyglot-ko-5.8b\\" prompt = \\"she open the door and see\\" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\\"pt\\").input_ids # pt infer pt_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) pt_model.eval() pt_outputs = pt_model.generate(inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=128) pt_ans = tokenizer.batch_decode(pt_outputs, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0] print(\\"=====pytorch result======\\") print(pt_ans) # itrex infer # fp32 config woq_config = WeightOnlyQuantConfig(not_quant=True) # model file should be in `runtime_outs` folder model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, quantization_config=woq_config, trust_remote_code=True) outputs = model.generate(inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=128) ans = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0] print(\\"=====itrex result======\\") print(ans) ``` The English prompt would have the output like: ```bash =====pytorch result====== she open the door and see him. She looks at him and says, \\"How do you do?\\" He says, \\"Fine.\\" She says, \\"What do you want?\\" He says, \\"I want to go home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m going home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m =====itrex result====== she open the door and see him. She looks at him and says, \\"How do you do?\\" He says, \\"Fine.\\" She says, \\"What do you want?\\" He says, \\"I want to go home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m going home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m ``` Once you make sure your model has the same generated tokens as PyTorch, you can deploy it by using low-bits precision like `INT4` data type and customized acceleration. Please refer to `Python API` section for more details. # Enable cpp model process We enable a CPP model in the following four steps. ```mermaid graph LR; Convert-->Load; Load-->Inference; Inference-->Optimize; ``` # 1. Model conversion We need to implement corresponding serialization methods from pytorch format, which is mainly divided into the following three steps. 1.1. Hyperparamters The term **\\"hyperparamters\\"** describes a value that is used to configure the behavior of a large language model; this is in contrast to the model\'s parameters, which are the weight that were derived in the training process that was used to create the model. Each model defines its own hyperparameter structure that defines the hyperparameter values accepted by that model. Valid ITREX model files must list these values in the correct order, and each value must be represented using the correct data type. Although hyperparameters are different across models, some attributes appear in the hyperparameters for most models: - n_vocab: the size of the model\'s vocabulary - n_embd: the size of the model\'s \\" embedding layer\\", which is used during prompt ingestion. - n_layer: the number of layers in the model; each layer represents a set of weights. Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L96) as an example, ```python fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams[\\"num_attention_heads\\"])) fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams.get(\\"n_head_kv\\", 0))) # multi-query attention fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams[\\"num_hidden_layers\\"])) ``` The above `fout` is the file we need to get, and the `num_attention`, `n_head_kv`, and `num_hidden_layer` from hparams is written into fout. 1.2. Vocabulary As the name implies, a model\'s vocabulary comprises components that are used by the model to generate language (text). However, unlike the vocabulary of a human, which consists of words, the vocabulary of a large language model consists of \\"tokens\\". A token can be an entire word, but oftentimes they are word fragments. Just like humans can compose millions of words from just a dozen or two letters, large language models use tokens to express a large number of words from a relatively smaller number of components. Consider a vocabulary with the following tokens: `whi`, `ch`, `le`, `who`, and `a`; this vocabulary can be used to create the English words `\\"which\\"`, `\\"while\\"`, `\\"who\\"`, `\\"a\\"`, and `\\"leach\\"`. How would the behavior change if the model contained the following tokens: `wh`, `ich`, `ile`, `o`, and `leach`? Choices such as these allow model-creators to tune the behavior and performance of their models. As described above, the model\'s hyperparameters typically contain a value that specifies the number of tokens in the vocabulary. The vocabulary is encoded as a list of tokens, each of which includes a 32-bit integer that specifies the length of the token. If your model has some new tokenizers, we suggest using a python tokenizer from transformers and feeding the input_ids to model Python API (python example in scripts folder) Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L122) as an example to processed the vocabulary of gptneox and written it into `fout`. ```python encoder = tokenizer.vocab encoder.update(tokenizer.get_added_vocab()) byte_encoder = bytes_to_unicode() byte_decoder = {v:k for k, v in byte_encoder.items()} ``` 1.3. Model weights Finally, and largest, component of a `Neural Speed` GRAPH file is the weights of the LLM that the file represents. Abstractly, a large language model is software that is used to generate language - just like software that is used to generate images can be improved by increasing the number of colors with which images can be rendered, large language models can be improved by increasing the number of weights in the model. The total number of weights in a model is referred to as the \\"size\\" of that model. For example, the dolly-v2-3b implementation of the gpt-neox-20b language model architecture is available in several sizes, like 3B and 20B, which stand for 3 billion and 20 billion, respectively. These numbers refer to the total number of weights in that model. As described in the hyperparameters section, weights are grouped in sets called \\"layers\\", which, like hyperparameters, have structures that are uniquely defined by the model architecture; within a layer, weights are grouped in structures called \\"tensors\\". So, for instance, both dolly-v2-3B and gpt-neox-20B use layers that comprise the same tensors, but dolly-v2-3B has relatively fewer layers when compared to gpt-neox-20B. Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L149) as an example to convert model weights to `fout`. ```python fout.write(struct.pack(\\"iii\\", n_dims, len(str), ftype_cur)) for i in range(n_dims): fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", data.shape[n_dims - 1 - i])) fout.write(str) data.tofile(fout) ``` # 2. Model enablements 2.1. Model loading - Model type: Refers to the type of the model, This can be compared to the model type in the Transformers library, we can see model_class in [model_type.h](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68), here defines the basic properties of an neural speed model, including model_hparams, model_layer, model_struct.etc. If you have a new cpp model you should update [model_archs](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68). ```diff enum model_archs { MODEL_UNKNOWN, MODEL_LLAMA, MODEL_GPTJ, MODEL_MPT, MODEL_GPTNEOX, MODEL_STARCODER, MODEL_FALCON, MODEL_OPT, MODEL_BLOOM, MODEL_BAICHUAN, MODEL_CHATGLM2, MODEL_CHATGLM, + MODEL_NEW }; ``` and update [model_name_to_arch()](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L395). ```diff private: model_name_to_arch() {} // update this table if has new cpp model std::unordered_map<std::string, model_archs> name2arch_ = { {\\"unknown\\", MODEL_UNKNOWN}, {\\"llama\\", MODEL_LLAMA}, {\\"gptj\\", MODEL_GPTJ}, {\\"mpt\\", MODEL_MPT}, {\\"opt\\", MODEL_OPT}, {\\"gptneox\\", MODEL_GPTNEOX}, {\\"dolly\\", MODEL_GPTNEOX}, {\\"starcoder\\", MODEL_STARCODER}, {\\"falcon\\", MODEL_FALCON}, {\\"bloom\\", MODEL_BLOOM}, {\\"chatglm2\\", MODEL_CHATGLM2}, {\\"chatglm\\", MODEL_CHATGLM}, - {\\"baichuan\\", MODEL_BAICHUAN}}; + {\\"baichuan\\", MODEL_BAICHUAN}},{\\"new_model\\", MODEL_NEW_MODEL}}; }; ``` - Set buffer size: we need to set the corresponding buffer size in model.h according to the size of parameters for the model, just like [gptneox.h](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h), you should update [enum gptneox_model](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L21), [model_scratch](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L26) and [model class](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L39). ```diff +#ifndef NEW_MODEL_H +#define NEW_MODEL_H +#include \\"models/model_utils/model_files.h\\" +#include \\"models/model_utils/model_types.h\\" +enum new_model { + NEW_MDOEL_UNKNOWN, + NEW_MODEL_13B, +}; +static const model_scratch new_model_mem_req(int n_layers, float scratch_size_ratio = 1.0f) { + switch (n_layers) { + case N: + return {8192ull * MB, 8192ull * MB, 8192ull * MB}; + default: + MODEL_ASSERT(false); } +} +class NEW_MODEL : public IModel { + private: + model_archs name = MODEL_NEW_MODEL; + std::unique_ptr<model_model_loader> ml; + uint32_t n_layer, n_embd, n_ff, n_vocab; + int n_ctx, n_gpu_layer; + bool use_mmap, use_mlock, vocab_only; + model_scratch scratch; + public: + void init(const char* path_model, model_context& lctx, int n_ctx, int n_gpu_layers, bool use_mmap_, bool use_mlock_, + bool vocab_only_) override; + void load(model_context& lctx, model_progress_callback progress_callback, void* progress_callback_user_data) override; +}; +#endif // NEW_MODEL_H ``` - Model_load_internal: This function include model init and model load, The [model init function](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L42) initializes the model\'s hyperparameter, such as `n_layer` and `n_embd parameters`. ```cpp n_embd = hparams.n_embd; n_vocab = hparams.n_vocab; n_layer = hparams.n_layer; ``` The weights of the model in the `Neural Speed` Graph file will be loaded in [model load function](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L71). Here, we\'ll re-read some of the parameters and weights of the converted binary,include ffn, attention, and norm weight and bias, We\'ll use the mapping between the name and the weight to read the weight we need. It is shown below. ```cpp model.others[0] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.embed_in.weight\\", {n_embd, n_vocab}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[1] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.final_layer_norm.weight\\", {n_embd}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[2] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.final_layer_norm.bias\\", {n_embd}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[3] = ml->get_tensor(\\"embed_out.weight\\", {n_embd, n_vocab}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); ``` Here we use get_tensor function to read `gpt_neox_embed_in.weight` with a shape of `(n_vocab,n_embd)` tensor into `model.others[0]`. So when enabling a new model, we should implement the `new_model_utils.cpp` of the new model. 2.2. Inference process - Model_eval_internal: This function can be equivalent to the forward process in pytorch, which has the same computational process. In [gptneox.cpp](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.cpp), the model_eval_internal here will perform a complete operation on the input values, such as ffn, layernorm, mha, etc. Here\'s a layernorm operation: ```cpp cur = ne_norm(ctx0, inpL); cur = ne_add(ctx0, ne_mul(ctx0, ne_repeat(ctx0, model.layers[il].norm[0], cur), cur), ne_repeat(ctx0, model.layers[il].norm[1], cur)); ``` It is equivalent to in [gptneox.modeling](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gpt_neox/modeling_gpt_neox.py#L441C12-L441C12): ```python self.input_layernorm(hidden_states) ``` The `inpL` in the code above is equivalent to the `hidden_states` in the pytorch code, and we combine ne_norm, ne_add, and ne_mul to equivalentize self.input_layernorm. When enabling a new model, we should implement the `new_model.cpp` of the new model. Most of our model examples only support single prompt processing. You need to add `batch-dim` for tensors and concat `KV cache` per-batch if you want to try multi-batch inference.

Application - Q4_0 quant : We can quantize the model generated by convert by adding a quant layer class to quantize it into an int4 low-bit file, so as to obtain better inference performance. Register quant layer class in your new_model_utils.cpp, just like [gptneox_utils.cpp](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L163), replace `gptneox_quant_layer` to your `new_model_quant_layer`. ```diff +class new_quant_layer : public quant_layer_base { + public: + quant_params_internal get_layer_config(std::string layername, std::vector<int64_t> ne, + ne_type type) override { + bool quantize = layername.rfind(\\"weight\\") == layername.size() - 6; // size(\\"weight\\") = 6 + if (layername == \\"model.embed_tokens.weight\\") { + // special layer process, can be loaded by config file + return quant_params_internal(); // return q4_0 to cover the usage of getrow + } + quantize &= (ne.size() == 2); // quantize only linear layers, which are two-dim + if (quantize) { + return mGCfg; // use global quant config + } else { + return quant_params_internal{quant_bits::count}; // non-quant + } + } +}; +REGISTER_QUANT_LAYER_CLASS(new_model); ``` - Add new CMakeLists.txt: We need to add the newly added model to the following CMakeList.txt.

The primary goal is to make these AI models work faster and more efficiently by employing various technical strategies. Let\'s break down the key points for easier understanding: # Core Idea: Making AI Models Faster Imagine your computer is a library, and within it, there\'s a special section dedicated to very complex and large books (representing LLMs). These books hold vast amounts of knowledge but are too big and complex to be used quickly when needed. \\"Neural Speed\\" acts like a skilled librarian, finding ways to manage these books more efficiently, ensuring that when you need information from them, you get it as quickly as possible. # Techniques Used: 1. **Tensor Parallelism**: This is like splitting up a massive encyclopedia among several librarians to find information faster. By dividing the work of processing the AI model\'s data (tensors) across multiple computer processors (compute devices), it speeds up how quickly the model can \'think\' and provide answers. 2. **Special Handling for Each Model**: Some of these AI models have unique characteristics that need special attention for them to work faster. It\'s akin to having different cataloging methods for books in a library, where some rare books might need a unique approach to be accessible quickly. 3. **Optimizing Complex Calculations**: The project includes advanced methods to make the complex math behind AI models run faster. This might involve clever tricks to avoid repetitive calculations, akin to a librarian knowing exactly where in the book the needed information is, without needing to read the entire page. # Practical Steps Involved: 1. **Adding New Models**: Before incorporating a new AI model into this system, it\'s essential to check if its architectural style matches the supported ones. It\'s like ensuring a new book adheres to a categorization system the library understands. 2. **Model Adjustments**: Modifying parts of the model to fit this optimization process is required, which could involve adjusting how data is stored or processed within the model. Imagine re-binding a book so that it fits better on the library shelves. 3. **Code Examples**: The page provides code snippets illustrating how to prepare an AI model (in this case, \\"polyglot\\") for this optimized processing. These code sections are like detailed instructions for a librarian on how to catalog and handle a new complex book. 4. **Comparing Results**: To ensure the optimizations work as intended, the page suggests running tests to compare the AI model\'s performance before and after optimization, ensuring the \'answers\' it provides remain accurate and become faster. 5. **Deployment and Optimization**: For those ready to use these optimizations in practical applications, further instructions and tools are provided to help integrate these models into real-world systems. This is akin to putting the newly cataloged and optimized books into circulation for library patrons. # Conclusion: In simple terms, the GitHub page showcases a sophisticated toolkit designed to supercharge the performance of AI models on Intel hardware, making them more practical for use in various applications by speeding up their processing capabilities and making them more efficient."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

At the heart of this gothic tableau, the Bat-Family stood in a semi-circle, their expressions a mix of disbelief, concern, and barely suppressed amusement. In the center of their attentive gazes hopped a small, fluffy creature with striking blue eyes and a tuft of hair that was unmistakably reminiscent of Dick Grayson\'s signature style. The resemblance didn\'t end there; the black rabbit\'s movements were animated, almost as if he was struggling to adjust to his new, decidedly less human form. Stephanie Brown, ever the optimist, was the first to break the palpable silence, a giggle escaping her lips as she crouched down to the rabbit\'s level. \\"Okay, who brought the cute bunny into the Batcave?\\" Tim Drake, ever the detective in training, peered closer, his brow furrowing. \\"That\'s no ordinary rabbit, Steph. Look at its eyes... and that hair. It\'s—\\" Jason Todd cut him off with a grunt, folding his arms across his chest. \\"It\'s freakin\' weird is what it is. Did one of you pull a prank? Because if so, it\'s a new low, even for us.\\" Damian Wayne scowled, clearly not amused by the turn of events, while Cassandra Cain simply tilted her head, observing the creature with a quiet curiosity that spoke volumes. Before any more speculations could be thrown into the ring, the bunny—remarkably, impossibly—opened its mouth. \\"...Uh...hi guys…it\'s me,\\" came the soft, slightly squeaky voice that was unmistakably Dick Grayson\'s, albeit pitched higher and undeniably more adorable in this new, diminutive form. A collective silence fell over the group, the weight of realization hitting them all at once. Dick Grayson, their brother-in-arms and the first to don the Robin mantle, had been transformed into a black rabbit with blue eyes... and a fluffy tail. \\"I know this is...a lot to take in,\\" the bunny continued, trying to hop closer but only succeeding in eliciting a wave of concerned forward steps from the group. \\"But it\'s really me, Dick. You\'re not going to believe what happened.\\" And so, with a mix of incredulity and a growing sense of urgency, the Bat-Family listened as their erstwhile human comrade recounted the tale of his transformation. It was a story that involved a suspiciously easy infiltration mission, a mystical artifact gone awry, and a spellcaster with a penchant for turning unsuspecting victims into animals as a form of twisted amusement. As the tale unfolded, the initial shock gave way to a sense of camaraderie that only the Bat-Family could understand. They had faced countless challenges together, but this was uncharted territory. And yet, the absurdity of the situation, of discussing strategy with a talking rabbit that was one of their own, only served to reinforce the bond between them. \\"We\'re going to fix this,\\" Tim declared, the resolve in his voice leaving no room for doubt. \\"Yeah, no way are we letting you hop around in a tail and twitchy nose for longer than necessary,\\" Jason chimed in, a rare grin spreading across his face. Damian, seemingly coming to terms with the situation, nodded tersely. \\"TT. We\'ll find the spellcaster.\\" Cassandra, ever the woman of few words, simply placed a gentle hand on the bunny\'s back, her action speaking volumes of assurance. And Stephanie, still marveling at the oddity of it all, summed up the team\'s sentiment: \\"We\'ve got you, Dick. Bunny form or not, you\'re stuck with us.\\" With a renewed sense of purpose and an unexpected challenge ahead, the Bat-Family rallied around their transformed brother. They were going to get Dick back to his normal self, no matter what it took. After all, they were family, through thick and thin, in human form or as an adorably fluffy rabbit. Nothing was too daunting for them—not even a spell that defied all logic and reason."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

However, LLM inference thing is complicated. It may have its own: 1. special tokenizer (or vocab); 2. architecture (or forward pipeline); 3. operators (or kernels). Generally speaking, the first and second points appear frequently for transformers-LLMs. I will show you how to run a new model as soon as possible when your model hasn\'t any problems like above or only the problem 1. The next sections will discuss about the problem 2 and the problem 3 is beyond the scope of this document. For simplicity, we take [polyglot](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/polyglot-ko-5.8b) as the example model. It has the same architecture as `GPT-NEOX` but only fewer layers. Firstly, we need to add its temp buffer in its [related model-arch header file](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h) and [re-compile](README.md#Install). ```diff static const model_scratch gptneox_mem_req(int n_layers, float scratch_size_ratio = 1.0f) { switch (n_layers) { case 44: return {2048ull * MB, 2048ull * MB, 4096ull * MB}; case 32: return {512ull * MB, 512ull * MB, 1026ull * MB}; + case 28: // 5.8B + return {512ull * MB, 512ull * MB, 1024ull * MB}; default: MODEL_ASSERT(false); } } ``` Then, use `transformers` tokenizer to encode prompt and decode return tokens instead of re-implementing C++ tokenizer. For checking text generation results, we recommend you to run this python codes below to align our runtime engine outputs with PyTorch (`FP32 data type, greedy search`). ```python from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer from intel_extension_for_transformers.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, WeightOnlyQuantConfig from neural_speed import Model model_name = \\"EleutherAI/polyglot-ko-5.8b\\" prompt = \\"she open the door and see\\" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\\"pt\\").input_ids # pt infer pt_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) pt_model.eval() pt_outputs = pt_model.generate(inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=128) pt_ans = tokenizer.batch_decode(pt_outputs, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0] print(\\"=====pytorch result======\\") print(pt_ans) # itrex infer # fp32 config woq_config = WeightOnlyQuantConfig(not_quant=True) # model file should be in `runtime_outs` folder model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, quantization_config=woq_config, trust_remote_code=True) outputs = model.generate(inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=128) ans = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0] print(\\"=====itrex result======\\") print(ans) ``` The English prompt would have the output like: ```bash =====pytorch result====== she open the door and see him. She looks at him and says, \\"How do you do?\\" He says, \\"Fine.\\" She says, \\"What do you want?\\" He says, \\"I want to go home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m going home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m =====itrex result====== she open the door and see him. She looks at him and says, \\"How do you do?\\" He says, \\"Fine.\\" She says, \\"What do you want?\\" He says, \\"I want to go home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m going home.\\" She says, \\"Where are you going?\\" He says, \\"I\'m ``` Once you make sure your model has the same generated tokens as PyTorch, you can deploy it by using low-bits precision like `INT4` data type and customized acceleration. Please refer to `Python API` section for more details. # Enable cpp model process We enable a CPP model in the following four steps. ```mermaid graph LR; Convert-->Load; Load-->Inference; Inference-->Optimize; ``` # 1. Model conversion We need to implement corresponding serialization methods from pytorch format, which is mainly divided into the following three steps. 1.1. Hyperparamters The term **\\"hyperparamters\\"** describes a value that is used to configure the behavior of a large language model; this is in contrast to the model\'s parameters, which are the weight that were derived in the training process that was used to create the model. Each model defines its own hyperparameter structure that defines the hyperparameter values accepted by that model. Valid ITREX model files must list these values in the correct order, and each value must be represented using the correct data type. Although hyperparameters are different across models, some attributes appear in the hyperparameters for most models: - n_vocab: the size of the model\'s vocabulary - n_embd: the size of the model\'s \\" embedding layer\\", which is used during prompt ingestion. - n_layer: the number of layers in the model; each layer represents a set of weights. Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L96) as an example, ```python fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams[\\"num_attention_heads\\"])) fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams.get(\\"n_head_kv\\", 0))) # multi-query attention fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", hparams[\\"num_hidden_layers\\"])) ``` The above `fout` is the file we need to get, and the `num_attention`, `n_head_kv`, and `num_hidden_layer` from hparams is written into fout. 1.2. Vocabulary As the name implies, a model\'s vocabulary comprises components that are used by the model to generate language (text). However, unlike the vocabulary of a human, which consists of words, the vocabulary of a large language model consists of \\"tokens\\". A token can be an entire word, but oftentimes they are word fragments. Just like humans can compose millions of words from just a dozen or two letters, large language models use tokens to express a large number of words from a relatively smaller number of components. Consider a vocabulary with the following tokens: `whi`, `ch`, `le`, `who`, and `a`; this vocabulary can be used to create the English words `\\"which\\"`, `\\"while\\"`, `\\"who\\"`, `\\"a\\"`, and `\\"leach\\"`. How would the behavior change if the model contained the following tokens: `wh`, `ich`, `ile`, `o`, and `leach`? Choices such as these allow model-creators to tune the behavior and performance of their models. As described above, the model\'s hyperparameters typically contain a value that specifies the number of tokens in the vocabulary. The vocabulary is encoded as a list of tokens, each of which includes a 32-bit integer that specifies the length of the token. If your model has some new tokenizers, we suggest using a python tokenizer from transformers and feeding the input_ids to model Python API (python example in scripts folder) Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L122) as an example to processed the vocabulary of gptneox and written it into `fout`. ```python encoder = tokenizer.vocab encoder.update(tokenizer.get_added_vocab()) byte_encoder = bytes_to_unicode() byte_decoder = {v:k for k, v in byte_encoder.items()} ``` 1.3. Model weights Finally, and largest, component of a `Neural Speed` GRAPH file is the weights of the LLM that the file represents. Abstractly, a large language model is software that is used to generate language - just like software that is used to generate images can be improved by increasing the number of colors with which images can be rendered, large language models can be improved by increasing the number of weights in the model. The total number of weights in a model is referred to as the \\"size\\" of that model. For example, the dolly-v2-3b implementation of the gpt-neox-20b language model architecture is available in several sizes, like 3B and 20B, which stand for 3 billion and 20 billion, respectively. These numbers refer to the total number of weights in that model. As described in the hyperparameters section, weights are grouped in sets called \\"layers\\", which, like hyperparameters, have structures that are uniquely defined by the model architecture; within a layer, weights are grouped in structures called \\"tensors\\". So, for instance, both dolly-v2-3B and gpt-neox-20B use layers that comprise the same tensors, but dolly-v2-3B has relatively fewer layers when compared to gpt-neox-20B. Here we will use [convert_gptneox.py](neural_speed/convert/convert_gptneox.py#L149) as an example to convert model weights to `fout`. ```python fout.write(struct.pack(\\"iii\\", n_dims, len(str), ftype_cur)) for i in range(n_dims): fout.write(struct.pack(\\"i\\", data.shape[n_dims - 1 - i])) fout.write(str) data.tofile(fout) ``` # 2. Model enablements 2.1. Model loading - Model type: Refers to the type of the model, This can be compared to the model type in the Transformers library, we can see model_class in [model_type.h](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68), here defines the basic properties of an neural speed model, including model_hparams, model_layer, model_struct.etc. If you have a new cpp model you should update [model_archs](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L68). ```diff enum model_archs { MODEL_UNKNOWN, MODEL_LLAMA, MODEL_GPTJ, MODEL_MPT, MODEL_GPTNEOX, MODEL_STARCODER, MODEL_FALCON, MODEL_OPT, MODEL_BLOOM, MODEL_BAICHUAN, MODEL_CHATGLM2, MODEL_CHATGLM, + MODEL_NEW }; ``` and update [model_name_to_arch()](neural_speed/models/model_utils/model_types.h#L395). ```diff private: model_name_to_arch() {} // update this table if has new cpp model std::unordered_map<std::string, model_archs> name2arch_ = { {\\"unknown\\", MODEL_UNKNOWN}, {\\"llama\\", MODEL_LLAMA}, {\\"gptj\\", MODEL_GPTJ}, {\\"mpt\\", MODEL_MPT}, {\\"opt\\", MODEL_OPT}, {\\"gptneox\\", MODEL_GPTNEOX}, {\\"dolly\\", MODEL_GPTNEOX}, {\\"starcoder\\", MODEL_STARCODER}, {\\"falcon\\", MODEL_FALCON}, {\\"bloom\\", MODEL_BLOOM}, {\\"chatglm2\\", MODEL_CHATGLM2}, {\\"chatglm\\", MODEL_CHATGLM}, - {\\"baichuan\\", MODEL_BAICHUAN}}; + {\\"baichuan\\", MODEL_BAICHUAN}},{\\"new_model\\", MODEL_NEW_MODEL}}; }; ``` - Set buffer size: we need to set the corresponding buffer size in model.h according to the size of parameters for the model, just like [gptneox.h](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h), you should update [enum gptneox_model](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L21), [model_scratch](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L26) and [model class](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.h#L39). ```diff +#ifndef NEW_MODEL_H +#define NEW_MODEL_H +#include \\"models/model_utils/model_files.h\\" +#include \\"models/model_utils/model_types.h\\" +enum new_model { + NEW_MDOEL_UNKNOWN, + NEW_MODEL_13B, +}; +static const model_scratch new_model_mem_req(int n_layers, float scratch_size_ratio = 1.0f) { + switch (n_layers) { + case N: + return {8192ull * MB, 8192ull * MB, 8192ull * MB}; + default: + MODEL_ASSERT(false); } +} +class NEW_MODEL : public IModel { + private: + model_archs name = MODEL_NEW_MODEL; + std::unique_ptr<model_model_loader> ml; + uint32_t n_layer, n_embd, n_ff, n_vocab; + int n_ctx, n_gpu_layer; + bool use_mmap, use_mlock, vocab_only; + model_scratch scratch; + public: + void init(const char* path_model, model_context& lctx, int n_ctx, int n_gpu_layers, bool use_mmap_, bool use_mlock_, + bool vocab_only_) override; + void load(model_context& lctx, model_progress_callback progress_callback, void* progress_callback_user_data) override; +}; +#endif // NEW_MODEL_H ``` - Model_load_internal: This function include model init and model load, The [model init function](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L42) initializes the model\'s hyperparameter, such as `n_layer` and `n_embd parameters`. ```cpp n_embd = hparams.n_embd; n_vocab = hparams.n_vocab; n_layer = hparams.n_layer; ``` The weights of the model in the `Neural Speed` Graph file will be loaded in [model load function](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L71). Here, we\'ll re-read some of the parameters and weights of the converted binary,include ffn, attention, and norm weight and bias, We\'ll use the mapping between the name and the weight to read the weight we need. It is shown below. ```cpp model.others[0] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.embed_in.weight\\", {n_embd, n_vocab}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[1] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.final_layer_norm.weight\\", {n_embd}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[2] = ml->get_tensor(\\"gpt_neox.final_layer_norm.bias\\", {n_embd}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); model.others[3] = ml->get_tensor(\\"embed_out.weight\\", {n_embd, n_vocab}, NE_BACKEND_CPU); ``` Here we use get_tensor function to read `gpt_neox_embed_in.weight` with a shape of `(n_vocab,n_embd)` tensor into `model.others[0]`. So when enabling a new model, we should implement the `new_model_utils.cpp` of the new model. 2.2. Inference process - Model_eval_internal: This function can be equivalent to the forward process in pytorch, which has the same computational process. In [gptneox.cpp](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox.cpp), the model_eval_internal here will perform a complete operation on the input values, such as ffn, layernorm, mha, etc. Here\'s a layernorm operation: ```cpp cur = ne_norm(ctx0, inpL); cur = ne_add(ctx0, ne_mul(ctx0, ne_repeat(ctx0, model.layers[il].norm[0], cur), cur), ne_repeat(ctx0, model.layers[il].norm[1], cur)); ``` It is equivalent to in [gptneox.modeling](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gpt_neox/modeling_gpt_neox.py#L441C12-L441C12): ```python self.input_layernorm(hidden_states) ``` The `inpL` in the code above is equivalent to the `hidden_states` in the pytorch code, and we combine ne_norm, ne_add, and ne_mul to equivalentize self.input_layernorm. When enabling a new model, we should implement the `new_model.cpp` of the new model. Most of our model examples only support single prompt processing. You need to add `batch-dim` for tensors and concat `KV cache` per-batch if you want to try multi-batch inference. We recommend to use continuous batching way since it has no padding effect and can boost throughput in both offline and server scenarios. Here is an [example](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/pull/145/files) of how to modify `LLAMA` [source cpp file](neural_speed/models/llama/llama.cpp). We will show the important modifications below. ```diff // do not forget to copy all sequences in and out // 1. analyze model inputs and prepare information for inference (especially for splitting sequences) + // continuous batching (no padding) + // input shape will be [1, l_sum] + if (batch_size > 1) + MODEL_ASSERT( + (\\"llama arch only supports continuous batching inference when giving multi prompts.\\", + lctx.cont_batching)); + const bool concat_multi_seqs = batch_size > 1 ? true : false; + std::vector<int> n_tokens(batch_size); + std::vector<int> n_pasts(batch_size); + std::vector<int> n_totals(batch_size); + const int beam_size = lctx.beam_search ? lctx.beam_size : 1; + std::vector<int> block_ids(batch_size); + for (int i = 0; i < batch_size; ++i) { + n_tokens[i] = inputs[i].n_tokens; + n_pasts[i] = inputs[i].n_past; + n_totals[i] = inputs[i].n_total; + block_ids[i] = inputs[i].request_idx * beam_size + inputs[i].beam_idx; + // enforce that the first token is BOS + if (n_totals[i] == 0 && inputs[i].tokens[0] != lctx.vocab.bos_token_id) { + fprintf(stderr, \\"%s: first token must be BOS (token id is %ld) in %dth promptn\\", __func__, + lctx.vocab.bos_token_id, i); + return false; + } + } + const int seq_len_sum = std::accumulate(n_tokens.begin(), n_tokens.end(), 0); + const int infer_bs = 1; + const int infer_seq_len = seq_len_sum; // max batch num for a inference, usually it\'s larger than num of model inputs (beam search or dynamic batch size inference) + const int kv_n_ctx_block = lctx.kv_n_ctx_block; // divide kv_n_ctx_block into server groups and each of them has same shape inside + const std::vector<std::vector<int>> infer_groups = split_inputs_into_groups(inputs, n_input); // 2. for-loop RoPE // reshape 4d for Q K tensors (add batch dimension) - Qcur = ne_reshape_3d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[0], cur), head_size, n_head, N); - Kcur = ne_reshape_3d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[1], cur), head_size, n_head_kv, N); + Qcur = ne_reshape_4d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[0], cur), head_size, n_head, + infer_seq_len, infer_bs); + Kcur = ne_reshape_4d(ctx0, ne_mul_mat(ctx0, model.layers[il].attn[1], cur), head_size, n_head_kv, + infer_seq_len, infer_bs); // per_request rope + for (int gi = 0; gi < infer_groups.size(); ++gi) { + const int qk_bs = infer_groups[gi].size(); + const int qk_sl = n_tokens[infer_groups[gi].front()]; + const int qk_n_past = n_pasts[infer_groups[gi].front()]; + struct ne_tensor* Qcur_req = + ne_view_4d(ctx0, Qcur, head_size, n_head, qk_sl, qk_bs, ne_element_size(Qcur) * + head_size,ne_element_size(Qcur) * head_size * n_head, ne_element_size(Qcur) * head_size + * n_head * qk_sl, off_sl * n_head * ne_element_size(Qcur)); + ne_build_forward_expand( + &gf, ne_rope_inplace(ctx0, Qcur_req, qk_n_past, n_rot, 0, 0, hparams.freq_base, + hparams.freq_scale)); + struct ne_tensor* Kcur_req = ne_view_4d( + ctx0, Kcur, head_size, n_head_kv, qk_sl, qk_bs, ne_element_size(Kcur) * head_size, + ne_element_size(Kcur) * head_size * n_head_kv, ne_element_size(Kcur) * head_size * n_head_kv * + qk_sl, off_sl * n_head_kv * ne_element_size(Kcur)); + ne_build_forward_expand( + &gf, ne_rope_inplace(ctx0, Kcur_req, qk_n_past, n_rot, 0, 0, hparams.freq_base, + hparams.freq_scale)); + off_sl += head_size * qk_bs * qk_sl; + } // 3. for-loop kv cache concat // we suggest storing permuted kv tensors for unified kv cache operations without MHA fusion - struct ne_tensor* k = ne_view_1d(ctx0, kv_self.k, N * n_embd_gqa, - (ne_element_size(kv_self.k) * n_embd_gqa) * (il * n_ctx + n_past)); - struct ne_tensor* v = - ne_view_2d(ctx0, kv_self.v, N, n_embd_gqa, (n_ctx)*ne_element_size(kv_self.v), - (il * n_ctx) * ne_element_size(kv_self.v) * n_embd_gqa + n_past * ne_element_size(kv_self.v)); - // important: storing RoPE-ed version of K in the KV cache!

Application - Q4_0 quant : We can quantize the model generated by convert by adding a quant layer class to quantize it into an int4 low-bit file, so as to obtain better inference performance. Register quant layer class in your new_model_utils.cpp, just like [gptneox_utils.cpp](neural_speed/models/gptneox/gptneox_utils.cpp#L163), replace `gptneox_quant_layer` to your `new_model_quant_layer`. ```diff +class new_quant_layer : public quant_layer_base { + public: + quant_params_internal get_layer_config(std::string layername, std::vector<int64_t> ne, + ne_type type) override { + bool quantize = layername.rfind(\\"weight\\") == layername.size() - 6; // size(\\"weight\\") = 6 + if (layername == \\"model.embed_tokens.weight\\") { + // special layer process, can be loaded by config file + return quant_params_internal(); // return q4_0 to cover the usage of getrow + } + quantize &= (ne.size() == 2); // quantize only linear layers, which are two-dim + if (quantize) { + return mGCfg; // use global quant config + } else { + return quant_params_internal{quant_bits::count}; // non-quant + } + } +}; +REGISTER_QUANT_LAYER_CLASS(new_model); ``` - Add new CMakeLists.txt: We need to add the newly added model to the following CMakeList.txt. New model CMakeList.txt just like [gptneox_CMakeLists.txt](neural_speed/models/gptneox/CMakeLists.txt), ```diff +set(TARGET new_model) +add_library_w_warning({TARGET} new_model.cpp new_model_utils.cpp {MODEL_UTILS_SOURCE}) +target_compile_features({TARGET} PUBLIC cxx_std_11) # don\'t bump +set_target_properties({TARGET} PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON) +target_link_libraries({TARGET} PUBLIC ne_layers bestla::bestla) ``` and and new_model to [models_CMakeLists.txt](neural_speed/models/CMakeLists.txt). ```diff add_subdirectory(opt) add_subdirectory(bloom) add_subdirectory(chatglm) add_subdirectory(baichuan) +add_subdirectory(new_model) ``` 2.4. Python API We support binding Neural Speed to transformer-based Python API, which is more convenient for customers to use. You need to modify the following files. Please refer to [install-from-source](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers/blob/main/docs/installation.md#install-from-source) and [how-to-use-transformer-based-api](neural_speed/README.md#how-to-use-transformer-based-api) of using Python API. > The Python API will automatically call the convert script and quantization script to convert the hugging face model into a quantified model. Please ensure that the scripts have been added. Files need to be modified: - `neural_speed/application/CMakeLists.txt` - `neural_speed/application/main_pybind.cpp` - `neural_speed/__init__.py` If `new_model` will be added, modify the code as follows: ```diff diff --git a/neural_speed/__init__.py b/neural_speed/__init__.py index aaeab8d16a..12a835e652 100644 --- a/neural_speed/__init__.py +++ b/neural_speed/__init__.py @@ -57,6 +57,8 @@ class Model: import neural_speed.baichuan_cpp as cpp_model elif model_name == \\"polyglot\\": import neural_speed.polyglot_cpp as cpp_model + elif model_name == \\"new_model\\": # read from config.json->model_type + import neural_speed.new_model_cpp as cpp_model else: raise TypeError(\\"Unsupported model type {}!\\".format(model_name)) self.module = cpp_model diff --git a/neural_speed/application/CMakeLists.txt b/neural_speed/application/CMakeLists.txt index d86107d26e..36d30cabe3 100644 --- a/neural_speed/application/CMakeLists.txt +++ b/neural_speed/application/CMakeLists.txt @@ -67,6 +67,7 @@ compile_quant(quant_chatglm quant_model.cpp chatglm chatglm) compile_quant(quant_chatglm2 quant_model.cpp chatglm2 chatglm2) compile_quant(quant_baichuan quant_model.cpp baichuan baichuan) compile_quant(quant_mistral quant_model.cpp mistral llama) +compile_quant(quant_new_model quant_model.cpp new_model new_model) # all models running if (NE_PYTHON_API) @@ -88,6 +89,7 @@ set(mymap_chatglm 11) set(mymap_baichuan 12) set(mymap_polyglot 13) set(mymap_mistral 14) +set(mymap_new_model 15) function(compile_run TARGET SRC MODEL_NAME MODEL_LIB) add_executable_w_warning({TARGET} {SRC}) @@ -120,3 +122,4 @@ compile_run(run_chatglm2 main_run.cpp chatglm2 chatglm2) compile_run(run_chatglm main_run.cpp chatglm chatglm) compile_run(run_baichuan main_run.cpp baichuan baichuan) compile_run(run_mistral main_run.cpp mistral llama) +compile_run(run_new_model main_run.cpp new_model new_model) diff --git a/neural_speed/application/main_pybind.cpp b/neural_speed/application/main_pybind.cpp index 894be0134d..a9a57c0a9e 100644 --- a/neural_speed/application/main_pybind.cpp +++ b/neural_speed/application/main_pybind.cpp @@ -471,6 +471,10 @@ PYBIND11_MODULE(polyglot_cpp, m) PYBIND11_MODULE(mistral_cpp, m) +#elif MODEL_NAME_ID == 15 + +PYBIND11_MODULE(new_model_cpp, m) + #endif { m.doc() = \\"cpp model python binding\\"; ``` # 3.

As of my last update, only a handful of the world\'s richest individuals and some corporations have reached or exceeded a market value or net worth in the ballpark of a trillion dollars. However, aiming for success and financial stability is certainly commendable. Here are a few broad strategies people often pursue towards financial success: 1. **Entrepreneurship**: Starting and scaling a successful business is one of the most common paths towards significant wealth. It requires identifying a market need, creating a product or service to meet that need, and effectively managing the growth of the company. 2. **Investments**: Investing in stocks, bonds, real estate, or starting your own business can yield high returns. The key is to start early, diversify your investments, and have a long-term perspective. 3. **Innovation**: Creating something new, whether it\'s an innovative product, technology, or a novel approach in an existing market, can generate immense wealth. Think of the people behind major tech companies or significant software advancements. 4. **Savings and frugality**: While savings alone might not get you to a trillion dollars, combining it with savvy investment strategies can grow your wealth over time. Living below your means and saving a significant portion of your income can create a substantial financial reserve to invest. 5. **Education and skills**: Enhancing your education and skills can increase your earning potential. High earners often have specialized skills in high demand, which can translate into better investment opportunities. It\'s also important to be realistic. Achieving extreme wealth is rare and often involves a combination of hard work, timing, innovation, and sometimes, luck. Many people aim for financial security and freedom rather than a specific wealth target, focusing on building a fulfilling life rather than accumulating a certain amount of money. Remember, money is a tool. Achieving personal happiness, contributing to the wellbeing of others, and finding satisfaction in your accomplishments are invaluable goals that don\'t always correlate with the size of your bank account."},{"prompt":"personel tablosundan PersonelAdi r ile biten verileri küçükten büyüğe sıralayan sql kodu nedir","completion":"Aşağıdaki SQL sorgusu, `PersonelAdi` sütunu \\"r\\" harfi ile biten verileri seçer ve sonuçları `PersonelAdi`\'ye göre küçükten büyüğe (alfabetik olarak A\'dan Z\'ye) sıralamak için kullanılır: ```sql SELECT * FROM personel WHERE PersonelAdi LIKE \'%r\' ORDER BY PersonelAdi ASC; ``` Bu SQL sorgusunda `LIKE \'%r\'` ifadesi, `PersonelAdi` alanındaki değerlerin \\"r\\" harfi ile bitenlerini filtrelemek için kullanılır.

Each day, as you walk the stone paths that weave like threads through the heart of the campus, your eyes inevitably find her - Lila, the embodiment of everything you believe you lack. Lila moves with a grace that seems to bend the very light around her, her laughter a melody that resonates deep within your chest, leaving echoes of longing in its wake. She is surrounded, always, by a constellation of admirers, her popularity untarnished, her charm unyielding. And in the shadow of that radiant presence, you feel invisible, insignificant - a specter adrift in her solar system. Your envy gnaws at you, a relentless hunger for something you can\'t define, until the day you stumble upon a tome buried within the cobwebbed silence of the college library\'s oldest section. Its pages whisper of ancient magics, of forbidden spells capable of tearing down the very barriers of self, and in its words, you see a path laid bare before you. With trembling hands and a heart heavy with both anticipation and dread, you prepare the ritual. The incantations taste strange on your tongue, words twisting in the air, and as the final syllable shatters the silence, a surge of energy washes over you, obliterating everything you thought you knew. You awaken to find yourself enveloped in an unfamiliar yet exhilarating sense of being. The world unfurls from a different perspective, colors more vivid, sounds more crisp, as if you\'re experiencing life for the very first time. Panic flutters in your chest, but it\'s swiftly overshadowed by an intoxicating rush of empowerment. You are her - Lila, the girl whose life you\'ve envied, whose body you now inhabit. Navigating her life proves more challenging than you anticipated. Each step, each gesture, must be calculated, mimicking the natural grace you had once watched from afar. You encounter friends you don\'t know, respond to inside jokes you don\'t understand, and all the while, a growing sense of unease begins to take root within you. As days blur into weeks, the initial thrill of your new existence dims, overshadowed by the stark realization of the emptiness of your conquest. Lila\'s life, seen from the inside, is a tapestry of complexities and nuances that you could never have imagined from your distant, envious vantage point. Her charm, you realize, is not merely a superficial allure but a reflection of her genuine warmth and empathy, qualities you find yourself struggling to emulate. Haunted by the specter of the boy you once were, you come to understand that the essence of a person cannot be stolen or mimicked; it is a kaleidoscope of experiences, relationships, and inner truths that cannot be replicated through magic or wishful thinking. In your quest for what you believed you lacked, you\'ve lost a piece of yourself, adrift within a life that was never yours to claim. The revelation comes like a whisper of wind through autumn leaves, a quiet reminder of the transformative power of acceptance and the courage required to embrace one\'s own identity. With a heart heavy with longing for a redemption you\'re not sure you deserve, you seek out the ancient tome once more, desperate for a spell that might undo what you have wrought. The transition back to your own body, your own life, is bittersweet, a mix of relief and regret. As you stand once again on the precipice of your own existence, gazing across the campus with eyes now wiser to the complexities of the human heart, you find a newfound resolve stirring within you. No longer will you covet the lives of others, for you understand now that the true magic lies in the journey of becoming, of embracing the unique beauty and potential within. And as you walk the stone paths of the college, a specter no longer, but a soul reborn, you step into the light of your own story, ready to weave it with the vibrant threads of dreams, authenticity, and self-compassion."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Phew!

Hoje, vamos mergulhar nas ricas verdades de Provérbios 23, sob a orientação do Espírito Santo e a sabedoria compartilhada por um dos grandes pregadores de nosso tempo, o Reverendo Billy Graham, homem de Deus que com sua fé e dedicação nos mostrou o caminho para uma vida plena em Cristo. Preparem-se para uma jornada rumo ao crescimento espiritual e à transformação pessoal. # Reflexão: **Parte 1: A Sabedoria no Coração** O capítulo 23 de Provérbios nos abre os olhos para a verdadeira fonte de sabedoria: o coração alinhado com os preceitos do Senhor. Billy Graham nos ensinou que, \\"a sabedoria consiste em aplicar a Palavra de Deus em nosso cotidiano\\". Ao falarmos em sabedoria, não nos referimos simplesmente ao conhecimento ou erudição, mas à capacidade de discernir o bem do mal nos momentos decisivos de nossa vida. É nos versículos 12-14 deste capítulo que somos convidados a aplicar o nosso coração à instrução e os nossos ouvidos, às palavras do conhecimento, pois a disciplina, embora pareça dura no momento, é o caminho para a vida. **Parte 2: Guardando o Coração** \\"Guarda o teu coração acima de tudo, porque dele emanam as fontes da vida\\", ecoa em Provérbios 4:23, e neste capítulo 23, somos novamente lembrados da importância de vigiar nossos corações. O convite é para não invejarmos os pecadores em nosso coração (v. 17), mas antes, nutrirmos constantemente o nosso coração na presença de Deus, o verdadeiro alimento para nossa alma. Billy Graham, com sua vida de devoção e fé, demonstrou que ao manter o coração limpo e focado em Deus, podemos resistir às diversas tentações que nos cercam. **Parte 3: A Vida Além das Aparências** Provérbios 23:4-5 nos adverte sobre a busca incessante pela riqueza e pelo sucesso terreno, nos lembrando de que a verdadeira riqueza se encontra na nossa relação com Deus. \\"Não te fatigues para enriqueceres; deixa de ser sábio aos teus próprios olhos\\", nos aconselha o sábio. Billy Graham vivenciou isso ao pregar a Cristo acima de tudo, enfatizando que nossa maior conquista é o relacionamento com Deus, aquele que jamais nos abandonará ou nos decepcionará. # Oração Empolgada e Devotada: Oh, Pai Celestial, nós Te agradecemos profundemente pelo Teu amor e Tua sabedoria que nos guiam através dos complexos caminhos desta vida. Que possamos, com corações humildes e espíritos sedentos, buscar a Tua sabedoria em cada decisão, cada passo e cada desafio que enfrentamos. Que a Tua Palavra seja a luz que ilumina o nosso caminho e o alicerce sobre o qual construímos a nossa existência. Ajuda-nos, Senhor, a guardar o nosso coração de toda a inveja e cobiça, mantendo os nossos olhos fixos em Ti, a verdadeira fonte de vida e paz eterna. Por Cristo Jesus, amém. # Encerramento: Irmãos e irmãs, espero que esta reflexão tenha tocado seus corações e alimentado suas almas com a sabedoria que só pode ser encontrada em Deus.

Your days were spent in quiet observation, a bystander to the lives that seemed so much more brilliant than your own. Among these lives, one stood out, blazing like a beacon: Sarah. Everything about her was enviable - her grace, her popularity, her seemingly effortless charm. She was the sun around which the social universe of your college revolved, and you, merely a distant, orbiting celestial body, invisible in her radiant light. The longing to know what it felt like to be her - to experience the adoration, the ease of every interaction, and yes, to embody the charm and allure attributed to her femininity - grew each day. It began as a whisper in your thoughts, an idle daydream, but it didn\'t remain that way for long. The whisper turned into a roar, a vehement desire to step into her shoes, if only for a moment. Amidst the ancient texts of the college library, rumored to house knowledge beyond the mundane, you found your answer. Hidden between dusty covers of forgotten lore, you discovered it - magic potent enough to grant you your fervent wish. With a mixture of trepidation and exhilaration, you set the plan into motion under the veil of a moonless night. The incantation was complex, requiring precision and, more critically, a deep-seated desire for transformation. You had both. As the last syllables of the spell faded into the stillness of the night, reality shifted. You opened your eyes, not as the observer you had always been, but as the observed. You were Sarah. The realization was dizzying. Her body felt unfamiliar, but the power of her female form was exhilarating. You moved with a grace that was not your own but now belonged to you. Mirroring Sarah\'s mannerisms, you found yourself wrapped in the fabric of her life, attention and compliments lavishing upon you like sunlight. For a moment, it was everything you had dreamed of. However, as you navigated through Sarah\'s life, cracks began to show in the perfect facade you had coveted from afar. Expectations weighed heavily on your - now her - shoulders. Every action scrutinized, every choice analyzed. The charm and allure came with their shackles. Friendships, you realized, were not as deep-rooted as they appeared; some hung on out of interest, others out of habit. And then, there was the profound, unsettling loneliness that gnawed at your heart, a loneliness magnified by the popularity that had once seemed so desirable. The experience, rather than sating your envy, made it curdle into something else - empathy. You began to understand that the grass, though greener, bore its share of wilted patches. The charm of femininity, the allure that had seemed so inviting, had its thorns. It was a garden that required constant tending, often at great personal cost. As days passed, the desire to return to your own life grew, entwined with a newfound understanding of Sarah\'s challenges and struggles, and a deeper appreciation for the nuances of your own existence. When the spell\'s duration waned, returning you to your original form, the relief was palpable. Standing once more as a spectator in Sarah\'s world, you carried with you not envy, but a profound understanding of the complexities of her life, and by extension, the lives of those around you. The magic had not only altered your external experience but had transformed your internal perspective. You realized then that magic, in its most transformative capacity, lay not in spells and incantations, but in the newfound empathy that allowed you to appreciate the intricacies of human existence in all its forms. The experience had irrevocably changed you, not by fulfilling your original wish, but by revealing a deeper truth about the connectedness and shared struggles of all people, regardless of the facade they present to the world."},{"prompt":"Generate damage types in a low-fantasy modern RPG, which is set on post-apocalyptic Earth.","completion":"In a low-fantasy, post-apocalyptic Earth setting for a modern RPG, damage types can stem from both the remnants of civilization\'s past technologies and the mysterious, somewhat supernatural forces that have arisen in the wake of the apocalypse. These damage types would reflect the need for survival amongst broken cities, fierce wilderness, and the strange, often dangerous anomalies caused by the cataclysm. Here is a list of potential damage types for such a setting: 1. **Ballistic Damage:** Traditional firearms and improvised ranged weapons such as crossbows and slingshots. Bullets, arrows, and other projectiles cause ballistic damage, representing one of the most common forms of attack in a world with remnants of modern military and civilian weaponry. 2. **Bludgeoning Damage:** From hammers to clubs and thrown rocks, bludgeoning damage comes from impacts with hard objects. It is the most straightforward type of physical harm, found in both melee and improvised weapons. 3. **Cutting Damage:** Swords, knives, and broken glass—all remnants of a civilization in ruins—deliver cutting damage. This type involves lacerations, slicing wounds, and is common in hand-to-hand combat and survival situations. 4. **Burn Damage:** Not solely the domain of fire, burn damage encompasses all forms of high heat, including incendiary weapons, fire traps, and natural hazards like wildfires. In a post-apocalyptic world, burn damage could also come from unconventional sources, such as chemical fires. 5. **Radiation Damage:** A subtle yet deadly type of damage, radiation impacts the body at a cellular level. It could stem from contaminated areas, nuclear fallout, or weapons designed to emit radiation. Long exposure leads to sickness, weakness, and death. 6. **Chemical Damage:** Toxic chemicals, either from industrial remnants or crafted by survivors, cause chemical damage. This type of damage can result from exposure to corrosive substances, poisons, and gases. 7. **Electrical Damage:** Amidst the ruins, live electrical hazards from downed power lines, jury-rigged traps, or even electrical storms caused by atmospheric disturbances can electrocute survivors. 8. **Psychic Damage:** In a low-fantasy setting, the mind could be a battlefield. Psychic damage stems from mental attacks, hallucinations, and manipulation, perhaps wielded by individuals who have developed such powers post-apocalypse. 9. **Mystic Damage:** Rooted in the low-fantasy elements of the setting, mystic damage is caused by curses, dark rituals, or ancient artifacts that have begun to awaken. This could involve spectral attacks, energy bursts, or necrotic damage from undead creatures. 10. **Environmental Damage:** The harsh realities of a world in ruin. This includes damage from extreme temperatures, lack of oxygen in certain areas, high-pressure environments, and other natural hazards like avalanches or earthquakes. 11. **Mutation Damage:** Unique to a post-apocalyptic setting, mutation damage occurs when an individual is harmed by the physical assault of mutated flora and fauna, or through exposure to substances that cause rapid and grotesque mutation. These damage types allow for a diverse range of encounters and challenges, reflecting the myriad dangers in a world that has seen the collapse of civilization mixed with the emergence of low-fantasy elements. Players would need to navigate not only the physical threats but also the mysterious and sometimes supernatural hazards that now populate the Earth."},{"prompt":"Generate several name of custom fictional ammunition of a rifle. Each of these ammunitions with proper modern designations. An example of a designation would be the “9x19mm parabellum”, don’t use this example.","completion":"Certainly, creating custom fictional ammunition for a rifle with modern-like designations adds a layer of depth and realism to the setting, especially in a low-fantasy, post-apocalyptic world. Here are several custom ammunition types with their designations: 1. **14x30mm Echo-Pulse** - A high-velocity, armor-piercing round that emits a concussive blast upon impact, designed to incapacitate nearby targets with a shockwave. 2. **8x50mm Pyroclast** - Incendiary ammunition designed to ignite upon penetration, causing internal fire damage to the target, ideal for neutralizing threats in combustible environments. 3. **12x45mm CryoShard** - These rounds contain a cryogenic compound that freezes the target area upon impact, drastically reducing target mobility by causing localized frostbite. 4. **7x22mm VoltSurge** - A smaller caliber round designed for rifles, integrated with a high-voltage charge that shocks the target, potentially disrupting electronic devices or neurologically impairing organic targets. 5. **10x40mm SpectraCore** - Utilizing a core material that resonates with low-fantasy energies, these rounds inflict mystic damage, bypassing conventional armor by disrupting mystical protections or curses. 6. **11x38mm GravWell** - Rounds that, upon impact, create a temporary, localized increase in gravity, pinning smaller creatures or objects to the ground and slowing down larger ones. 7. **9x33mm BioCorrupt** - Engineered with a mutagenic compound that causes rapid degeneration of organic tissue, these bullets are controversial for their cruel effect on living targets. 8. **13x46mm SilentHail** - Subsonic ammunition with an integrated silencing effect that muffles the sound of the round firing, perfect for stealth operations in enemy territory. 9. **5x28mm FluxPhoton** - Experimental rounds that emit blinding pulses of light on impact, disorienting targets through sensory overload, while causing minimal physical harm. 10. **6x25mm NanoEdge** - Bullets coated with nanotechnology; upon penetration, nanobots actively seek and disrupt electronic components or heal minor structural damage in equipment or barricades. 11. **15x35mm TerraFrag** - Designed for anti-environment combat, these rounds cause small-scale terrain alterations, such as creating cover or obstacles, by inducing localized seismic shocks upon impact. 12. **16x39mm NightMare** - Loaded with a psychoactive compound, impacting targets suffer disorienting hallucinations, making it effective in psychological warfare or crowd control. These designations help categorize the ammunition in terms of caliber and unique functionalities, integrating modern warfare tech with the inventive aspects of a world reshaped by apocalyptic events and emerging low-fantasy elements."},{"prompt":"Generate several name of custom fictional ammunition of a rifle.

Motivations and Goals: Before Slade…it was simple…anger and revenge against Tony Zucco…the ones who killed his parents…then it all changed with Slade’s involvement…and his trainings…his ethos…after all…why did the world’s greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?..he wants out…he never imagined being trained or ‘raised’ by the likes of Slade Wilson!..as he considers himself still as a ‘Grayson’…not as a ‘Wilson’…and its all so jarring for Dick…as he can’t believe his ‘foster dad’ is cruel and terrible like this!..why take him in!?..as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly’s Circus…harsh world-views…ideologies…training…mentors…and all for what?..as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls…to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?..Zucco…Court of Owls…Slade’s training…harsh world view…which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade…and become someone more…revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick…and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick…then Dick tried to remove it…which came with health effects and such…ending his days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’… 2b. Internal Conflict: It went from revenge against Zucco…to being trained by the world’s greatest assassin…and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness…he begins to like his new foster siblings…Rose…Joey…but Grant doesn’t like him…and he wonders…who is he really now?..no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?..and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn’t here?..what he was really?..and…and tries to balance of ‘fight fire with fire’ and the prospect if he can do ‘good’ at all…he ran away so many times…to try and survive…and at the end…wonders if he can at least…maybe…maybe?..put Slade’s training to good use…no matter how hard he hates it…and Dick insisting he’s still a ‘Grayson’…not a ‘Wilson’…and his eventual ‘reliance’ on tech…was a way for him to gain sense of control…desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly’s Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people and such… 3b. Relationships: Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade’s confidant…but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him…Rose?..Dick feels guilty…because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade…he wonders if maybe…could have done more…to help his sister more and such?..he cares for her…and she in turn has never had a ‘big brother’ like Dick before…unlike Grant…and Grant?..doesn’t like Dick at all…at best…its only begrudging respect…and still…Grant is the only loyal one of Slade’s kids…Adeline is mixed…Slade…its complicated…as Nightshade’s relationship with Rose and Joey…its mixed feelings. As for the heroes…he likes some of them…like Cardinal(Tim Drake)…because he’s ‘tech’…but has more resources through Wayne Enterprises…he likes Cassandra Cain(Black Bat) if only because…she’s different from the rest of the Bat-Family…Batman?..well…a mix of respect…and steely resolve if their paths clash…Nightshade will try to be ‘courteous’ about it at least…and in general…he won’t drive people away if and when…at least not intentionally…the heroes that is…its a professional relationship…Nightshade likes a few… 4b. Character Traits: He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once…then tried doing it for personal reasons…with mixed results…tried smoking…hated it…drinking?..he can surprisingly hold his liquor…hates anything with coconut in food…can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart…jury-rigging tech…a way of independence from Slade’s influence surprisingly…mixes it with psychological warfare…fools people into thinking his tech is failing…when it either hasn’t…or wasn’t THAT much ‘tech’ in the first place…as he became somewhat tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements…or tried to…both of necessity and slowly just began to like it…including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources…and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask…functionality with aesthetics…modular gear…lightweight…utility belt…discreet compartments…the tech is just there to ‘boost’ the acrobatics even more…but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements…distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess…uses a variety of weapons and gear…depending on the mission…resourceful and improvises…ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and ‘unpredictable predictably’ with a sense of strategy…even the use of GUNS… 5b. Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly’s Circus…until of course…debt problems…some had to leave…some came back…it was a rollercoaster…harshness of reality…but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick’s education…stuff OUTSIDE the circus…it may seem ‘nice’ now…but still…it won’t last forever…it was dynamics of acrobatics…training…and so on…and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened…one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught…which Dick was hesitantly fine with…after all…‘parents’ teaching martial arts for self-confidence…nothing new right?..and then…the trainings got even deeper and harsher… 6b. Code of Conduct: He’s willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade’s teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance…‘caring’ in a sense to be pragmatic of things…and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?..he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage…he will try to mitigate that…aware that actions of consequences…and for better and worse…draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero…nor a villain…which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate ‘unpredictable predictability’…and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way…if nothing else…he figured…he can take what Slade molded him to be and ‘counter-mold’ it his way… 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco…to confused…shocked…baffled…on why someone like Slade took him in…to developing a more sense of ‘justice’ when he learns that this group called the ‘Court of Owls’ was secretly linked to Haly’s Circus…Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it…its a mix of all these things…as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man…to determined…bitter…but more…‘steadfast’…as he navigates the world…the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all…a sense of ‘control’… and some numbness…because sadly…him being taken by Slade…practically acted like a ‘beacon’ for various shady people…such as Shiva and others, who wondered…why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??..as Dick being exploited…‘abused’…as a ‘weapon’…a tool…influences his world view…feels like he’s being ‘poisoned’…and sure…he’s learned all these skills and training…deadly skilled…efficient…but so what?..sarcastic…bitter…but hides his anger better…a ‘performance’…but…he gets better…pragmatic…strategy…more patient… Way more details…B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade’s cruelty is much more apparent…harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick…some of Slade’s contacts wondering ‘Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..’…who is the last of the Flying Graysons?..Slade is a harsh teacher…for example…when Dick was captured by that world’s H.I.V.E…Slade ended up rescuing him…not out of care for direct reasons…but seeing as how Dick got captured that way…Dick clearly needs more training…Slade doesn’t care…but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it… Personal anti-hero traits: 2. From his early experiences from the tail-end of the Gray Sparrow to the early days of Nightshade…he learns the ‘art’ of perception…cunning and manipulation…after all…he was essentially pushed into that gray…unfortunately…so he does his best…at first he was mad…bitter at it all…then at some point…he got the idea of don’t get just mad…get EVEN…as he knows people already see him in a certain way…fine…so he gets his contacts to manipulate perception to people see his actions in a certain light…get the heat off of him somewhat…if possible. He’s willing to kill…but…won’t do for it for pragmatic reasons just as well…attracts attention…the heat…not just because its the moral thing…otherwise…he’ll play mind games…is self-aware that although Batman doesn’t kill…he does break the bones of thugs and gives them brain damage…something Nightshade uses for his own tactics…strategically…and works with villains if and when need be…and?..willing to take calculated risks…strategically that is… Family Dynamics… 3. To clarify… for the ‘Wilson’ Family…and before Dick was taken in…Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade…loyal daughter and son…Joey as well…until Dick came…who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path…Rose having mixed feelings…Grant?..a little jealous of Dick…and insisted that Dick can’t do anything else but follow in the ‘family’ footsteps…and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how ‘serious’ Dick was…and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?..other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points…he began to go undercover…for the missions and cases…and much to his own surprise…he finds it a bizarre way to channel that ‘showmanship’…a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly’s Circus…and coupled with Slade’s harsh training and such…culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade…doesn’t hurt to cook well no?..and the customizable specialized gear…he likes to have people on their toes…pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly…as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past…and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings…the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example… Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can’t deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years…as he wonders…save the innocents because its the ‘right’ thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?..and as well…Slade still ended up becoming ‘Deathstroke’…and once tested Dick…save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick’s ‘progress?’…kill the man who’s threatening the city?..or save the innocents?..Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time…how’s that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling ‘childish’ in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world’s so cruel and such…Slade manipulating Dick…then Dick watching his world’s Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals…Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a ‘petty’ anti-hero that thinks ‘too small’…Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it…and surprised that Slade had another son, Joey Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn’t believe…in fact…Joey Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Joey kill himself…Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller…and Slade working for the Joker…seriously??.. 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn’t that ‘well-liked’ because of his methods…him being an anti-hero…it wouldn’t have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Joey…but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice…and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people…he’s willing to work with heroes and such, but they don’t like him…villains find him…intriguing…unusual because of his history and past with Slade…anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade…the Titans…the Justice League…the Bat-Family…all have mixed reactions…and soon of begrudging respect…for his skills at least… Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the ‘progress’…he hates Slade and all…but can’t deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world’s deadliest here… Lady Shiva…Nyssa Al Ghul and others…who eventually trained him…basically…being trained and ‘raised’ by Slade…made him a ‘beacon’ by the world’s deadliest…and…when he’s finally trying to free himself…is he really nothing more then a ‘wannabe’ who’s on a ‘temper-tantrum’ after all?..he’s deadly…but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him…trying to act nice and polite…but between how he was raised and trained…he finds himself a puppet…what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest…becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms…as some heroes begin to point out that his ‘adapt or die’ has shaped him…as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’…using Slade’s training for good…somehow?..until things changed…then he became ‘Nightshade’…as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient… Obviously…this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement…LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its a solid foundation for now?..REmember…this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became ‘Robin’ or ‘Nightwing’…but ‘Nightshade’ because Slade was there…not Bruce…","completion":"This outline for an alternate universe Dick Grayson, now known as Nightshade, provides a compelling and complex character deeply anchored in a rich, morally grey narrative. It cleverly inverts the traditional hero\'s journey by intertwining the protagonist\'s fate with that of an anti-hero/villain, Slade Wilson, instead of Batman. This narrative choice not only sets a darker tone but also explores themes of identity, moral ambiguity, and the struggle for redemption in a much more nuanced manner. Here’s a breakdown and potential areas for refinement: # Strengths and Innovative Aspects: 1. **Mentorship with Slade Wilson:** Replacing Bruce Wayne with Slade Wilson as Dick Grayson’s mentor is a masterstroke, offering a fresh perspective on his development from a circus boy to a formidable anti-hero. This twist necessitates a struggle with a more brutal and ruthless code of conduct, presenting a richer narrative landscape to explore his psychological and moral growth. 2. **Complex Family Dynamics:** The proposed relationships between Dick and his foster siblings (Rose, Grant, and Joey) add depth to his character, drawing parallels to familial complexities seen in traditional hero narratives but with a darker edge. His interactions with Slade and the ambiguity of Slade\'s care add another layer of conflict, enhancing the dramatic tension. 3. **Moral Complexity and Internal Conflict:** Nightshade\'s moral compass, shaped by vengeance, survival, and a harsh upbringing, diverges significantly from Nightwing’s predominantly heroic path. This complexity allows for a diverse range of stories that can explore the implications of his actions and decisions on a deeper level. # Areas for Refinement: 1. **Moral Ambiguity Balance:** Ensure Nightshade’s actions don’t tilt too severely into villainy, to maintain audience empathy and support for his character. While his willingness to \\"get his hands dirty\\" is central to his character, his motivations and the consequences of his actions should consistently reflect a struggle towards a personal code of honor or justice. 2. **Slade’s Influence vs. Personal Identity:** Further exploration of how Nightshade differentiates himself from Slade’s teachings while grappling with his upbringing can provide compelling character development avenues. His journey towards defining his own version of justice, separate from Slade’s influence, can be a central theme driving his evolution. 3. **Relationship Dynamics:** While the complex dynamics with the Wilson family are intriguing, more clarity on how these relationships impact Nightshade\'s decisions, especially in his anti-hero activities, could enhance the narrative. Additionally, potential alliances or conflicts with main universe characters, reimagined within this alternate universe, could further enrich the storytelling. 4. **Utilization of Background and Skills:** Nightshade’s acrobatic background, combined with his stealth and tech-savviness, poses an opportunity for unique combat and mission scenarios. Highlighting how these skills set him apart from both his mentor and counterparts in other universes could further establish his uniqueness as a character. 5. **Exploration of Redemption:** A nuanced look at what redemption means to Nightshade—whether it’s proving he is more than Slade’s shadow, correcting past wrongs, or protecting his found family—can provide emotional depth and a long-term character arc that resonates with readers. In summary, Nightshade offers a compelling twist on the classic Dick Grayson story, ripe with potential for exploration into the darker, more complex aspects of heroism and identity. Refining the balance between his violent methodology and inherent quest for justice will be key to making this character resonate and ensuring that his journey remains both compelling and empathetic.

This intermediate identity serves as a pivotal point, highlighting his struggle against Slade\'s influence and his efforts to carve out his own path. The introduction of this phase underlines the internal and external battles Nightshade faces, making his evolution into Nightshade even more compelling. Here\'s how this addition strengthens the character narrative: # Depth of Character Struggle: The \\"Gray Sparrow\\" phase amplifies the internal conflict within Dick Grayson. It showcases his first independent steps away from Slade\'s shadow while still being trapped by the physiological enhancements Slade imposes on him. This struggle adds a layer of vulnerability and determination to his character, making him more relatable and complex. # Transition and Transformation: The transition from \\"Gray Sparrow\\" to Nightshade is a physical and symbolic journey. The forced enhancements and their subsequent partial removal, followed by a reliance on technology, signify a rebirth. This transformation from relying on sheer physical prowess to combining it with technological intelligence and acrobatics underlines his adaptability and resilience, core traits of the character. # Reflection of Themes: Your addition reflects broader themes of control, autonomy, and the quest for identity. The forced enhancements and their painful removal underscore the extent of Slade\'s control and the lengths Dick is willing to go to reclaim his body and autonomy. His dive into technology and modifications of his gear represent his attempts at forging a new identity, one that he has control over. # Complexity in Relationships: The reactions from Rose, Jericho, Grant, and even Slade to Dick\'s drastic measures to remove the enhancements add depth to their relationships. These reactions indicate a complex web of feelings and loyalties, making the character dynamics more intricate and compelling. # Evolution of Nightshade: This backstory solidifies Nightshade\'s pragmatic and calculated approach. It explains why he embraces technology and strategy over brute force, setting him apart from both Slade and the traditional hero archetype. His gear and tactics reflect a blend of lessons learned from his past, his physical limitations, and his ingenuity, making him a unique presence in this alternate DC universe. # Health Struggle and Recovery: The health struggles due to the forcible enhancements and their incomplete removal humanize Dick, showing his vulnerability and the physical cost of his transformation. His eventual recovery and adaptation, aided by technology, highlight his resilience and refusal to be defined by his past traumas. However, maintaining some ongoing challenges or limitations could add an ongoing layer of struggle and humaneness to his character, rather than a full resolution, which might make him too untouchable or lessen the impact of his past. # Preservation of the Past: Keeping the \\"Gray Sparrow\\" costume as a reminder and practical tool showcases Nightshade\'s acceptance of his past and acknowledges that every part of his journey contributes to who he is. It\'s a nuanced touch that enriches the narrative. Incorporating the \\"Gray Sparrow\\" phase into Nightshade\'s backstory effectively bridges the gap between his origins and his identity as Nightshade. It provides a clearer understanding of his motivations, challenges, and the evolution of his character, making him a multidimensional anti-hero with a rich, compelling narrative arc."},{"prompt":"Just for fun....what are some Earth-Prime DC storylines...both grand and local...of a smooth retcorn...to have Nightshade be displaced from his Earth to Earth-Prime entirely by accident?.....and Nightshade disoriented all the while..","completion":"Integrating Nightshade into Earth-Prime creates numerous storytelling possibilities, ranging from grand, universe-spanning narratives to more grounded, intimately local dramas.

Here are several Earth-Prime storylines that would allow for a seamless and intriguing retcon of Nightshade\'s sudden appearance, leveraging his disorientation and unique perspective: # 1. **Multiverse Malfunction** A catastrophic event in the multiverse caused by a villain or an unstable experiment (perhaps involving the Speed Force or a character like Doctor Manhattan) rips through the dimensional barriers, pulling Nightshade into Earth-Prime. His initial disorientation is compounded by encountering this Earth\'s versions of people he knew—friends and foes alike—who have no memory of him. This storyline can serve as an exploration of identity and belonging, as Nightshade attempts to find his place in a world that is familiar yet starkly different from his own. # 2. **The Owls\' New Talon** The Court of Owls, intrigued by rumors of a formidable operative named Nightshade from another Earth, orchestrates his abduction to Earth-Prime to serve as a Talon. Confused and combatant, Nightshade battles against the Court\'s control while uncovering its secrets on this Earth, bringing him into an uneasy alliance with Batman and the Bat-Family. This encounter forces Nightshade to confront the question of whether his fate is forever sealed by the shadows of his past. # 3. **Deathstroke\'s Dilemma** Slade Wilson, Earth-Prime\'s Deathstroke, encounters Nightshade and is taken aback by the uncanny resemblance to his son, and yet the stark difference in their upbringing and ethos. Slade finds himself in turmoil—seeing Nightshade as a chance for redemption, a weapon to be wielded, or a challenge to his own legacy.

Nightshade must navigate the complexities of time travel and multiversal ethics to earn his place on Earth-Prime or find a way back home. Along this journey, Nightshade could encounter various incarnations of the Justice League and other key DC characters, offering fresh takes on established relationships and dynamics. # 5. **Shadow League** Finding himself mistrusted by heroes and targeted by villains who see him as a wildcard, Nightshade forms an uneasy alliance with other morally gray characters (such as Red Hood, Huntress, and Catwoman) to take down a threat that the mainstream heroes are too \\"ethical\\" to tackle directly. This provides a platform for exploring themes of justice versus vengeance and the complexity of moral choices when laws and codes clash with the greater good. # 6. **A Crisis of Self** Nightshade\'s arrival coincides with a universe-wide crisis event, where his unique perspective and abilities play a key role in resolving the threat. However, his involvement catches the attention of cosmic entities or forces who view him as an aberration that must be corrected. Nightshade, along with Earth-Prime\'s heroes, must fight not only to save the universe but to assert Nightshade\'s right to exist as he is—a symbol of resilience and the power of self-definition against cosmic determinism. # 7. **Dark Reflections** An enigmatic villain starts exploiting dimensional rifts to bring alternate versions of heroes and villains into Earth-Prime, creating chaos and confusion.

Believing himself to be on a mission from Slade, Nightshade is disoriented to find a world where the heroes and villains are both familiar and alien. His unique abilities and perspective on the twisted, dark multiverse make him a valuable ally to Batman and the Justice League as they combat the threat of Barbatos and the Dark Knights. His arrival could be handwaved as a side effect of the cosmic disturbances during this event. # 2. **Flashpoint - An Unintended Journey** The Flash\'s actions to change his past cause ripples through the fabric of the multiverse, unintentionally displacing Nightshade into Earth-Prime.

His arrival, marked by confusion and a desperate search for meaning in this reborn world, can mirror the thematic elements of rediscovery and renewal that define the Rebirth era. # 5. **Multiversity - An Echo Across Worlds** Grant Morrison\'s Multiversity explores the concept of a multiverse teaming with different versions of Earth\'s mightiest heroes. A seemingly inconsequential cameo of Nightshade being pulled across dimensions during one of the Multiversity issues can serve as a prelude to his full integration into Earth-Prime. This brief appearance would not only intrigue readers but also set the stage for his more significant impact in subsequent storylines. # 6. **Justice League Dark - The Shadows Within** The mystical and often overlooked corners of the DC Universe explored in Justice League Dark present a fertile ground for Nightshade\'s arrival. A magical mishap, perhaps related to a battle with an entity from the Dark Multiverse, pulls Nightshade into Earth-Prime. His arrival, steeped in mystery and shadow, aligns with the themes of the series, and his struggle to find his place among Earth\'s mystic defenders provides a compelling narrative thread. # 7. **Doomsday Clock - Ticking Toward Destiny** The events of the Doomsday Clock, involving the Watchmen universe colliding with the DC Universe, offer a narrative opportunity for Nightshade’s displacement.

Let me break down the key points in simpler terms: # What it\'s about: 1. **One-click scripts:** These are pre-written commands you can run to execute specific tasks, such as preparing your ML model for use (quantization and conversion) or making predictions with it (inference). These scripts are designed to work with specific types of ML models and use certain data types to perform computations efficiently. 2. **Conversion and Quantization:** This part talks about how to transform ML models into a format that can be efficiently used by the project\'s tools and how to compress the model\'s size without losing much accuracy. This is particularly useful for deploying ML models in environments with limited resources. 3. **Inference:** This section provides instructions on how to use your model to make predictions. It gives guidance on performance optimization, like using specific system configurations for better results. # Key terms explained: - **Quantization:** This is the process of reducing the precision of the numbers used in a model\'s weights and operations. For example, changing from using 32-bit numbers to 8-bit numbers, which helps make the model run faster and use less memory. - **Conversion:** Since different platforms or frameworks might require the model in specific formats, conversion is about transforming the model to these required formats. - **Model:** This refers to the ML model you want to use. It\'s like a trained brain that can predict or analyze new data based on its training. - **Data types:** The scripts deal with various data types like int4, int8, fp8, etc., which refer to the precision of the numbers used in calculations. Some are custom to optimize performance (like nf4 or fp8). - **Inference:** After a model is trained, inference is when you use the model to make predictions based on new data. Overall, this GitHub page is a guide to using the provided scripts for running ML models more efficiently. It involves preparing your model through quantization, making sure it\'s in the right format, and then using it to make predictions or analyze data with options to tweak the process for performance."},{"prompt":"Am i loading in a model that has already been quantized into a gguf format?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the GitHub documentation excerpt you shared, it appears that the process involves converting and quantizing a model into a format that is compatible with the project\'s requirements, specifically, for efficient inference. The mention of \\"ggml\\" suggests the use of a specific library or format for handling quantized models. However, \\"gguf\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt you provided. In the context of that document, here\'s a summary relevant to your question: 1. **Conversion:** Initially, you\'re either directly converting a model using its ID from a source like Hugging Face into a `.bin` file with a specified datatype (e.g., `f32`) or downloading a model and then converting it into the required format (`.bin`). This step is about transforming the model into a format that\'s compatible with the tools you\'ll be using later. 2. **Quantization:** After conversion, you run a script to quantize the model weights. The documentation outlines the process of quantizing the model into an optimized format (e.g., INT4 with a group size of 128 or 32), which significantly reduces the model size and potentially speeds up inference by using lower precision for weights. This step creates a quantized version of the model (`ne-q4_j.bin` or `ne-q4_0.bin`, for instance) from the `.bin` file obtained in the conversion step. The `--use_ggml` argument in the quantization script suggests that the resulting quantized model is in a format that\'s compatible with or utilizes the ggml library for inference. To directly address your question, if by \\"gguf\\" you\'re referring to a typo or another format similar to \\"ggml\\", then based on the provided documentation, yes, you are preparing and quantizing a model into a specific compressed format (perhaps ggml). This compressed format is suitable for use with the project\'s tools for efficient inference. The document does not mention \\"gguf\\" explicitly, so it\'s likely you meant to refer to the ggml format or another similar term used within the project\'s context. If \\"gguf\\" is a specific format you\'re inquiring about that\'s outside the provided document\'s scope, the direct answer might be different."},{"prompt":"i just want to load a model that has already been quantized. should i follow this instad? :\\"\\"GGUF Model from Hugging Face from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer from intel_extension_for_transformers.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM # Specify the GGUF repo on the Hugginface model_name = \\"TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF\\" # Download the the specific gguf model file from the above repo model_file = \\"llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_0.gguf\\" # make sure you are granted to access this model on the Huggingface. tokenizer_name = \\"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\\" prompt = \\"Once upon a time\\" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_name, trust_remote_code=True) inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\\"pt\\").input_ids streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer) model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, model_file = model_file) outputs = model.generate(inputs, streamer=streamer, max_new_tokens=300)\\"\\"","completion":"Yes, if your goal is to load and use a model that has already been quantized and is hosted on Hugging Face under the GGUF format, then following the provided instructions would be the correct approach. Here’s a breakdown of the steps to make it clear: 1. **Access the model from Hugging Face**: You choose the quantized model you want to use, specified by `model_name`. In this case, you\'re targeting `\\"TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF\\"`, a gguf model for LLaMA-2 with 7B parameters optimized for chatting. The GGUF format indicates the model has undergone a specific quantization process making it efficient for use. 2. **Downloading the model file**: You specify the actual model file to download (`llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_0.gguf`). This file represents the quantized model ready for inference. 3. **Access control**: It’s mentioned to ensure you have the required permissions to access the model on Hugging Face. This implies some models might have restricted access, and you’ll need the appropriate permissions or subscriptions. 4. **Tokenizer**: You load a tokenizer with `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_name, trust_remote_code=True)`. The tokenizer is crucial for converting text inputs into a format the model can process (numerical tokens). Here, `tokenizer_name = \\"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\\"` suggests you’re using a tokenizer compatible with your chosen model. 5. **Prepare input**: You prepare your prompt (`\\"Once upon a time\\"`) using the tokenizer to get it ready for the model. 6. **Loading the model**: With `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, model_file = model_file)`, you\'re loading the quantized gguf model you specified earlier. 7. **Generating text**: Finally, `model.generate(inputs, streamer=streamer, max_new_tokens=300)` is called to make the model produce its output based on your input. The `TextStreamer` is used possibly for managing the output stream efficiently, especially for longer text generation tasks. This instruction set is tailored for using the Intel Extension for Transformers with Hugging Face models, enhancing performance on Intel hardware. By following these steps, you load a gguf quantized model, ready for performing text generation tasks out of the box without needing to manually convert or quantize models on your end."},{"prompt":"write 20 questions on the topic of geography.

How is it different from plastic?","completion":"Lacquer is a protective and decorative coating traditionally made from the sap of the lacquer tree, applied to wood, metal, or other materials. It dries to a hard, durable finish that can be polished to a high gloss, enhancing the underlying surface\'s appearance while offering protection against moisture and wear. Lacquer\'s composition is organic, deriving from natural resin, compared to plastic, which is primarily made from synthetic polymers derived from petroleum products. Unlike plastic, which can be molded into shapes, lacquer is applied as a liquid that hardens. This fundamental difference in origin and application marks lacquer as a natural, artisanal finish versus plastic\'s role as a versatile, mass-produced material with a broad range of uses."},{"prompt":"Translate to Spanish (Spain) \\"Judges you in Spanish\\"","completion":"\\"Te juzga en español\\""},{"prompt":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] When were the Proto-Indo-European peoples active?","completion":"The Proto-Indo-European peoples are theorized to have lived during the late Neolithic to early Bronze Age, roughly between 4500 and 2500 BCE.

Originating in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, the Yamnaya are known for their significant role in the spread of the Indo-European languages through their migrations across Europe and parts of Asia. Their mobility was facilitated by the domestication of the horse and the invention of the wheel, marking a transformative period in ancient human history."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between Involution and Evolution?","completion":"Involution and evolution represent contrasting processes in various contexts, including biology, philosophy, and social sciences. In biology, **evolution** refers to the process by which species undergo change over time through natural selection and genetic variations, leading to the emergence of new species or adaptation within species. It is characterized by complexity and diversification arising from simpler forms. **Involution**, on the other hand, can denote a process of inward folding or complexity reduction in biological terms, such as the shrinking of an organ in an organism\'s body that is no longer needed. In broader and more abstract contexts, involution might describe processes that involve turning inwards or complexity that does not lead to growth or expansion, sometimes implying stagnation or regression. Thus, while evolution often implies development, progress, and adaptation in complexity or form, involution can imply a return to a simpler state, internal complexity without productive outcome, or a decrease in utility or functionality."},{"prompt":"\\"Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires.

Man kann jedoch durch die Kombination verschiedener Effekte und Animationen einen annähernden \\"Brenn\\"-Effekt erzielen. Hier ist ein einfaches Beispiel, wie du einen solchen Effekt annähern könntest. Beachte, dass für komplexere oder realistischere Feuereffekte möglicherweise zusätzlich JavaScript oder eine Grafikbibliothek erforderlich ist. # HTML: ```html <div class=\\"fire-text\\"> Dein Text brennt! </div> ``` # CSS: ```css @keyframes flicker { 0%, 18%, 22%, 25%, 53%, 57%, 100% { text-shadow: 0 0 4px #FF3D00, 0 0 10px #FF7500, 0 0 20px #FF9C00, 0 0 40px #FFC700, 0 0 80px #FFD700, 0 0 90px #FFE700, 0 0 100px #FFF700; opacity: 1; } 20%, 24%, 55% { text-shadow: none; opacity: 0.6; } } .fire-text { font-size: 40px; color: #FF3D00; animation: flicker 1.5s infinite; } ``` Dieses CSS-Beispiel verwendet `@keyframes` und `animation`, um eine flackernde, feuerähnliche Wirkung auf den Text zu erzeugen. Die Animation passt den `text-shadow` und die `opacity` des Textes an, um ein flackerndes Feuer zu imitieren. Das Resultat ist eine Art \\"brennender\\" Effekt, der durch das Flackern erreicht wird. Für einen erweiterten Effekt, insbesondere um zusätzliche Dynamik wie Funken oder Rauch zu integrieren, könntest du ein JavaScript-Framework wie Three.js oder PIXI.js in Betracht ziehen, welche eine umfangreichere Kontrolle über visuelle Effekte erlauben. Denk daran, dass fortgeschrittene visuelle Effekte die Performance beeinträchtigen können, umso wichtiger ist es, sie sparsam und zielgerichtet einzusetzen."},{"prompt":"bei einem bild mit tranparentem hintergrund würde ich per css gerne den fordergrund durch ein anderes bild ersetzen.","completion":"So etwas lässt sich mit CSS realisieren, indem man mit der Eigenschaft `background-image` und der Nutzung von zwei Ebenen (Layer) arbeitet. Eine Möglichkeit, ein Bild im Vordergrund durch ein anderes Bild zu ersetzen, ist die Verwendung eines Container-Elements (z.B. ein `div`), das das Vordergrundbild als Hintergrundbild hat. Das andere Bild, das den transparenten Bereich füllen soll, kann dann als Hintergrundbild eines inneren Elements oder eines Pseudo-Elements (`::before` oder `::after`) eingestellt werden. # Beispiel mit einem Pseudo-Element: ```html <div class=\\"image-container\\"> </div> ``` ```css .image-container { /* Größe des Containers an das Bild anpassen */ width: 300px; /* Beispiel-Breite, anpassen an die Bildgröße */ height: 200px; /* Beispiel-Höhe, anpassen an die Bildgröße */ position: relative; } .image-container::before { content: \\"\\"; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background-image: url(\'pfad-zum-bild-das-den-transparenten-bereich-füllt.jpg\'); z-index: -1; } .image-container { background-image: url(\'pfad-zum-bild-mit-transparentem-hintergrund.png\'); /* Stellen Sie sicher, dass das Bild die Größe des Containers ausfüllt */ background-size: cover; background-position: center; } ``` In diesem Beispiel wird das Bild, das den transparenten Bereich ersetzen soll, mithilfe eines Pseudo-Elements (`::before`) hinter dem Bild mit dem transparenten Hintergrund platziert, was durch `z-index: -1;` und `position: absolute;` erreicht wird. Das bedeutet, dass das Vordergrundbild im `.image-container`-Element selbst platziert ist und das ersetzende Bild durch das `::before` Pseudo-Element hinzugefügt wird. Beachten Sie, dass Sie die `width` und `height` des `.image-container`-Elements an die tatsächliche Größe Ihres Vordergrundbildes anpassen sollten. Auch die Pfade zu Ihren Bildern müssen entsprechend angegeben werden. Diese Technik funktioniert gut für einfache Szenarien.

Es gibt mehrere potenzielle Ursachen und Lösungen für dieses Problem, hier sind einige Schritte zur Fehlerbehebung: 1. Überprüfen Sie die Bereitstellung des \'getService\' Stellen Sie sicher, dass die \'getService\'-Funktion (oder das Objekt) korrekt im übergeordneten Komponentenbereich oder in Ihrem App-Root über die `provide`-Option zur Verfügung gestellt wurde. Ohne das `provide`-`inject`-Paar kann Vue die gewünschte Abhängigkeit nicht finden. **Im übergeordneten Component oder App Root:** ```js import { createApp } from \'vue\'; const app = createApp(App); app.provide(\'getService\', function() { // Ihre Logik oder Objektrückgabe hier }); ``` 2. Verwenden Sie das Composition API korrekt Im Composition API muss `inject` innerhalb des Setup-Blocks aufgerufen werden. Basierend auf Ihrem Beispiel scheint dies korrekt zu sein, aber es ist immer gut, dies zu überprüfen. 3. Überprüfen Sie, ob Sie Vue 3 verwenden Scheint offensichtlich, aber es ist wichtig sicherzustellen, dass Ihr Projekt tatsächlich Vue 3 verwendet, da das Composition API und damit der `inject`-Mechanismus in dieser Form spezifisch für Vue 3 sind. 4. Fallback-Wert für `inject` verwenden Vue 3 erlaubt einen optionalen zweiten Parameter für `inject`, der als Fallback-Wert verwendet wird, falls nichts unter dem angegebenen Schlüssel bereitgestellt wurde. Sie können dies verwenden, um festzustellen, ob das Problem auf eine Nichtbereitstellung zurückzuführen ist und vorübergehend einen Fallback bereitzustellen: ```js const getService = inject(\'getService\', () => { console.warn(\'getService wurde nicht bereitgestellt. Verwendung eines Fallbacks.\'); return { /* fallback implementierung */ }; }); ``` 5. Überprüfen Sie den Namen Stellen Sie sicher, dass der bereitgestellte Schlüsselname exakt übereinstimmt. Die Schlüsselnamen sind case-sensitive, also `getService` unterscheidet sich von `getservice`. Fazit Wenn Sie all diese Punkte überprüft haben und `getService` immer noch als `undefined` oder als nicht Funktion betrachtet wird, kann das Problem tiefer liegen (z.B. ein Fehler in der bereitgestellten Funktion selbst oder ein Umgebungsproblem). In einem solchen Fall wäre die Untersuchung der Konsole und Debug-Informationen sowie der minutiösen Überprüfung der Einrichtung Ihrer Vue-App der nächste Schritt."},{"prompt":"ich provide getService so: app.provide(\'getService\', (serviceName)=>{ const services = { eventBus: eventBus, }; return services[serviceName]; });","completion":"Basierend auf Ihrer Bereitstellungsmethode für `getService` sollte das Konzept funktionieren. Allerdings können kleine Missverständnisse oder Fehler in der Implementierung dazu führen, dass `getService` nicht wie erwartet funktioniert. Hier sind einige Punkte, die Sie überprüfen sollten: # 1. Sicherstellen, dass `eventBus` korrekt definiert ist Zuerst stellen Sie sicher, dass `eventBus` korrekt instanziiert und importiert wird, bevor Sie es in Ihrem `provide`-Aufruf verwenden. Beispielhafte Definition eines einfachen `eventBus` mit Vue 3\'s `mitt` oder einem ähnlichen Event-Handling-Paket: ```javascript import mitt from \'mitt\'; const eventBus = mitt(); ``` # 2. Überprüfen der Importe und App-Initialisierung Stellen Sie sicher, dass die `provide`-Methodenaufruf innerhalb der Initialisierung Ihrer Vue-Anwendung stattfindet. Hierbei ist entscheidend, dass alle Teile korrekt importiert und definiert sind: ```javascript import { createApp } from \'vue\'; import App from \'./App.vue\'; // Nehmen wir an, eventBus ist wie oben definiert const eventBus = ...; const app = createApp(App); // Bereitstellung des getService app.provide(\'getService\', (serviceName) =>{ const services = { eventBus: eventBus, }; return services[serviceName]; }); app.mount(\'#app\'); ``` # 3. Verwenden von `inject` im Composition API Kontext Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Verwendung von `inject` innerhalb der `setup`-Funktion eines komponentenbasierten Ansatzes erfolgt: ```javascript import { inject } from \'vue\'; export default { setup() { const getService = inject(\'getService\'); const eventBus = getService(\'eventBus\'); // Verwendung von eventBus... return { // Daten, Methoden usw., die im Template verwendet werden }; } } ``` # 4. Prüfen des Rückgabewertes und Fehlerbehandlung Es kann hilfreich sein, innerhalb des `getService`-Aufrufs eine einfache Fehlerbehandlung hinzuzufügen, um Probleme schneller zu erkennen: ```javascript app.provide(\'getService\', (serviceName) => { const services = { eventBus: eventBus, }; const service = services[serviceName]; if (!service) { console.error(`Service {serviceName} nicht gefunden.`); } return service; }); ``` # 5. Fallback für `inject` Wie bereits in meiner vorherigen Antwort erwähnt, können Sie eine Fallback-Funktion für `inject` bereitstellen, um Fehler zu vermeiden, falls ein Dienst nicht verfügbar ist. Dies kann auch beim Debuggen hilfreich sein: ```javascript const getService = inject(\'getService\', () => { console.warn(\'getService wurde nicht bereitgestellt.\'); return (serviceName) => { console.warn(`Service {serviceName} nicht verfügbar.`); }; }); ``` Zusammenfassend, überprüfen Sie alle Schritte und sicherstellen, dass sowohl das Bereitstellen (`provide`) als auch das Injizieren (`inject`) korrekt im Vue-Kontext erfolgen."},{"prompt":"kann ich in meinem modul export function useTwitchChat() {} eine setup methode zur verfügung stellen?","completion":"In Vue 3, besonders wenn Sie das Composition API verwenden, ist es üblich, \\"Composables\\" zu erstellen – wiederverwendbare Funktionen, die die Logik kapseln. Diese Composables ermöglichen es Ihnen, Logik und Statusmanagement außerhalb von Komponenten zu bewahren und nahtlos in der `setup`-Funktion von Komponenten zu verwenden. Das ist genau das, was Sie mit `export function useTwitchChat()` erreichen möchten. Die `setup`-Funktion, von der Sie sprechen, ist jedoch ein spezifischer Bestandteil einer Vue-Komponente und wird direkt dort definiert, nicht innerhalb eines Composables. Was Sie in Ihrem `useTwitchChat` Composable machen können, ist, eine Logik zur Verfügung zu stellen, die dann in der `setup`-Funktion einer Komponente genutzt werden kann. Hier ist ein grundlegendes Beispiel, wie das Composable `useTwitchChat` aussehen könnte und wie man es in einer Komponente verwendet: # Das `useTwitchChat` Composable: ```javascript // useTwitchChat.js import { reactive, inject } from \'vue\'; export function useTwitchChat() { const getService = inject(\'getService\'); const state = reactive({ chat: null, isConnected: false, tokenAccess:\'\', username:\'\', channel:\'\' }); // Hier könnten wir Funktionen wie \\"connect\\" definieren const connect = async () => { // Zum Beispiel Zugriff auf `getService` und verwenden des `eventBus` const eventBus = getService(\'eventBus\'); // Implementieren Sie die Verbindung und die Logik state.isConnected = true; // Beispiel für ein Event eventBus.emit(\\"twitch-chat-connected\\", {}); }; return { state, connect }; } ``` # Verwendung in einer Vue-Komponente: ```vue <template> <div> <button v-if=\\"!state.isConnected\\" @click=\\"connect\\">Verbinden</button> <div v-if=\\"state.isConnected\\">Verbunden!</div> </div> </template> <script> import { useTwitchChat } from \'./useTwitchChat\'; export default { setup() { const { state, connect } = useTwitchChat(); return { state, connect }; } } <\/script> ``` In diesem Beispiel bietet das `useTwitchChat` Composable einen Zustand (`state`) und eine Funktion (`connect`), um beispielsweise eine Verbindung zu einem Twitch-Chat herzustellen. Diese werden dann in der `setup`-Funktion einer Komponente eingebunden und im Template genutzt. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass Composables normalerweise unabhängig von spezifischen Implementierungen sind. Sie könnten daher die `getService` Initialisierung und Nutzung direkt in Ihrer Komponente behandeln, falls dies die Wiederverwendbarkeit des Composables erhöht. Ebenso könnte in einem Composable jederzeit auf vom Kontext (`context`) oder von `props` abhängige Funktionalitäten zugegriffen werden, indem diese Parameter an das Composable übergeben werden."},{"prompt":"ok, ich habe eine funktion const connect = async () => { const getService = inject(\'getService\'); const config = getService(\'config\'); const temp = getService(\'temp\'); const eventBus = getService(\'eventBus\'); } in der export function useTwitchChat() erstellt.

Innerhalb von Setup-Kompositionsfunktionen arbeitet `inject` anders als in option-basierten API-Komponenten. Ein wichtiger Punkt ist, dass `inject` direkt in der `setup`-Funktion oder am Anfang Ihres Composables aufgerufen werden muss, nicht innerhalb von verschachtelten Funktionen wie Ihrer `connect`-Funktion. Der Grund dafür ist, dass `inject` auf den Komponenten-Instanzkontext zugreifen muss, der nur in der `setup`-Funktion oder an oberster Ebene im Composable verfügbar ist. Hier ist ein angepasster Ansatz, um den Fehler zu beheben: # Überarbeitete useTwitchChat Composable-Funktion: ```javascript import { inject, reactive } from \'vue\'; export function useTwitchChat() { // Rufen Sie `inject` am Anfang auf, außerhalb der `connect` Funktion const getService = inject(\'getService\'); // Sicherstellen, dass getService nicht `undefined` ist if (typeof getService !== \'function\') { console.error(\'getService ist nicht verfügbar. Stellen Sie sicher, dass es bereitgestellt wurde.\'); // Optional: Behandeln des Fehlers anstatt nur zu loggen return; } const state = reactive({ chat: null, isConnected: false, tokenAccess: \'\', username: \'\', channel: \'\' }); const connect = async () => { // Direkt verwenden, da `getService` außerhalb definiert wurde const config = getService(\'config\'); const temp = getService(\'temp\'); const eventBus = getService(\'eventBus\'); // Verbindungslogik fortschreiben... state.isConnected = true; // Beispielnutzung von eventBus // eventBus.emit(\\"some-event\\", { data: \\"test\\" }); }; return { state, connect }; } ``` In diesem überarbeiteten Beispiel wird `getService` direkt im oberen Bereich des Composables aufgerufen. Diese Methode sichert, dass der Kontext korrekt ist, wenn `inject` aufgerufen wird. Der Zugriff auf Dienste durch `getService` erfolgt später innerhalb der `connect`-Funktion, weil die Referenz zu `getService` bereits sicher etabliert wurde. Falls `getService` ein Fehler ausgibt oder `undefined` zurückkehrt, zeigt dies, dass der Dienst nicht korrekt bereitgestellt wurde. In solchen Fällen sollten Sie überprüfen: 1. **Bereitstellung im Wurzel- oder Elternelement:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass `getService` vor irgendwelchen Komponenten, die es verwenden möchten, mit `app.provide(\'getService\', ...)` bereitgestellt wurde. 2. **Reihenfolge der Skriptausrührung:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Bereitstellung von `getService` erfolgt, bevor die Komponente, die `useTwitchChat` verwendet, initialisiert oder gerendert wird. Indem Sie diese Praktiken befolgen, sollten Sie in der Lage sein, den `TypeError: getService is not a function`-Fehler effektiv zu beheben."},{"prompt":"wenn ich es so umsetze erhalte ich auch TypeError: getService is not a function","completion":"Wenn Sie immer noch auf den Fehler `TypeError: getService is not a function` stoßen, auch nachdem Sie den Aufruf von `inject` an den Anfang Ihres Composables verschoben haben, könnte das Problem tiefer liegen. Hier sind einige zusätzliche Schritte, die Sie überprüfen sollten: 1. **Überprüfen der `provide`-Funktion:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass die `provide`-Funktionalität korrekt in einem übergeordneten Element oder in der Hauptinstanz Ihrer Vue-App definiert wurde. Die `provide`- und `inject`-Funktionalität in Vue erlaubt es Ihnen, Abhängigkeiten von einem übergeordneten Komponentenbaum zu einem Kind zu „injizieren“, ohne dass die Props von jedem einzelnen zu übergeben sind. Wenn `provide` nicht korrekt festgelegt wurde, kann `inject` die benötigten Dienste nicht finden. **Vue App Root Beispiel:** ```javascript import { createApp } from \'vue\'; import App from \'./App.vue\'; const app = createApp(App); // Stellen wir uns vor, \'eventBus\' ist korrekt initialisiert. const eventBus = { emit: (event, payload) => { /* ... */ }, on: (event, handler) => { /* ... */ } }; // Bereitstellung einer Funktion durch `provide` app.provide(\'getService\', serviceName => { const services = { eventBus, // andere Dienste... }; return services[serviceName]; }); app.mount(\'#app\'); ``` 2. **Überprüfen der Verfügbarkeit von `inject` zum Zeitpunkt des Aufrufs:** `inject` funktioniert prinzipiell innerhalb der `setup`-Funktion einer Komponente und sollte dort funktionieren. Wenn Sie `inject` außerhalb der `setup`-Funktion oder in einem Bereich verwenden, der nicht direkt auf den Vue-Instanzkontext zugreifen kann, könnte dies zu Problemen führen. 3. **Fallback-Wert für `inject` verwenden:** Als Diagnosewerkzeug können Sie einen Fallback-Wert für `inject` angeben, um zu sehen, ob das Problem immer noch besteht. Wenn Ihr kodierter Fallback-Wert zurückkommt, heißt das, dass Vue den von Ihnen bereitgestellten Dienst nicht finden kann. ```javascript const getService = inject(\'getService\', () => { console.warn(\'getService nicht gefunden.\'); return () => { console.warn(\'Kein Dienst verfügbar.\'); }; }); ``` 4. **Nachprüfen der App-Struktur:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Komponente, die `useTwitchChat` nutzt, tatsächlich innerhalb des Baums der durch `createApp(App)` initialisierten Vue-Anwendung liegt. Manchmal kann es zu Verwirrungen kommen, wenn mehrere Vue-Anwendungen oder Instanzen involviert sind. Sollten diese Schritte das Problem nicht lösen, könnte es hilfreich sein, den gesamten Stack-Trace des Fehlers und mehr Kontext über die Struktur Ihrer Anwendung zu überprüfen. Es gibt Szenarien, in denen ein Tippfehler oder ein simpler Konfigurationsfehler schwer zu entdecken sind. Zuletzt, wenn es sich um ein sehr ungewöhnliches Verhalten handelt, vergewissern Sie sich, dass Sie die neueste Version von Vue 3 verwenden. In seltenen Fällen könnten Bugs oder Inkompatibilitäten in bestimmten Versionen solche Symptome verursachen."},{"prompt":"const getService = inject(\'getService\'); in der export function useTwitchChat() {} ist undefined. wie kann dass passieren?","completion":"Wenn `inject(\'getService\')` innerhalb Ihres `useTwitchChat` Composables `undefined` zurückgibt, deutet dies darauf hin, dass Vue das bereitgestellte Objekt oder die Funktion mit dem Schlüssel \'getService\' nicht finden kann. Dies kann verschiedene Ursachen haben, die von der Struktur Ihrer Vue-Anwendung abhängen. Hier sind einige potenzielle Gründe und Vorschläge zur Fehlerbehebung: # 1. Überprüfung des Bereitstellungsortes Das `provide`/`inject`-Paar in Vue dient dazu, Daten von einem übergeordneten Komponentenbaum an untergeordnete Komponenten weiterzugeben, ohne sie als `props` durchgeben zu müssen. Damit `inject` erfolgreich ist, muss sicher gestellt sein, dass: - `provide` korrekt aufgerufen wurde, bevor `inject` aufgerufen wird. - `provide` in einem übergeordneten oder der Wurzel(Komponenten)Instanz Ihrer Anwendung definiert ist. Falls Sie versuchen, `getService` in einer Komponente oder einem Composable zu `inject`en, das auf der gleichen oder einer tieferen Ebene liegt als die Komponente/das Composable, die/ das `provide` aufruft, wird `undefined` zurückgegeben, da `inject` den bereitgestellten Wert nicht finden kann. # 2. Aufruf von `provide` in der Hauptinstanz Stellen Sie sicher, dass `provide` in der Hauptinstanz (der Eintrittspunkt der Anwendung, in der Regel `main.js` oder `app.js`) oder in einem übergeordneten Element relativ zu dem Teil der Anwendung aufgerufen wird, der `inject` verwendet. Dabei sollte der Code so aussehen: ```javascript import { createApp } from \'vue\'; import App from \'./App.vue\'; const app = createApp(App); app.provide(\'getService\', serviceName => { // Implementierung... }); app.mount(\'#app\'); ``` # 3. Zurückgeben eines Default-Werts Um zu überprüfen, ob `inject` richtig funktioniert, können Sie versuchen, einen Default-Wert bereitzustellen: ```javascript const getService = inject(\'getService\', () => { console.warn(\'getService ist nicht verfügbar.\'); }); ``` Wenn diese Warnung erscheint, wissen Sie, dass `provide` entweder nicht aufgerufen wurde oder `provide` und `inject` nicht im selben Baum liegen. # 4. Verwendung der Composition API Stellen Sie sicher, dass `inject` innerhalb der `setup`-Funktion einer Komponente oder direkt in der obersten Ebene eines Composables aufgerufen wird, um Zugriff auf den korrekten Kontext zu gewährleisten. `inject` kann nicht in reaktiven Funktionen oder in den Callbacks von Lifecycle-Hooks verwendet werden (außer `setup`). # 5. Vue-Version überprüfen Überprüfen Sie, ob Sie eine kompatible Vue-Version verwenden. Das `provide`/`inject` API ist in Vue 2.2.0+ und Vue 3 verfügbar, aber das Verhalten oder die genaue Syntax könnte sich leicht unterscheiden. Stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihre Anwendung auf der richtigen Version basiert und dass Sie nach der für Ihre Version spezifischen Dokumentation vorgehen. Wenn all diese Prüfschritte nicht helfen, könnte ein Beispielcode von der Struktur Ihrer `provide`/`inject`-Logik und von der Struktur Ihrer Vue-Anwendung mehr Aufschluss geben und helfen, das Problem genauer zu identifizieren."},{"prompt":"Der Aufbau in der Main.js ist wie folgt: import { createApp } from \'vue\'; import App from \'./App.vue\'; import mitt from \'mitt\'; const app = createApp(App); const eventBus = mitt(); app.provide(\'getService\', (serviceName)=>{ const services = { eventBus: eventBus, }; return services[serviceName]; }); import { useTwitchChat } from \'./modules/useTwitchChat\'; const chat = useTwitchChat();","completion":"Basierend auf der bereitgestellten Struktur Ihrer `main.js` und dem Aufruf von `useTwitchChat()` direkt dort, gibt es einen wichtigen Aspekt zu berücksichtigen. Die `inject`-Funktion von Vue\'s Composition API ist darauf ausgelegt, innerhalb des Kontextes einer Komponente oder speziell innerhalb der `setup`-Funktion dieser Komponente verwendet zu werden. Das bedeutet, dass `inject` erwartet, innerhalb des reaktiven Kontextes einer Komponente aufgerufen zu werden, um entsprechend darauf zugreifen zu können. In Ihrem Fall versuchen Sie, `useTwitchChat()` direkt in `main.js` aufzurufen, bevor irgendeine Komponente (einschließlich der Wurzelkomponente `App.vue`) gemountet oder sogar vollständig initialisiert wurde. Das bedeutet, dass es keinen aktiven Kontext gibt, in dem `inject` nach `getService` suchen könnte, wodurch `getService` als `undefined` ausgewertet wird. # Lösungsvorschlag Um das beschriebene Problem zu lösen, müssen Sie Ihren Zugang zum `useTwitchChat()` Composable so anpassen, dass er innerhalb des reaktiven Kontextes einer Vue-Komponente aufgerufen wird, typischerweise innerhalb der `setup`-Funktion einer Komponente. So können Sie sicherstellen, dass `inject` korrekt auf `provide`-Werte zugreifen kann. In `App.vue` oder einer anderen Komponente: ```vue <template> <!-- Ihre Komponentenvorlage hier --> </template> <script> import { onMounted } from \'vue\'; import { useTwitchChat } from \'./modules/useTwitchChat\'; export default { setup() { // Rufen Sie useTwitchChat innerhalb des Setup oder in einem Lifecycle Hook wie onMounted auf onMounted(() => { const chat = useTwitchChat(); // Führen Sie Logik für den Chat hier oder in useTwitchChat direkt aus }); return {}; }, } <\/script> ``` # Bessere Praxis Es ist besser, Composables wie `useTwitchChat` innerhalb des Kontextes von Komponenten zu verwenden, wo sie Zugriff auf das vollständige reaktive System und den Dependency-Injection-Mechanismus von Vue haben. Diese Vorgehensweise sorgt auch für eine klarere Trennung von Verantwortlichkeiten und fördert die Wiederverwendbarkeit und Testbarkeit Ihrer Code-Bausteine. # Zusätzlicher Hinweis Wenn Ihr Composable (`useTwitchChat`) globalen Zustand oder Dienste betrifft, die in verschiedenen Teilen Ihrer Anwendung verfügbar sein müssen, könnten Sie auch Vue\'s Pinia oder Vuex als zentralen Zustandsspeicher in Betracht ziehen. Diese bieten Mechanismen zur Zustandsverwaltung, sind aber so konzipiert, dass sie von überall in Ihrer Anwendung sicher verwendet werden können, ohne sich um den Kontext der Komponenten-Lifecycle zu sorgen."},{"prompt":"wo kann ich als händler edelstahl schrauben beziehen?","completion":"Als Händler können Sie Edelstahlschrauben von einer Reihe von Lieferanten und Distributoren beziehen, je nachdem, wo Sie sich befinden und was Ihre spezifischen Bedürfnisse sind.

Eine häufige Methode ist die Verwendung des Composition API mit reaktiven Zuständen und der `provide`/`inject`-Funktion direkt in der Komponentenhierarchie. Hier ist ein grundlegendes Beispiel, wie Sie einen Zustand oder ein Objekt in `App.vue` bereitstellen und dann in einer beliebigen Komponente injizieren können, ohne `app.provide` zu verwenden: # Schritt 1: Erstellen des anbietenden Komponenten-Zustands (z.B. in `App.vue`) In Ihrer Haupt-App-Komponente (`App.vue`) können Sie den Zustand definieren, den Sie teilen möchten, und diesen mit `provide` anbieten. ```vue <template> <div> <!-- Ihre App-Komponenten hier, welche den Zustand nutzen sollen --> <MyComponent /> </div> </template> <script> import { provide, reactive } from \'vue\'; import MyComponent from \'./components/MyComponent.vue\'; export default { name: \'App\', components: { MyComponent, }, setup() { const sharedState = reactive({ message: \'Shared message from App.vue\', }); // Der erste Parameter ist der Injektionsschlüssel, der zweite der Zustand provide(\'sharedState\', sharedState); return {}; }, }; <\/script> ``` # Schritt 2: Injizieren des Zustands in einer untergeordneten Komponente In einer beliebigen Komponente, die ein Nachkomme von `App.vue` ist, können Sie auf den bereitgestellten Zustand mit `inject` zugreifen. ```vue <template> <div> {{ sharedState.message }} </div> </template> <script> import { inject } from \'vue\'; export default { name: \'MyComponent\', setup() { // Verwendung des gleichen Schlüssels, um den Zustand zu injizieren const sharedState = inject(\'sharedState\'); return { sharedState }; }, }; <\/script> ``` Mit dieser Methode können Sie den `provide`- und `inject`-Mechanismus innerhalb der Komponentenstruktur von Vue verwenden, ohne auf die globale `app.provide`-Methode zugreifen zu müssen. Dies ermöglicht es Ihnen, effektiv Zustände oder Objekte über die Komponentenhierarchie hinweg zu teilen, was besonders nützlich ist, um globalen Zustand oder Dienste in einer Vue 3-Anwendung bereitzustellen."},{"prompt":"Schreibe das folgende als VUE3 Modul um class Queue { constructor() { this.items = []; this.queueRunning = false; this.playQueued = this.playQueued.bind(this); this.playQueuedEnded = this.playQueuedEnded.bind(this); } isEmpty() { return this.items.length === 0; } addToQueue(item) { item.fromQueue=true; item.step = 3; this.items.push(item); console.log(\'adding item to queue: \' + this.items.length, \\"queueRunning: \\" + this.queueRunning, this.items); if (!this.queueRunning) { console.log(\'added To Queue, start play cause queue is running \', \\"queueRunning: \\" + this.queueRunning); this.playQueued(); } } playQueued() { this.queueRunning = true; console.log(\'playQueued, queue length is: \', this.items.length); // fifo var item = this.items.shift(); item.step = 4; console.log(\\"playQueued trigger eventBus\\", item.type, item); this.eventBus.emit( item.type, item ); } playQueuedEnded(event){ event.target.removeEventListener(\'ended\', this.playQueuedEnded, true); if (this.isEmpty()) { this.queueRunning = false; console.log( \'playQueuedEnded no more entries in queue: \' + this.items.length, this.queueRunning, ); } else { console.log( \'playQueuedEnded item ended, remaining items: \' + this.items.length, this.queueRunning, ); console.log(\'setting timer for next run: \', this.config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance); var queueTimeDistanceTimeout = window.setTimeout( this.playQueued, this.config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance ); } } } export default new Queue();","completion":"Um die gegebene `Queue`-Klasse in ein Vue 3-Modul bzw. Composable umzuschreiben, gehen wir ähnlich vor wie bei der Verwendung von klassenbasierten Komponenten, jedoch mit der Nutzung des Composition APIs von Vue 3. Ein wichtiger Punkt dabei ist, dass ein Vue 3 Composable den Kontext, wie z.B. die Ereignisbus-Instanz (`eventBus`) und die Konfiguration (`config`), anders handhaben muss als in einer Vue-Instanzmethode oder einem Mixin. Da Composables keinen direkten Zugriff auf die Vue-Instanz oder `this` haben, müssen Abhängigkeiten wie der Eventbus und Konfigurationseinstellungen anders bereitgestellt werden. Eine Möglichkeit ist, sie als Parameter oder über `provide`/`inject`-Mechanismen zugänglich zu machen. Hier ist ein Ansatz zur Umstrukturierung der `Queue`-Klasse als Vue 3 Composable: ```javascript // useQueue.js import { reactive, toRefs } from \'vue\'; export default function useQueue(eventBus, config) { const state = reactive({ items: [], queueRunning: false, }); const isEmpty = () => { return state.items.length === 0; }; const addToQueue = (item) => { item.fromQueue = true; item.step = 3; state.items.push(item); console.log(\'adding item to queue: \' + state.items.length, \\"queueRunning: \\" + state.queueRunning, state.items); if (!state.queueRunning) { console.log(\'added To Queue, start play cause queue is running \', \\"queueRunning: \\" + state.queueRunning); playQueued(); } }; const playQueued = () => { state.queueRunning = true; console.log(\'playQueued, queue length is: \', state.items.length); // fifo var item = state.items.shift(); item.step = 4; console.log(\\"playQueued trigger eventBus\\", item.type, item); eventBus.emit(item.type, item); }; const playQueuedEnded = (event) => { event.target.removeEventListener(\'ended\', playQueuedEnded, true); if (isEmpty()) { state.queueRunning = false; console.log( \'playQueuedEnded no more entries in queue: \' + state.items.length, state.queueRunning, ); } else { console.log( \'playQueuedEnded item ended, remaining items: \' + state.items.length, state.queueRunning, ); console.log(\'setting timer for next run: \', config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance); var queueTimeDistanceTimeout = window.setTimeout( playQueued, config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance ); } }; return { ...toRefs(state), addToQueue, playQueued, playQueuedEnded }; } ``` In Ihrer Vue-App müssten Sie dann das Composable `useQueue` zusammen mit dem Eventbus und Konfigurationsobjekt verwenden. Wenn Sie nicht bereits über eine zentrale Methode zur Bereitstellung dieser Abhängigkeiten (wie durch ein Root-`provide` oder einen globalen Zustandsmanager) verfügen, müssten Sie diese beim Aufruf von `useQueue` übergeben. ```javascript import useQueue from \'./useQueue\'; import eventBus from \'./eventBus\'; // Ihr zentralisierte Ereignisbus-Instanz import config from \'./config\'; // Ihre App-Konfiguration export default { setup() { const { addToQueue, playQueued, playQueuedEnded } = useQueue(eventBus, config); // ... nutzen Sie addToQueue, playQueued, playQueuedEnded hier } } ``` Dieser Ansatz transformiert die Klasse in ein Composition API-“Composable“, was es einfacher macht, sie innerhalb der Setup-Funktion jeder Komponente in einer Vue 3-App zu verwenden. Denken Sie daran, dass Sie für den `eventBus` und `config` einen konkreten Mechanismus zur Verfügung stellen müssen, um diese Instanzen zu erhalten, falls diese nicht schon global verfügbar gemacht wurden."},{"prompt":"Schreibe das folgende um als Vue3 Module class Queue { constructor() { this.items = []; this.queueRunning = false; this.playQueued = this.playQueued.bind(this); this.playQueuedEnded = this.playQueuedEnded.bind(this); } isEmpty() { return this.items.length === 0; } addToQueue(item) { item.fromQueue=true; item.step = 3; this.items.push(item); console.log(\'adding item to queue: \' + this.items.length, \\"queueRunning: \\" + this.queueRunning, this.items); if (!this.queueRunning) { console.log(\'added To Queue, start play cause queue is running \', \\"queueRunning: \\" + this.queueRunning); this.playQueued(); } } playQueued() { this.queueRunning = true; console.log(\'playQueued, queue length is: \', this.items.length); // fifo var item = this.items.shift(); item.step = 4; console.log(\\"playQueued trigger eventBus\\", item.type, item); this.eventBus.emit( item.type, item ); } playQueuedEnded(event){ event.target.removeEventListener(\'ended\', this.playQueuedEnded, true); if (this.isEmpty()) { this.queueRunning = false; console.log( \'playQueuedEnded no more entries in queue: \' + this.items.length, this.queueRunning, ); } else { console.log( \'playQueuedEnded item ended, remaining items: \' + this.items.length, this.queueRunning, ); console.log(\'setting timer for next run: \', this.config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance); var queueTimeDistanceTimeout = window.setTimeout( this.playQueued, this.config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance ); } } } export default new Queue();","completion":"Um das gegebene Klassendesign in ein Vue 3 Modul zu übertragen, das selbstverwaltet und reaktiv ist, könnten wir die Composition API von Vue 3 nutzen. Wir würden `ref` für reaktive Daten wie `items` und `queueRunning` verwenden und Funktionen als setup-Funktionen deklarieren. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu beachten, dass das Konzept von `eventBus` in Vue 3 nicht direkt unterstützt wird, da die EventBus-Funktionalität entfernt wurde. Stattdessen könnten wir entweder ein externes Zustandsverwaltungssystem wie Vuex oder die Provide/Inject API für die Kommunikation über Komponenten verwenden. Hier ist ein grober Entwurf, wie die Klasse `Queue` als Vue 3 Composition API Modul refaktorisiert werden könnte. Für den EventBus-Teil werde ich einen einfachen Platzhalter verwenden, den du durch eine tatsächliche Implementierung ersetzen solltest (z.B. durch Verwendung eines globalen Store oder custom events): ```javascript import { ref } from \'vue\'; // Platzhalter-EventBus-Funktionen. Ersetze diese durch deine Event-Kommunikation function emitEvent(eventType, payload) { console.log(`Event emitted: {eventType}`, payload); // Implementiere deine Logik hier, z.B. über einen global store oder custom events } export function useQueue() { const items = ref([]); const queueRunning = ref(false); // Methoden function isEmpty() { return items.value.length === 0; } function addToQueue(item) { item.fromQueue = true; item.step = 3; items.value.push(item); console.log(\'adding item to queue: \' + items.value.length, \\"queueRunning: \\" + queueRunning.value, items.value); if (!queueRunning.value) { console.log(\'added To Queue, start play cause queue is running \', \\"queueRunning: \\" + queueRunning.value); playQueued(); } } function playQueued() { queueRunning.value = true; console.log(\'playQueued, queue length is: \', items.value.length); const item = items.value.shift(); item.step = 4; console.log(\\"playQueued trigger event\\", item.type, item); emitEvent(item.type, item); // Geändert von eventBus.emit } function playQueuedEnded(event) { event.target.removeEventListener(\'ended\', playQueuedEnded, true); if (isEmpty()) { queueRunning.value = false; console.log( \'playQueuedEnded no more entries in queue: \' + items.value.length, queueRunning.value, ); } else { console.log( \'playQueuedEnded item ended, remaining items: \' + items.value.length, queueRunning.value, ); console.log(\'setting timer for next run: \', 5000); // Ersetzt this.config.settings.alerts.queueTimeDistance mit einem statischen Wert oder von einer Konfigurationsquelle window.setTimeout(playQueued, 5000); // Geändert zu einem statischen Wert oder von einer Konfigurationsquelle } } return { addToQueue, playQueued, playQueuedEnded, queueRunning, items }; } ``` In diesem Beispiel würdest du die `useQueue` Funktion innerhalb einer Vue-Komponente aufrufen, um deren Methoden und reaktive Eigenschaften zu verwenden.

Учитывается, что `ref`, `unref` и `emit` используются должным образом в соответствии с Vue 3 Composition API. Также предполагается, что вы поместите этот код внутри `setup()` функции компонента для правильного использования Composition API. Так как `this.refs` не используется в Composition API напрямую, необходимо будет применить другой подход для доступа к рефам, например, используя `ref` или `reactive` для их хранения. ```javascript import { ref, unref, watchEffect } from \'vue\'; export default { setup(props, { emit }) { const count = ref(0); // Пример инициализации count, значение должно прийти из ваших пропсов/другой логики const groups = ref({}); // Создаем рефы для каждой группы; это пример, возможно, потребуется адаптация под вашу логику const groupRefs = ref([]); // Эмуляция создания рефов для групп for (let i = 1; i <= unref(count); i++) { groupRefs.value[i] = ref(null); // Присвоение DOM элемента будет в вашем шаблоне через ref=\\"groupRefs[i]\\" } const next = () => { const newGroups = {}; for (let i = 1; i <= unref(count); i++) { // Предполагается, что groupRefs у вас будет содержать реальные рефы к вашим группам // и что generateGroup() - это метод ваших компонентов группы. if (groupRefs.value[i]?.value) { const group = groupRefs.value[i].value.generateGroup(); Object.assign(newGroups, group); } } groups.value = newGroups; emit(\'next-step\', newGroups); }; watchEffect(() => { // Пример как можно отслеживать изменение count и выполнять действия // Это просто для демонстрации, возможно, в вашем конкретном случае это не понадобится console.log(`Count changed to: {count.value}`); }); return { groups, next }; } } ``` Важно отметить, что доступ к рефам элементов осуществляется по-другому в Composition API по сравнению с Options API. Теперь вы должны использовать `ref` для создания ссылки на элементы DOM и компоненты, и вы не можете просто обращаться к ним через `this.refs`. В примере выше использование `groupRefs` показывает, как можно организовать доступ к рефам компонентов внутри `setup`. Также следует помнить, что теперь нет необходимости использовать `this.` для доступа к свойствам и методам компонента внутри `setup`. Вместо этого, вы работаете напрямую с переменными и функциями, возвращаемыми из `setup`."},{"prompt":"я знаю сколько всего лотов у меня в сделках как узнать какой это процент от депозита на mql5","completion":"Чтобы рассчитать, какой процент от вашего депозита составляют лоты ваших сделок на MQL5, вам необходимо узнать общий размер лотов в ваших открытых сделках, а затем вычислить, какую часть от вашего депозита они составляют. Вот шаги, которые помогут вам это сделать: 1. **Определение размера лотов:** Сначала важно точно определить общее количество лотов в ваших сделках. Допустим, у вас есть три сделки, с лотами 0.1, 0.2 и 0.5 соответственно. Это означает, что общее количество лотов составит 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.5 = 0.8 лота. 2. **Вычисление стоимости лотов:** Чтобы вычислить общую стоимость этих лотов, вам необходимо знать стоимость одного лота. Стоимость лота часто зависит от типа торгуемого инструмента, но для примера, допустим стоимость 1 лота составляет 10,000. Следовательно, общая стоимость ваших лотов будет 0.8 * 10,000 = 8,000. 3. **Расчет процента от депозита:** Далее, нужно знать размер вашего депозита. Допустим, ваш депозит составляет 20,000. Чтобы выяснить, какой процент от вашего депозита составляют лоты, используйте следующую формулу: [ text{Процент от депозита} = left( frac{text{Общая стоимость лотов}}{text{Размер депозита}} right) times 100 ] [ text{Процент от депозита} = left( frac{8000}{20000} right) times 100 = 40% ] Таким образом, 0.8 лота из ваших сделок составляют 40% от вашего депозита. Обратите внимание, что для точного расчета вам необходимо знать реальные значения, такие как стоимость одного лота для конкретного инструмента, которым вы торгуете, а также точный размер вашего депозита.

Ему предстоит преодолеть длинный и опасный путь домой пешком через неспокойные улицы города. В песне прозвучат мысли о свободе, одиночестве и неприятии общественных норм. 2. **\\"Забытые ботинки\\"**: История о человеке, который идет против системы и стандартов, навязанных обществом. Он ходит в старых, изношенных ботинках, которые для него являются символом его борьбы и несгибаемости духа. Эта песня – гимн тем, кто не боится выглядеть не так, как все, и идет своим путем, независимо от мнений окружающих. 3. **\\"Глас асфальта\\"**: Энергичная песня о городской жизни, виденной глазами скейтбордиста, который каждый день прокладывает свой маршрут по асфальтовым джунглям. Он переживает свободу, скорость, встречи и столкновения с разношерстной публикой. Песня передает атмосферу молодежного бунта и жажды приключений на фоне городских закатов. 4. **\\"Не проданная песня\\"**: Ироничная и самокритичная песня о группе, которая пытается сохранить свою честность и идеалы в мире коммерциализированной музыки. Они отказываются идти на компромиссы с лейблами и продавать свою музыку, в итоге оказываясь на грани финансового краха, но сохраняя свой стиль и уважение своей аудитории. 5. **\\"В стране отчуждения\\"**: Песня о чувстве отчуждения и неприятия со стороны общества, которое испытывают многие молодые люди. Они чувствуют себя чужими в собственной стране, где царит бесправие, коррупция и недоверие к правительству. Молодежь объединяется в поиске своего места в жизни, где можно свободно выражать свои мысли и быть услышанным. 6. **\\"Эхо поколений\\"**: Это песня о поколенческой эстафете идей и ценностей от более старого поколения бунтарей к молодым. Сюжет охватывает истории разных поколений, которые связаны общим стремлением к переменам и желанием сделать мир лучше, несмотря на все препятствия и невзгоды."},{"prompt":"Ещё 5 сюжетов с вариантами припевов","completion":"# 7. **\\"Город, что не спит\\"** **Сюжет:** Композиция прослеживает ночные приключения группы друзей, которые проводят время, скитаясь по неспящему городу, ища свободу и отрыв от рутины. Эта ночь полна неожиданных встреч, свободы слова и выхода из зоны комфорта. **Припев:** \\"В городе, что не сомкнет веки, Мы нашли свои секреты, Где каждый уголок знаком – Там, где свобода, там – наш дом.\\" # 8. **\\"Следы на песке\\"** **Сюжет:** Песня о временности и изменчивости жизни, сравниваемой со следами на песке, которые смывает прибой. Она задумывается о значении каждого шага, который мы делаем, и о вечном стремлении оставить после себя что-то значимое, несмотря на все стихии мира. **Припев:** \\"Следы на песке, что смоет волна, Но каждый из нас хочет стать иной – Оставить свой знак, ведь каждая долга, Противиться вечному забвенью строй.\\" # 9. **\\"Крик на лице ветра\\"** **Сюжет:** Очень энергичная песня, посвященная активистам и всем, кто борется за изменения в обществе, несмотря на противодействие и репрессии. Они словно кричат против ветра, но их голоса соединяются в единый крик, который способен изменить мир. **Припев:** \\"Мы кричим на лицо ветра, Голоса летят в ночь, Мы – эхо изменений эры, Свет в туннеле подожжём.\\" # 10. **\\"Асфальтовые цветы\\"** **Сюжет:** Ещё одна песня о городской жизни, но с акцентом на нахождение красоты в самых неожиданных местах, таких как цветы, пробивающиеся сквозь асфальт. Это метафора решимости и надежды в условиях городской среды, где кажется, что нет места натуральной красоте. **Припев:** \\"Мы – асфальтовые цветы, Сквозь темноту пробьемся светом. В мире, где жесткость – это моды, Мы – живой и яркий лепесток.\\" # 11. **\\"Эйфория мгновений\\"** **Сюжет:** Эта песня – ода тем небольшим мгновениям жизни, которые приносят неописуемую радость и чувство единения с миром. Она говорит о том, что важно уметь видеть и ценить эти моменты, не теряясь в повседневной суете. **Припев:** \\"В мгновениях – эйфория, летим, Сердца бьются в унисон этим миром.

Hoje, estamos reunidos aqui, em espírito e em verdade, para mergulhar profundamente em um dos tesouros da Palavra de Deus. Estaremos refletindo sobre o capítulo 23 do livro de Provérbios, absorvendo cada gota de sabedoria e instrução divina para nossas vidas. Convido a cada um de vocês a abrir o coração e permitir que a semente da Palavra frutifique em solo fértil. Este é um dia que o Senhor fez para nossa edificação e crescimento espiritual. Venham, embarquemos juntos nesta jornada. # Desenvolvimento: Parte 1: **Guardando o Coração** No começo do capítulo 23 de Provérbios, somos lembrados sobre a importância de guardarmos nosso coração, especialmente em situações onde as aparências podem nos enganar. O versículo 3 nos alerta: \\"Não cobices as suas iguarias, porque são manjares enganosos.\\" Irmãos, como é fácil cairmos na tentação de desejarmos o que parece bom aos olhos, mas que no fundo, pode nos afastar dos caminhos do Senhor. A verdadeira sabedoria consiste em discernir além das aparências e buscar alimentar nosso espírito com aquilo que verdadeiramente nos edifica. Parte 2: **A Sabedoria do Provimento** Avançando na leitura, encontramos uma exortação poderosa sobre a sabedoria do provimento. O verso 12 diz: \\"Aplica o teu coração à instrução e os teus ouvidos às palavras do conhecimento.\\" Nossa fonte inesgotável de conhecimento e sabedoria está no Senhor. Investir tempo na Palavra de Deus e na comunhão com Ele é provimento para a nossa alma, é garantia de uma vida pautada na verdadeira sabedoria que nos guia, protege e nos mantém no caminho certo. Parte 3: **Vivendo Além das Aparências** Por último, mas não menos importante, somos chamados a viver além das aparências. Este mundo nos bombardeia com inúmeras tentações e nos oferece constantemente um estilo de vida que se opõe aos princípios do Reino de Deus. O capítulo 23 nos ensina a ter discernimento e a entender que o valor verdadeiro da vida não está no que é visível aos olhos, mas naquilo que é eterno. \\"Pois não é sábio entregar-se ao vinho nem correr atrás da cerveja.\\" (verso 20). Este versículo simboliza a importância de não nos perdermos em desejos momentâneos que podem nos causar dano espiritual, emocional e físico. # Oração Empolgante e Devocional: Querido Pai Celestial, nós Te agradecemos por este momento de comunhão e reflexão na Tua Palavra. Que cada ensinamento do capítulo 23 de Provérbios se grave em nossos corações, alimentando nossa alma e nos conduzindo no caminho da retidão. Ajuda-nos a discernir as aparências enganosas deste mundo, a investir no verdadeiro conhecimento que vem de Ti e a viver uma vida que reflita Tua glória e Tua santidade. Fortalece-nos em nossa caminhada diária contigo e que possamos ser luz nesse mundo, mostrando o caminho que conduz a Ti. Em nome de Jesus, amém! # Conclusão e Chamada para Ação: Queridos irmãos e irmãs, chegamos ao fim de mais uma reflexão que, espero, tenha tocado profundamente seus corações.

Que a palavra de Deus possa alcançar muitos corações através de nós. Que o Senhor os abençoe ricamente, hoje e sempre.

В Гражданском кодексе РФ юридические факты получили свое закрепление, тем не менее, исследование и анализ юридических фактов, их природы, классификации и влияния на правоотношения требует углубленного изучения и понимания. Цель данной курсовой работы заключается в анализе понятия юридических фактов в гражданском праве, выявлении их видов, особенностей, а также изучении их роли и значения в правовом регулировании. Для достижения поставленных целей необходимо решить следующие задачи: 1. Исследовать теоретические аспекты юридических фактов как юридической категории, их место и роль в системе гражданского права. 2. Проанализировать нормативное регулирование юридических фактов в нормах российского гражданского законодательства. 3. Классифицировать юридические факты на основе различных критериев и обосновать необходимость их разделения на виды. 4. Изучить юридические последствия наступления различных видов юридических фактов. 5. Определить особенности применения отдельных видов юридических фактов на практике осуществления гражданских правоотношений. Таким образом, объектом исследования выступают юридические факты в системе гражданского права, а предметом – нормативное регулирование и практическое применение юридических фактов, их классификация и влияние на возникновение, изменение и прекращение гражданских правоотношений. Исследование базируется на эксплуатации нормативных актов, комментариях к Гражданскому кодексу РФ, научных работах и статьях в области гражданского права, а также судебной практике, отражающей применение норм о юридических фактах. Методологическую основу работы составляют общенаучные и специальные методы познания: анализ, синтез, обобщение, системный подход, метод компаративистики и другие. Ожидается, что результаты проведенного исследования позволят глубже понять природу и роль юридических фактов в гражданском праве, а также способствовать более эффективному решению возникающих на практике вопросов, связанных с их применением. --- Этот пример вводной части к курсовой работе можно адаптировать под конкретные требования и задачи вашего исследования."},{"prompt":"Please summarise this link https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:884c472a-7c38-4fee-b568-49beaae565ff","completion":"The link leads to a webpage discussing Adobe Acrobat in detail, including its features and benefits.

Could you please provide the details or text of the PDF document you would like me to summarize?"},{"prompt":"Hi! can you create a simple linux terminal gtts-cli \\"hello\\" python scripts using british male english","completion":"Certainly! To create a Python script that uses `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) with a CLI (Command-Line Interface) for saying \\"hello\\" in British Male English, you will need the `gTTS` library. However, please note that as of my last update, `gTTS` does not allow you to directly specify the gender of the voice, but you can specify the language/locale. For British English, the locale can be `en-uk` or similar, but the actual voice\'s gender may not be guaranteed as it\'s dependent on what Google Text-to-Speech provides. First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, you will need to install the `gTTS` library if you haven\'t done so. You can do that by running the following command in your terminal: ```bash pip install gtts ``` Once `gTTS` is installed, you can create your Python script. Let\'s name it `speak_hello.py`. Open a text editor and write the following code: ```python from gtts import gTTS import os def speak_hello(): # Text to be spoken text = \\"Hello\\" # Specify the language/locale. For British English, it\'s \'en-uk\' tts = gTTS(text=text, lang=\'en-uk\') # Save the audio file tts.save(\\"hello.mp3\\") # Play the audio file. How you do this can depend on your system. # For Linux, we\'ll use mpg321, but ensure it\'s installed. os.system(\\"mpg321 hello.mp3\\") if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": speak_hello() ``` This script initializes an instance of `gTTS` with the text \\"hello\\" and the British English locale, saves the speech output to an MP3 file named `hello.mp3`, and finally plays that MP3 file using the `mpg321` player, which you need to have installed on your Linux system. If you don\'t have `mpg321`, you can install it on most Debian-based systems with: ```bash sudo apt-get install mpg321 ``` After creating the script, make it executable by running: ```bash chmod +x speak_hello.py ``` You can then run the script with: ```bash ./speak_hello.py ``` This simple set-up should meet your requirements. Remember, you might need to adjust the audio player command (`mpg321 hello.mp3`) based on what\'s available or preferred on your system. Some alternatives include `aplay`, `ffplay`, and `vlc`."},{"prompt":"Hi! can you create a simple linux terminal gtts-cli “hello” python scripts using british male english voice","completion":"As of my last update, the Google Text-to-Speech API and by extension the `gTTS` library for Python, does not offer a direct option to select a voice\'s gender for any given language. When you specify a language (for example, British English via `lang=\'en-gb\'`), the API uses the default voice chosen by Google for that language, which often includes a mix of both male and female voices without the ability to select between them directly within the `gTTS` library. Given this limitation, I\'ll provide a Python script example that uses `gTTS` to generate and play a \\"hello\\" message in British English. Although it won\'t specify the voice to be male due to the mentioned constraints, here\'s how you can accomplish the task with `gTTS`: 1. **Ensure Python and pip are installed**: You\'ll need Python and pip installed on your Linux system. You can check if you have them installed by running `python --version` and `pip --version` in your terminal. 2. **Install `gTTS` and a media player** (`mpg321` is a good choice for playing MP3 files from the command line in Linux): ```bash pip install gtts sudo apt-get install mpg321 ``` 3. **Writing the Python Script**: Below is a simple Python script named `say_hello.py` that uses `gTTS` to generate a speech file from the text \\"hello\\" in British English and plays it back: ```python from gtts import gTTS import os def say_hello(): # The text you want to convert to speech text_to_say = \\"Hello\\" # Choose the language, for British English you can use \'en-gb\' language = \'en-gb\' # Creating a gTTS object tts = gTTS(text=text_to_say, lang=language, slow=False) # Saving the audio file audio_file = \\"hello.mp3\\" tts.save(audio_file) # Playing the audio file using mpg321 os.system(f\\"mpg321 {audio_file}\\") if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": say_hello() ``` 4. **Making the Script Executable and Running It**: Make sure you make the script executable by running: ```bash chmod +x say_hello.py ``` Then, you can execute the script by using: ```bash ./say_hello.py ``` This script will generate a speech file saying \\"hello\\" in what Google determines as British English (typically `en-gb`), but, as previously noted, you won\'t have control over the voice\'s gender through this method. The gender of the voice may vary depending on Google\'s default settings for British English."},{"prompt":"Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Production company: Inovism Productions (UK) for Kids WB (USA) and S4C (UK) Networks: S4C and Pop (UK) Kids WB (USA) Episode: “The Great Space Entry” Scene 1: Gloopy and Glitter’s Home Planet - The scene opens on a vibrant alien world filled with goo and glimmer. - Gloopy, the laid-back teal blob with a charming smile, is listening to spaced-out tunes with headphones that wrap around his entire gelatinous body. - Glitter, a sparkling fuchsia blob that leaves a trail of glitter in her wake, is concocting a shimmery potion in their blobby lab.

Gloopy: “Whoa, Glitter! This place is like a cotton candy dream!” Glitter: “Look at the shimmering pink sands, Gloopy. It’s so… sparkly!” Scene 2: The Pink Encounter - While exploring, they meet a friendly pink alien named Blibby, who sports big curious eyes and a gentle smile. - Blibby is fascinated by Gloopy and Glitter’s shiny appearance and is eager to make new friends. Blibby: “Greetings! I am Blibby. This world is called Rosalux. I’ve never seen creatures like you before!” Glitter: “We’re the gleaming wanderers from Gloopiter! I’m Glitter, and this is Gloopy. Our ship had a bit of a hiccough.” Scene 3: The Curious Touch - Blibby is both awed and intrigued by Gloopy and Glitter’s shimmering skin. - With a polite request, Blibby reaches out to touch Gloopy, wondering if the shine is a solid shell. Blibby (with wonder in voice): “May I? Your glow is so intriguing!” Gloopy: “Sure thing, Blibby. But prepare for a slime surprise!” - When Blibby touches Gloopy, her hand comes away covered in teal goo, much to her amazement. Blibby: “Oh! It’s soft and squishy! And… it’s not sticky! What a marvelous sensation!” Scene 4: The Slime Session - Gloopy laughs and jiggles, while Glitter uses her sparkles to clean up the goo from Blibby’s hand, leaving a twinkle on her skin. - Overcoming the initial shock, Blibby is now brimming with excitement and requests a lesson in slime play from Gloopy and Glitter.

She gathers her potions and concocts a special mixture of her glitter and Gloopy’s goo. - Spreading the mixture onto the landscape, a remarkable transformation occurs. The dull terrain begins to sparkle, and the shadows start to dance with color. Glitter (with a heart full of glee): “A little bit of Gloopy, a little bit of Glitter, and voilà!” Scene 8: A World Reborn - The lifeless planet comes to life, bursting with colors as the shadows reflect the newfound light from every shimmering rock and sparkling crevice. - The shadows, now intertwined with the light, create an ethereal glow that stretches as far as the eye can see. Gloopy (in awe): “We didn’t just find a new world—we helped create one.” Glitter: “And we’ve made new friends who taught us the beauty that lies in the shadows.” Scene 9: Farewell and Forward - With the blob-mobile repaired and the memories of a once barren planet now teeming with prismatic hues, Gloopy and Glitter bid their new friends goodbye. - The shadows wave in their own fluid, graceful way as the duo blasts off, leaving behind a legacy of light in the darkness. Voiceover: “And with their hearts a little fuller, Gloopy and Glitter continue their odyssey amongst the stars, forever seeking to brighten the cosmos, one rejuvenated world at a time.” - The screen fades to black, with the echoes of Gloopy and Glitter’s laughter trailing off, the barren planet they left now aglow with vibrant shadows and radiant sparkles. Title: “Gloopy’s Shape Sensation” Scene 1: An Unexpected Audience - Our adventure begins with Gloopy and Glitter exploring the vast cosmos, powered by the warp drive they won from “The Great Space Entry” competition. Their blob-mobile navigates through the starry expanse, zipping past comets and asteroid belts. Glitter: “Gloopy, I’ve pinpointed an unexplored planet on the map. It’s known as Forma-5, famous for its inhabitants’ love for art and performance!” Gloopy: “Sounds like a place where I can stretch my… talents! Let’s check it out!” - They land on Forma-5 and are greeted by its geometrically shaped inhabitants, beings who can change colors but not their forms. Scene 2: Discovering Gloopy’s Talent - Gloopy and Glitter visit the central plaza, where locals are showcasing their art. Though their color transformations are beautiful, Gloopy quietly starts to play around, innocently morphing into various shapes—circles, stars, and even mimicking some of the local architecture. Child-Like Hexagon: “Look, mom! That stranger can change his shape!” - Soon, a small crowd gathers, marveling at Gloopy’s effortless transformations. Word quickly spreads about the incredible shapeshifting visitor. Scene 3: The Invitation - The mayor of Forma-5, a dignified dodecahedron named Dodecy, approaches Gloopy and Glitter with an offer. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your ability is a gift! We’ve never seen such talent. Would you honor us by performing at our Grand Plaza tonight? Your art could inspire our youth and bring joy to our citizens!” Glitter, beaming with pride: “What do you say, Gloopy?” Gloopy: “I’d be thrilled! Let’s make it a night to remember!” Scene 4: Preparing the Performance - Backstage, Glitter helps Gloopy prepare. She applies a bit of her glitter to make his transformations sparkle in the night. Glitter: “With each shape you make, let’s add a burst of sparkle to illuminate your art even further!” Gloopy: “This is going to be spectacular. I can’t wait to share our sparkle with everyone.” Scene 5: The Grand Performance - As night falls, Gloopy takes center stage under the stars. The plaza is filled with thousands of Forma-5’s inhabitants, eagerly waiting in anticipation. Announcer: “Presenting Gloopy, the Shapeshifting Sensation from the faraway world of Gloopiter!” - With each beat of the cosmic melody, Gloopy transforms. He becomes a star, a bird, an intricate flower blooming—all sparkling under Glitter’s magical touch. His performance tells a story of friendship, adventure, and the beauty of being unique. Scene 6: A Standing Ovation - The crowd is mesmerized. As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy’s shapes, combined with Glitter’s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms. Scene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell - As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they’re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy’s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art. Gloopy, touched: “I never knew my shapeshifting could bring so much happiness. What an unforgettable experience!” Glitter: “You’ve touched their hearts, Gloopy. Let’s keep spreading joy across the stars.” - They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one’s talents. Voiceover: “With Forma-5 in their wake, Gloopy and Glitter continue their cosmic journey, leaving a trail of inspiration and creativity. Wherever they go, they remind us that it’s our unique qualities that truly make us shine.” - The stars twinkle a little brighter as the screen fades to black, the shared laughter of Gloopy and Glitter echoing into the vastness of space. Title: \\"The Mysterious Infinite Mall\\" Scene 1: Glitter’s Mysterious Encounter - Gloopy and Glitter had decided to take a break from their intergalactic adventures and explore a bustling space mall for a change of scenery. As Gloopy headed to the bathroom, Glitter, with her sparkly trail in tow, ventured off on her own. - Lost in the maze-like corridors of the mall, Glitter marveled at the variety of shops and alien species bustling about. Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight – a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself. Alien: “Infinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‘infinite, forever, never ending’?” Alien (with a hiss): “Ah, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy’s Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion. Alien Child: “Help us, friendly blob! We can’t find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.” Gloopy: “Don’t worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let’s stick together and find a way out.” Scene 3: A Uniting Force - Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy’s malleable form and the children’s keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks. - Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter’s sparkling trail as a guiding light. - Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite. Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. \'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give \'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.\' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years.

There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right!

Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up.

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra!

Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn\'t confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn\'t World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn\'t premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu\'s Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are!

Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history.

User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait!

With CW4Kids transitioning full throttle into a new era, we bid farewell to the iconic shorts “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” These shorts have entertained countless viewers with their unique humor and quirky characters, becoming staples of Saturday morning routines. Yet, as we mourn their departure, we also welcome with open arms the new contenders set to fill the void: “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki.” “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” provided us with laughter, creativity, and endless entertainment. “Lamput,” with its minimalistic yet expressive animation, gave us a silent but hilariously dynamic orange blob constantly escaping the clutches of dimwitted scientists. “Planet Sketch” took us on a rollercoaster of comedy with its diverse cast of characters and unpredictable scenarios. Their contribution to the realm of animated shorts will not be forgotten, but in the entertainment industry, the show must go on. Enter “The Gees,” a fresh addition to the CW4Kids lineup that promises a cosmic comedy adventure unlike any other.

Their adventures are guaranteed to lead to laughter-inducing disasters, promising a delightful twist to our Saturday mornings.

This musical short brings the nostalgic tunes from the Pokémon universe to a new generation, possibly reigniting passions for the original series while delighting fans with catchy melodies and vibrant animations inspired by their favorite pocket monsters.

This educational and entertaining short provides insights into the characters of “GoGoRiki,” blending knowledge with humor in a format that is both engaging and enlightening. While we reminisce about the creativity and laughter brought to us by “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” the arrival of “The Gees,” “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” and “GoGoWiki” marks a refreshing beginning with endless possibilities. CW4Kids continues to demonstrate its commitment to delivering diverse, quality content that captivates the imaginations of its young audience. in the process, ensuring that the legacy of Saturday morning cartoons not only endures but evolves.

Also, here\'s the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids\' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Write a forum convo on December 24 where the schedule on January 6 is the same, but one user says \\"Don\'t be fooled, It\'s changing soon enough\\" and tells us a show to look out for","completion":"Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids January 6 Debut Schedule Revealed - No Changes?” User1: ToonTalker101 Posted on December 24, 2023, at 9:15 AM Just checked out the schedule for CW4Kids debut on January 6, and to my surprise, it\'s virtually the same as Kids\' WB\'s last one! Looks like they\'re easing into the transition without any immediate shake-ups. Everything from “Johnny Test” to “Code Lyoko” is in its usual slot. Thoughts on this soft launch approach? User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 24, 2023, at 9:40 AM Definitely not what I was expecting for the big rebrand. I thought we\'d see some of the changes kick in right away, maybe a couple of new shows or at least a shift in the schedule. Sticking to the original lineup feels...safe. But maybe it\'s a smart move, not to jolt the audience with too many changes all at once. User3: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on December 24, 2023, at 10:05 AM Don\'t let the unchanged schedule fool you; it\'s changing soon enough. The word around is that we should keep an eye out for “GoGoRiki.” From what I’ve gathered, it’s going to be a significant part of the new CW4Kids identity, bringing a fresh mix of humor and adventure to our Saturday mornings. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on December 24, 2023, at 10:30 AM Interesting, @SaturdaySkeptic. “GoGoRiki” sounds promising. I suppose a gradual transition does make sense, easing viewers into the new CW4Kids without causing too much uproar. Still, I\'m curious about when we\'ll start seeing the shake-up actually take place. Keeping the same lineup as the launch does feel like they\'re playing it cautiously. User5: DigitalToonDiver Posted on December 24, 2023, at 11:00 AM Yeah, @SaturdaySkeptic is on to something. Just because the January 6 lineup isn\'t changing doesn\'t mean it\'ll stay that way for long. “GoGoRiki” leading the charge into the new era is intriguing. CW4Kids is probably testing the waters on day one before diving into deeper changes. Let\'s keep an eye out for any hints in the upcoming promos! Moderator: CWKidsForumMod Posted on December 24, 2023, at 11:30 AM Appreciate the discussion, everyone! The transition to CW4Kids is indeed a step-by-step process designed to maintain continuity for our viewers while preparing for the introduction of new content. “GoGoRiki” and other upcoming shows represent the exciting direction we\'re heading towards. Stay tuned for announcements and thank you for your enthusiasm and support during this transition period.

Motivations and Goals: Before Slade…it was simple…anger and revenge against Tony Zucco…the ones who killed his parents…then it all changed with Slade’s involvement…and his trainings…his ethos…after all…why did the world’s greatest assassin take in the last of the Flying Graysons!?..he wants out…he never imagined being trained or ‘raised’ by the likes of Slade Wilson!..as he considers himself still as a ‘Grayson’…not as a ‘Wilson’…and its all so jarring for Dick…as he can’t believe his ‘foster dad’ is cruel and terrible like this!..why take him in!?..as Dick is thrust into a world entirely beyond Haly’s Circus…harsh world-views…ideologies…training…mentors…and all for what?..as his focus then goes onto the Court of Owls…to think THAT was the reason why Slade was there at the time?..Zucco…Court of Owls…Slade’s training…harsh world view…which all builds the foundations and desires to eventually NOT be like Slade…and become someone more…revenge and justice become intertwined for Dick…and the fact that Slade forcibly enhanced Dick…then Dick tried to remove it…which came with health effects and such…ending his days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’… 2b. Internal Conflict: It went from revenge against Zucco…to being trained by the world’s greatest assassin…and a feeling of desperation and hopelessness…he begins to like his new foster siblings…Rose…Joey…but Grant doesn’t like him…and he wonders…who is he really now?..no longer considered of his part of the Flying Graysons?..and was he meant to be a Talon by the Court of Owls if Slade wasn’t here?..what he was really?..and…and tries to balance of ‘fight fire with fire’ and the prospect if he can do ‘good’ at all…he ran away so many times…to try and survive…and at the end…wonders if he can at least…maybe…maybe?..put Slade’s training to good use…no matter how hard he hates it…and Dick insisting he’s still a ‘Grayson’…not a ‘Wilson’…and his eventual ‘reliance’ on tech…was a way for him to gain sense of control…desperately wanting to keep his past at Haly’s Circus but it feels tainted by Slade and the various deadly people and such… 3b. Relationships: Dick has mixed feelings with Wintergreen, as he is Slade’s confidant…but Wintergreen has his moments and care for him…Rose?..Dick feels guilty…because he was so rebellious and all wanting to get away from Slade…he wonders if maybe…could have done more…to help his sister more and such?..he cares for her…and she in turn has never had a ‘big brother’ like Dick before…unlike Grant…and Grant?..doesn’t like Dick at all…at best…its only begrudging respect…and still…Grant is the only loyal one of Slade’s kids…Adeline is mixed…Slade…its complicated…as Nightshade’s relationship with Rose and Joey…its mixed feelings. As for the heroes…he likes some of them…like Cardinal(Tim Drake)…because he’s ‘tech’…but has more resources through Wayne Enterprises…he likes Cassandra Cain(Black Bat) if only because…she’s different from the rest of the Bat-Family…Batman?..well…a mix of respect…and steely resolve if their paths clash…Nightshade will try to be ‘courteous’ about it at least…and in general…he won’t drive people away if and when…at least not intentionally…the heroes that is…its a professional relationship…Nightshade likes a few… 4b. Character Traits: He tried acting classes, and played roles for a missions once…then tried doing it for personal reasons…with mixed results…tried smoking…hated it…drinking?..he can surprisingly hold his liquor…hates anything with coconut in food…can actually cook unlike his main DC universe counterpart…jury-rigging tech…a way of independence from Slade’s influence surprisingly…mixes it with psychological warfare…fools people into thinking his tech is failing…when it either hasn’t…or wasn’t THAT much ‘tech’ in the first place…as he became somewhat tech-savvy after the surgery of removing his enhancements…or tried to…both of necessity and slowly just began to like it…including fashioning a sleek tactical-suit from various resources…and has a sleek, aerodynamic helmet or mask…functionality with aesthetics…modular gear…lightweight…utility belt…discreet compartments…the tech is just there to ‘boost’ the acrobatics even more…but found it a way to compensate for his lost enhancements…distract with the tech then disorient with the acrobatics and martial prowess…uses a variety of weapons and gear…depending on the mission…resourceful and improvises…ALL his TECH revolves around his acrobatics and ‘unpredictable predictably’ with a sense of strategy…even the use of GUNS… 5b. Backstory: It was pretty happy for the most part in Haly’s Circus…until of course…debt problems…some had to leave…some came back…it was a rollercoaster…harshness of reality…but he loved his parents, as his parents insisted firmly on Dick’s education…stuff OUTSIDE the circus…it may seem ‘nice’ now…but still…it won’t last forever…it was dynamics of acrobatics…training…and so on…and when Slade took in Dick to train and such after what happened…one particular experience?..was Slade teaching Dick self-defense, and urging Dick to use his acrobatics from the circus coupled with the stuff he was taught…which Dick was hesitantly fine with…after all…‘parents’ teaching martial arts for self-confidence…nothing new right?..and then…the trainings got even deeper and harsher… 6b. Code of Conduct: He’s willing to get his hands dirty, influenced by Slade’s teachings mixed with his own experiences and views that came with shades of grey. He wants to give people a chance…‘caring’ in a sense to be pragmatic of things…and takes no pleasure in the killing, but if he has to?..he WILL. Going further of course, the matter of collateral damage…he will try to mitigate that…aware that actions of consequences…and for better and worse…draws a fine line of neither the traditional hero…nor a villain…which in a sense, coupled with how he does things his way, gives him a sense of unfortunate ‘unpredictable predictability’…and chooses to build reputation, skills, and resources, HIS way…if nothing else…he figured…he can take what Slade molded him to be and ‘counter-mold’ it his way… 7b. Evolution: He goes from angry and wanting of justice to kill Zucco…to confused…shocked…baffled…on why someone like Slade took him in…to developing a more sense of ‘justice’ when he learns that this group called the ‘Court of Owls’ was secretly linked to Haly’s Circus…Old Man Haley and Bryan were in on it…its a mix of all these things…as he goes from desperate, angry, and spiteful man…to determined…bitter…but more…‘steadfast’…as he navigates the world…the tech was his way of making himself independent from Slade and his foster siblings is all…a sense of ‘control’… and some numbness…because sadly…him being taken by Slade…practically acted like a ‘beacon’ for various shady people…such as Shiva and others, who wondered…why did Slade take in the last of the Flying Graysons??..as Dick being exploited…‘abused’…as a ‘weapon’…a tool…influences his world view…feels like he’s being ‘poisoned’…and sure…he’s learned all these skills and training…deadly skilled…efficient…but so what?..sarcastic…bitter…but hides his anger better…a ‘performance’…but…he gets better…pragmatic…strategy…more patient… Way more details…B Mixed Feelings Towards Slade: 1. Slade’s cruelty is much more apparent…harsh Drill-Sergeant in raising Dick…some of Slade’s contacts wondering ‘Why the hell did you take interest in that kid?..’…who is the last of the Flying Graysons?..Slade is a harsh teacher…for example…when Dick was captured by that world’s H.I.V.E…Slade ended up rescuing him…not out of care for direct reasons…but seeing as how Dick got captured that way…Dick clearly needs more training…Slade doesn’t care…but cares enough in a way that as Wintergreen describes that Slade cares for his children, Dick most of all, but Slade is just too broken a human being to even express it… Personal anti-hero traits: 2. From his early experiences from the tail-end of the Gray Sparrow to the early days of Nightshade…he learns the ‘art’ of perception…cunning and manipulation…after all…he was essentially pushed into that gray…unfortunately…so he does his best…at first he was mad…bitter at it all…then at some point…he got the idea of don’t get just mad…get EVEN…as he knows people already see him in a certain way…fine…so he gets his contacts to manipulate perception to people see his actions in a certain light…get the heat off of him somewhat…if possible. He’s willing to kill…but…won’t do for it for pragmatic reasons just as well…attracts attention…the heat…not just because its the moral thing…otherwise…he’ll play mind games…is self-aware that although Batman doesn’t kill…he does break the bones of thugs and gives them brain damage…something Nightshade uses for his own tactics…strategically…and works with villains if and when need be…and?..willing to take calculated risks…strategically that is… Family Dynamics… 3. To clarify… for the ‘Wilson’ Family…and before Dick was taken in…Rose and Grant were loyal to Slade…loyal daughter and son…Joey as well…until Dick came…who would indirectly inspire Rose to follow her own path…Rose having mixed feelings…Grant?..a little jealous of Dick…and insisted that Dick can’t do anything else but follow in the ‘family’ footsteps…and even tried killing Dick a couple of times just to see how ‘serious’ Dick was…and Dick asking why a man like Wintergreen follows Slade at all anyway?..other then the obvious? Unique Traits and Hobbies: 4. At some points…he began to go undercover…for the missions and cases…and much to his own surprise…he finds it a bizarre way to channel that ‘showmanship’…a crude, and sad way to remember his roots at Haly’s Circus…and coupled with Slade’s harsh training and such…culinary skills were part of his going independent route from Slade…doesn’t hurt to cook well no?..and the customizable specialized gear…he likes to have people on their toes…pragmatics with a surprise that he never imagined himself to become quite the tinkerer honestly…as ALL his tech revolves around his acrobatics and yearning for his past…and the tech was a way for him to stand out from Slade and his foster siblings…the colors of gunmetal black and blue for example… Pragmatic Caring and Moral Lines: 5. He can’t deny the lethal trainings and skills he got from Slade and others over the years…as he wonders…save the innocents because its the ‘right’ thing AND get the good publicity?..which seems obvious right?..and as well…Slade still ended up becoming ‘Deathstroke’…and once tested Dick…save the innocents caught up in this mess by this man that Slade hired to test Dick’s ‘progress?’…kill the man who’s threatening the city?..or save the innocents?..Dick ends up saving the innocents and just BARELY saves that city in time…how’s that? Rebellion and Character Evolution: 6. Slade hitting him after Dick calling ‘childish’ in a debate of why Slade teaches him of the world’s so cruel and such…Slade manipulating Dick…then Dick watching his world’s Batman save a bunch of people from a burning fire after subduing criminals…Slade arguing that Dick is wasting his talents and skills on being a ‘petty’ anti-hero that thinks ‘too small’…Dick seeing how Slade is manipulating Terra for his own ends, and how Dick ultimately felt guilty for not doing anything about it…and surprised that Slade had another son, Joey Wilson, but chose to ignore him, was something Dick couldn’t believe…in fact…Joey Wilson was in the hospital after a supervillain tried to make Joey kill himself…Slade still working for a woman like Amanda Waller…and Slade working for the Joker…seriously??.. 7. Personal Relationships: Compared to main universe DC Nightwing, Nightshade isn’t that ‘well-liked’ because of his methods…him being an anti-hero…it wouldn’t have been a problem for the heroes if he become firmly good like Rose and Joey…but the fact that Nightshade is willing to get his hands dirty for justice…and the way he stands out because of his history, as Nightshade has mixed relationships with many people…he’s willing to work with heroes and such, but they don’t like him…villains find him…intriguing…unusual because of his history and past with Slade…anti-heroes crowd around Nightshade…the Titans…the Justice League…the Bat-Family…all have mixed reactions…and soon of begrudging respect…for his skills at least… Growth and Redemption: 8. Dick struggles for the ‘progress’…he hates Slade and all…but can’t deny the influence on him, mixed with attracting the attention of the world’s deadliest here… Lady Shiva…Nyssa Al Ghul and others…who eventually trained him…basically…being trained and ‘raised’ by Slade…made him a ‘beacon’ by the world’s deadliest…and…when he’s finally trying to free himself…is he really nothing more then a ‘wannabe’ who’s on a ‘temper-tantrum’ after all?..he’s deadly…but tries to act differently then what being Slade taught him…trying to act nice and polite…but between how he was raised and trained…he finds himself a puppet…what does he want for himself now?..he was trained and learned from the deadliest…becoming a formidable anti-hero in all forms…as some heroes begin to point out that his ‘adapt or die’ has shaped him…as Dick evolved from this early simple days as the ‘Gray Sparrow’…using Slade’s training for good…somehow?..until things changed…then he became ‘Nightshade’…as he goes from spiteful angry, typical brooding to a more pragmatic calculating anti-hero who learns to be more patient… Obviously…this WHOLE thing needs a LOT of improvement…LIKE A WHOLE LOT!.but its a solid foundation for now?..REmember…this is an alternate DC universe where Dick Grayson never became ‘Robin’ or ‘Nightwing’…but ‘Nightshade’ because Slade was there…not Bruce…","completion":"Your concept for Nightshade, an alternate universe Dick Grayson mentored by Slade Wilson instead of Bruce Wayne, presents a compelling and multifaceted anti-hero with a rich narrative potential. Here’s an analysis and potential improvements: **1. Foundation and Depth of Character:** You\'ve laid a solid foundation for Nightshade\'s character, highlighting a distinct departure from his origins as Robin and Nightwing through the significant influence of Slade Wilson. This divergence offers a fresh perspective on Dick Grayson, exploring how his innate goodness, skills, and resilience are shaped under the tutelage of a morally ambiguous figure like Slade. To deepen this, consider exploring more of Nightshade\'s internal struggles, particularly how he reconciles his desire for justice with Slade’s ruthless methods. **2. Moral Complexity and Themes:** The moral ambiguity you\'ve woven into Nightshade’s character, his actions, and his relationships with both allies and enemies is intriguing. It reflects on themes of nature versus nurture, the gray areas of justice, and the quest for identity amidst chaos. These themes could be further explored by presenting Nightshade with moral dilemmas that challenge his beliefs and force him to define his code of ethics away from the shadows of Slade’s influence. **3. Relationships and Dynamics:** The complex familial dynamics and relationships you\'ve outlined offer rich narrative territory. Nightshade\'s interactions with his foster siblings, especially the mixed relationships with Rose and Joey and the antagonistic relationship with Grant, add layers to his character. Developing these relationships can provide emotional depth and opportunities for growth. Additionally, Nightshade\'s professional relationships with other heroes set the stage for intriguing storylines that can test his loyalties, beliefs, and resolve. **4. Evolution and Growth:** The character arc you’ve envisioned for Nightshade showcases significant potential for growth. Starting as a figure molded by vengeance and Slade’s teachings, he evolves into a more pragmatic and independent anti-hero. His journey can be further enriched by focusing on critical turning points that challenge his worldview, force him to confront his past, and ultimately shape his path forward. **5. Unique Traits, Skills, and Motivations:** Your attention to Nightshade\'s skills, hobbies, and personal quirks is commendable. These elements not only distinguish him from other characters but also add realism and relatability. Delving deeper into how these skills and traits were developed or how they play into his larger goals could offer more insight into his character and make him even more compelling. **Improvements and Considerations:** - **Exploring the Psychological Impact:** Further delve into the psychological effects of being raised by Slade, contrasting it with what might have been under Batman’s mentorship. How does this shape Nightshade\'s view on heroism, family, and his own identity? - **Balancing Darkness with Light:** While Nightshade operates in morally grey areas, finding moments that reveal his inherent goodness or moments of vulnerability can make him a more rounded character and help readers empathize with him. - **Expanding the World:** Flesh out how Nightshade fits into the broader universe. How does his presence and actions impact the dynamics of heroism, villainy, and law enforcement in this world? How do established heroes and villains view him? Your alternate universe Dick Grayson as Nightshade is a fascinating concept that brings a fresh and darker perspective to a well-loved character. By deepening his struggles, honing his relationships, and clearly defining his growth, Nightshade can stand as a captivating figure in his own right, offering readers a unique exploration of themes central to the human condition."},{"prompt":"How’s this for an addition?

This narrative arc not only showcases his physical and emotional struggle but also highlights his resilience and determination to carve out his own identity away from Slade\'s influence. Here are some thoughts and suggestions on your addition: **1. The Transformation from Gray Sparrow to Nightshade:** The transition from Gray Sparrow, a hopeful yet naive vigilante, to Nightshade, a calculated and tech-enhanced anti-hero, is a powerful narrative arc. It mirrors the loss of innocence and the harsh realities that shape heroes. To deepen this transformation, consider exploring the psychological impact of his transition more thoroughly. How does this change his approach to vigilante justice, his relationship with fear, and his understanding of power and responsibility? **2.

To create a simple Linux terminal script that uses `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) to say \\"hello\\" in a British male voice, follow these steps. Note that as of my last update, `gTTS` does not allow direct specification of gender for voices, but you can select a UK English accent, and the default voice might align with what you\'re looking for. # Step 1: Install gTTS First, you need to install the `gTTS` Python package. Open a terminal and run: ```bash pip install gTTS ``` # Step 2: Create the Python Script Next, create a Python script. Open your favorite text editor, and append the following code: ```python from gtts import gTTS import os # The text to be read aloud text = \\"Hello\\" # Creating the gTTS object # lang=\'en-uk\' selects the English language with a UK accent. # Unfortunately, as of the last update, gTTS doesn\'t allow specifying gender. tts = gTTS(text=text, lang=\'en-uk\') # Saving the audio file tts.save(\\"hello.mp3\\") # Playing the audio file using mpg123, a command-line audio player. # Ensure you have mpg123 installed on your system, or adapt this line # to use another media player that can handle mp3 files. os.system(\\"mpg123 hello.mp3\\") ``` Save the script with a `.py` extension, for example, `say_hello.py`. # Step 3: Make sure you have `mpg123` (or another command-line player) The script uses `mpg123` to play the MP3 file. If you don\'t have it installed, you can usually install it via your distribution\'s package manager: For Debian/Ubuntu: ```bash sudo apt-get install mpg123 ``` For Fedora: ```bash sudo dnf install mpg123 ``` # Step 4: Running the Script Make sure you are in the directory where your script is saved. Then, run the script by typing: ```bash python say_hello.py ``` The script will generate an MP3 file with the text \\"Hello\\" spoken in a UK English accent, and then play that file. If you specifically need a male voice and the default does not meet your requirements, you might have to look for a different TTS engine or service that allows specifying the voice gender more explicitly, as `gTTS` relies on Google\'s Text-to-Speech API, which does not provide direct control over voice gender through `gTTS`."},{"prompt":"Assume I dessin a recommerreniee. witot t er eedback only wth collarave flerrng using LHS(locaaly ssenstie hashing) algorrhm. Assume I want to collect and use user feedback. What are the next steps?","completion":"Designing a recommender system without explicit feedback but planning to incorporate user feedback later, especially using a collaborative filtering approach with Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for efficiency, is a strategic way to enhance the performance of your recommendation system. Here\'s how you can proceed with integrating user feedback into your system: # 1. **Understand User Interactions** The first step is to identify what constitutes feedback in your system. Since you started without explicit feedback, consider all forms of user interaction as implicit feedback. This includes: - Viewing items (implying interest) - How long they view items (engagement depth) - Purchase history - Browsing behavior - Click-through rates # 2. **Data Collection** Start collecting this data systematically. Ensure you have a robust data collection infrastructure that respects user privacy and complies with data protection laws (like GDPR). This data will serve as the foundation for interpreting user preferences and enhancing recommendation accuracy. # 3. **Feedback Integration Strategy** Integrate the collected user feedback into your model. This could mean: - **Adjusting Weights:** Use feedback to adjust the importance of different items or features within your model. - **Re-train with Feedback:** Periodically re-train your model with the new feedback data to ensure the recommendations remain relevant. - **Model Hybridization:** Consider a hybrid model that combines collaborative filtering with content-based filtering, utilizing user feedback for the collaborative part to refine recommendations. # 4. **Use Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** You\'re already using LSH; it\'s a technique for grouping similar items or user preferences together to speed up similarity searches. With the introduction of feedback: - **Update LSH Buckets:** As you collect feedback, the similarity relationships between items or users might change. Update your LSH buckets accordingly to ensure efficient and accurate retrieval of similar items. - **Tune LSH:** Adjust parameters like the number of hash tables and hash functions to find the right balance between accuracy and efficiency, especially as your data grows with feedback. # 5. **User Feedback Loop** Implement a mechanism to capture direct user feedback as well, such as ratings or likes/dislikes, if you haven’t already. This can be used to further refine the recommendations. - **A/B Testing:** Regularly test different versions of your recommender system to find out which offers the best results based on real user feedback. - **Monitor Performance:** Use metrics like precision, recall, and the F1 score, but also consider user engagement and satisfaction metrics to evaluate the impact of incorporating feedback. # 6. **Scale and Adapt** As your system evolves, it will likely require scaling and adapting strategies to handle increased data and changing user behavior patterns. - **Dynamic Updates:** Consider strategies for dynamically updating recommendations in near real-time based on the latest feedback. - **Diversification:** Ensure that incorporating feedback does not lead to a filter bubble. Introduce diversity in recommendations to keep the user experience fresh and engaging. # 7. **Privacy and Ethics** Remember to handle all user data ethically, respecting privacy and consent. Be transparent about how user data is used to generate recommendations and offer users control over their data. # Conclusion Integrating user feedback into a recommender system is a continuous process of collection, analysis, and adaptation. It requires carefully balancing the need for personalization with concerns for user privacy and system scalability. With the right approach, incorporating user feedback can significantly enhance the relevance and effectiveness of your recommendations."},{"prompt":"Assume I want to collect explicit feedack. What are the protocol and what should be done?","completion":"Collecting explicit feedback from users involves asking them directly for their opinions or preferences regarding the items or services offered by your system. This feedback is invaluable as it provides direct insights into user preferences and can significantly enhance the accuracy of your recommendation system. To effectively collect and utilize explicit feedback, follow these protocols and steps: # 1. **User Interface for Feedback Collection** - **Design Simplicity:** Ensure the feedback mechanism is straightforward and non-intrusive. Complex or time-consuming processes may discourage user participation. - **Multi-Dimensional Feedback:** Allow users to rate different aspects (like quality, relevance, or satisfaction) to get nuanced insights. - **Accessibility:** Make the feedback option easily accessible but not disruptive to the user experience. # 2. **Feedback Timing and Frequency** - **Strategic Timing:** Request feedback after a user has had a meaningful interaction with the item or service. - **Frequency:** Be mindful of how often you request feedback to avoid user fatigue. Too many requests can lead to annoyance and decreased participation. # 3. **Privacy and Consent** - **Transparent Communication:** Clearly explain why you\'re collecting feedback and how it will be used to improve user experience. - **User Consent:** Ensure users understand that their feedback is voluntary and provide options for users to opt out of feedback mechanisms. # 4. **Data Handling and Ethics** - **Secure Storage:** Keep feedback data secure and anonymize personal information where possible to protect user privacy. - **Ethical Use:** Use feedback data responsibly and only for the purpose of enhancing the recommender system or user experience. # 5. **Incentivization** - **Encourage Participation:** Offer incentives for providing feedback, such as discounts, badges, or improved personalization, to encourage more users to participate. - **Value Feedback:** Show users how their feedback has contributed to improving the system to maintain engagement and trust. # 6. **Analysis and Integration** - **Feedback Analysis:** Implement mechanisms to analyze the feedback effectively. This may include sentiment analysis, rating averages, and spotting trends. - **Iterative Learning:** Continuously integrate feedback into your recommendation algorithms. This might require retraining your model periodically to factor in new feedback. # 7. **Quality Control** - **Filter Spam:** Implement systems to identify and filter out spam or irrelevant feedback. - **Outliers Handling:** Be aware of how outliers and extreme ratings affect your recommendations and adjust your analysis accordingly. # 8. **A/B Testing and Continuous Improvement** - **Test Changes:** Before fully integrating feedback into your live system, use A/B testing to measure the impact of changes on user satisfaction and engagement. - **Iterative Improvement:** Use feedback not just to improve recommendations but also to improve the feedback collection process itself. # 9. **Feedback Loop** - **Create a Feedback Loop:** Inform users about how their feedback has led to improvements. This transparency can increase trust and future user engagement. # Conclusion Collecting and utilizing explicit feedback requires careful planning and execution but can significantly enhance the accuracy and user satisfaction of your recommender system. Always prioritize user privacy, ensure consent, and use feedback data ethically and responsibly. Remember, the goal is to create a more personalized, engaging, and valuable experience for your users."},{"prompt":"Fact check the following: @blake.buswell So here’s the situation. Assume we have a query item that we want our model to output recommended materials (based on similarity mechanism executed by the LSH algorithm). So the scenario is if our item does not have recycled content, the recommended items may also not have recycled content (due to similarity of features as part of the features used for ML model training). So, we designed a mechanism that is able to recommend products that have sustainable materials even if the query item does not have sustainable materials. This comes with a caveat! It may (not necessarily) sacrifice the quality of recommendations dues to lower level of similarity as we prioritize sustainable materials to be recommended. Latanya mentioned we do not want this sacrifice just for the sake of recommending sustainable materials. It\'s ok that we don\'t recommend sustainable materials in case the algorithm believes the top similar cases for recommendations does not have sustainable materials which happends mostly in the scenarios that the query item itself does not have sustainable materials.","completion":"The scenario described is technically feasible and highlights an important consideration in the design of recommendation systems, particularly when integrating sustainability or other specific criteria into the recommendation logic. Let\'s fact-check and elaborate on the key points mentioned: 1. **LSH Algorithm for Similarity-Based Recommendations:** The Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithm is indeed used for identifying similar items in large datasets efficiently. When using LSH or any similarity-based mechanism, recommendations are typically based on feature similarity. If recycled or sustainable materials are not part of the feature set or not prioritized, items without such materials may be recommended when the query item also lacks them. **Fact Check: True** 2. **Designing a Mechanism for Recommending Sustainable Materials:** It is possible to design a recommendation system that deliberately prioritizes certain features, such as sustainable materials, even if those features are not present in the query item. This involves adjusting the feature weighting or adding specific logic to the recommendation algorithm to boost items with desired attributes. **Fact Check: True** 3. **Potential Sacrifice in Recommendation Quality:** Prioritizing sustainable materials over other similar features may indeed lead to a reduction in the perceived quality of the recommendations, as it could result in recommending items that are less similar to the query item in other respects. This trade-off between promoting sustainability and maintaining similarity-based recommendation quality is a real consideration in the design of recommendation systems. **Fact Check: True** 4. **Choosing Not to Sacrifice Recommendation Quality:** The decision not to sacrifice the quality of recommendations for the sake of promoting sustainable materials is a strategic choice that reflects the prioritization of user satisfaction and relevance in the recommendation process. It is a valid approach, especially in scenarios where the inclusion of sustainable materials could significantly deviate from the user\'s expected or desired outcomes. **Fact Check: True** In summary, the scenario described demonstrates an understanding of the complexities involved in designing recommendation systems that balance various factors, including feature similarity, sustainability, and user satisfaction. Incorporating sustainability into recommendations without compromising quality often requires sophisticated algorithmic adjustments and a nuanced understanding of user preferences."},{"prompt":"Придумай 10 фраз с игрой слов","completion":"1.

[ ΔR1 = |R1 - R| ] [ ΔR2 = |R2 - R| ] [ ΔR3 = |R3 - R| ] Подставим данные: [ ΔR1 = |37,03 - 36,52| ≈ 0,51 ] [ ΔR2 = |36,25 - 36,52| ≈ 0,27 ] [ ΔR3 = |36,27 - 36,52| ≈ 0,25 ] 3. **Определите, какое максимальное отклонение от среднего значения**, это будет ваша абсолютная погрешность. По предыдущим расчетам: - Абсолютное отклонение для R1 = 0,51 Ом, - Абсолютное отклонение для R2 = 0,27 Ом, - Абсолютное отклонение для R3 = 0,25 Ом. Самое большое отклонение - это 0,51 Ом. Таким образом, абсолютная погрешность вашего среднего значения сопротивления R будет равна 0,51 Ом. Обратите внимание, что это упрощение, предполагающее, что вы ищете абсолютную погрешность усредненного значения из трех измерений. В реальных научных или инженерных задачах могут требоваться более сложные расчеты, особенно если речь идет о сложных электрических цепях, где сопротивления соединены последовательно или параллельно, и ошибка в измерении каждого компонента влияет на общую погрешность по-разному. Кроме того, если у вас есть информация о точности используемых измерительных приборов, эта информация также должна быть включена в анализ погрешности."},{"prompt":"Класс точности приборов γ= 0,5, max I =500 мА , max u =20 В если это пригодится","completion":"Если учитывать класс точности приборов, то абсолютная погрешность измерений также зависит от допустимой ошибки, связанной с классом точности приборов, используемых для измерения. Класс точности (γ) устройства показывает максимально допустимую относительную погрешность измерения. В вашем случае γ = 0,5% для приборов, максимальный ток (I) = 500 мА и максимальное напряжение (U) = 20 В. Для расчета абсолютной погрешности с использованием класса точности устройств, нам нужно знать, какие величины (ток или напряжение) измерялись для определения сопротивления. Если сопротивление было вычислено непосредственно, тогда информация о классе точности приборов может быть использована для определения погрешности измерительного прибора, а не вычисленной величины. Однако, если сопротивление было вычислено через измеренные величины тока и напряжения по закону Ома (R = frac{U}{I}), в этом случае абсолютная погрешность измеряемого сопротивления будет зависеть от погрешностей измерений тока и напряжения. Абсолютная погрешность измерения данной величины (Δ) может быть вычислена с использованием формулы класса точности: [ Δ = γ times text{максимальное значение измеряемой величины} / 100 ] Для тока и напряжения: [ ΔI = 0,5% times 500мА = 2,5 мА ] [ ΔU = 0,5% times 20В = 0,1 В ] Эти расчеты указывают на погрешность измерения тока и напряжения на основе класса точности ваших приборов. Однако, без дополнительной информации о том, как измерялось сопротивление (через ток и напряжение или непосредственно), а также о самом методе расчета (например, использовались ли разные приборы для измерения каждого из R1, R2, и R3), не представляется возможным точно рассчитать абсолютную погрешность сопротивления R с учетом этой информации. Если сопротивление вычислялось через измерения напряжения и тока, нужно будет также учитывать погрешности этих измерений, а также возможное влияние их на абсолютную погрешность итогового значения сопротивления. В таком случае абсолютная погрешность сопротивления будет зависеть не только от прямых измерений R1, R2, R3, но и от погрешностей измерения тока и напряжения."},{"prompt":"нельзя ли рассчитать абсолютную погрешность как просто половину цены деления прибора? т.е ΔR=0,0001/2","completion":"Да, в некоторых контекстах и для определенных типов задач абсолютная погрешность измерения может быть определена как половина наименьшего деления шкалы измерительного прибора. Этот метод основан на предположении, что реальное значение измеряемой величины находится в пределах одного наименьшего деления от показания прибора, и самая безопасная оценка его погрешности — это половина этого деления, поскольку это максимальная ошибка, которую можно допустить, не зная точного расположения значения в пределах этого деления. Если значение абсолютной погрешности ΔR определяется как (0,0001 / 2), это должно означать, что наименьшее деление шкалы вашего измерительного прибора (или разрешение измерительного устройства) составляет 0,0001. Следовательно, половина этого значения, то есть 0,00005, будет вашей оценкой абсолютной погрешности измерения сопротивления на основе разрешения измерительного прибора. Этот подход к определению абсолютной погрешности является довольно общим и может использоваться, когда другие факторы, такие как погрешность класса точности, не учитываются, или когда нет информации о цифровом представлении погрешности. Однако он предполагает, что только разрешающая способность прибора ограничивает точность измерения, и не принимает в расчет систематические погрешности, которые могут быть связаны с самим прибором или методом измерения. Таким образом, если мы трактуем ваш вопрос как использующий половину минимального деления прибора как оценку абсолютной погрешности, то ваш расчет ΔR=0,00005 является корректным подходом в контексте, где другие погрешности не рассматриваются или их влияние признается незначительным."},{"prompt":"хорошо а теперь помоги найти относительную погрешность учитывая измерения, по которым я находил значения сопротивлений.

После этого можно обсудить, как влияет класс точности измерительных приборов. Сначала вычислим сопротивления: 1. (R1 = frac{U1}{I1} = frac{10В}{0,27А} approx 37,04 Ом) 2. (R2 = frac{U2}{I2} = frac{8,7В}{0,24А} approx 36,25 Ом) 3. (R3 = frac{U3}{I3} = frac{7,8В}{0,215А} approx 36,28 Ом) Затем найдем абсолютные погрешности измерений тока ((ΔI)) и напряжения ((ΔU)) через класс точности приборов ((γ)): [ ΔI = γ times text{max} I = 0,005 times 500 мА = 2,5 мА = 0,0025 А ] [ ΔU = γ times text{max} U = 0,005 times 20 В = 0,1 В ] Чтобы оценить абсолютную погрешность сопротивления ((ΔR)), используем правило пропагации неопределенностей для деления (здесь мы считаем, что погрешности (ΔI) и (ΔU) независимы): [ ΔR = sqrt{left(frac{ΔU}{I}right)^2 + left(frac{U cdot ΔI}{I^2}right)^2} ] Однако в контексте вашего вопроса проще будет использовать класс точности для вычисления относительных погрешностей измеренных величин напряжения ((U)) и тока ((I)), и затем применить их для нахождения относительной погрешности сопротивления ((R)). Относительная погрешность сопротивления ((ε_R)) будет суммой относительных погрешностей измерений тока и напряжения: [ ε_R = ε_U + ε_I = 2γ ] (ε_U) и (ε_I) здесь равны γ (0,5%), поскольку класс точности приборов одинаков для измерений напряжения и тока. Итак: [ ε_R = 2 cdot 0,005 = 0,01 ] или 1%. Это значит, что для каждого измеренного значения сопротивления относительная погрешность составляет (1%). Это относительно упрощенный способ оценки относительной погрешности сопротивления, основанный на предпосылке, что основные погрешности проистекают из класса точности измерительных устройств, и не учитывает другие возможные источники ошибок."},{"prompt":"Рассчитай погрешность дифференциальным способом и присылай пожалуйста вычисления в понятных мне символах","completion":"Для вычисления абсолютной погрешности сопротивления дифференциальным методом, мы должны применить формулы, учитывая абсолютную погрешность измерений напряжения ((ΔU)) и тока ((ΔI)), и затем найдем относительную погрешность сопротивления, используя закон Ома ((R = frac{U}{I})), где (R) — сопротивление, (U) — напряжение, и (I) — ток. Формула для абсолютной погрешности сопротивления по закону Ома при дифференциации будет: [ ΔR = R times sqrt{left(frac{ΔU}{U}right)^2 + left(frac{ΔI}{I}right)^2} ] Здесь (ΔR) — абсолютная погрешность сопротивления, (ΔU) — абсолютная погрешность напряжения, и (ΔI) — абсолютная погрешность тока.

Подставим соответствующие значения в формулу: [ ΔR1 = 37,04 times sqrt{left(frac{0,1}{10}right)^2 + left(frac{0,0025}{0,27}right)^2} ] [ ΔR1 = 37,04 times sqrt{0,01^2 + 0,0093^2} ] [ ΔR1 = 37,04 times sqrt{0,0001 + 0,00008649} ] [ ΔR1 = 37,04 times sqrt{0,00018649} ] [ ΔR1 ≈ 37,04 times 0,01365 ] [ ΔR1 ≈ 0,505 Ом ] Таким образом, абсолютная погрешность первого сопротивления составляет примерно (0,505) Ом. Для относительной погрешности сопротивления: [ ε_R = frac{ΔR}{R} ] Для первого измерения: [ ε_{R1} = frac{0,505}{37,04} ≈ 0,0136 ] или (1,36%).

Инструменты, используемые в вступлении и на протяжении всей песни: - Струнные инструменты: основную линию создают скрипки и виолончели, которые играют запоминающийся мотив. Этот мотив был адаптирован из симфонической аранжировки Эндрю Олдэма (Andrew Loog Oldham) песни \\"The Last Time\\" группы The Rolling Stones, что впоследствии привело к юридическим спорам о правах на музыку. - Ударные: В песне также присутствуют ударные, добавляющие ритм и поддержку струнным, но в более фоновом режиме в начале песни. - Гитары: Электрогитара и бас-гитара вносят дополнительные музыкальные слои, подчёркивая роковую основу трека. - Вокал: Вокал Ричарда Эшкрофта (Richard Ashcroft) входит после вступительных тактов, добавляя ещё большей выразительности и эмоциональной глубины песне. Жанр и стиль: - \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\" объединяет в себе элементы альтернативного рока и бритпопа с симфоническими и оркестровыми аранжировками. Это сочетание придаёт песне уникальный характер и атмосферность, за что она и была высоко оценена как критиками, так и слушателями. Стилистически песня выделяется своей эпической, возвышенной атмосферой, создавая чувство ностальгии и размышлений о жизни.

Provérbios 23 nos ensina que o coração que se abre para a sabedoria divina é um coração pronto para receber as mais ricas bênçãos de Deus. É como plantar em solo fértil, preparado para acolher a boa semente e produzir abundantes frutos. Incentivo cada um de vocês, meus queridos, a dirigir seu coração à sabedoria, a buscar a Deus de todo o coração, pois Ele é o caminho, a verdade e a vida. Nossa jornada aqui na Terra é breve, mas o legado de um coração sábio e temente a Deus é eterno. **Parte 3: A Vida Além do Material** \\"Não te esforces para ser rico; da tua própria inteligência, desiste\\", nos exorta o Provérbio 23:4. Que poderoso lembrete, irmãos, de que a busca incessante por riquezas materiais é um caminho vazio. O Senhor nos chama a buscar riquezas eternas, aquelas que não são corroídas pelo tempo nem roubadas por ladrões. É tempo de refletir: estamos construindo tesouros no céu ou nos perdendo na ilusão das riquezas terrenas? Jesus nos ensina que onde estiver o nosso tesouro, aí estará também o nosso coração. Que o nosso coração esteja sempre voltado para Deus, para Sua vontade, Sua sabedoria e Seu amor incondicional. **Oração:** Ó Deus Todo-Poderoso, Pai de amor e misericórdia, estamos aqui diante de Ti, sedentos pela Tua sabedoria e pela Tua direção. Abre nossos corações, Senhor, para acolher Teus ensinamentos e viver de acordo com Tua palavra. Que possamos buscar a verdadeira riqueza que vem de Ti, e não sermos seduzidos pelas falsas promessas deste mundo. Dá-nos força e coragem para seguir Teu caminho, confiando sempre em Tua providência divina. Em nome de Jesus, Amém. **Encerramento:** Irmãos e irmãs, que esta reflexão tenha tocado seus corações e alimentado suas almas. Esperamos que essas palavras permaneçam com vocês, guiando seus passos no caminho da verdadeira sabedoria e felicidade.

Permaculture is a design philosophy centered around working with nature to create sustainable, self-sufficient ecosystems. By mimicking patterns and relationships found in nature, permaculture seeks to develop agricultural systems, living spaces, and communities that are environmentally friendly, economically viable, and socially equitable. It incorporates principles like recycling resources, enhancing biodiversity, and maximizing beneficial interactions between different elements of the ecosystem. Permaculture aims not just to do less harm to the planet, but to actively regenerate and improve environmental health and human well-being. It\'s about creating systems that are not only beneficial for us today but are designed to continue providing for future generations."},{"prompt":"please give me one more example.","completion":"Certainly! Think of permaculture as the art and science of designing human habitats and food production systems in a way that mimics the natural ecosystems. It\'s an approach that encourages us to be stewards of the land, cultivating diversity, stability, and resilience. For example, in a permaculture garden, instead of neat rows of a single crop, you might find a vibrant mix of plants, animals, and structures, all carefully designed to support and enhance each other — like planting nitrogen-fixing legumes to enrich the soil for other plants, or using chickens to help control pests and fertilize the ground. This creates a healthy, productive environment that\'s less reliant on external inputs like chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and more in tune with the rhythms of nature. It\'s about creating systems that care for the Earth while also caring for people, building a future where both thrive."},{"prompt":"thank you","completion":"You\'re welcome!

Это означает, что если составной объект содержит внутри себя другие объекты, то в новом составном объекте останутся ссылки на те же самые объекты, что и в оригинале. В результате, изменения внутри вложенных объектов в копии отразятся на оригинальном объекте, и наоборот. В Python, поверхностное копирование выполняется с помощью метода `copy()` из модуля `copy` или использованием методов/конструкторов типов, таких как `list()` для списков, `dict()` для словарей и т.д. 2. **Deep Copy (Глубокое копирование)**: В отличие от поверхностного копирования, при глубоком копировании создается полностью независимая копия исходного составного объекта вместе со всеми объектами, которые он содержит. Это означает, что создаются новые копии не только самого составного объекта, но и всех вложенных объектов, рекурсивно вплоть до самого последнего уровня. Изменения, сделанные в глубокой копии, не затронут оригинальный объект и наоборот. В Python, глубокое копирование выполняется с помощью метода `deepcopy()` из модуля `copy`. **Пример с использованием списков:** ```python import copy # исходный список original_list = [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]] # поверхностное копирование shallow_copied_list = copy.copy(original_list) # глубокое копирование deep_copied_list = copy.deepcopy(original_list) # изменяем исходный список original_list[1][0] = \'a\' print(original_list) # [1, [\'a\', 3], [4, 5]] print(shallow_copied_list) # [1, [\'a\', 3], [4, 5]] - изменения отражаются в поверхностной копии print(deep_copied_list) # [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]] - глубокая копия остается без изменений ``` В данном примере изменения во вложенном списке исходного списка также приводят к изменениям в поверхностно скопированном списке, т.к. вложенные списки копируются по ссылке. В то же время, глубоко скопированный список остается незатронутым, так как все вложенности были скопированы рекурсивно."},{"prompt":"привет что не так в моей сортировке пузырьком def bubble(inp: list) -> list: lenght = len(inp) while lenght != 1: for i in range(0, lenght): if inp[i-1] > inp[i]: inp[i-1], inp[i] = inp[i], inp[i-1] lenght = i return inp print(bubble(sdsa))","completion":"В вашем коде сортировки пузырьком есть несколько проблем. Давайте разберем их и увидим, как можно улучшить код. 1. **Неправильное обновление переменной `lenght`**: - Вы обновляете `lenght` значением `i` в самом конце цикла `for`, что неправильно. Ваше намерение, вероятно, было уменьшать `lenght` на 1 на каждом проходе, чтобы не проверять уже отсортированные элементы. Однако, присваивание `lenght = i` делает это некорректно, так как значение `i` в последней итерации всегда будет `lenght - 1`. - Вместо этого после окончания цикла `for` нужно уменьшать `lenght` на 1, используя `lenght -= 1`. 2. **Ошибочный доступ к элементам списка**: - Ваш цикл `for` начинается с `0`, и когда `i` равно `0`, выравнивание `inp[i-1] > inp[i]` приводит к сравнению первого элемента (`inp[0]`) со \\"следующим\\" элементом в конце списка (`inp[-1]`) из-за способа работы отрицательных индексов в списке. Это может повлечь неожиданное поведение сортировки. - Ваш внутренний цикл должен начинаться с `1`, а не с `0`, чтобы избежать этой проблемы и правильно сравнивать пары элементов. Попробуйте исправленную версию вашей функции: ```python def bubble(inp: list) -> list: length = len(inp) while length > 1: # Используйте \\"length > 1\\", чтобы убедиться, что остановка будет, когда массив будет отсортирован for i in range(1, length): # Начинайте с 1, чтобы избежать отрицательного индекса if inp[i-1] > inp[i]: inp[i-1], inp[i] = inp[i], inp[i-1] length -= 1 # Правильное уменьшение длины на 1 после каждого прохода return inp # Пример использования sdsa = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90] print(bubble(sdsa)) ``` Теперь функция должна корректно сортировать входной список методом пузырька. Помните, что сортировка пузырьком не самый эффективный метод сортировки для больших массивов, но она имеет образовательное значение и может быть полезна для понимания основ алгоритмов сортировки."},{"prompt":"в чём отличия global от nonlocal","completion":"Ключевые слова `global` и `nonlocal` в Python используются для работы с переменными в различных областях видимости, но они действуют по-разному. # Global Ключевое слово `global` используется внутри функции для указания на то, что переменная является глобальной, то есть она была определена вне функций, на уровне модуля. Если переменная объявлена как `global`, это означает, что любые изменения этой переменной внутри функции будут отражены на переменной в глобальной области видимости. ```python x = 5 def func(): global x x = 10 func() print(x) # Выведет: 10, так как мы изменили глобальную переменную x ``` # Nonlocal Ключевое слово `nonlocal`, в свою очередь, используется для работы с переменными в областях видимости, заключенных между локальной и глобальной, т.е. во вложенных функциях. Оно позволяет изменять переменные в области видимости непосредственного родителя функции (но не глобальные переменные). ```python def outer(): x = 5 def inner(): nonlocal x x = 10 inner() print(x) # Выведет: 10, так как inner изменила nonlocal переменную x outer() ``` # Основные отличия - `global` используется для указания на переменные, определенные на уровне модуля (глобальные переменные), позволяя изменять их значения внутри функций. - `nonlocal` используется во вложенных функциях для указания на переменные в области видимости внешней функции (но не на глобальные переменные), позволяя изменять их значения во вложенных функциях.

Выбор между ними зависит чаще всего от стилистических предпочтений программиста или от рекомендаций по стилю кода в проекте. Основные случаи использования каждого из них можно описать следующим образом: 1. **Внутристрочные кавычки**: Одна из причин выбрать одинарные или двойные кавычки — это наличие кавычек внутри строки. Чтобы не использовать экранирование (``), можно выбирать тип кавычек в зависимости от содержимого строки. ```python # Использование двойных кавычек, если в строке есть одинарные s = \\"That\'s a nice day.\\" # Использование одинарных кавычек, если в строке есть двойные s = \'He said, \\"Hello, world!\\"\' ``` 2. **Многострочные строки**: И одинарные, и двойные кавычки можно утроить (`\'\'\'` или `\\"\\"\\"`) для создания многострочных строк, в которых сохраняются переводы строки и пробелы. Выбор между одинарными и двойными кавычками также зависит от стиля или содержимого. ```python # Многострочная строка с двойными кавычками s = \\"\\"\\"Многострочный текст\\"\\"\\" # Многострочная строка с одинарными кавычками s = \'\'\'Многострочный текст\'\'\' ``` 3. **Согласованность**: Важно поддерживать согласованность в использовании кавычек в пределах проекта. Некоторые стайлгайды, например, PEP 8 для Python, не предписывают строго использование одного из видов кавычек, но рекомендуют придерживаться выбранного стиля. 4. **JSON и другие языки**: Двойные кавычки часто используются при работе с JSON и в примерах кода на других языках, в которых строгое использование двойных кавычек является требованием (например, JSON). Это может быть еще одной причиной предпочесть двойные кавычки в Python, чтобы сохранить единообразие в коде, который работает с такими форматами или языками. В заключение, выбор между одинарными и двойными кавычками в Python — это вопрос стиля и удобства, а не функциональности. Главное — последовательно следовать выбранному стилю в рамках своего проекта."},{"prompt":"lua defold script with html5.run()","completion":"In Defold, a powerful 2D game engine designed for cross-platform development, you can use the HTML5 API to interact with the webpage hosting your game. One of the functions provided by this API is `html5.run()`, which allows you to execute JavaScript code from your Lua script. This can be especially useful for tasks such as saving and loading game data, interacting with web APIs, and modifying the webpage layout or styles directly from your game code. Given the depth of possible use cases, I\'ll provide a simple example to demonstrate how to use `html5.run()` in Defold to interact with the browser environment: # Example: Alert Message from Defold Game Let\'s create a simple example where we trigger a JavaScript alert dialog with a message from our Defold game. Step 1: Check if Running in HTML5 First, it\'s good to check if your game is running in an HTML5 environment to avoid calling HTML5-specific functions in environments where they aren\'t supported (like desktop or mobile builds). ```lua if html5 then -- We can safely use html5 functions here else -- Not in an HTML5 environment end ``` Step 2: Prepare Your JavaScript Code Decide on the JavaScript code you want to run. For a simple alert: ```javascript alert(\'This is a message from your Defold game!\'); ``` Step 3: Execute JavaScript from Lua Convert your JavaScript code into a string and pass it to `html5.run()`. ```lua if html5 then html5.run(\\"alert(\'This is a message from your Defold game!\')\\") end ``` # Complete Example Combining the steps above, here\'s a simple Defold script that checks if the game is running in an HTML5 environment and, if so, executes a JavaScript alert: ```lua function init(self) if html5 then html5.run(\\"alert(\'This is a message from your Defold game!\')\\") end end ``` # Security Notes When using `html5.run()`, keep the following in mind: - Be careful with dynamically generated JavaScript code, especially if it\'s based on user input, to avoid security issues like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting). - Different browsers and environments might have varying levels of support for JavaScript features. Test your game across different platforms to ensure compatibility. # Conclusion `html5.run()` is a powerful tool in the Defold game engine for interfacing with the host webpage and browser. With it, you can execute arbitrary JavaScript, opening a wide range of possibilities for integrating your game with web technologies. As always, ensure that you\'re writing secure code, especially when dealing with external inputs or sensitive data."},{"prompt":"введение в курсовой работе на тему: юридические факты в гражданском праве","completion":"Введение в курсовую работу на тему: \\"Юридические факты в гражданском праве\\" Гражданское право – одна из ключевых и наиболее развитых отраслей права, которая регулирует многообразие общественных отношений, возникающих в сфере имущественного оборота, а также в сфере личных неимущественных прав.

Ancak, bu sektör birçok zorlukla karşı karşıyadır. Bu zorlukların bazıları global ölçekte hissedilirken, bazıları ise daha çok yerel dinamiklere bağlıdır. İşte gayrimenkul sektörünün karşı karşıya olduğu bazı temel zorluklar: # 1. Ekonomik Dalgalanmalar Gayrimenkul piyasası, genel ekonomik durumdan doğrudan etkilenir. Ekonomik büyüme yavaşladığında veya bir kriz yaşandığında, gayrimenkul yatırımları da olumsuz yönde etkilenir. Gelir seviyeleri, işsizlik oranları ve faiz oranları gibi faktörler, insanların ev alma veya kirama gücünü doğrudan etkiler. # 2. Yüksek Faiz Oranları Merkez bankaları tarafından belirlenen faiz oranları, kredili gayrimenkul alımlarını büyük ölçüde etkiler. Faiz oranlarının yüksek olması, kredi maliyetlerini artırarak, hem alıcıların hem de gayrimenkul geliştiricilerinin finansman maliyetlerini yükseltir. # 3. Yasal ve Düzenleyici Hükümler Gayrimenkul sektörü, yerel ve uluslararası düzeyde bir dizi yasal ve düzenleyici hükümlere tabidir. Bu kanunlar ve yönetmelikler, arazi kullanımından, çevresel düzenlemelere, inşaat standartlarına ve mülk satışına kadar çeşitli alanlarda geliştiriciler ve yatırımcılar için zorluklar oluşturabilir. # 4. Teknolojik Gelişmeler Teknolojik ilerlemeler, gayrimenkul sektörünü de dönüştürmekte ve yeni zorluklar ortaya çıkarmaktadır. Örneğin, çevrimiçi platformlar ve sanal turlar, geleneksel satış ve pazarlama yöntemlerini değiştiriyor. Ayrıca, akıllı binalar ve sürdürülebilir inşaat teknikleri gibi yenilikler, sektör profesyonellerinin sürekli olarak yeni beceriler öğrenmesini gerektiriyor. # 5. Demografik Değişiklikler Nüfus artışı, kentleşme, yaşlanan nüfus ve göç gibi demografik değişiklikler de gayrimenkul sektörü üzerinde büyük etkilere sahiptir. Bu değişiklikler, konut, ticari alan ve altyapı ihtiyaçlarını etkilerken, aynı zamanda gayrimenkul talebini de değiştiriyor. # 6. Sürdürülebilirlik ve Çevresel Sorunlar Çevresel sürdürülebilirlik, bugünün gayrimenkul sektörü için önemli bir zorluktur. Enerji verimliliği, su tasarrufu ve karbon ayak izinin azaltılması gibi konular, projelerin tasarım ve inşaat aşamalarında giderek daha fazla önem kazanmaktadır. Ayrıca, iklim değişikliği ve doğal afet risklerinin artması, gayrimenkulün konumu ve dayanıklılığı açısından yeni düşüncelerin ortaya çıkmasına neden oluyor. # 7. Yatırımcı Beklentileri Gayrimenkul yatırımcılarının beklentileri zaman içinde değişiklik gösterir. Yüksek getiri beklentisi, düşük risk ve likidite ihtiyacı gibi faktörler, sektör profesyonelleri için sürekli bir zorluk oluşturur. Ayrıca, yatırımcıların çeşitlenen ihtiyaç ve beklentilerine uyum sağlamak, sektör için önemli bir meydan okumadır. Gayrimenkul sektörü, bu ve benzeri zorluklarla başa çıkmak için sürekli olarak adaptasyon ve yenilik yapmak zorundadır. Ekonomik, teknolojik, çevresel ve demografik değişikliklere hızlı bir şekilde adapte olabilen şirketler, rekabet avantajı elde edebilir ve uzun vadede başarılı olabilirler."},{"prompt":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam (who likes to communicate using Internet slang and abbreviations), Jane’s 14 year old friend and neighbour Aaron Ling and Aaron’s 12 year old sister Molly-Rose Ling hanging out during a school trip to the mall when Molly-Rose mentions how her mother regrets giving Aaron a credit card, especially since the school mentioned multiple times to students and their parents to not bring any kinds of cash (this includes banknotes, credit cards, debit cards and gift cards), yet Aaron brought his credit card in, making his two friends jealous that he can buy stuff during the trip, even after the school and his mother told him not to bring it in, but then Molly-Rose explains **why** Aaron brought it in and **how** he physically can’t window shop, he physically has to buy at least one thing and how he gets really antsy, anxious, frustrated, stressed and screams if he leaves a store or a mall without buying anything","completion":"Jane: Hey guys, did you see that new store that just opened up in the mall?

There isn\'t an explicit \\"error\\" in the traditional sense (syntax errors, for example), but there are some aspects that might not work as intended or could use clarification/improvement. 1. **Clarification of Intended Functionality:** - The script assumes the presence of an `artifact` object with a `value` attribute at the line `inputs.exo_message_subject = artifact.value`. Ensure that `artifact` is defined and has a value relevant to the context of `exo_message_subject`. - The script sets several variables (like `inputs.exo_mail_folders`, `inputs.exo_email_address_sender`, etc.) to `None` or to specific values but comments out alternative ways to set these using `playbook.inputs...`. If these commented lines are meant to be potential alternatives, ensure that there\'s guidance or conditional logic to choose appropriately based on the scenario. 2. **Hardcoded Value:** - Setting `inputs.exo_email_address = \'ALL\'` is a specific use-case choice. Ensure that this is indeed the intended logic for your script, as this seems to imply the script will query all users’ mailboxes, which may not be optimal or allowable depending on your organization\'s policy or the API\'s limitations. 3. **Conditional Logic on `inputs.exo_message_subject`:** - The if condition `if inputs.exo_message_subject == artifact.value:` immediately after setting `inputs.exo_message_subject` to `artifact.value` will always be true, which suggests either redundant logic or a misunderstanding of the intended condition. 4. **Use of `playbook.inputs`:** - Ensure that `playbook.inputs` is appropriately populated with all necessary attributes before this script segment runs. Your checks (like `if hasattr(playbook.inputs, \\"exchange_online_query_results_output\\"):`) are good practice, but ensure that all necessary input data is provided, validated, and cleaned before use. 5. **Error Handling:** - Consider adding error handling around areas where data may not be as expected (e.g., missing `artifact` value, failing to retrieve `playbook.inputs`, etc.). This can help in making the script more robust and easier to debug. 6. **Code Comments and Unused Code:** - It looks like there are commented-out parts that suggest alternative sources for input values (`#playbook.inputs.exchange_online_mail_folder_id`, etc.). If these are intended for future use or as optional configurations, make it clear in your documentation or through conditional logic in your script. Otherwise, consider removing or clearly marking such segments to avoid confusion. In summary, while there doesn\'t appear to be a major syntax error, the effectiveness and correctness of the script heavily depend on the context of use, data integrity, and external dependencies (e.g., `artifact`, `playbook.inputs`). Ensure that all assumptions made in the script are valid in your specific use case."},{"prompt":"Crie uma ótima e bem explicado e persuasivas reflexão com muita eloquência sobre provérbio 23 com muita fé, e motivação, baseando no estilo de algum grande pregador evangélico de sua escolha comece fazendo três ótimos titulo muito curtos, depois crie uma introdução que atraia as pessoas a ficar assistindo o vídeo, agora desenvolva a reflexão com tudo que pedi no começo, se preferir pode dividir em partes e depois desenvolve parte por parte ,faça uma ótima e completa reflexão, depois faca uma bela oração relacionada ao tema com muita empolgação e devoção ,quero fixar que será um vídeo para o youtube.

Каждый такой сегмент представляет собой отдельную виртуальную локальную сеть. Хотя VLAN часто используется для улучшения производительности и управления сетью, он также может способствовать повышению безопасности информации в сети организации. Рассмотрим, как именно VLAN может служить средством защиты информации: 1. **Изоляция трафика**: С помощью VLAN можно разделить трафик различных подразделений или групп пользователей, изолируя его друг от друга. Это означает, что пользователи одной виртуальной сети не имеют доступа к ресурсам другой виртуальной сети без соответствующих прав доступа. Такая изоляция помогает снижать риск несанкционированного доступа к чувствительной информации. 2. **Контроль доступа**: С помощью VLAN можно более тонко управлять правами доступа к сетевым ресурсам. Администраторы могут настраивать политики безопасности для каждой VLAN, контролируя, какие устройства и пользователи могут взаимодействовать с данными в каждом сегменте сети. Это позволяет предоставлять доступ только тем, кто действительно нуждается в нем для работы, и ограничивать доступ остальным. 3. **Снижение риска распространения угроз**: В случае проникновения зловредного ПО или атаки извне, использование VLAN может помочь ограничить распространение атаки в сети. Зараженное устройство или сегмент сети может быть изолирован, что ограничит доступ атакующего к другим частям сети и поможет быстрее нейтрализовать угрозу. 4. **Управление гостевым доступом**: VLAN можно использовать для создания отдельных сетей для гостевых пользователей, обеспечивая им доступ в Интернет, но изолируя от корпоративных ресурсов. Это предотвращает возможные риски безопасности, связанные с доступом неконтролируемых устройств к корпоративной сети. 5. **Шифрование трафика**: Некоторые реализации VLAN поддерживают шифрование трафика между устройствами в пределах VLAN. Это помогает обеспечить конфиденциальность данных в сетевых передачах. На практике для максимальной эффективности VLAN следует использовать в сочетании с другими мерами безопасности, такими как брандмауэры, системы обнаружения и предотвращения вторжений (IDS/IPS), аутентификация и контроль доступа на уровне доступа (NAC). Относиться к VLAN как к универсальному решению для обеспечения безопасности недостаточно, но он является важным инструментом в арсенале средств защиты информации сети организации."},{"prompt":"cuál es el comando para crear un entorno virtual en Mac?","completion":"El comando para crear un entorno virtual en MacOS es el siguiente: ```bash python3 -m venv mi_entorno_virtual ``` Donde \\"mi_entorno_virtual\\" es el nombre que le quieres dar a tu entorno virtual.

Если транспорт исправен, то произвести расчет нагрузки можно следующим образом: В документах на тягач и прицеп находим массу техники. М1 – масса автомобиля, М2 – масса прицепа. Определяем вес груза (М3). Он всегда указан в сопроводительной документации на груз. Сначала нужно рассчитать нагрузку на прицеп. Расчет производится следующим образом: 75% от массы прицепа и массы груза (М2+М3). Полученное значение составляет нагрузку на полуприцеп. Например, вес груза – 15 т, вес прицепа – 10 т. Сумма этих показателей умножается на 75%. Получаем нагрузку на прицеп 18,75 т. Возьмем за основу массу тягача (М1) 7 т. Теперь можно рассчитать нагрузку на каждую ось тягача. Например, допустим что в автомобиле три оси. Таким образом, 18,75 т общего веса нужно разделить на количество осей (3). Получаем 6,25 т, которые приходятся на каждую ось прицепа. Затем нужно вычислить нагрузку на ось тягача. Она составляет 25% от массы прицепа и тягача. Получаем следующую формулу: (М2+М3)х0,25+М1. На нашем примере это будет выглядеть следующим образом: (10+15)х0,25+7=13,25 т. Далее нужно установить, какая масса давит на задние оси. На них распространяется 7% общей массы от общей нагрузки, то есть 13,25х0,75:2=4,97 т. После этого рассчитываем нагрузку на переднюю ось: 13,25-4,97х2=3,31 т. В нашей ситуации итоговый результат будет следующим: Нагрузка на переднюю ось – 3,31 т. Нагрузка на каждую заднюю ось – 4,97 т. Что нужно для подсчета нагрузки Чтобы установить нагрузки, необходимы следующие показатели: масса тягача; масса полуприцепа; масса груза. Формируем нагрузку на оси полуприцепа Начиная эти расчеты, нужно знать, каким образом распределяется вес по всем осям автомобиля. На передние оси распространяется лишь четверть (25%) массы всей фуры. Это происходит потому, что указанные оси держат массу тягача и передней части полуприцепа. Оставшийся вес составляет три четверти (75%) и приходится на задние оси. Именно они фиксируют загруженность прицепа.\\" Структурируй текст задачи, разбей его на понятные абзац и в конце каждого абзац напиши, что нужно сделать по его смыслу.

Текст задачи: \\"Масса без нагрузки SCANIA R440LA4X2MEB составляет 8209 килограмм. Этот автомобиль, который состоит из 2 осей, с прицепом из 3 дополнительных осей вез на себе около металлические трубы. Был произведён замер, который показал, что общий вес автомобиля с прицепом и трубами составил 33897 кг. При этом же был сделан замер нагрузки на каждую ось, который показал, что у оси 1 вес — 7256 кг, оси 2 — 11987 кг, оси 3 — 4506 кг, оси 4 — 4274 кг, оси 5 — 4086 кг. Как такое могло получиться? Представь свои теоретические размышления о том, почему измерения могли быть с ошибками Обоснуй, что в измерениях, которая показала вес оси №2 11987 кг, есть ошибки и поэтому вес оси №2 не мог быть равен 11987 кг. Докажи, что таких измерений не могло быть. Обоснуй, почему измерение нагрузки на ось №2 в 11987 кг противоречит разрешённым значениям и не соответствует ожидаемым результатам. Учти, что груз (трубы) были распределены равномерно на 2, 3, 4 и 5 оси. Первая ось трубы не несёт на себе. Также учти, что на первые 2 оси распределяется вес самого автомобиля без прицепа. Напоминаю, что вес автомобиля равен 8209 кг. и на первую ось нагрузка составила 7256 кг. Для сведения: разрешённая нагрузка на ось 1 - 9 тонн, ось 2 - 10 тонн, ось 3, 4, 5 - 7 тонн. Напоминаю, что всего у нас есть 5 осей — 2 первые оси самого автомобиля и 3 оси прицепа. Разрешённые значения не должно участвовать в вычислениях. Они нужны только, чтобы понять, было ли превышение или нет. Напиши подробное заключения эксперта с расчётами и формулами. Твоё объяснение должно выдерживать критерий достоверности.

Аллергия на арахис считается одной из самых распространённых пищевых аллергий и может вызывать серьёзные или даже смертельные реакции. Когда человек с аллергией на арахис употребляет продукты, содержащие арахис, его иммунная система ошибочно идентифицирует белки арахиса как вредные вещества. В ответ на это тело высвобождает антитела класса иммуноглобулин Е (IgE), чтобы бороться с этими воспринимаемыми угрозами. При повторном контакте с тем же аллергеном антитела IgE активируют мастоциты (особые клетки иммунной системы), которые начинают выделять гистамин и другие вещества, вызывающие симптомы аллергии. Гистамин и другие химические вещества могут вызвать такие симптомы, как зуд, отек, затруднение дыхания, низкое кровяное давление, учащённое сердцебиение и в крайних случаях анафилактический шок. Анафилаксия – это быстро развивающаяся, тяжелая аллергическая реакция, которая влияет на многие части тела одновременно и может быть смертельной без немедленной медицинской помощи. Тяжесть аллергической реакции на арахис может варьироваться от легкой непереносимости до анафилаксии, что делает ее одной из самых опасных пищевых аллергий. На сегодняшний день нет известного лечения аллергии на арахис; ключевая стратегия управления заключается в избегании контакта с арахисом и продуктами, его содержащими. Для людей с высоким риском анафилаксии также рекомендуется всегда носить с собой автоинъекторы эпинефрина (например, EpiPen), который может быстро облегчить симптомы анафилактического шока."},{"prompt":"4.

As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy’s shapes, combined with Glitter’s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms. Scene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell - As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they’re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy’s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art. Gloopy, touched: “I never knew my shapeshifting could bring so much happiness. What an unforgettable experience!” Glitter: “You’ve touched their hearts, Gloopy. Let’s keep spreading joy across the stars.” - They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one’s talents.

As Gloopy headed to the bathroom, Glitter, with her sparkly trail in tow, ventured off on her own. - Lost in the maze-like corridors of the mall, Glitter marveled at the variety of shops and alien species bustling about. Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight – a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself. Alien: “Infinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‘infinite, forever, never ending’?” Alien (with a hiss): “Ah, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy’s Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion. Alien Child: “Help us, friendly blob! We can’t find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.” Gloopy: “Don’t worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let’s stick together and find a way out.” Scene 3: A Uniting Force - Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy’s malleable form and the children’s keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks. - Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter’s sparkling trail as a guiding light. - Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite. Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. \'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign! Stay toony, and let’s look forward to positive news about our favorite show’s return!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give \'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.\' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns.

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new. Each show brings something different to the lineup, so let’s keep an open mind. Who knows? We might just find a new favorite among these newcomers! Write a tweet in late July where WOQ is the 2nd most popular show, and state what 1 is 🌟 Incredible news, #ToonFans! 📊 “World of Quest” has risen to become the 2nd most popular show on Kids’ WB this July, trailing right behind the unstoppable “Code Lyoko” at #1! 🎮🗺️ Talk about an adventure-packed summer!

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up.

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra! Extra!/The Magic Trick/Treasure Hunt/The Forgotten Memory (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:00 Ultimate Muscle: Making The Cut (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:30 Code Lyoko: Guided Missile - 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown: Finding Omi - 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: The Barren Planet of Shadows/Lost in Gloopiter - 10:00 Sonic X: Satellite Swindle (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya: Un-Reality TV (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 11:00 Johnny Test: Johnny To The Centre of the Earth/Phat Johnny - 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man: Why I Hate Gym Forum Thread Title: “The Shift to CW4KIDS.tv - Observing Website Updates & Pokémon Episode Airings” User1: WebWizKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:47 AM Have you all checked out cw4kids.com lately? Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn\'t confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn\'t World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn\'t premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in!

User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu\'s Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads!

User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history.

Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Write a forum convo on December 30 where the schedule is the same on Jan 6, but a user says to not be fooled, because GoGoRiki is coming in a few weeks, Also another user asks the mod if he\'s working for Warner or 4Kids, because it seems apparent that Warner still have some form of control over the block for now","completion":"Forum Thread Title: “Kids\' WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids\' WB isn\'t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don\'t you think? However, don\'t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so...familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can\'t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I\'m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I\'m curious how they\'ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids\' WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you\'ll start to see more of 4Kids\' influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it\'s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter","completion":"Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard \\"Pokémon\\" and \\"Sonic X\\" are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I\'m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty.

User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 1:30 PM That clip was definitely a tease.

User6: AnimationAficionado Posted on December 30, 2023, at 1:45 PM The question now is – will this potential new series or feature be something that aligns more closely with the classic Kids’ WB vibe or something that propels us into the new CW4Kids vision? Either way, that split-second clip was a smart move; it’s got everyone buzzing. User7: ToonTalker Posted on December 30, 2023, at 2:00 PM Agreed on all points! It could be anything from a brand new show, a major crossover event, or even a revamp of a classic that we all know and love.

Consisten en una colección de imágenes, texturas, colores, tipografías, y a veces muestras de objetos, que juntos crean una representación visual del tono, estilo o sensación que se quiere alcanzar. El propósito de un moodboard es comunicar visualmente la dirección estética de un proyecto antes de empezar a trabajar en los elementos específicos del diseño. Permite a los diseñadores presentar sus ideas a los clientes o al equipo de trabajo de una forma comprensible y visualmente atractiva, facilitando el diálogo y asegurando que todos los involucrados compartan una visión común del proyecto. Los moodboards pueden ser tanto físicos como digitales. Los físicos pueden incluir recortes de revistas, telas, pinturas, o cualquier otro material que pueda pegarse en un tablero. Los digitales, por otro lado, se suelen elaborar con software específico de diseño o aplicaciones en línea, permitiendo integrar imágenes de internet, esquemas de color, y demás recursos digitales. La elaboración de un moodboard es un proceso creativo que requiere de una búsqueda amplia de referencias y de una selección cuidadosa de elementos que representen fielmente la visión del proyecto.

I think you\'ll find it quite... interesting.\\" Jake laughed in disbelief. \\"Hypnosis? You think you can hypnotize me? You\'re a joke, Derek.\\" But Derek didn\'t falter. He swung the watch back and forth in front of Jake\'s eyes, murmuring a calming mantra. Jake\'s sneer faded into a confused expression, his eyes beginning to glaze over. \\"Relax, Jake. Just relax and listen to my voice,\\" Derek said softly. \\"You are feeling sleepy, very sleepy. And when you wake up, you will have a tail. A big, fluffy wolf tail.\\" Jake\'s eyes fluttered closed, and when he opened them again, he shook his head in confusion. \\"What... what just happened?\\" Derek grinned. \\"Look behind you, Jake.\\" Jake turned and yelped in surprise as he saw a huge, furry tail wagging behind him. He reached behind himself and felt the soft fur, his eyes widening in shock. \\"I... I have a tail! How is this possible?\\" Derek chuckled. \\"You were born with it, Jake. You\'ve always had a tail. It\'s just taken you this long to realize it.\\" Jake looked down at his new appendage in awe, running his hands over the furry surface. \\"This is insane! How did you do this, Derek?\\" Derek shrugged. \\"Just a little hypnosis. But don\'t worry, Jake. You\'ll get used to it. Just embrace your wolf side.\\" Jake laughed nervously, still staring at the tail in disbelief. \\"I can\'t believe this. I\'ve always felt a connection to wolves, but I never thought... I never thought it would be like this.\\" Derek smiled, feeling a sense of satisfaction. He had finally turned the tables on his bully, giving him a taste of his own medicine in a truly unique way. And as Jake continued to marvel at his new tail, Derek knew that he had the power to stand up for himself, even in the face of someone like Jake. And as the summer sun beat down on the alley, Derek felt a newfound sense of confidence, knowing that he had the ability to change his own destiny."},{"prompt":"введение в курсовой работе на тему : \\"Юридические факты в гражданском праве\\" 1. актуальность выбранной темы. 2. классификация юридических фактов. 3. цель работы. 4. задачи. 5. объект и субъект. 6. предмет курсовой работы.","completion":"Введение в курсовую работу на тему: \\"Юридические факты в гражданском праве\\" 1. Актуальность выбранной темы Изучение юридических фактов в контексте гражданского права имеет ключевое значение для понимания механизмов регулирования общественных отношений в данной области. Юридические факты являются основанием для возникновения, изменения или прекращения гражданских прав и обязанностей, что делает их изучение необходимым для обеспечения правовой определенности и защиты субъективных прав. В современных условиях, когда правовая система и ее инструментарий постоянно эволюционируют, а значимость информационно-цифровых технологий в правовой сфере увеличивается, актуальность данной темы только усиливается. 2. Классификация юридических фактов Юридические факты подразделяются на две основные группы: юридические события и юридические действия. Юридические события – это факты, которые происходят независимо от воли человека (например, смерть, стихийное бедствие). Юридические действия, напротив, предполагают волевое управление субъектами права (например, заключение договора, завещание). Каждая из этих групп имеет свои подкатегории и особенности, которые необходимо детально рассмотреть для полного понимания темы. 3. Цель работы Целью данной курсовой работы является всесторонний анализ юридических фактов в системе гражданского права, определение их роли и значения в формировании и регулировании гражданско-правовых отношений. 4. Задачи Для достижения поставленной цели в работе предусмотрено выполнение следующих задач: - Исследовать теоретические основы понятия юридических фактов в гражданском праве. - Проанализировать классификацию юридических фактов и их характерные особенности. - Рассмотреть механизмы воздействия юридических фактов на возникновение, изменение и прекращение гражданских правоотношений. - Выявить проблемные аспекты и перспективы развития законодательства и судебной практики в части юридических фактов. 5. Объект и субъект Объектом исследования в данной курсовой работе являются юридические факты в гражданском праве. Субъектами исследования выступают участники гражданских правоотношений - физические и юридические лица, составляющие основу для анализа регулятивной функции юридических фактов. 6. Предмет курсовой работы Предметом курсовой работы является анализ нормативно-правовой базы, доктринальных исследований в области юридических фактов, а также изучение судебной практики по рассматриваемым вопросам. Этот анализ поможет выделить ключевые аспекты темы, выявить проблемные зоны и обозначить направления дальнейших исследований."},{"prompt":"подробнее актуальность темы","completion":"Актуальность темы \\"Юридические факты в гражданском праве\\" обусловлена несколькими ключевыми аспектами, которые имеют важное значение как для теории права, так и для правоприменительной практики. 1. Основа гражданского правоотношения: Юридические факты являются основой для возникновения, изменения и прекращения гражданских правоотношений. Без понимания юридических фактов невозможно полноценно анализировать и применять нормы гражданского права, поскольку именно они определяют моменты начала и окончания юридически значимых ситуаций. 2. Сложность и многообразие: Современное гражданское право становится всё более сложным и разнообразным, что требует детального изучения различных видов юридических фактов и их особенностей. Появление новых типов отношений, например, в сфере цифровых технологий, навязывает необходимость адаптации и развития понятийного аппарата и теории юридических фактов. 3. Практическая значимость: Понимание природы и классификации юридических фактов имеет прямое практическое значение для юристов, судей, нотариусов и других участников правоприменительной деятельности. От правильности их определения и толкования зависят исходы судебных дел, законность сделок, защита прав и законных интересов граждан и организаций. 4. Правовая определенность и прогнозируемость: Изучение юридических фактов способствует углубленному пониманию механизмов правового регулирования и повышению правовой определенности. Это, в свою очередь, помогает субъектам правоотношений лучше ориентироваться в своих правах и обязанностях, а также более эффективно защищать свои интересы. 5. Развитие законодательства и судебной практики: Анализ юридических фактов способствует выявлению проблемных мест в законодательстве и практике его применения, предлагает пути их разрешения, что способствует совершенствованию правовой системы в целом. Таким образом, актуальность изучения данной темы обосновывается не только теоретическим интересом к основам гражданского права, но и практической необходимостью повышения эффективности правоприменения и защиты прав с учетом меняющихся условий социально-экономического развития общества."},{"prompt":"Liste todos os verbos que aceitam a preposição \\"em\\"","completion":"Listar todos os verbos que podem ser seguidos pela preposição \\"em\\" é uma tarefa desafiadora, já que o uso de preposições pode variar com o contexto e o significado específico que se deseja transmitir.

Aqui está uma organização lógica em grupos de verbos diretos e indiretos, descrevendo a ideia do verbo \\"visar\\" em cada um deles: Verbos Diretos: 1. Mirar: O verbo \\"visar\\" pode significar \\"apontar ou direcionar para um alvo ou objetivo específico\\". Por exemplo: \\"O atirador visou a mira para acertar o alvo\\". 2. Focar: \\"Visar\\" também pode ser usado no sentido de \\"concentrar a atenção ou esforços em algo específico\\". Por exemplo: \\"A empresa visa aumentar sua participação no mercado\\". 3. Pretender: Em alguns contextos, \\"visar\\" pode significar \\"ter a intenção ou pretensão de alcançar algo\\". Por exemplo: \\"O estudante visa obter boas notas para entrar na universidade desejada\\". Verbos Indiretos: 1. Objetivar: O verbo \\"visar\\" pode ser usado como um verbo indireto, significando \\"ter como objetivo ou finalidade\\". Por exemplo: \\"O projeto visa a melhorar a qualidade de vida da população local\\". 2. Almejar: \\"Visar\\" também pode ser usado no sentido de \\"aspirar ou ter como meta algo\\". Por exemplo: \\"O atleta visa conquistar a medalha de ouro nos próximos Jogos Olímpicos\\". 3. Buscar: Em alguns casos, \\"visar\\" pode ser empregado como um verbo indireto, significando \\"procurar alcançar ou obter algo\\". Por exemplo: \\"A política ambiental visa reduzir as emissões de gases poluentes\\".","completion":"O texto fornece uma explicação sobre o uso do verbo \\"visar\\", destacando como ele pode ser empregado tanto de maneira direta quanto indireta, dependendo do sentido que se quer transmitir. Contudo, a categorização em \\"verbos diretos\\" e \\"verbos indiretos\\", assim como as descrições associadas a cada grupo, podem ser um pouco confusas, uma vez que elas parecem se referir mais aos significados diferentes do verbo \\"visar\\" do que a uma classificação de outros verbos em si. Aqui estão as correções e esclarecimentos adequados para melhorar o entendimento: --- O verbo \\"visar\\" pode ser usado tanto como um verbo transitivo direto quanto como um verbo transitivo indireto, dependendo do contexto em que é empregado. A seguir, uma descrição clara para compreender os dois principais usos do verbo \\"visar\\": **Significados de \\"Visar\\" como verbo transitivo direto:** 1. **Mirar / Apontar:** O verbo \\"visar\\" tem o sentido de \\"apontar ou direcionar para um alvo ou objetivo específico\\". Por exemplo: \\"O atirador visou o alvo cuidadosamente antes de disparar\\". 2. **Assinar / Carimbar:** Em um contexto mais formal ou burocrático, \\"visar\\" pode significar \\"dar visto em; assinalar com visto\\", como numa verificação documental. Exemplo: \\"O funcionário visou os documentos necessários\\". **Significados de \\"Visar\\" como verbo transitivo indireto (requerendo a preposição \'a\'):** 1. **Ter como objetivo / Almejar:** Quando acompanhado pela preposição \\"a\\", \\"visar\\" adquire o sentido de \\"ter como objetivo ou finalidade\\". Por exemplo: \\"O projeto visa a melhorar a qualidade de vida da população local\\". 2. **Aspirar algo / Ter em vista:** Expressa a intenção ou um desejo de alcançar determinado objetivo. Exemplo: \\"Os novos empreendedores visam a uma posição de destaque no mercado\\". Correção nos exemplos fornecidos para alinhar com essas definições: - \\"A empresa visa aumentar sua participação no mercado\\" seria mais corretamente interpretado como a empresa tendo o objetivo (transitivo indireto) de aumentar sua participação, recomendando a preposição \\"a\\", ficando: \\"A empresa visa a aumentar sua participação no mercado\\". - Onde está \\"O estudante visa obter boas notas...\\", o correto seria \\"O estudante visa a obter boas notas...\\", marcando a intenção do estudante (transito indireto). Esta correção visa (transitivo indireto) a clarificar o uso variado do verbo \\"visar\\", seja como verbo transitivo direto ou indireto, dependendo do contexto e da preposição (ou ausência dela) utilizada."},{"prompt":"regência do verbo almejar","completion":"O verbo \\"almejar\\" tem sua regência tradicionalmente como transitivo direto, ou seja, não requer o uso de preposição para ligar-se ao seu complemento. Isso significa que, quando se usa \\"almejar\\" em uma frase, o objeto que se deseja alcançar é colocado diretamente após o verbo, sem a interposição de uma preposição. Ele é usado para expressar o desejo intenso por algo, aspirar, ansiar por ou ter como objetivo. Vejamos alguns exemplos para clarificar: 1. Eles almejam o sucesso profissional. 2. O atleta almeja a medalha de ouro. 3. Todos nós almejamos a paz mundial. 4. A empresa almeja expandir suas operações para o exterior. Contudo, vale observar que a língua é dinâmica, e o uso pode variar dependendo do contexto e da preferência do falante. Em algumas construções menos comuns ou em contextos específicos, pode aparecer uma preposição seguida de um infinitivo, embora isso não seja a forma padrão de sua regência. Essa variabilidade sublinha a importância de se considerar o contexto ao empregar verbos com regências múltiplas ou variáveis. Portanto, para usos normativos e padrões, lembre-se de que \\"almejar\\" é um verbo transitivo direto, que liga-se diretamente ao seu objeto sem a necessidade de preposição."},{"prompt":"gere 5 exercícios de nível superior sobre regência verbal","completion":"A regência verbal trata da relação gramatical entre verbos e seus complementos, sejam eles diretos (sem preposição) ou indiretos (com preposição), além do uso de pronomes adequados.

Nessa compra, ALfredo economizou?","completion":"Para encontrar o valor que Alfredo economizou na compra do celular, precisamos primeiro determinar o preço original do celular antes do desconto. Podemos fazer isso usando a seguinte equação, onde (P) representa o preço original e (D) o desconto aplicado: [P - (P times D) = text{Preço Pago}] Sabemos que o desconto aplicado foi de 15% (ou (D = 0,15)) e que o preço pago após o desconto foi de R 1.360,00. Substituindo esses valores na equação, temos: [P - (P times 0,15) = 1.360] [P times (1 - 0,15) = 1.360] [P times 0,85 = 1.360] Dividindo ambos os lados da equação por 0,85, obtemos: [P = frac{1.360}{0,85}] [P = 1.600] Portanto, o preço original do celular era R 1.600,00. Agora, para descobrir quanto Alfredo economizou, subtraímos o preço que ele pagou do preço original: [Economia = text{Preço Original} - text{Preço Pago}] [Economia = 1.600 - 1.360] [Economia = 240] Logo, Alfredo economizou R 240,00 na compra do celular com o desconto de 15%."},{"prompt":"maria recebeu certo valor em moeda corrente.

Vamos denominar esse valor inicial de (V). 1. **Ela depositou 25% na poupança**: Isso significa que ela manteve (75%) do valor inicial, pois (100% - 25% = 75%). Em termos matemáticos, isso se traduz em (0,75V). 2. **Gastou a terça parte do restante em compras**: Então, ela gastou (frac{1}{3}) do que restou após depositar na poupança. Isso indica que ela ficou com (frac{2}{3}) do restante. Se o componente restante antes de gastar era (0,75V), após gastar será [0,75V times frac{2}{3}]. 3. **Sobrou R 1870**: Esta é a quantidade que sobrou depois de depositar na poupança e gastar em compras. Pela informação dada, temos: [0,75V times frac{2}{3} = 1870] Vamos agora encontrar (V): [0,75V times frac{2}{3} = 1870] [0,50V = 1870] [V = frac{1870}{0,50}] [V = 3740] Portanto, o valor inicial que Maria recebeu foi R 3740."},{"prompt":"در مورد ارائه دهنده خدمات اینترنت (ISP): Sindad Netwok Technology Ltd. چه اطلاعاتی داری؟","completion":"متاسفانه تا تاریخ به‌روزرسانی اطلاعات من (آوریل 2023)، اطلاعات مشخص و معتبری در مورد ارائه دهنده خدمات اینترنت با نام \\"Sindad Network Technology Ltd.\\" در دسترس نیست. این ممکن است به دلیل جدید بودن این شرکت، کمتر شناخته شده بودن آن در سطح بین‌المللی یا احتمالاً وجود اشتباه تایپی در نام آن باشد. به طور کلی، یک ارائه دهنده خدمات اینترنت (ISP) شرکتی است که خدمات دسترسی به اینترنت، میزبانی وب، ایمیل، و سایر خدمات مرتبط با ارتباطات دیجیتال را به فرد یا سازمان‌ها ارائه می‌دهد. اگر در مورد یک ISP خاص تحقیق می‌کنید، به دنبال بررسی‌های کاربران، میزان پوشش خدمات در مناطق مختلف، نوع فناوری‌هایی که ارائه می‌دهند (مانند ADSL, Fiber Optic, Satellite, etc.) و پشتیبانی مشتری باشید. برای دریافت اطلاعات دقیق در مورد \\"Sindad Network Technology Ltd.\\"، توصیه می‌شود که به منابع محلی یا وبسایت رسمی این شرکت مراجعه کنید یا جستجوهای دقیق‌تری با استفاده از اطلاعات به‌روز یا تصحیح شده انجام دهید."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"coffee and flower\\"","completion":"coffee and flower"},{"prompt":"Crie uma ótima e bem explicado e persuasivas reflexão com muita eloquência sobre provérbio 23 com muita fé, e motivação, baseando no estilo de algum grande pregador evangélico de sua escolha comece fazendo três ótimos titulo muito curtos, depois crie uma introdução que atraia as pessoas a ficar assistindo o vídeo, agora desenvolva a reflexão com tudo que pedi no começo, se preferir pode dividir em partes e depois desenvolve parte por parte ,faça uma ótima e completa reflexão, depois faca uma bela oração relacionada ao tema com muita empolgação e devoção ,quero fixar que será um vídeo para o youtube.

Nos ensina, primeiramente, sobre a importância de discernir e valorizar o que realmente alimenta nossa alma. \\"Quando te assentares a comer com um governador, atenta bem para o que está diante de ti;\\" - este versículo nos convida a olhar além das aparências e prazeres imediatos que o mundo nos oferece. Nesta era de excessos, somos constantemente tentados a nos saciar com o que é passageiro e superficial. No entanto, a verdadeira nutrição que nossa alma anseia é encontrada na presença de Deus, na Sua Palavra, e no amor que compartilhamos com o próximo. **Parte II: O Valor da Moderação** A vida é cheia de escolhas, e o provérbio segue nos ensinando a escolher com sabedoria. \\"Não ambiciones as suas iguarias, porque são comidas enganosas.\\" Aqui somos advertidos sobre os perigos dos desejos desmedidos. Seja em bens materiais, no poder ou em prazeres efêmeros, a busca excessiva por estes pode nos afastar do que verdadeiramente importa. Moderação e contentamento são palavras-chave nessa jornada. Devemos buscar, portanto, um coração grato e satisfeito nas bênçãos que Deus nos concede diariamente. **Parte III: A Busca por Sabedoria e Direção** Num mundo que muitas vezes valoriza o conhecimento superficial e a rápida ascensão, somos chamados a perseguir uma sabedoria mais profunda. \\"Aplica o teu coração à instrução e os teus ouvidos às palavras do conhecimento.\\" Este é um convite divino para mergulharmos naquilo que nunca passará - a sabedoria que vem de Deus. Ela é a verdadeira chave para uma vida plena, repleta de propósito e direção. **Parte IV: A Força da Fé e da Disciplina** No caminhar com Cristo, aprendemos também sobre a importância da disciplina e do fortalecimento da fé. \\"Não rejeites a disciplina do Senhor, nem te enfades da sua repreensão.\\" A disciplina divina é uma expressão do amor de Deus por nós, direcionando-nos para o caminho da vida eterna. Através da fé, somos capazes de ver além das dificuldades temporais, mantendo nossos olhos fixos na promessa de eternidade com Ele. # Oração: Ó Deus Todo-Poderoso, nós Te agradecemos por Tua palavra de sabedoria e vida. Pedimos que nos ensines a alimentar nossa alma unicamente com o que vem de Ti. Que aprendamos a viver com moderação e gratidão, buscando a sabedoria que só Tu podes nos oferecer. Fortalece nossa fé, Senhor, e nos guie sempre pelo caminho da retidão, disciplina e amor. Que possamos ser luz para aqueles que nos cercam, refletindo Tua glória em todo o nosso viver. Em nome de Jesus, Amém. # Encerramento: Amados, espero que esta reflexão tenha tocado seus corações e renovado suas forças. Que possamos levar estes ensinamentos para nossa vida, transformando cada dia com a sabedoria, fé e amor que vem do Pai.

Additionally, there are issues with misuse of the type `Data` in `fileallocation.c`. Let\'s address these problems step by step to correct the code and get it compiling and running correctly. Firstly, the primary issue in your code comes from the order and way types are declared and used across `fileallocation.c` and `LinkedList.h`. Fix 1: Ensure `Block` is defined before `LinkedList.h` is included. Since `LinkedList.h` uses `Block` as a type for `Data`, you need to define `Block` before including `LinkedList.h`. Thus, place the `Block` struct definition above the `#include \\"LinkedList.h\\"` directive in `fileallocation.c`. Fix 2: Modify `LinkedList.h` to accept generic data by using `void*` or consider integrating the structure definition into `fileallocation.c`. For simplicity, here\'s how you can adjust your `LinkedList.h` to deal with generic data pointers which will allow it to be more flexible. This avoids the immediate error but might require adjustments in how you handle data within the list. LinkedList.h: ```c typedef struct Node { void* data; // Changed from Data d; struct Node* next; } Node; typedef Node* List; ... // Functions declarations remain largely the same but will require adjustments due to the change from Data to void*. ``` Fix 3: Adapt code in `fileallocation.c` to work with the changes made in `LinkedList.h`. When you are using `void*` for data in `LinkedList.h`, you need to adjust how data is inserted into the list and accessed thereafter in `fileallocation.c`. Any operation on `Node`\'s data will now require casting to the appropriate type before usage. For example, the `insertLast` function would look something like this: ```c void insertLast(List head, void* d) { Node* newNode = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node)); newNode->data = d; // Note: d is now a void pointer newNode->next = NULL; Node* tmp = head; while (tmp->next != NULL) { tmp = tmp->next; } tmp->next = newNode; } ``` And when accessing data from a `Node`, you\'ll have to cast it back to the appropriate type, like so: ```c Node* node = search(list, id); Block* blockData = (Block*)node->data; // Assuming you\'re searching for a Block type ``` This approach will require several changes throughout `fileallocation.c` to cast data to and from `void*` appropriately. Given the extent of the changes needed, these fixes offer a conceptual path forward rather than a direct, drop-in solution. The key is to fix the forward declaration issue by properly structuring the code so that all types are defined before they are used, and adapting `LinkedList.h` to handle generic data through `void*` pointers, which then requires casting data types when they are used. This approach introduces some complexity but adds flexibility to your linked list implementation."},{"prompt":"give me full correct code without errors","completion":"Given the issues encountered and the request for a comprehensive solution, I\'ll provide a simplified and corrected version of your code integrating the main ideas but focusing on getting a compilable and logically consistent structure. This solution will address the primary issues in a more straightforward manner than introducing `void*` pointers for generic list handling due to the complexity that generic data handling would add. Instead, we\'ll ensure the `Block` structure is defined before being used by `LinkedList.h` and simplify the usage. # Step 1: Define Structures Properly **fileallocation.c** (partial): ```c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> #include <math.h> #define MAX 100 #define FREE 0 typedef struct Block { int id; unsigned status : 1; struct Block *next_file_blk; } Block; // Ensure LinkedList.h is included after the Block definition. #include \\"LinkedList.h\\" // Further implementations... ``` # Step 2: Adjust LinkedList Implementation **LinkedList.h** (modified for direct integration with `Block` structure): ```c #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> typedef struct Node { Block d; // Directly use Block as this list specifically handles Blocks. struct Node *next; } Node; typedef Node *List; List createEmptyList(); void insertLast(List head, const Block d); Node* search(List head, const int id); // And more function declarations as needed... ``` # Step 3: Simplify the `fileallocation.c` File **fileallocation.c** (continued): Considering the length and complexity of your original code, instead of pasting the entirety of it here, I\'ll note key adjustments below that should be made following the newly defined structures and simplified linked list: 1. Ensure the `init_block` function is defined before including `LinkedList.h` or directly within `fileallocation.c` if it\'s only used there. 2. Use `Block` directly in your list operations. Correct the `insertLast` usage and any other list operations to properly handle `Block` without type mismatches. 3. Adapt the file operations (`contiguous`, `linked`, `indexed`) to correctly work with the adjusted `List` and `Node` structure. 4. Consider removing `extern void init_block(Block *const);` from \\"LinkedList.h\\" if it\'s unnecessarily complicating the code structure, as initialization functionalities are typically handled within the main file or their specific module. # Simplified File Allocation Operations The detailed implementation of functions like `contiguous`, `linked`, and `indexed` in `fileallocation.c` would still follow the logic you\'ve defined but will now work correctly with the list. Since redoing those function implementations in full would be quite extensive and isn\'t the focus of the fix, make sure that when you access or modify `Block` structures within these functions, you are directly working with `Block` instances or pointers and not through a type mismatch. # Conclusion This provided fix focuses on the structural issues in your code related to type definitions and the order of includes. The operations within the file allocation functions would follow the same logic but adapted to the corrected structure. Due to space and focus, detailing every corrected line of your rather extensive original code isn\'t practical here. However, this guide gives a solid foundation on how to correctly organize your code and address the type-related issues you\'ve encountered."},{"prompt":"Переклади англійською: Після відʼїзду із Стретфорда майже нічого невідомо про життєві події Шекспіра.
