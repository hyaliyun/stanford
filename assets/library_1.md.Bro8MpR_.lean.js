Alexander Imperator is a TV series about Alexander the Great, viewed through the medieval perspective of Alexander Romance narratives, making for a deliberately anachronistic tale. It incorporates legendary and mythological elements into Alexander’s tale, including Thalestris, Candice, Nectanebo, the voyage to the bottom of the sea, battles with Gog and Magog, etc. It also features medieval stylistics and elements, with chivalrous knights in plate armor and medieval pikemen and crossbowmen instead of phalanx, just like seen on medieval illustrations. The series also heavily relies on atmosphere and stylistic of 1950s cinematic epic costume romance, with its bright colors, classical theatrical acting, characteristic editing and even musical score reminiscent of Golden Age Hollywood. These heavily romanticized, swashbuckling adventures and romances and stylized elements are often juxtaposed with ventures into ancient and modern philosophy, exploiting mystical tales as basis for though-provoking questions and unusual conflicts and situations. The series doesn't focus just on Alexander, but also on his companians, his mother Olympias and his numerous lovers. Write long and detailed analysis and exploration of this TV series, focusing on choice of style and aesthetics and its deliberate anachronisms.","completion":"Title: Alexander Imperator: A Bold and Anachronistic TV Series Introduction Alexander Imperator is a unique TV series that reinterprets the conventional narratives on the life and exploits of Alexander the Great through the medieval lens of the Alexander Romance. By integrating a blend of legendary, mythological, and anachronistic elements, the series crafts a fantastical world that pivots around the fantastical adventures of its protagonist and his companions. Drenched in the stylistic aesthetics reminiscent of the 1950s cinematic epic costume romance, the series exhibits a rich visual spectacle marked by striking colors, classical theatrical acting, and an evocative musical score. This intricate tapestry of styles and approaches heightens the viewing experience and produces a rare breed of TV show that oscillates between romance, swashbuckling exploits, and philosophical inquiries. Choice of Style and Aesthetics The decision to anchor the series' stylistic approach on the signature features of the 1950s cinematic epic costume romance is a testament to the creators' desire to craft a unique visual and atmospheric experience. By harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood and embracing its characteristic editing, vibrant colors, and dramatic musical score, Alexander Imperator establishes itself as a distinct entry in the historical drama genre. This stylistic choice, motivated by nostalgia and admiration for the classical medium, injects a sense of timelessness into the series that complements the anachronistic nature of the narrative. Deliberate Anachronisms The series' overt utilization of anachronisms fosters an intriguing thematic paradox, as it combines elements belonging to distinct historical periods to fashion a cohesive and fascinating world. By replacing the classical phalanx with chivalrous knights in plate armor and medieval pikemen and crossbowmen, Alexander Imperator highlights the creative liberties taken to reconceptualize the traditional image of Alexander the Great and his entourage. These anachronistic components, particularly visible in the portrayal of clothing, weaponry, and architecture, serve to create an immersive realm in which history and imagination coalesce. In addition, the incorporation of legendary and mythological tales, such as Alexander's encounters with Thalestris, Candice, and Nectanebo, or his voyage to the bottom of the sea, enhances the fantastical undertones that permeate the series. By intertwining these fables into the main storyline and fabricating provocative questions and conflicts based on these narratives, the series transcends the confines of routine historical storytelling and extends into the realm of philosophy and metaphysics. Focus on Characters The series' attention to its ensemble of characters further enriches the narrative and deepens the audience's engagement with the tale. By not solely fixating on Alexander as the central figure, the series allows for the exploration of the intricate relationships shared by the protagonist, his companions (e.g., Hephaestion, Ptolemy, and Cassander), his mother Olympias, and his various lovers. This multifaceted character development unravels the complexities that underpin the characters' motivations and actions, and serves to humanize the legendary figures that populate the world of Alexander Imperator. Conclusion Alexander Imperator is a standout TV series that boldly challenges conventional norms of historical storytelling by embracing a deliberate blend of anachronisms and stylistic aesthetics hailing from the 1950s cinematic epic costume romance. This amalgamation of styles and creative choices results in a riveting spectacle that offers a fresh interpretation of the fascinating figure that is Alexander the Great."},{"prompt":"Who is raj haldua ?","completion":"I am an AI language model and do not have personal information or knowledge about individuals unless they are public figures or celebrities.

The gobo patterns are placed in front of a light source and the light is projected through the pattern, creating a shadow or colored image. Gobo lighting is commonly used in theater productions, concerts, live events, architectural lighting, and other applications where creating unique visual effects and ambiance is desired. The patterns can be custom-made to display different images, shapes, or even logos, allowing for a high degree of flexibility and creativity in lighting design."},{"prompt":"What is gobo lighting, explain in 500-510 words.","completion":"Gobo lighting is a lighting technique that utilizes specialized projectors and patterns to create unique illuminated effects. Gobos themselves are thin, often metal, discs that have stencils or cutouts that can be used to project various images, textures, or patterns. One of the primary benefits of gobo lighting is its versatility, which allows designers to craft an array of visual landscapes and dynamics with a single technology. The gobo projector is the instrument that is used to project the patterns onto a surface. It is made up of a light source, a lens, and a holder for the gobo. The light source is typically a powerful halogen or LED lamp that is directed at the gobo, which is placed in the holder. The lens focuses and projects the light through the gobo, which in turn creates the pattern projection on the surface. Gobo lighting can be used in a range of applications such as theater productions, concerts, live events, architectural lighting, television productions, and more. One of the most popular uses of gobo lighting is in the entertainment industry as it can create dynamic visuals, add atmosphere and enhance the presentation of performers on stage. However, the uses are not limited to these applications as it is also popular in other areas such as retail spaces, restaurants, weddings, and corporate events. It is popular in retail spaces as it can be used to create an ambience, set the mood, and enhance window displays. In restaurants, it is used to create a cozy atmosphere and accentuate the food displays. The flexibility of gobo lighting technology has allowed it to be used in a variety of ways and has become a ubiquitous feature in event spaces. One of the benefits of gobo lighting is the ability to customize the patterns used to project onto surfaces. This customization allows the creation of unique visuals that can reflect the theme of an event, highlight a brand, or simply set the mood for an occasion. To create custom gobos, a designer typically begins with an image, a logo, or a drawing which is then converted into vector art using software such as Adobe Illustrator. From there, the vector art is processed by specialized software that creates a metal or glass gobo with the desired cutouts or patterns. Gobo patterns can also be combined with color filters to further modify the projected image or pattern. The resulting effect can be a rainbow of colors or simply a monochrome limelight. Using multiple projectors at once along with coordinating patterns, can create impressive scenes and landscapes that enhance themes of events. In conclusion, gobo lighting is a versatile and powerful technology that has been widely adopted in the entertainment, hospitality, and event industries. The unique patterns and customizations provided by the technology serve not only as unmatched eye-catchers but also as mood-setters in a broad range of scenarios. The added flexibility and expressiveness allow lighting designers to create an array of custom looks that can enhance and elevate any event."},{"prompt":"Вот мой продукт , у каждого такого продукта есть кнопка “добавить” , я хочу чтобы при нажатии на эту кнопку конкретный товар добавлялся в корзину , саму корзину тоже реализуй , у каждого товра есть стоимость сделай так чтобы в списке также появилась суммарная стоимость всех товаров и кнопка заказать . Вот класс моего продукта и помни что корзина должна работать во фрагменте , так же напиши все необходимое , чтобы вывести корзину на экран при нажатии на другую кнопку (Товары расположены в FirstFragmetn) : package com.example.myapp_2.List_1; public class Product { private String name; private String description; private int imageResource; private float rating; private double price; public Product(String name, String description, int imageResource, float rating, double price) { this.name = name; this.description = description; this.imageResource = imageResource; this.rating = rating; this.price = price; } public Product(String name, String description, int imageResource, double price) { this.name = name; this.description = description; this.imageResource = imageResource; this.rating = 0.0f; this.price = price; } public String getName() { return name; } public String getDescription() { return description; } public int getImageResource() { return imageResource; } public float getRating() { return rating; } public void setRating(float rating) { this.rating = rating; } public double getPrice() { return price; } public void setPrice(double price) { this.price = price; } Для реализации добавления товара в корзину и отображения ее содержимого на экране тебе нужно использовать два фрагмента: один для списка товаров, другой – для корзины. Для начала, создай класс CartItem, который будет представлять товары в корзине: public class CartItem { private Product product; // сам товар private int quantity; // количество public CartItem(Product product, int quantity) { this.product = product; this.quantity = quantity; } public Product getProduct() { return product; } public void setProduct(Product product) { this.product = product; } public int getQuantity() { return quantity; } public void setQuantity(int quantity) { this.quantity = quantity; } public double getTotalPrice() { return product.getPrice() * quantity; } } Теперь создай фрагмент для списка товаров, который будет отображать список товаров и их стоимость, а также кнопки «Добавить» рядом с каждым товаром. При нажатии на кнопку «Добавить» должно происходить добавление товара в корзину. public class ProductsFragment extends Fragment { private List<Product> productList; private RecyclerView recyclerView; private ProductAdapter adapter; @Nullable @Override public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_products, container, false); // Здесь инициализируем список товаров и recyclerView adapter = new ProductAdapter(productList, new OnProductClickListener() { @Override public void onAddToCartClick(Product product) { addToCart(product); } }); // передаём метод добавления товара в корзину recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter); recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(getContext())); return view; } private void addToCart(Product product) { // метод добавления товара в корзину Cart cart = Cart.getInstance(); cart.addItem(product); } } Здесь мы создаём адаптер для списка товаров и передаём ему метод onAddToCartClick, который будет вызываться при нажатии на кнопку «Добавить». Затем в методе addToCart мы получаем объект Cart и вызываем у него метод addItem, который добавляет переданный товар. Далее создай фрагмент для корзины, который будет отображать содержимое корзины и её стоимость, а также кнопку «Оформить заказ». public class CartFragment extends Fragment { private TextView totalPriceTextView; private Button placeOrderButton; private RecyclerView recyclerView; private CartAdapter adapter; private Cart cart; @Nullable @Override public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_cart, container, false); // инициализируем элементы UI и получаем объект Cart из синглтона totalPriceTextView = view.findViewById(R.id.total_price_text_view); placeOrderButton = view.findViewById(R.id.place_order_button); recyclerView = view.findViewById(R.id.cart_recycler_view); cart = Cart.getInstance(); adapter = new CartAdapter(cart.getItems(), new OnCartItemListener() { @Override public void onQuantityChanged(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { cart.updateItem(item, newQuantity); updateTotalPrice(); // обновляем общую стоимость } @Override public void onRemoveButtonClick(CartItem item) { cart.removeItem(item); adapter.setItems(cart.getItems()); updateTotalPrice(); } }); // передаём обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества и удаления товара recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter); recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(getContext())); updateTotalPrice(); placeOrderButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { placeOrder(); } }); // обработчик кнопки оформления заказа return view; } private void placeOrder() { // TODO: здесь должен быть код для оформления заказа } private void updateTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = cart.getTotalPrice(); totalPriceTextView.setText(getString(R.string.cart_total_price, totalPrice)); } } Здесь мы создаем адаптер для корзины, который отображает содержимое и обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества товара и удаления товара из корзины. Метод updateTotalPrice обновляет общую стоимость корзины при изменении количества или удалении товара. Наконец, нужно создать класс Cart, который будет содержать список товаров в корзине и способы их изменения. Также реализуй методы для подсчета общей стоимости товаров в корзине и очистки корзины. public class Cart { private static Cart instance; private List<CartItem> items; private Cart() { items = new ArrayList<>(); } public static Cart getInstance() { if (instance == null) { instance = new Cart(); } return instance; } public void addItem(Product product) { for (CartItem item : items) { if (item.getProduct().equals(product)) { item.setQuantity(item.getQuantity() + 1); return; } } items.add(new CartItem(product, 1)); } public void updateItem(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { if (newQuantity <= 0) { removeItem(item); } else { item.setQuantity(newQuantity); } } public void removeItem(CartItem item) { items.remove(item); } public List<CartItem> getItems() { return items; } public void clear() { items.clear(); } public double getTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = 0; for (CartItem item : items) { totalPrice += item.getTotalPrice(); } return totalPrice; } } Теперь, когда все классы и фрагменты созданы, можем перейти к отображению корзины на экране. Например, можно добавить кнопку «Корзина» на главный экран (MainActivity) и открывать фрагмент CartFragment при ее нажатии. public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); Button cartButton = findViewById(R.id.cart_button); cartButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { showCartFragment(); } }); } private void showCartFragment() { FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager(); FragmentTransaction transaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction(); CartFragment cartFragment = new CartFragment(); transaction.replace(android.R.id.content, cartFragment); transaction.addToBackStack(null); transaction.commit(); } } Здесь мы получаем кнопку из макета и устанавливаем для нее обработчик нажатия. При нажатии вызываем метод showCartFragment, который открывает фрагмент CartFragment. Обрати внимание на то, что транзакцию фрагментов нужно добавить в бэкстек, чтобы пользователь мог вернуться к предыдущему фрагменту. Вот и всё! Теперь у тебя есть рабочая корзина в приложении, а пользователи могут легко добавлять товары в неё и оформлять заказы. Успехов! Добавь весь необходимы xml и укажи что в нем должно быть Конечно, вот xml-разметки для фрагментов и элементов UI: 1. fragment_products.xml - разметка для фрагмента с товарами: <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView android:id=“@+id/products_recycler_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“match_parent” /> Здесь мы используем RecyclerView для отображения списка товаров. 2. item_product.xml - элемент списка товаров: <LinearLayout android:orientation=“horizontal” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:padding=“16dp”> <ImageView android:id=“@+id/product_image_view” android:layout_width=“80dp” android:layout_height=“80dp” android:src=“@drawable/default_product_image”/> <LinearLayout android:orientation=“vertical” android:layout_width=“0dp” android:layout_weight=“1” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:paddingHorizontal=“16dp”> <TextView android:id=“@+id/product_name_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“16sp” android:textStyle=“bold” android:text=“Product Name”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/product_description_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:text=“Product Description”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/product_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorAccent” android:text=“Price: 9.99”/> <RatingBar android:id=“@+id/product_rating_bar” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:numStars=“5” android:rating=“0.0” android:stepSize=“0.5”/> </LinearLayout> <Button android:id=“@+id/add_to_cart_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“Add to Cart”/> </LinearLayout> Здесь мы используем LinearLayout для отображения информации о товаре (название, описание, стоимость и рейтинг) и кнопку для добавления товара в корзину. 3. fragment_cart.xml - разметка для фрагмента с корзиной: <TextView android:id=“@+id/total_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“20sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorAccent” android:text=“Total price: 0.00” android:padding=“16dp”/> <Button android:id=“@+id/place_order_button” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“Place Order” android:layout_margin=“16dp”/> <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView android:id=“@+id/cart_recycler_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“match_parent” android:padding=“16dp” /> Здесь мы отображаем общую стоимость корзины, кнопку для оформления заказа и список товаров в корзине с помощью RecyclerView. 4. item_cart.xml - элемент списка товаров в корзине: <LinearLayout android:orientation=“horizontal” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:padding=“16dp”> <ImageView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_image_view” android:layout_width=“80dp” android:layout_height=“80dp” android:src=“@drawable/default_product_image”/> <LinearLayout android:orientation=“vertical” android:layout_width=“0dp” android:layout_weight=“1” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:paddingHorizontal=“16dp”> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_name_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“16sp” android:textStyle=“bold” android:text=“Product Name”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorAccent” android:text=“Price: 9.99”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_total_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorPrimary” android:text=“Total price: 9.99”/> <LinearLayout android:orientation=“horizontal” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content”> <Button android:id=“@+id/cart_item_decrease_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“-”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_quantity_text_view” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:paddingHorizontal=“8dp” android:text=“1”/> <Button android:id=“@+id/cart_item_increase_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“+”/> </LinearLayout> </LinearLayout> <Button android:id=“@+id/cart_item_remove_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“Remove”/> </LinearLayout> Здесь мы отображаем информацию о товаре в корзине, его стоимость и обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества и удаления товара.

В файле colors.xml должна быть определена палитра цветов, например: <?xml version=“1.0” encoding=“utf-8”?> <resources> <color name=“colorPrimary”>#3F51B5</color> <color name=“colorPrimaryDark”>#303F9F</color> <color name=“colorAccent”>#FF4081</color> </resources> Здесь определены три цвета: colorPrimary, colorPrimaryDark и colorAccent. Если вы используете данную палитру, то ссылка на colorAccent должна функционировать. Если у вас другая палитра цветов, то необходимо использовать свой цвет, определенный в вашем файле colors.xml. Надеюсь, это помогло вам решить ошибку. Ты не реализовал CartAdapter Правильно, в сообщении я не реализовал класс CartAdapter. Вот, как он должен выглядеть: public class CartAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<CartAdapter.CartItemViewHolder> { private List<CartItem> items; private OnCartItemListener listener; public CartAdapter(List<CartItem> items, OnCartItemListener listener) { this.items = items; this.listener = listener; } @NonNull","completion":"@Override public CartItemViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(@NonNull ViewGroup parent, int viewType) { View view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_cart, parent, false); return new CartItemViewHolder(view); } @Override public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull CartItemViewHolder holder, int position) { CartItem item = items.get(position); holder.bind(item, listener); } @Override public int getItemCount() { return items.size(); } public void setItems(List<CartItem> items) { this.items = items; notifyDataSetChanged(); } public class CartItemViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder { private ImageView productImageView; private TextView productNameTextView; private TextView productPriceTextView; private TextView productTotalPriceTextView; private TextView productQuantityTextView; private Button decreaseButton; private Button increaseButton; private Button removeButton; private int quantity; public CartItemViewHolder(@NonNull View itemView) { super(itemView); productImageView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.cart_item_image_view); productNameTextView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.cart_item_name_text_view);"},{"prompt":"Write a paragraph about how good cookie clicker is","completion":"As an AI language model, I do not have preferences or opinions of my own.

Для начала, создай класс CartItem, который будет представлять товары в корзине: public class CartItem { private Product product; // сам товар private int quantity; // количество public CartItem(Product product, int quantity) { this.product = product; this.quantity = quantity; } public Product getProduct() { return product; } public void setProduct(Product product) { this.product = product; } public int getQuantity() { return quantity; } public void setQuantity(int quantity) { this.quantity = quantity; } public double getTotalPrice() { return product.getPrice() * quantity; } } Теперь создай фрагмент для списка товаров, который будет отображать список товаров и их стоимость, а также кнопки «Добавить» рядом с каждым товаром. При нажатии на кнопку «Добавить» должно происходить добавление товара в корзину. public class ProductsFragment extends Fragment { private List<Product> productList; private RecyclerView recyclerView; private ProductAdapter adapter; @Nullable @Override public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_products, container, false); // Здесь инициализируем список товаров и recyclerView adapter = new ProductAdapter(productList, new OnProductClickListener() { @Override public void onAddToCartClick(Product product) { addToCart(product); } }); // передаём метод добавления товара в корзину recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter); recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(getContext())); return view; } private void addToCart(Product product) { // метод добавления товара в корзину Cart cart = Cart.getInstance(); cart.addItem(product); } } Здесь мы создаём адаптер для списка товаров и передаём ему метод onAddToCartClick, который будет вызываться при нажатии на кнопку «Добавить». Затем в методе addToCart мы получаем объект Cart и вызываем у него метод addItem, который добавляет переданный товар. Далее создай фрагмент для корзины, который будет отображать содержимое корзины и её стоимость, а также кнопку «Оформить заказ». public class CartFragment extends Fragment { private TextView totalPriceTextView; private Button placeOrderButton; private RecyclerView recyclerView; private CartAdapter adapter; private Cart cart; @Nullable @Override public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_cart, container, false); // инициализируем элементы UI и получаем объект Cart из синглтона totalPriceTextView = view.findViewById(R.id.total_price_text_view); placeOrderButton = view.findViewById(R.id.place_order_button); recyclerView = view.findViewById(R.id.cart_recycler_view); cart = Cart.getInstance(); adapter = new CartAdapter(cart.getItems(), new OnCartItemListener() { @Override public void onQuantityChanged(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { cart.updateItem(item, newQuantity); updateTotalPrice(); // обновляем общую стоимость } @Override public void onRemoveButtonClick(CartItem item) { cart.removeItem(item); adapter.setItems(cart.getItems()); updateTotalPrice(); } }); // передаём обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества и удаления товара recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter); recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(getContext())); updateTotalPrice(); placeOrderButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { placeOrder(); } }); // обработчик кнопки оформления заказа return view; } private void placeOrder() { // TODO: здесь должен быть код для оформления заказа } private void updateTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = cart.getTotalPrice(); totalPriceTextView.setText(getString(R.string.cart_total_price, totalPrice)); } } Здесь мы создаем адаптер для корзины, который отображает содержимое и обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества товара и удаления товара из корзины. Метод updateTotalPrice обновляет общую стоимость корзины при изменении количества или удалении товара. Наконец, нужно создать класс Cart, который будет содержать список товаров в корзине и способы их изменения. Также реализуй методы для подсчета общей стоимости товаров в корзине и очистки корзины. public class Cart { private static Cart instance; private List<CartItem> items; private Cart() { items = new ArrayList<>(); } public static Cart getInstance() { if (instance == null) { instance = new Cart(); } return instance; } public void addItem(Product product) { for (CartItem item : items) { if (item.getProduct().equals(product)) { item.setQuantity(item.getQuantity() + 1); return; } } items.add(new CartItem(product, 1)); } public void updateItem(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { if (newQuantity <= 0) { removeItem(item); } else { item.setQuantity(newQuantity); } } public void removeItem(CartItem item) { items.remove(item); } public List<CartItem> getItems() { return items; } public void clear() { items.clear(); } public double getTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = 0; for (CartItem item : items) { totalPrice += item.getTotalPrice(); } return totalPrice; } } Теперь, когда все классы и фрагменты созданы, можем перейти к отображению корзины на экране. Например, можно добавить кнопку «Корзина» на главный экран (MainActivity) и открывать фрагмент CartFragment при ее нажатии. public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); Button cartButton = findViewById(R.id.cart_button); cartButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { showCartFragment(); } }); } private void showCartFragment() { FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager(); FragmentTransaction transaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction(); CartFragment cartFragment = new CartFragment(); transaction.replace(android.R.id.content, cartFragment); transaction.addToBackStack(null); transaction.commit(); } } Здесь мы получаем кнопку из макета и устанавливаем для нее обработчик нажатия. При нажатии вызываем метод showCartFragment, который открывает фрагмент CartFragment. Обрати внимание на то, что транзакцию фрагментов нужно добавить в бэкстек, чтобы пользователь мог вернуться к предыдущему фрагменту. Вот и всё! Теперь у тебя есть рабочая корзина в приложении, а пользователи могут легко добавлять товары в неё и оформлять заказы. Успехов! Добавь весь необходимы xml и укажи что в нем должно быть Конечно, вот xml-разметки для фрагментов и элементов UI: 1. fragment_products.xml - разметка для фрагмента с товарами: <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView android:id=“@+id/products_recycler_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“match_parent” /> Здесь мы используем RecyclerView для отображения списка товаров. 2. item_product.xml - элемент списка товаров: <LinearLayout android:orientation=“horizontal” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:padding=“16dp”> <ImageView android:id=“@+id/product_image_view” android:layout_width=“80dp” android:layout_height=“80dp” android:src=“@drawable/default_product_image”/> <LinearLayout android:orientation=“vertical” android:layout_width=“0dp” android:layout_weight=“1” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:paddingHorizontal=“16dp”> <TextView android:id=“@+id/product_name_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“16sp” android:textStyle=“bold” android:text=“Product Name”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/product_description_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:text=“Product Description”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/product_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorAccent” android:text=“Price: 9.99”/> <RatingBar android:id=“@+id/product_rating_bar” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:numStars=“5” android:rating=“0.0” android:stepSize=“0.5”/> </LinearLayout> <Button android:id=“@+id/add_to_cart_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“Add to Cart”/> </LinearLayout> Здесь мы используем LinearLayout для отображения информации о товаре (название, описание, стоимость и рейтинг) и кнопку для добавления товара в корзину. 3. fragment_cart.xml - разметка для фрагмента с корзиной: <TextView android:id=“@+id/total_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“20sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorAccent” android:text=“Total price: 0.00” android:padding=“16dp”/> <Button android:id=“@+id/place_order_button” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“Place Order” android:layout_margin=“16dp”/> <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView android:id=“@+id/cart_recycler_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“match_parent” android:padding=“16dp” /> Здесь мы отображаем общую стоимость корзины, кнопку для оформления заказа и список товаров в корзине с помощью RecyclerView. 4. item_cart.xml - элемент списка товаров в корзине: <LinearLayout android:orientation=“horizontal” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:padding=“16dp”> <ImageView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_image_view” android:layout_width=“80dp” android:layout_height=“80dp” android:src=“@drawable/default_product_image”/> <LinearLayout android:orientation=“vertical” android:layout_width=“0dp” android:layout_weight=“1” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:paddingHorizontal=“16dp”> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_name_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“16sp” android:textStyle=“bold” android:text=“Product Name”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorAccent” android:text=“Price: 9.99”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_total_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorPrimary” android:text=“Total price: 9.99”/> <LinearLayout android:orientation=“horizontal” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content”> <Button android:id=“@+id/cart_item_decrease_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“-”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_quantity_text_view” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:paddingHorizontal=“8dp” android:text=“1”/> <Button android:id=“@+id/cart_item_increase_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“+”/> </LinearLayout> </LinearLayout> <Button android:id=“@+id/cart_item_remove_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“Remove”/> </LinearLayout> Здесь мы отображаем информацию о товаре в корзине, его стоимость и обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества и удаления товара.

Kernel module : Les drivers Linux sont des modules du noyau Linux, et sont donc chargés dans le noyau de manière dynamique. Les drivers Linux sont typiquement écrits en langage C. 2. Registres : Il est courant de trouver dans un driver Linux une zone d'enregistrement (ou registration), qui contient des informations sur les dispositifs qu'il gère ainsi que les fonctions de gestion de ces dispositifs. Cette zone est utilisée pour initialiser le driver, ou le faire correspondre avec certains dispositifs. 3. Fonctions de gestion de périphériques : Les drivers Linux fournissent des fonctions pour gérer les périphériques qu'ils contrôlent, telles que l'initialisation, la configuration et la lecture/écriture de données sur le périphérique. 4. Point d'accès : Les drivers Linux fournissent souvent un point d'accès (comme une fonction API) pour les applications ou les autres sous-systèmes du noyau pour interagir avec le périphérique. 5. Intégration dans le noyau : Les drivers Linux doivent également prendre en compte les conventions de conception et les normes de codage du noyau Linux afin de s'intégrer avec succès dans le noyau. En fin de compte, la structure d'un driver Linux dépend du périphérique spécifique qu'il contrôle et des exigences de développement du système.

Lorsque le noyau détecte un périphérique PCI Express, il utilise la table d'identification de périphérique du driver pour vérifier si ce périphérique doit être géré par ce driver. Si le périphérique correspond aux ID de vendeur et de périphérique spécifiés dans la table, le noyau appelle la fonction probe() du driver pour initialiser le périphérique. La fonction probe() est responsable d'initialiser le périphérique, d'activer son accès en lecture et en écriture, de mapper physiquement sa mémoire dans l'espace virtuel du noyau, de configurer les IRQ (Interruptions) et de rendre disponibles les ressources de périphérique nécessaires pour son fonctionnement. Cette fonction commence généralement par rechercher le périphérique pour identifier ses fonctionnalités et spécificités. Une fois que la fonction probe() est terminée, le périphérique est prêt à être utilisé par d'autres processus ou sous-systèmes du noyau. Le driver peut alors communiquer avec le périphérique pour fournir à l'utilisateur ou aux autres processus des services viables.

Cela signifie que les données sont transmises un seul bit à la fois, un par un, en série, plutôt que tous en même temps, comme c'est le cas avec les ports de communication parallèle. Le PCI Express est conçu pour améliorer la performance et la fiabilité des ports de communication de bus PCIe actuels, qui incluent les ports parallèles PCI et AGP. Les ports PCI et AGP avaient atteint leur limite de performances en raison des limites de la communication parallèle, et en raison de problèmes tels que le bruit électromagnétique et la dissipation de puissance. Le PCI Express a été conçu pour surmonter ces problèmes en utilisant la communication série. En utilisant une communication série, le PCI Express est capable d'atteindre des débits de données beaucoup plus élevés que les ports PCI et AGP à architecture parallèle. Le PCI Express offre également une compatibilité ascendante, ce qui signifie qu'il est capable de fonctionner avec des composants plus anciens compatibles PCI et AGP. En somme, le PCI Express est un port de communication série qui offre des performances améliorées et une compatibilité ascendante par rapport aux ports précédents tels que les ports parallèles PCI et AGP."},{"prompt":"Le port PCI Express est donc série, est il synchrone ou bien asynchrone ?","completion":"Le port PCI Express est une interface série asynchrone, ce qui signifie qu'il n'y a pas d'horloge globale partagée qui régule la transmission des données entre les périphériques. Au lieu de cela, chaque périphérique dispose de sa propre horloge locale qui est utilisée pour synchroniser les transmissions de données. Cette technique est appelée \\"transmission asynchrone par paquets\\". Dans une transmission asynchrone par paquets, les données sont envoyées sous forme de paquets discrets qui contiennent de l'information de synchronisation dans l'en-tête. Lorsque les paquets sont reçus par le périphérique de destination, l'information de synchronisation est utilisée pour synchroniser les transmissions de données. Les avantages de la transmission asynchrone par paquets incluent une utilisation plus efficace de la bande passante, une faible latence de transmission et une tolérance élevée aux erreurs. De plus, la synchronisation locale permet d'éviter les problèmes liés à la propagation des signaux sur des distances longues, ce qui est souvent un problème avec les transmissions synchrones.

Durante el Imperio Romano, la producción estaba predominantemente basada en la agricultura y la esclavitud, lo que permitía la acumulación de grandes riquezas por parte de los terratenientes y la élite. Sin embargo, con la caída del Imperio, los grandes latifundios se dividieron en pequeñas parcelas y se instauró un sistema de arrendamiento que llevó a la aparición de una clase media rural. A medida que las ciudades de Roma de Occidente se debilitaron, se produjo un aumento de la producción agrícola local y un aumento en la producción de bienes artesanales en pequeñas comunidades rurales. Además, el comercio continuó siendo importante en la economía, aunque a una escala más reducida. La producción también estaba limitada por la falta de nuevas técnicas y tecnologías, lo que significó que el nivel de producción no aumentó significativamente.

La caída del imperio llevó a una desintegración de la unidad política y la autoridad centralizada, lo que tuvo un impacto significativo en la ciudadanía y en las instituciones civiles. En términos políticos, los ciudadanos del Imperio Romano de Occidente, que habían disfrutado de una gran cantidad de derechos y libertades civiles, perdieron gran parte de estos derechos una vez que los reinos germánicos y bárbaros que sucedieron a la caída del Imperio tomaron el control. En muchos de estos reinos, la ciudadanía fue determinada por la pertenencia a un grupo étnico específico, y los derechos dependían de la posición social y económica del individuo dentro del grupo. Además, la dislocación económica que resultó de la caída del Imperio tuvo un impacto significativo en los ciudadanos romanos, que dependían en gran medida de una economía centralizada y de un comercio bien organizado. La caída del Imperio desestabilizó el comercio y la economía, lo que llevó a una disminución del nivel de vida de muchos ciudadanos. El surgimiento de una nueva élite noble y guerrera, los reyes germánicos y bárbaros, tuvo un impacto significativo en la ciudadanía, ya que estos reyes ejercieron su poder a menudo por la fuerza y la opresión. La lucha por establecer el poder colonial en territorios romanos, a menudo se dieron en detrimento de la población romanizada que allí residía.

La caída del Imperio llevó a la dislocación económica y política, así como a la pérdida de muchas de las libertades y derechos que habían disfrutado antes de su caída."},{"prompt":"porque se dio el feudalismo despues de la caida del imperio romano","completion":"La transición del Imperio Romano al feudalismo se produjo por una combinación de factores históricos y sociales. Después de la caída del Imperio Romano de Occidente, Europa se sumió en un período de inestabilidad, ya que las instituciones y el gobierno centralizado habían colapsado. El resultado fue una lucha desesperada por el poder y el control en todos los niveles de la sociedad. El feudalismo fue una de las respuestas a la necesidad de crear un sistema de poder y control en la ausencia de una estructura centralizada. El feudalismo fue un sistema organizativo que se basaba en la descentralización del poder, con una serie de pequeños señores feudales que controlaban la tierra y la producción en un determinado territorio. El feudalismo se estableció sobre la base de la lealtad y el vasallaje, donde los señores feudales recibían el control de una parcela de tierra y el poder político en una jurisdicción específica, a cambio de servicios y/o tributos para el rey o el monarca. Los campesinos, que trabajaban la tierra de los señores feudales, a su vez recibían protección y seguridad del señor feudal en un escenario donde la inseguridad reinaba. Este sistema de control y poder descentralizado fue una respuesta al caos y la inestabilidad política, económica y social que surgieron después de la caída del Imperio Romano de Occidente. El feudalismo permitió una cierta forma de estabilidad y control focalizado en el poder feudal local, y aunque no restauró la estabilidad total de la época imperial en cuanto a su poder centralizado, sí logró mantener la continuidad territorial y los principios de justicia y autonomía básicos."},{"prompt":"que paginas online puedo usar para crear presentaciones con diapositivas","completion":"Hay varias opciones en línea para crear presentaciones con diapositivas.

Realize this, and you will find strength.\\" in the style and point of view of Marcus Aurelius.","completion":"In the often unpredictable and tumultuous landscape of life, it is easy to forget that the power to shape our experiences lies not in the world around us, but within the recesses of our own minds. As the great Stoic philosophers have taught, the path to equanimity and inner fortitude lies in the recognition that the events that befall us are less significant than the attitudes and judgments we construct in response to them. In this essay, I shall expound upon the wisdom latent in the Stoic dictum: \\"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.\\" In contemplating our place in the vast and indifferent cosmos, it becomes apparent that the very fabric upon which our lives are woven is beyond our control. We are at the mercy of fate, subject to the caprices of fortune or the malice of our fellow beings, and forever vulnerable to the vicissitudes of nature. Consequently, the cultivation of the proper mindset remains the only true means by which we may attain a sense of mastery over our lives. How, then, shall we proceed in this quest for self-governance? We must begin by recognizing the distinction between the external world, governed by forces beyond our reach, and the internal realm of our judgment and perception. The essence of Stoic ideology lies in the assertion that the pursuit of tranquility and contentment necessitates a shift in emphasis from the former to the latter, and a refocusing of our attentions upon the virtues of wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. To better understand the notion that we ought to be concerned primarily with our mental faculties, consider the following observation: it is not adversity itself that causes distress, but our interpretation and reaction to it. When faced with tribulation, we often lament, \\"This should not have happened to me.\\" However, such thoughts only give rise to despair and impede the ability to overcome the obstacle at hand. It is within our power to choose a different perspective, one that encourages resilience and adaptation. Should we adopt such a Stoic approach to life's trials, we may foster inner resilience by reminding ourselves that misfortune is an inevitable aspect of existence, and that we possess the strength to confront and surmount even the most formidable barriers to our well-being. In the words of my fellow Stoic Epictetus, \\"Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them.\\" As we hone our intellectual faculties and master our innate capacity for reason, we place ourselves firmly on the path toward inner peace and self-sufficiency. Let us strive to be like the sturdy oak tree, with roots deeply entrenched in the fertile soil of virtue and wisdom, so that even the fiercest gales cannot unmoor us from our sense of stability and contentment. I encourage you, dear reader, to seek solace not in the fleeting whims of fortune, but in the unshakable core of your own character. Embrace the Stoic conviction that true strength lies not in our ability to change the world around us, but in our capacity to adapt our minds and souls to the ever-shifting currents of life. Let these words serve as a beacon of guidance and transformative power: \\"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.\\" In closing, may the blessings of reason and virtue accompany you in all your endeavors. May you cultivate an inner sanctuary, a citadel of the soul, that is impervious to the turmoil of the external world. Dare to look beyond the realm of fate and circumstance, and there you will find the true source of your potential - the power of your mind. As you weather the tempests of life with unyielding fortitude, may you never lose sight of this inviolable truth."},{"prompt":"Liste plotadores baseados em texto de prompts de IA.","completion":"1.

Если в кадрах уже находится нужная страница, то отказа не происходит.

При нажатии на кнопку «Добавить» должно происходить добавление товара в корзину. public class ProductsFragment extends Fragment { private List<Product> productList; private RecyclerView recyclerView; private ProductAdapter adapter; @Nullable @Override public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_products, container, false); // Здесь инициализируем список товаров и recyclerView adapter = new ProductAdapter(productList, new OnProductClickListener() { @Override public void onAddToCartClick(Product product) { addToCart(product); } }); // передаём метод добавления товара в корзину recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter); recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(getContext())); return view; } private void addToCart(Product product) { // метод добавления товара в корзину Cart cart = Cart.getInstance(); cart.addItem(product); } } Здесь мы создаём адаптер для списка товаров и передаём ему метод onAddToCartClick, который будет вызываться при нажатии на кнопку «Добавить». Затем в методе addToCart мы получаем объект Cart и вызываем у него метод addItem, который добавляет переданный товар. Далее создай фрагмент для корзины, который будет отображать содержимое корзины и её стоимость, а также кнопку «Оформить заказ». public class CartFragment extends Fragment { private TextView totalPriceTextView; private Button placeOrderButton; private RecyclerView recyclerView; private CartAdapter adapter; private Cart cart; @Nullable @Override public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_cart, container, false); // инициализируем элементы UI и получаем объект Cart из синглтона totalPriceTextView = view.findViewById(R.id.total_price_text_view); placeOrderButton = view.findViewById(R.id.place_order_button); recyclerView = view.findViewById(R.id.cart_recycler_view); cart = Cart.getInstance(); adapter = new CartAdapter(cart.getItems(), new OnCartItemListener() { @Override public void onQuantityChanged(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { cart.updateItem(item, newQuantity); updateTotalPrice(); // обновляем общую стоимость } @Override public void onRemoveButtonClick(CartItem item) { cart.removeItem(item); adapter.setItems(cart.getItems()); updateTotalPrice(); } }); // передаём обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества и удаления товара recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter); recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(getContext())); updateTotalPrice(); placeOrderButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { placeOrder(); } }); // обработчик кнопки оформления заказа return view; } private void placeOrder() { // TODO: здесь должен быть код для оформления заказа } private void updateTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = cart.getTotalPrice(); totalPriceTextView.setText(getString(R.string.cart_total_price, totalPrice)); } } Здесь мы создаем адаптер для корзины, который отображает содержимое и обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества товара и удаления товара из корзины. Метод updateTotalPrice обновляет общую стоимость корзины при изменении количества или удалении товара. Наконец, нужно создать класс Cart, который будет содержать список товаров в корзине и способы их изменения. Также реализуй методы для подсчета общей стоимости товаров в корзине и очистки корзины. public class Cart { private static Cart instance; private List<CartItem> items; private Cart() { items = new ArrayList<>(); } public static Cart getInstance() { if (instance == null) { instance = new Cart(); } return instance; } public void addItem(Product product) { for (CartItem item : items) { if (item.getProduct().equals(product)) { item.setQuantity(item.getQuantity() + 1); return; } } items.add(new CartItem(product, 1)); } public void updateItem(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { if (newQuantity <= 0) { removeItem(item); } else { item.setQuantity(newQuantity); } } public void removeItem(CartItem item) { items.remove(item); } public List<CartItem> getItems() { return items; } public void clear() { items.clear(); } public double getTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = 0; for (CartItem item : items) { totalPrice += item.getTotalPrice(); } return totalPrice; } } Теперь, когда все классы и фрагменты созданы, можем перейти к отображению корзины на экране. Например, можно добавить кнопку «Корзина» на главный экран (MainActivity) и открывать фрагмент CartFragment при ее нажатии. public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); Button cartButton = findViewById(R.id.cart_button); cartButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { showCartFragment(); } }); } private void showCartFragment() { FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager(); FragmentTransaction transaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction(); CartFragment cartFragment = new CartFragment(); transaction.replace(android.R.id.content, cartFragment); transaction.addToBackStack(null); transaction.commit(); } } Здесь мы получаем кнопку из макета и устанавливаем для нее обработчик нажатия. При нажатии вызываем метод showCartFragment, который открывает фрагмент CartFragment.

Alexander Imperator is a TV series about Alexander the Great, viewed through the medieval perspective of Alexander Romance narratives, making for a deliberately anachronistic tale. It incorporates legendary and mythological elements into Alexander’s tale, including Thalestris, Candice, Nectanebo, the voyage to the bottom of the sea, battles with Gog and Magog, etc. It also features medieval stylistics and elements, with chivalrous knights in plate armor and medieval pikemen and crossbowmen instead of phalanx, just like seen on medieval illustrations. The series also heavily relies on atmosphere and stylistic of 1950s cinematic epic costume romance, with its bright colors, classical theatrical acting, characteristic editing and even musical score reminiscent of Golden Age Hollywood. These heavily romanticized, swashbuckling adventures and romances and stylized elements are often juxtaposed with ventures into ancient and modern philosophy, exploiting mystical tales as basis for though-provoking questions and unusual conflicts and situations. The series doesn’t focus just on Alexander, but also on his companians, his mother Olympias and his numerous lovers. Write long and detailed IMDB review of this TV series.","completion":"Title: A Nostalgic and Enchanting Journey through Time and Romance Rating: 9/10 I have been an ardent fan of historical epics and romance, and I believe that Alexander Imperator is a truly unique and fascinating addition to the world of television. This TV series captures the grandeur, atmosphere, and philosophy of the mythological stories of Alexander the Great, whilst also incorporating medieval stylistics, thus giving it a delightful flavor of anachronism. The series does not stick to the conventional depictions of historical events and characters, but rather, presents a highly imaginative interpretation, ultimately creating an irresistible blend of nostalgia, chivalry, and epic drama. The cinematic quality, especially the bright colors and the classical theatrical acting, transports us back to the 1950s' era of romance and adventure. I must applaud the creators for their bold decision to showcase medieval knights in plate armor, crossbowmen, and pikemen in lieu of the traditional phalanx, which adds charm to the series and helps highlight its unique vision. The musical score is mesmerizing and beautifully complements the majestic atmosphere and events unfolding on screen. What truly sets Alexander Imperator apart from other television shows is its ability to weave intricate narratives, juggling an extensive line-up of legendary and mythological elements. For instance, the incorporation of Thalestris, Candice, Nectanebo, Gog and Magog, and Alexander's voyage to the bottom of the sea, imparts an air of wonder and intrigue to the story. The series successfully delves into the personal lives and internal struggles of Alexander, his mother Olympias, his companions, and his numerous lovers. In addition, the series boldly ventures into ancient and modern philosophy, exploring thought-provoking questions, unconventional conflicts, and curious situations. Notable performances by the lead cast members further strengthen the series. Alexander, portrayed with zeal and charisma, creates a magnetic protagonist whom we follow with bated breath through battles, romances, and mystifying encounters. Olympias, Alexander's mother, enriches the narrative with her Machiavellian schemes and captivating presence. The supporting cast members are equally impressive, each enriching the story and blending seamlessly into the medieval world created by the series. As with any ambitious project, minor imperfections can be found. The pacing can occasionally seem uneven, and some subplots may not hold the viewers' interest as strongly as the central narrative. Nonetheless, these minor drawbacks do not detract from the overall experience. In conclusion, Alexander Imperator is an enthralling and boldly imaginative television series that offers a fresh take on the legendary figure of Alexander the Great. The combination of nostalgic visual elements, the captivating world of Alexander Romance narratives, and the enchanting atmosphere of epic romance makes it a must-watch for fans of historical dramas and great storytelling."},{"prompt":"fanfic: Sans Last Breath meets freedom planet (storyline) part 1 Dragon Valley","completion":"Title: The Fractured Worlds Part 1: The Battle of Dragon Valley INTRODUCTION The city of Undertale had tried to live in harmony for centuries. Monsters roamed the land as did humans, but the uneasy alliance between the two meant that life was always a delicate dance. In recent years, the stability had been tested, with some of the most powerful creatures in the Kingdom of Animalia testing the limits of what once was a safe undertaking. Sans, the skeletal protector of the citizens of Undertale, was the last bastion of hope for his people. With each passing day, the inhabitants of the land could feel the strain pulling at the very fabric of their reality. Little did they know, a prophecy had long foretold the merging of two worlds—their own and the other, the world of Freedom Planet, peopled with unique creatures of unparalleled abilities. CHAPTER 1: The Rift In the outskirts of Dragon Valley, a strange rift in time and space could be seen overhead. The sky seemed to appear in hues of blues, greens, and purples. Sans, sensing the tension in the air, decided to consult the citizens, knowing that they would understand what was causing this disturbance. In Undertale, whispers of the prophecy began to circulate. Rumors spread about a land beyond the rift, filled with mysterious and powerful beings. Meanwhile, Sans could feel the pressure mounting within him, urging him to investigate further. It was then that a devastating burst of energy discharged itself from the rift, causing Sans' world to lose all that they held dear. The sudden surge of magic awakened several aligned Souls throughout both lands of Undertale and Freedom Planet, drawing Sans and the brave inhabitants of each world closer to the impending battle. Sans knew that the existence of the worlds as they knew them was in grave danger, and he had to act. Before he set out on his journey, he informed the King and gathered his allies from the world of Undertale. Sans had heard about the Freedom Planet inhabitants, but didn't know what to expect — they only existed for him in stories passed down through generations. CHAPTER 2: The Heroes Unite Meanwhile, in Dragon Valley, the inhabitants were experiencing the same disturbance. The protagonists of freedom planet, Sash Lilac, Carol Tea, and Milla Basset, also sensed that their world was merging with another. As Sans and his allies crossed the dimensional rift, the magic within Sans fused the worlds together, allowing everyone to traverse freely between them. When the heroes from Undertale finally reached Dragon Valley, Sans and the protagonists of Freedom Planet finally met face to face. Despite their initial culture shock and misunderstandings, the heroes eventually formed an alliance to tackle the threat that loomed over both their worlds. It was then that the nameless evil began to manifest, born out of the fractured reality swirling around them. CHAPTER 3: Puzzling Pieces and Escalating Struggles The heroes had to discover a way to defeat the nameless evil and restore their worlds to the separate existences they had known before. To do so, they would have to navigate through a tangled world of strange landscapes that had formed where their worlds met. Tensions continued to rise in the merged worlds as Sans, the inhabitants of Undertale, and the Freedom Planet protagonists embarked on a perilous journey to find a solution. Along the way, they faced strange, hybrid beasts created by the rift, wild landscapes that mixed and merged the two worlds, and ancient tests that tested each hero's resolve. CONCLUSION As they journeyed on, the heroes began to realize that the prophecy was true: their worlds were forever bound, and only they could protect them both. With each passing obstacle, the heroes learn to work together, using their unique abilities and strengths to protect the worlds they called home. With trial and courage, the heroes face the nameless evil at the heart of the rift. In the battle that follows, the magic that fueled the dimensional bridge is expended, and the rift finally closes. Upon their victory, Sans and the Freedom Planet heroes, now friends, realize that they have more in common than they previously thought. Both worlds had changed, but not without consequences. They agreed to maintain their newfound alliance and work together to ensure that their worlds remained separate yet connected. And so, the tale of two worlds, Undertale and Freedom Planet, was written. Although the prophecy had come to pass, the future was uncertain. With the knowledge that they could depend on each other for support, the heroes prepared for whatever may come — knowing that in the darkest times, even the most unlikely allies may come to be powerful friends."},{"prompt":"Что мне ответить, если покупатель не доволен товаром?","completion":"Вы можете сообщить, что вы сожалеете, что товар не соответствует его ожиданиям и готовы рассмотреть различные варианты решения проблемы, такие как замена товара или возврат денег.

Study design “The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research of the School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP (protocol number 01394712.5.0000.5416). The purpose and content of the study were explained to eligible subjects, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants for inclusion in the study. A total of 70 participants were recruited from June 2016 to March 2018 at the Periodontology Clinic, School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP. The diagnosis of periodontitis was performed according to the classification of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions 12 . All patients should present a minimum of 15 natural teeth. Twenty patients were included in the periodontally healthy control group. All subjects were free of systemic and periodontal diseases. They should present probing depth (PD) ≤ 3 mm, no bleeding on probing (BOP), no clinical attachment loss, plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) ≤ 15%. Fifty patients with periodontitis stage III or IV were included in periodontitis groups. In addition to the diagnostic criteria 12 , they should present at least five sites in non-adjacent teeth with PD ≥ 4 mm, BOP, and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 4 mm, except for third molars. From the 50 patients, 25 had never smoked and 25 were smokers who should smoke at least 10 cigarettes/day for a minimum of 5 years. None of the patients had a history of systemic diseases or immunological disorders. Subjects who had received antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs within the last 3 months or received periodontal treatment within the last 6 months were not included in the study. Patients using hormone replacement therapy, pregnant and lactating women and orthodontic patients were also excluded. The sample size was calculated using statistical software (GPower 3.1 Statistical Power Analysis for Windows, Düsseldorf, Germany). Considering mean values of hBD expression and standard deviation from previous studies 13 , 14 , 15 , an effect size of 0.3 was obtained. Based on this effect size, a significance level of 0.05 and a study power of 0.80, a sample size of 20 individuals per group were determined to be necessary.”, 2.Clinical examination “One calibrated examiner performed all clinical examinations. The intra-examiner reproducibility was assessed by measuring the PD in six teeth (16, 21, 24, 36, 41 and 44), according to the Ramfjord index, in a total of six patients (36 sites/patient) on two different occasions in a time interval of 7 days. Data were submitted to Kappa concordance analysis (k=0.91). The parameters PD, BOP and CAL were assessed at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, disto-lingual), while PI and GI were registered as absence (negative site) or presence (positive site) of visible plaque and gingival bleeding at four sites per tooth (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual), excluding the third molars. Measurements were performed with a manual periodontal probe (UNC15; Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).”, 3. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling : “GCF samples were collected from healthy (n=5) sites of each periodontally healthy patient and from healthy (n=5) and diseased (n=5) sites of each periodontitis patient. Sites at different non-adjacent teeth, preferably one site per quadrant, were selected for GCF collection in each subject, one day after the periodontal examination. Healthy sites had no gingival inflammation, PD ≤ 3 mm, no BOP or clinical attachment loss; and diseased sites had gingival inflammation, PD and CAL ≥ 4 mm with BOP. Diseased sites were selected according to the deepest probing depth in each quadrant. A single examiner performed GCF sampling. The sites to be sampled were isolated with cotton rolls, the supragingival plaque was removed with a sterile curette and the surfaces were gently air-dried. GCF was sampled by inserting absorbent paper strips (Periopaper®, Oraflow Inc., New York, USA) into the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket for 30 seconds. Paper strips contaminated with blood and saliva were rejected. An electronic device Periotron 8000 determined the GCF volume absorbed into each strip (Periopaper, ProFlow, Inc., Amityville, NY, USA), which was calibrated based on a protocol described before 16 (calibration of the electronic device by polynomial regression). The GCF was obtained as a pooled sample of the same category (healthy or diseased site) in each subject. The papers strips were immediately placed into a dry sterile polypropylene tube (5 paper strips per tube) and kept at -80 °C until analysis. The readings from the Periotron 8000 were converted to an actual volume (μL) by reference to a standard curve.”, 4. Immunosorbent assay for hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification: “First, the absorbed GCF was eluted from the paper strips by adding 750 μL (150 μL per strip) of 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) to each tube. The tubes were left on ice in a horizontal shaker for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 4 °C, 13.000 g for 10 minutes. The GCF levels of hBD 1 and 2 were measured using the sandwich ELISA technique according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). The absorbance was measured by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm wavelength. The levels of AMPs in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.” and 5. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA). For clinical data, normal distribution was analyzed using the D’Agostino and Pearson test. For normally distributed data, it was used One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey for healthy sites and unpaired t test for diseased sites on inter-group analyses and paired t test for intra-group analyses. For non-normally distributed data, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn were used for healthy sites and Mann-Whitney tests was used for diseased sites on inter-group analyses, while the Wilcoxon test was performed for intra-group comparison. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The effect size was estimated for the primary outcome of the study (AMPs level in GCF). Since non-parametric tests were used for intra and inter-group comparisons, the eta squared and the correlation coefficient r were calculated.” 1. Demographics and periodontal parameters “A significant age difference was found between periodontally healthy subjects (25.79 ± 3.95) and periodontitis patients (NS [40.32 ± 12]; S [43.88 ± 10.64]) (p<0.05). The distribution of the male and female participants had no significant difference between the study groups, periodontally healthy subjects (5 males/15 females) and periodontitis patients (NS - 9 males/16 females; S - 12 males/13 females) (p = 0.28). The periodontal clinical parameters are presented in table 1. Regarding the full mouth periodontal clinical parameters, PI, BOP, PD and CAL were significantly lower in periodontally healthy subjects than in periodontitis patients (p<0.0001). Only for GI, a significant difference was observed between periodontally healthy patients and smoker patients (p=0.0001). The sampled sites of periodontally healthy subjects presented significantly lower values of PD and CFV than healthy sampled sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.05), as well as lower CAL than healthy sampled sites of smokers (p<0.05) (Table 2). In patients with periodontitis, the intra-group comparison revealed lower levels of PD, CAL and CFV in the healthy sampled sites than in the diseased sites (p<0.0001) (Table 2).” , 2. hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification “The GCF levels of hBD 1 and hBD 2 are presented in Figure 1. The hBD 1 levels were significantly higher in healthy sites of the patients without periodontal disease than in healthy sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.0001), with a mean difference of 31.62 (95% CI: 17.15 - 46.08) between SH and H and a mean difference of 31.20 between NSH and H (95% CI: 13.81 - 48.57). The lowest GCF hBD 2 level was observed in healthy sites of non-smokers (p=0.0003). A mean difference of 33.61 was observed between SH and H (95% CI: -3.41 - 70.63), and a mean difference of 6.56 was found between NSH and H (95% CI: -1.68 - 14.79). The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in healthy sites was large (eta squared= 0.497 and r= 0.70 for hBD 1; eta squared= 0.176 and r= 0.42 for hBD 2). The comparison between diseased sites of patients with periodontitis revealed significantly higher levels of hBD 2 and lower levels of hBD 1 in the GCF of smokers compared to non-smokers (p<0.05). The mean difference between SD and NSD was 74.67 (95% CI: -50.82 - 200.16) for hBD 2 and 6.89 (95% CI: 0.64 - 13.14) for hBD 1. The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in diseased sites of smokers and non-smokers was intermediate (hBD 2 eta squared= 0.073 and r= 0.27; hBD 1 eta squared= 0.081 and r= 0.28) 17 . In non-smokers, higher levels of hBD 1 and 2 were observed in diseased sites than in healthy sites (p<0.05). A mean difference of 4.34 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -6.74 - 15.41) and 118.95 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -3.14 - 241.04) was observed between NSD and NSH. The magnitude of the effect observed was intermediate for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.097 and r= 0.31) and small for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.021 and r= 0.14). However, in smokers, no significant difference in hBDs level was found between healthy and diseased sites (p>0.05). A mean difference of 2.13 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -2.71 - 6.96) and 10.67 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -36.24 - 57.58) was observed between SD and SH. The magnitude of the effect observed was small for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.019 and r= 0.14) and intermediate for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.108 and r= 0.33) .” and these are the data of the second study : 1.

Clinical measures : \\"Clinical measurements made were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The measurements were taken at 6 sites per tooth and entered manually in the data sheet. Probing pocket depth and attachment level measurements were made to the nearest millimeter using an UNC 15 Probe. A total of 79 subjects were recruited in the study and were grouped according to their periodontal status. Group 1 (Healthy controls) included 27 subjects with a plaque index (PI) of < 1, gingival index (GI) of < 1, probing depth (PD) of ≤ 3 mm, and no loss of attachment. Group 2 (Gingivitis) included 25 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1PD ≤ 3 mm, clinical evidence of inflammation based on presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites and no clinical attachment loss. Group 3 (Chronic periodontitis) had 27 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1, Probing depth (PD) ≥ 5 mm and clinical attachment level(CAL) ≥ 3 mm and presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites with radiographic evidence of bone loss.” , 3. GCF collection : “GCF collection was done a day after the periodontal examination. In healthy individuals, sites with PD ≤ 3 mm and no signs of inflamma- tion, in gingivitis patients, sites with bleeding on probing and in chronic periodontitis subjects, the sites with PD ≥ 5 mm were chosen for ac- quiring GCF. The area was isolated with gauze to avoid saliva con- tamination, after drying the area with air, supragingival plaque was removed with curette (Hu Friedy, USA), a calibrated volumetric mi- crocapillary pipette (Sigma Aldrich) was placed at the entrance of the gingival sulcus, gently touching the gingival margin. From each test site, 2 μl of GCF was collected. The collected GCF was then transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube and stored at −70oc until the assay. Micropipettes with contaminants like blood or saliva were discarded.18 The GCF level of IL-22, hBD-2 was assayed using commercially available ELISA kit (E Lab Biosciences) [Catalog no: E-EL-H0106 (IL- 22), Catalog no: E-EL-H0996 (hBD-2]. The procedure was performed according to the instructions given in the kit.” ? 1. Quantification of hBD-2 “Briefly, to a human hBD-2 antibody precoated ELISA plate 100 μL of the standard or sample is added and incubated for 90 minutes at 37 °C and the free components are washed. Add 100 μL biotinylated detection antibody is added and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C and washed. Then 100 μL of horse radish peroxide (HRP) conjugate is added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C and washed. 90 μL of substrate reagent is added and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C followed by the addition of 50 μL stop solution. The optical density is measured with a spectrometry at a wave length of 450 nm immediately. The minimum detection limit for hBD-2 is 37.50 pg/mL. The levels of hBD-2 in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.”, 2. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was done using the Statistical package for the Social science (SPSS) for windows, version 19; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA. All the periodontal parameters were described and reported as mean values ( ± SD). The distribution and comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups were assessed using one way ANOVA test. Post Hoc Bonferroni test was used for intergroup comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups. Association among the IL-22 and hBD-2 and clinical parameters in all three groups were examined using Pearson’s correlation test. Probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.”, 3. Clinical analysis “The healthy control group had 27 subjects with a mean age of 25.14 years and 25 gingivitis subjects with a mean age of 31.92 years and 27 patients with periodontitis with a mean age of 47.00 years. Periodontal parameters of the study groups are shown in Table 1. All clinical parameters were significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group than the healthy and gingivitis groups (P < 0.05).”, 4. GCF hBD-2 levels \\" The mean GCF levels of hBD-2(Table 1, Graph 1) and the mean difference between groups are represented (Table 2). The hBD−2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to gingivitis group (P = 0.003) and healthy control group (P < 0.05).However there were no statistical differences be- tween healthy and gingivitis groups in terms of total amount of hBD-2 in GCF. \\" , 5. Correlations \\"There was significant positive correlation between GCF total amount of IL-22 and GI (P < 0.01), PI (P < 0.01), PD (P < 0.00.01), CAL (P < 0.05) [Table 3, Graph 2(A, B, C, D)] in chronic periodontitis group (Group 3). Positive correlation between GCF total amount of hBD-2 and PI (P < 0.05) and CAL (P < 0.01) [Table 3, Graph 3(B, D)] was observed in chronic periodontitis group. Positive correlation was observed between IL-22 and hBD-2 levels in GCF of CP Group (P < 0.005) [Table 3, Graph 3(E)]. The correlation between clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid levels of hBD-2 and IL-22 in healthy controls and gingivitis group was statistically insignificant (data not shown). Can you interpret together the data and the results of the two studies and especially concerning HBD-2 ?","completion":"Based on the data provided from the two studies, I will perform a comparison focusing on hBD-2 levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) across different groups (periodontally healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis patients). Study 1: - The lowest GCF hBD-2 levels were observed in healthy sites of non-smokers (p=0.0003). - In the comparison between periodontitis patients, smokers had significantly higher levels of hBD-2 and lower levels of hBD-1 in the GCF compared to non-smokers (p<0.05). - In non-smokers with periodontitis, higher levels of hBD-2 were observed in diseased sites than in healthy sites (p<0.05). - In smokers with periodontitis, no significant difference in hBD-2 levels was found between healthy sites and diseased sites (p>0.05). Study 2: - GCF hBD-2 was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to both the gingivitis group (p=0.003) and the healthy control group (p<0.05). - However, there were no statistical differences between the healthy and gingivitis groups regarding the total amount of hBD-2 in GCF. Combined interpretation: - In both studies, hBD-2 levels in GCF were generally higher in periodontitis patients compared to those with gingivitis and healthy controls. - In Study 1, hBD-2 levels in healthy sites of non-smokers were significantly lower than those in periodontitis patients. This result is in line with the findings of Study 2, where hBD-2 levels in periodontitis patients were significantly higher than in both healthy controls and gingivitis patients. - Study 1 found that smokers with periodontitis had higher hBD-2 levels in diseased sites compared to non-smokers with periodontitis. Study 2 did not report data specific to the smoking status of the participants, making a direct comparison difficult. - Study 1 also reported that non-smokers with periodontitis had significantly higher hBD-2 levels in diseased sites compared to healthy sites. Similar differences between healthy and diseased sites in smokers with periodontitis were not observed. Study 2 did not explicitly compare healthy and diseased sites within the same group, so further comparison on this aspect is not possible. In conclusion, both studies show that hBD-2 levels in GCF are generally higher in periodontitis patients compared to individuals with gingivitis and periodontally healthy individuals. Some differences between the studies, such as the influence of smoking on hBD-2 levels, cannot be directly compared due to the absence of relevant data in Study 2."},{"prompt":"now i will provide you with data from a third study. Can you interpret together the data and the results of the three studies and especially concerning HBD-2 ? Here are the data for the third study:1. Participant selection and clinical evaluations “In this cross-sectional study, 42 CP patients and 59 controls were recruited from either patients attending to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, or from the personal patient populations of the academic faculty and postgraduate students at the Ondokuz Mayis University between June 2014 and May 2015. Ethics committee approval was received from Ondokuz Mayıs University clinical research ethics committee with decision number 2014/556-630(2013/416-447). Individuals included in the study were informed about the purpose and content of the study and signed an informed consent form indicating they voluntarily participated in the study.”, 2. Inclusion criteria “Individuals included were over 18 years old and willing to provide in- formed consent. In addition, they did not have any systemic diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic renal failure, and hepatitis B and C, and were not using any chronic anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, participants who are pregnant or lactating at the time of the study or receive any periodontal treatment within the preceding six months were excluded from the study. All subjects were evaluated clinically and radiographically at the first clinical visit; periapical and panoramic radiographs were obtained from all patients to verify the clinical periodontal diagnosis and the extent of alveolar bone loss. All clinical parameters were evaluated by a single investigator (S.K). The examiner was calibrated against an expert periodontist. Calibration was validated if 90% of the recordings could be reproduced within a 1.0-mm difference (Badersten, Nilvéaus, & Egelberg, 1984). The following clinical parameters were assessed at six sites per tooth: probing pocket depth (PD); clinical attachment loss (CAL); bleeding on probing (BOP) (Ainamo & Bay, 1975); plaque index (PI) (Silness & Löe, 1964); gingi- val index (GI) (Löe & Silness, 1963); and the number of missing teeth, mobility, and furcation involvement. PD was defined as the distance between the coronal-most margin of the free gingiva to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-0 probe. CAL was defined as the distance from the cemento-enamel junction to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-O probe. The presence of supragingival plaque was recorded dichotomously during PD measurements. Bleeding on probing (BOP) within 20s was recorded dichotomously.Clinical and radiographic criteria proposed by the 1999 International World Workshop were used for diagnosis.”, 3. Control group “Patients had no history of periodontitis, and no furcation involvement and mobility. Their PD was smaller than 3 mm.”, 4. CP group inclusion criteria “Radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss and at least ≥4 mm PDD in two interdental areas, not on the same tooth (Eke, Page, Wei, Thornton-Evans, & Genco, 2012).”, 5. Collection and storage of samples “GCF samples were obtained for analyses (mainly from the maxillary premolar area for standardization). The supragingival plaque was removed without touching the gingival margin. The area was care- fully washed with water to prevent salivary contamination, the tooth was isolated with cotton rolls, and the area was dried with air for 10 s. For sampling, paper strips (Periopaper, ProFlow, Amityville, NY,USA) were carefully placed in the gingival sulcus and held there for 30 s. If the paper strips were contaminated with blood or saliva, they were discarded and replaced. The volume of each paper strip was determined with Periotron 8,000 (ProFlow, Amityville, NY, USA). The samples were placed with 50 microliters of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) in an Eppendorf tube. Two milliliters of peripheral venous blood samples were taken from each subject, using a standard venipuncture method. The sam- ples were then transferred to tubes containing 8% liquid EDTA. GCF samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min; blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min by a centrifuge device (Shimadzu UV160A, SNo: 28006648, Japan). The supernatants obtained from GCF and serum samples were separated for the study. The samples were mixed thoroughly with a vortex and stored at −80oC until the working day. On the working day, the samples were brought to room temperature.” .1.Determination of hBD-2 concentrations “Serum and GCF hBD-2 concentrations were studied by the commercially available Human BioD2 ELISA Kit (Sun-Red Bio Company, Cat No. 201-12-1937, Shanghai, China), in the Ondokuz Mayıs University, Faculty of Medicine, by the Medical Biochemistry Research Laboratory. The “double-antibody sandwich” enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure was used for this analysis. All working solutions were freshly prepared and stored at room temperature (25°C) until use. Five standards were prepared with the serial dilution method using human hBD-2 standard (S1–6.4 ng/ml, S2–3.2 ng/ml, S3–1.6 ng/ml, S4–0.8 ng/ml, and S5–0.4 ng/ml). The wells were identified on the ELISA plate for blank, standards, and samples. Nothing was added to the blank well except Chromogen A, Chromogen B, and a stop solution. The same procedure used with the sample was applied to the standards. Fifty μL of standard (S1–S5) was pipetted into each well, and 40 μl + 10 μl of hBD-2 antibody was pipetted from each sample. Then, 50 μl Streptavidin–Horseradish peroxidase was added to the standards and samples and incubated at 370C for 60 min. After incubation, the plate was washed 5 times with 350 μl washing solution with the help of an automatic washer. 50 μl Chromogen A and 50 μl Chromogen B were added to all wells and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Then, the reaction was stopped by pipetting 50 μl of stop solution. At the end of the study, absorbance at 450 nm wavelength was read by a microplate reader. Sample hBD-2 concentrations were calculated according to the standard curve generated using standard values, and the concentrations obtained were expressed in ng/ml. Kit sensitivity 0.05 ng/ml and assay range 0.1 ng/ml-10 ng/ml were given. High concentration samples were confirmed by working twice.”, 2. Statistical analysis \\"Data analysis was performed using R program version 3.5.1. (R Core Team, 2019). Data are expressed as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile ranges (IR) as appropriate. Data were analyzed for normal distribution by the Shapiro–Wilk test. A chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical variables. An independent- sample t test was used to detect the statistical significance between the two groups, based on the clinical variables obtained, such as age, probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and others. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess the association between the outcome (periodontal disease) with serum and GCF hBD-2 levels and other covariates. Correlation between each clinical parameter and serum and GCF hBD-2 levels was analyzed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A p-value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. The estimated power of the test was 0.80. 3. Clinical findings “A total of 101 participants, 59 controls and 42 patients with CP, were assessed. Of the volunteers included in the study, only 8 in the control group and only 5 in the CP group were smokers. Thirty- seven (37) females and 22 males (mean age 27.69 ± 7.78) were included in the control group, and 28 females and 14 males (mean age 42.67 ± 10.62) were included in the CP group. There was no statisti- cal difference between the groups in terms of smoking and gender distribution (p > .05). The distribution of demographic data is shown in Table 1. Age was found to be significantly higher in the CP group (p < .001). The mean age of all participants was 33.93 (±11.68) years; the mean age of the control group was 27.69 (±7.78), and the mean age of the CP group was 42.67 (±10.62) (Table 1).”, 4. Clinical variables “All recorded clinical parameters (BOP, CAL, PI, GI, and PD) were significantly higher in the CP group than in the control group (p < .001) (Table 2). CP was reclassified according to the modification of the new international classification of periodontitis (Tonetti, Greenwell, & Kornman, 2018). Accordingly, cases were classified as Stage II (n = 3; 7%); Stage III (n = 34; 81%); Stage IV (n = 5; 12%); and Grade B (n = 25; 60%) to C (n = 17; 40%) periodontitis. Of these, 67% of CP patients were generalized CP, and 33% were localized CP.The mean hBD-2 levels of GCF samples in the CP group were 2.77 (±0.74) ng/30 s and 2.51 (±0.54) ng/30 s in the control group. The GCF levels of the mean hBD-2 were significantly higher in the CP group compared with those in healthy controls (p = .047; Figure 1). Adjusting for potential confounders such as smoking, age, and gender did not alter this association (p = .036). Conversely, the mean hBD-2 levels of serum samples in the CP group were lower (2.92 ± 3.07 ng/ ml) compared with those of the control group (7.75 ± 6.37 ng/ml; p < .001; Figure 2). Similarly, adjusting for smoking status, age, and gender did not alter this association (p < .001). Additionally, we tested the difference of hBD-2 level between generalized and localized CP. The difference between the groups both in serum (p = .25) and in GCF hBD-2 levels (p = .51) was not statistically significant.”, 5. Correlations “The correlation between serum and GCF hBD-2 expression and clinical periodontal measures was analyzed. No correlation was observed between serum and GCF hBD-2 levels (r = .004, n = 99, p = .97). In both GCF and serum samples, no correlations were ob- served between hBD-2 and the clinical parameters of periodontal disease such as PD, GI, PI, CAL, and number of teeth present. On the other hand, both localized GCF and serum hBD-2 were correlated with BOP within the periodontitis group. However, after adjustment by the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons, a statistically significant correlation remained only between GCF hBD-2 and BOP (r = .54, p = .0002; Table 3).” .","completion":"Now, with the data from the third study, let's compare the results concerning hBD-2 from all three studies.

However, in general, Border Collies are a highly active breed and require a lot of exercise and interaction to be happy and healthy. If your family is providing basic training and short walks, that may not be enough to satisfy the breed's needs. It is essential to make sure the dog gets enough exercise and socialization to prevent behavior problems and promote its well-being.

Distract the dog: Give attention to the dog if he starts biting into pants. You can try giving him a toy instead, praise him for letting go of the pants, or make a loud noise to stop the behavior. 2. Provide appropriate toys: Make sure the dog has toys to distract him from biting into pants. Give him chew toys, puzzle toys, or interactive toys that can keep him busy and entertained. 3. Use positive reinforcement: Reward the dog when he stops biting into pants. Praise him, give him treats, or play with him when he shows appropriate behavior. 4. Use negative reinforcement: Use a short and sharp command, like \\"no\\" or \\"stop\\" to tell the dog what he's doing wrong. You can also use a squirt bottle filled with water to spray him lightly when he starts biting into pants. 5. Train the dog: Teach the dog basic commands like \\"leave it,\\" \\"drop it,\\" or \\"come.\\" Encourage him to follow these commands by rewarding him with treats and praises. Remember, consistency is key when training a dog. Using all of these methods consistently and with patience will help the dog learn the appropriate behavior, and stop biting into pants."},{"prompt":"public class ProductsFragment extends Fragment { private List<Product> productList; private RecyclerView recyclerView; private ProductAdapter adapter; @Nullable @Override public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_products, container, false); // Здесь инициализируем список товаров и recyclerView adapter = new ProductAdapter(productList, new OnProductClickListener() { @Override public void onAddToCartClick(Product product) { addToCart(product); } }); // передаём метод добавления товара в корзину recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter); recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(getContext())); return view; } private void addToCart(Product product) { // метод добавления товара в корзину Cart cart = Cart.getInstance(); cart.addItem(product); } } Здесь мы создаём адаптер для списка товаров и передаём ему метод onAddToCartClick, который будет вызываться при нажатии на кнопку «Добавить». Затем в методе addToCart мы получаем объект Cart и вызываем у него метод addItem, который добавляет переданный товар. Далее создай фрагмент для корзины, который будет отображать содержимое корзины и её стоимость, а также кнопку «Оформить заказ». public class CartFragment extends Fragment { private TextView totalPriceTextView; private Button placeOrderButton; private RecyclerView recyclerView; private CartAdapter adapter; private Cart cart; @Nullable @Override public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_cart, container, false); // инициализируем элементы UI и получаем объект Cart из синглтона totalPriceTextView = view.findViewById(R.id.total_price_text_view); placeOrderButton = view.findViewById(R.id.place_order_button); recyclerView = view.findViewById(R.id.cart_recycler_view); cart = Cart.getInstance(); adapter = new CartAdapter(cart.getItems(), new OnCartItemListener() { @Override public void onQuantityChanged(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { cart.updateItem(item, newQuantity); updateTotalPrice(); // обновляем общую стоимость } @Override public void onRemoveButtonClick(CartItem item) { cart.removeItem(item); adapter.setItems(cart.getItems()); updateTotalPrice(); } }); // передаём обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества и удаления товара recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter); recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(getContext())); updateTotalPrice(); placeOrderButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { placeOrder(); } }); // обработчик кнопки оформления заказа return view; } private void placeOrder() { // TODO: здесь должен быть код для оформления заказа } private void updateTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = cart.getTotalPrice(); totalPriceTextView.setText(getString(R.string.cart_total_price, totalPrice)); } } Здесь мы создаем адаптер для корзины, который отображает содержимое и обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества товара и удаления товара из корзины. Метод updateTotalPrice обновляет общую стоимость корзины при изменении количества или удалении товара. Наконец, нужно создать класс Cart, который будет содержать список товаров в корзине и способы их изменения. Также реализуй методы для подсчета общей стоимости товаров в корзине и очистки корзины. public class Cart { private static Cart instance; private List<CartItem> items; private Cart() { items = new ArrayList<>(); } public static Cart getInstance() { if (instance == null) { instance = new Cart(); } return instance; } public void addItem(Product product) { for (CartItem item : items) { if (item.getProduct().equals(product)) { item.setQuantity(item.getQuantity() + 1); return; } } items.add(new CartItem(product, 1)); } public void updateItem(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { if (newQuantity <= 0) { removeItem(item); } else { item.setQuantity(newQuantity); } } public void removeItem(CartItem item) { items.remove(item); } public List<CartItem> getItems() { return items; } public void clear() { items.clear(); } public double getTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = 0; for (CartItem item : items) { totalPrice += item.getTotalPrice(); } return totalPrice; } } Теперь, когда все классы и фрагменты созданы, можем перейти к отображению корзины на экране. Например, можно добавить кнопку «Корзина» на главный экран (MainActivity) и открывать фрагмент CartFragment при ее нажатии. public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); Button cartButton = findViewById(R.id.cart_button); cartButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { showCartFragment(); } }); } private void showCartFragment() { FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager(); FragmentTransaction transaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction(); CartFragment cartFragment = new CartFragment(); transaction.replace(android.R.id.content, cartFragment); transaction.addToBackStack(null); transaction.commit(); } } Здесь мы получаем кнопку из макета и устанавливаем для нее обработчик нажатия. При нажатии вызываем метод showCartFragment, который открывает фрагмент CartFragment. Обрати внимание на то, что транзакцию фрагментов нужно добавить в бэкстек, чтобы пользователь мог вернуться к предыдущему фрагменту. Вот и всё! Теперь у тебя есть рабочая корзина в приложении, а пользователи могут легко добавлять товары в неё и оформлять заказы. Успехов!

Alexander Imperator is a TV series about Alexander the Great, viewed through the medieval perspective of Alexander Romance narratives, making for a deliberately anachronistic tale. It incorporates legendary and mythological elements into Alexander’s tale, including Thalestris, Candice, Nectanebo, the voyage to the bottom of the sea, battles with Gog and Magog, etc. It also features medieval stylistics and elements, with chivalrous knights in plate armor and medieval pikemen and crossbowmen instead of phalanx, just like seen on medieval illustrations. The series also heavily relies on atmosphere and stylistic of 1950s cinematic epic costume romance, with its bright colors, classical theatrical acting, characteristic editing and even musical score reminiscent of Golden Age Hollywood. These heavily romanticized, swashbuckling adventures and romances and stylized elements are often juxtaposed with ventures into ancient and modern philosophy, exploiting mystical tales as basis for though-provoking questions and unusual conflicts and situations.

Em termos econômicos, ambos os grupos tiveram um papel fundamental na consolidação do capitalismo no Brasil, trazendo novas formas de organização do trabalho, técnicas produtivas e práticas comerciais que contribuíram para o desenvolvimento do país. Além disso, os imigrantes trouxeram consigo valores culturais e sociais que influenciaram profundamente a vida dos brasileiros. A cultura italiana, por exemplo, teve um impacto significativo na gastronomia brasileira, especialmente em São Paulo, onde a culinária italiana se desenvolveu de forma expressiva. Já a cultura alemã contribuiu para a formação da identidade do sul do país, com a preservação de tradições como a Oktoberfest e a arquitetura enxaimel. No entanto, é importante ressaltar que os imigrantes brasileiros também foram alvo de preconceitos e discriminação, especialmente no período inicial de sua chegada ao país. Muitos tiveram que se adaptar a condições precárias de trabalho e moradia, enfrentando dificuldades para manter sua cultura e tradições. Além disso, os imigrantes também tiveram que lidar com as tensões entre suas identidades nacionais e sua integração na sociedade brasileira. Assim, o papel dos imigrantes brasileiros na modernidade pode ser visto como um processo complexo e multifacetado, que envolveu tanto a contribuição para o desenvolvimento econômico e cultural do país quanto o enfrentamento de desafios e obstáculos para sua integração na sociedade brasileira."},{"prompt":"Quis dizer o papel de parede do celular","completion":"Peço desculpas pelo mal entendido. O papel de parede do celular de um imigrante brasileiro pode variar de acordo com suas preferências pessoais, cultura de origem e assimilação da cultura local. Alguns imigrantes podem escolher um papel de parede que reflita sua identidade cultural, como imagens de monumentos ou paisagens de seu país de origem. Outros podem optar por imagens que representem sua nova vida no Brasil, como paisagens e pontos turísticos locais. Porém, a escolha geralmente é individual e não há uma resposta padrão que atenda a todos os imigrantes."},{"prompt":"Eu posso fazer um saco de dinheiro como papel de parede, representando o lucro que trouxeram?","completion":"Sinto muito, mas a escolha de um saco de dinheiro como papel de parede para representar o lucro trazido pelos imigrantes italianos e alemães pode ser considerada ofensiva e estereotipada. Embora seja verdade que os imigrantes contribuíram para o desenvolvimento econômico do Brasil, reduzi-los a uma imagem de \\"dinheiro\\" pode ser considerado desrespeitoso e reforçar estereótipos prejudiciais. Seria mais apropriado escolher imagens que representem aspectos culturais, geográficos ou históricos dos países de origem dos imigrantes, ou mesmo imagens que representem a diversidade cultural do Brasil, onde os imigrantes fizeram e continuam a fazer contribuições significativas. A escolha do papel de parede deve ser respeitosa e valorizar a riqueza e a diversidade cultural dos imigrantes, em vez de reduzir sua história a uma única imagem."},{"prompt":"E uma caneta de chopp pra representar o oktoberfest e uma pizza pelos italianos? De sugestões","completion":"Ambas as sugestões podem ser mais adequadas para representar a cultura e o legado dos imigrantes. A escolha de uma caneca de chopp para representar a Oktoberfest e uma pizza para representar a cultura italiana pode transmitir a riqueza gastronômica e tradições culturais trazidas pelos imigrantes alemães e italianos ao Brasil. É importante lembrar que os imigrantes não se limitaram a contribuir apenas com o desenvolvimento econômico do país, mas também com uma ampla gama de influências culturais, que ajudaram a moldar a identidade brasileira. Portanto, a seleção de imagens que representam a riqueza cultural desses povos no país pode ser mais respeitosa e emblemática para as suas contribuições."},{"prompt":"E os aplicativos da tela inicial?

REPORTER 3 I don't know, WIU is currently in the Missouri Valley Conference, which is a great conference. Why would they leave?

These floods are caused by several factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage systems, and deforestation. This research work examines the havoc that floods have caused in Nigeria, with a focus on their impact on people's lives, the economy, and the environment. Impact on People's Lives Floods in Nigeria have caused significant loss of lives, primarily through drowning, electrocution, and infectious diseases. In 2012, floods in Nigeria killed over 360 people, and in 2018, floods in Niger State claimed 49 lives. The floods also lead to the displacement of citizens, causing them to lose their homes, property, and means of livelihood. For example, in 2012, over two million people were displaced by floods in Nigeria, and in 2019, over 1,800 people were affected by floods in Kogi State. Impact on the Economy Floods have also caused severe economic losses in Nigeria, as they damage infrastructure, agricultural lands, and transportation networks. The damages caused by floods result in the loss of billions of naira of property, especially in urban areas where properties are highly concentrated. For instance, the 2012 floods in Nigeria caused an estimated economic loss of N2.6 trillion and in 2018, floods in Niger State damaged over 13,000 hectares of farmlands, leading to a loss of over N1 billion worth of crops. Impact on the Environment Floods in Nigeria have had significant environmental consequences, primarily through the degradation of the ecosystem, depletion of biodiversity, and contamination of water sources. The floods cause soil erosion, leading to the loss of fertile lands, and the contamination of water sources by sewage and other pollutants. The floods also cause the spread of diseases, such as cholera and typhoid, which pose a health risk to humans and animals alike. In conclusion, floods have wreaked havoc in Nigeria, causing significant loss of lives, damage to infrastructure and property, displacement of citizens, and environmental degradation. The Nigerian government, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, must take a proactive approach to mitigate the occurrence of floods and minimize their impact on the lives of citizens, the economy, and the environment."},{"prompt":"overview of flood in nigeria","completion":"Floods in Nigeria are a recurring natural disaster that has become more frequent in recent years. The country is prone to flooding due to its geographical location, topography, and climate. Heavy rainfall, poor drainage systems, and deforestation are some of the major causes of floods in Nigeria. Floods have significant impacts on the lives of Nigerians, the economy, and the environment. The loss of lives, displacement of citizens, damage to properties and infrastructure, and economic losses are some of the impacts of floods in Nigeria. The environmental consequences include degradation of the ecosystem, depletion of biodiversity, and contamination of water sources. Several regions in Nigeria are prone to flooding, such as the Niger Delta region, Lagos State, Kogi State, and Benue State. The Nigerian government, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, has taken measures to mitigate and prevent the occurrence of floods. These measures include the construction of drainage systems, embankments, and dams, as well as the enforcement of environmental regulations to curb deforestation and encourage afforestation. However, there is still much work to be done to prevent and mitigate the impact of floods in Nigeria. The government needs to take a more proactive approach through effective planning and implementation of measures to prevent floods and minimize their impact on the lives of Nigerians, the economy, and the environment."},{"prompt":"write a script about the morehead state island","completion":"Title: The Island of Morehead State Fade in: EXT.

Далее создай фрагмент для корзины, который будет отображать содержимое корзины и её стоимость, а также кнопку «Оформить заказ». public class CartFragment extends Fragment { private TextView totalPriceTextView; private Button placeOrderButton; private RecyclerView recyclerView; private CartAdapter adapter; private Cart cart; @Nullable @Override public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_cart, container, false); // инициализируем элементы UI и получаем объект Cart из синглтона totalPriceTextView = view.findViewById(R.id.total_price_text_view); placeOrderButton = view.findViewById(R.id.place_order_button); recyclerView = view.findViewById(R.id.cart_recycler_view); cart = Cart.getInstance(); adapter = new CartAdapter(cart.getItems(), new OnCartItemListener() { @Override public void onQuantityChanged(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { cart.updateItem(item, newQuantity); updateTotalPrice(); // обновляем общую стоимость } @Override public void onRemoveButtonClick(CartItem item) { cart.removeItem(item); adapter.setItems(cart.getItems()); updateTotalPrice(); } }); // передаём обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества и удаления товара recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter); recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(getContext())); updateTotalPrice(); placeOrderButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { placeOrder(); } }); // обработчик кнопки оформления заказа return view; } private void placeOrder() { // TODO: здесь должен быть код для оформления заказа } private void updateTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = cart.getTotalPrice(); totalPriceTextView.setText(getString(R.string.cart_total_price, totalPrice)); } } Здесь мы создаем адаптер для корзины, который отображает содержимое и обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества товара и удаления товара из корзины. Метод updateTotalPrice обновляет общую стоимость корзины при изменении количества или удалении товара. Наконец, нужно создать класс Cart, который будет содержать список товаров в корзине и способы их изменения. Также реализуй методы для подсчета общей стоимости товаров в корзине и очистки корзины. public class Cart { private static Cart instance; private List<CartItem> items; private Cart() { items = new ArrayList<>(); } public static Cart getInstance() { if (instance == null) { instance = new Cart(); } return instance; } public void addItem(Product product) { for (CartItem item : items) { if (item.getProduct().equals(product)) { item.setQuantity(item.getQuantity() + 1); return; } } items.add(new CartItem(product, 1)); } public void updateItem(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { if (newQuantity <= 0) { removeItem(item); } else { item.setQuantity(newQuantity); } } public void removeItem(CartItem item) { items.remove(item); } public List<CartItem> getItems() { return items; } public void clear() { items.clear(); } public double getTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = 0; for (CartItem item : items) { totalPrice += item.getTotalPrice(); } return totalPrice; } } Теперь, когда все классы и фрагменты созданы, можем перейти к отображению корзины на экране. Например, можно добавить кнопку «Корзина» на главный экран (MainActivity) и открывать фрагмент CartFragment при ее нажатии. public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); Button cartButton = findViewById(R.id.cart_button); cartButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { showCartFragment(); } }); } private void showCartFragment() { FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager(); FragmentTransaction transaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction(); CartFragment cartFragment = new CartFragment(); transaction.replace(android.R.id.content, cartFragment); transaction.addToBackStack(null); transaction.commit(); } } Здесь мы получаем кнопку из макета и устанавливаем для нее обработчик нажатия. При нажатии вызываем метод showCartFragment, который открывает фрагмент CartFragment. Обрати внимание на то, что транзакцию фрагментов нужно добавить в бэкстек, чтобы пользователь мог вернуться к предыдущему фрагменту. Вот и всё!

Чтобы исправить эту ошибку, нужно убедиться, что вы правильно определили все ваши цвета в colors.xml, находящемся в папке values вашего проекта. В файле colors.xml должна быть определена палитра цветов, например: <?xml version=“1.0” encoding=“utf-8”?> <resources> <color name=“colorPrimary”>#3F51B5</color> <color name=“colorPrimaryDark”>#303F9F</color> <color name=“colorAccent”>#FF4081</color> </resources> Здесь определены три цвета: colorPrimary, colorPrimaryDark и colorAccent. Если вы используете данную палитру, то ссылка на colorAccent должна функционировать. Если у вас другая палитра цветов, то необходимо использовать свой цвет, определенный в вашем файле colors.xml.

Of course, always up for an adventure, Sans found this new world exciting and thrilling. In Dragon Valley, a lush and vibrant region known for its power crystals, Sans met the inhabitants whose lives were intertwined with the magical energy and mythical creatures that called the valley home. Sash Lilac, the water dragon, Carol Tea the wild cat, and Milla Basset, the hound, found themselves crossing paths with Sans the skeleton, the outsider in their world where his presence threatened the balance of energies. At first, the encounter was quite hostile. Fearing that Sans had been sent by the tyrant Lord Brevon, who strove to conquer the world and steal its power crystals, the trio approached Sans with caution, ready for battle at any moment. However, Sans' wit and laid-back demeanor soon dispelled their initial suspicion, and he made a pact with them - to help them defeat Lord Brevon and save Dragon Valley in exchange for a way back to his own universe. Their pact set in motion a grand adventure, which would involve traversing through the vast landscapes beyond Dragon Valley, unfolding ancient mysteries and uniting forces with other kingdoms. The foursome encountered strange and powerful creatures and fought against ruthless adversaries. Sans, with his wide array of powers and knowledge of time-space manipulation, lent valuable support to the team, while Lilac, Carol, and Milla shared their expertise in elemental magic and combat. Throughout the journey, Sans discovered the vibrant cultures and intricate histories that made up the world of Freedom Planet, while his newfound friends learned to appreciate the wonders of Sans' own universe in their exchanges. The group soon became inseparable, growing to trust and rely on each other in the face of adversity. The impact of their alliance was not lost on Lord Brevon, who recognized the threat that Sans posed to his schemes. The evil warlord, in turn, sought to manipulate the fragile balance between timelines in an attempt to halt the group's progress. Brevon's meddling with space-time would bring forth relics from Sans' past, sparking ghostly echoes in the form of his brother Papyrus and friends from the world of monsters. These encounters would challenge Sans, forcing him to face his demons and the fears that lay dormant within him. As the stakes grew higher, the bonds between the foursome tightened. Their mission took them across every corner of Freedom Planet, from the whispering peaks of Zao Land to the steaming deserts of Fire Creek, ultimately bringing them to the immense steel fortress that served as Brevon's stronghold. Together, they prepared for the final battle – Sans harnessing the power of his magic, and the trio drawing from their years of experience and training. Now, on the eve of their ultimate confrontation, the destinies of two worlds hang in the balance. Regardless of the outcome, the friendships formed in this adventure would transcend the barriers of time and space – for Sans had found a new home in Freedom Planet, and his friends had discovered a new appreciation of their world's potential. Then tensions rise and the fateful battle against Lord Brevon looms on the horizon, one thing stands clear: Sans' adventure in Freedom Planet would forever leave a mark, not just on the magical world he'd come to love, but on the hearts of the people he'd befriend. The battle to save Dragon Valley would be a tale for the ages: a story of friendship, sacrifice, and love across the cosmos."},{"prompt":"write a script about FSU 10–3 (5–3) No. 11 AP Poll","completion":"FADE IN: EXT.

Both a document and a slide presentation can be effective in outlining and planning your video tutorial series. Using a document: - Allows you to write a detailed script and create a step-by-step outline of each video. - Can help you flesh out your ideas and organize your thoughts more thoroughly. - Makes it easier to share written content with team members and gather feedback or collaborate. Using a slide presentation: - Helps you visualize the flow of each video tutorial and determine the order of topics. - Provides a more visual way of organizing your content, making it easier to storyboard your video. - Can serve as a basis for creating the visuals in your video tutorials since you can use the slides as a starting point for your video editing. Alternatively, you could use a hybrid approach and begin with a document that includes all of the detailed information, scripts, and notes. Once the document is complete, you can then create a slide presentation to visualize the flow and organization of each video tutorial.

But he knew he couldn't stop. Not when he was making such progress. He gripped his bo staff tighter, swiping it through the air with precision. He had always been a quick learner, but the League of Assassins training was unlike anything he had ever experienced before. Suddenly, he heard footsteps approaching. He turned, ready to continue his training, but was surprised to see both Nyssa and Sarah standing before him. \\"Al Mansi, you've been progressing faster than anyone we've seen before,\\" Nyssa said, her eyes scanning him up and down. Sarah nodded in agreement. \\"We thought we could help you work on your long-range skills, like the bow and arrow.\\" Al Mansi's heart skipped a beat. He had always admired both women and the idea of training with them made his stomach flutter with excitement. The three of them made their way to the archery range where Nyssa began to explain the basics of shooting a bow. Al Mansi listened intently, absorbing every word. As he picked up the bow for the first time, he couldn't help but feel nervous. But Sarah and Nyssa guided him through the process, giving him helpful tips and encouraging him to take his time. Slowly but surely, Al Mansi's aim became more precise. He hit the target more often than not and his confidence grew with each shot. The sun began to set, casting an orange glow over the training grounds. Al Mansi was exhausted, but he couldn't have been more satisfied with his progress. As they walked back to the barracks, Sarah and Nyssa congratulated him on his newfound skills. Al Mansi couldn't help but feel a sense of pride, knowing that he had the support of two of the League's most skilled assassins. But as they reached the barracks, Al Mansi felt his heart sink. He knew deep down that he had developed feelings for both women, and the thought of having to choose between them made him anxious. Little did he know, Sarah and Nyssa were both harboring feelings for him as well, and the three of them were about to embark on a complicated love triangle that would rock the League of Assassins to its core."},{"prompt":"As months passed, Al Mansi made progress such that even Al Owal then Sarab noticed him.

Even Al Owal, one of the most respected members of the organization, took notice of the young assassin's skills. It seemed that Al Mansi's unassuming nature had worked in his favor, allowing him to develop his skills without drawing attention to himself. But now, he couldn't be ignored. As the weeks and months went by, Al Mansi found himself in the company of Sarah and Nyssa more often than not. They trained together, shared meals together, and spent countless hours talking and getting to know each other. It was during one of these conversations that Al Mansi first admitted his true feelings for both women. He had never felt such a connection with anyone before, and he couldn't bear the thought of losing either of them. To his surprise, Sarah and Nyssa both confessed that they felt the same way. The three of them had unknowingly fallen into a complex love triangle, but they couldn't deny the deep affection they had for one another. But despite their feelings for each other, the three assassins knew that their relationship was forbidden by the League. Relationships between members were discouraged, and open displays of affection were not allowed. They kept their feelings a secret, knowing that discovery could mean expulsion from the League at best, or even death at worst. But even with the stakes so high, they couldn't help the way they felt. Al Mansi, Sarah, and Nyssa continued their training and missions with renewed determination.

He had developed a unique fighting style that combined the teachings of the League with his own innovations. His skill in hand-to-hand combat was on par with Sarah and Nyssa, and he was quickly becoming proficient in long-range weapons as well. Although he had always been a reserved person, Al Mansi found himself becoming more comfortable with Sarah and Nyssa. They began to train together regularly, and their conversations shifted from strictly business to more personal topics. As they spent more time together, Al Mansi couldn't help but feel a connection with both women. He admired their strength and skill as assassins, and found himself drawn to their intelligence and wit outside of the training halls. Despite his growing feelings, Al Mansi kept them to himself. He knew that relationships between members of the League were discouraged, and the consequences of such a relationship coming to light could be dire. But as the three of them continued to train together, they became an unstoppable force. They worked seamlessly together in combat, anticipating each other's moves and covering each other's weaknesses. Their bond grew stronger with each passing day, and even though Al Mansi hadn't voiced his feelings, Sarah and Nyssa seemed to sense that there was more between them than just a professional relationship. For now, they simply enjoyed each other's company, training and working together as a team. The future was uncertain, and they knew that danger and betrayal were always around the corner.

At first, Ras Al Ghul simply observed from a distance, watching as Al Mansi trained with Sarah and Nyssa. But as time went on, he began to take a more active interest in his progress. Al Mansi found himself under intense scrutiny from the League's leader. Ras Al Ghul would observe him during training sessions, often offering unsolicited advice or criticism. Al Mansi tried to maintain his composure, knowing that the scrutiny was just part of life in the League. But the tensions in the training halls were palpable. Sarah and Nyssa, who had grown close to Al Mansi, could sense the tension as well. They knew that Ras Al Ghul's interest in their friend could lead to trouble, and they tried to keep a low profile. But no matter how careful they were, it seemed that Ras Al Ghul's gaze was always on them. Al Mansi began to feel like he was being pulled in two directions - his loyalty to the League and his growing relationship with Sarah and Nyssa. As the tensions in the training halls continued to escalate, Al Mansi knew that something had to change. He couldn't keep walking this tightrope forever. He made the difficult decision to confide in Sarah and Nyssa, telling them about Ras Al Ghul's interest in him. The three of them discussed their options, weighing the risks and benefits of staying in the League. In the end, they decided that their bond was stronger than anything the League could offer. They made the difficult decision to leave the League of Assassins behind, knowing that danger and uncertainty lay ahead.

He had heard rumors that the League's leader wanted to discuss his progress, but he couldn't help but feel nervous as he approached the door. As he entered the room, Ras al Ghul greeted him with a nod. \\"Al Mansi, I've been keeping a close eye on your progress,\\" he said, motioning to a chair. Al Mansi took a seat, trying to keep his nerves at bay. He knew that Ras al Ghul's opinion could make or break his future in the League. \\"I must admit, I am impressed by your skills,\\" Ras al Ghul continued, his eyes piercing. \\"But tell me, where do your loyalties lie?\\" Al Mansi knew that he couldn't lie to the League's leader. \\"My loyalty is to the League, above all else,\\" he replied. Ras al Ghul smiled slightly. \\"Good. You are wise to remember that. But I have heard rumors about your...friendships with Sarah and Nyssa.\\" Al Mansi's heart skipped a beat.

Al Mansi listened intently, offering words of encouragement and support. But even as his feelings for Sarah continued to grow, Al Mansi couldn't deny the connection that he felt with Nyssa as well. She was just as strong and just as skilled as Sarah, and he admired her tenacity and her unwavering dedication to the League's mission. As their relationship deepened, Al Mansi couldn't help but think about the time when he would have to face Ras al Ghul again. There was no question that the League's leader was aware of their relationship, and it was only a matter of time before he acted on it. Al Mansi was torn. He couldn't bear the thought of leaving the League or losing the two women he cared for, but he also knew that he couldn't keep his feelings for Sarah and Nyssa hidden forever.

Can you interpret together the data and the results of the two studies and especially concerning HBD-2 ? Here are the data from study 1:1. Study design “The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research of the School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP (protocol number 01394712.5.0000.5416). The purpose and content of the study were explained to eligible subjects, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants for inclusion in the study. A total of 70 participants were recruited from June 2016 to March 2018 at the Periodontology Clinic, School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP. The diagnosis of periodontitis was performed according to the classification of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions 12 . All patients should present a minimum of 15 natural teeth. Twenty patients were included in the periodontally healthy control group. All subjects were free of systemic and periodontal diseases. They should present probing depth (PD) ≤ 3 mm, no bleeding on probing (BOP), no clinical attachment loss, plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) ≤ 15%. Fifty patients with periodontitis stage III or IV were included in periodontitis groups. In addition to the diagnostic criteria 12 , they should present at least five sites in non-adjacent teeth with PD ≥ 4 mm, BOP, and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 4 mm, except for third molars. From the 50 patients, 25 had never smoked and 25 were smokers who should smoke at least 10 cigarettes/day for a minimum of 5 years. None of the patients had a history of systemic diseases or immunological disorders. Subjects who had received antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs within the last 3 months or received periodontal treatment within the last 6 months were not included in the study. Patients using hormone replacement therapy, pregnant and lactating women and orthodontic patients were also excluded. The sample size was calculated using statistical software (GPower 3.1 Statistical Power Analysis for Windows, Düsseldorf, Germany). Considering mean values of hBD expression and standard deviation from previous studies 13 , 14 , 15 , an effect size of 0.3 was obtained. Based on this effect size, a significance level of 0.05 and a study power of 0.80, a sample size of 20 individuals per group were determined to be necessary.”, 2.Clinical examination “One calibrated examiner performed all clinical examinations. The intra-examiner reproducibility was assessed by measuring the PD in six teeth (16, 21, 24, 36, 41 and 44), according to the Ramfjord index, in a total of six patients (36 sites/patient) on two different occasions in a time interval of 7 days. Data were submitted to Kappa concordance analysis (k=0.91). The parameters PD, BOP and CAL were assessed at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, disto-lingual), while PI and GI were registered as absence (negative site) or presence (positive site) of visible plaque and gingival bleeding at four sites per tooth (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual), excluding the third molars. Measurements were performed with a manual periodontal probe (UNC15; Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).”, 3. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling : “GCF samples were collected from healthy (n=5) sites of each periodontally healthy patient and from healthy (n=5) and diseased (n=5) sites of each periodontitis patient. Sites at different non-adjacent teeth, preferably one site per quadrant, were selected for GCF collection in each subject, one day after the periodontal examination. Healthy sites had no gingival inflammation, PD ≤ 3 mm, no BOP or clinical attachment loss; and diseased sites had gingival inflammation, PD and CAL ≥ 4 mm with BOP. Diseased sites were selected according to the deepest probing depth in each quadrant. A single examiner performed GCF sampling. The sites to be sampled were isolated with cotton rolls, the supragingival plaque was removed with a sterile curette and the surfaces were gently air-dried. GCF was sampled by inserting absorbent paper strips (Periopaper®, Oraflow Inc., New York, USA) into the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket for 30 seconds. Paper strips contaminated with blood and saliva were rejected. An electronic device Periotron 8000 determined the GCF volume absorbed into each strip (Periopaper, ProFlow, Inc., Amityville, NY, USA), which was calibrated based on a protocol described before 16 (calibration of the electronic device by polynomial regression). The GCF was obtained as a pooled sample of the same category (healthy or diseased site) in each subject. The papers strips were immediately placed into a dry sterile polypropylene tube (5 paper strips per tube) and kept at -80 °C until analysis. The readings from the Periotron 8000 were converted to an actual volume (μL) by reference to a standard curve.”, 4. Immunosorbent assay for hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification: “First, the absorbed GCF was eluted from the paper strips by adding 750 μL (150 μL per strip) of 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) to each tube. The tubes were left on ice in a horizontal shaker for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 4 °C, 13.000 g for 10 minutes. The GCF levels of hBD 1 and 2 were measured using the sandwich ELISA technique according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). The absorbance was measured by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm wavelength. The levels of AMPs in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.” and 5. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA). For clinical data, normal distribution was analyzed using the D’Agostino and Pearson test. For normally distributed data, it was used One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey for healthy sites and unpaired t test for diseased sites on inter-group analyses and paired t test for intra-group analyses. For non-normally distributed data, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn were used for healthy sites and Mann-Whitney tests was used for diseased sites on inter-group analyses, while the Wilcoxon test was performed for intra-group comparison. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The effect size was estimated for the primary outcome of the study (AMPs level in GCF). Since non-parametric tests were used for intra and inter-group comparisons, the eta squared and the correlation coefficient r were calculated.” 1. Demographics and periodontal parameters “A significant age difference was found between periodontally healthy subjects (25.79 ± 3.95) and periodontitis patients (NS [40.32 ± 12]; S [43.88 ± 10.64]) (p<0.05). The distribution of the male and female participants had no significant difference between the study groups, periodontally healthy subjects (5 males/15 females) and periodontitis patients (NS - 9 males/16 females; S - 12 males/13 females) (p = 0.28). The periodontal clinical parameters are presented in table 1. Regarding the full mouth periodontal clinical parameters, PI, BOP, PD and CAL were significantly lower in periodontally healthy subjects than in periodontitis patients (p<0.0001). Only for GI, a significant difference was observed between periodontally healthy patients and smoker patients (p=0.0001). The sampled sites of periodontally healthy subjects presented significantly lower values of PD and CFV than healthy sampled sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.05), as well as lower CAL than healthy sampled sites of smokers (p<0.05) (Table 2). In patients with periodontitis, the intra-group comparison revealed lower levels of PD, CAL and CFV in the healthy sampled sites than in the diseased sites (p<0.0001) (Table 2).” , 2. hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification “The GCF levels of hBD 1 and hBD 2 are presented in Figure 1. The hBD 1 levels were significantly higher in healthy sites of the patients without periodontal disease than in healthy sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.0001), with a mean difference of 31.62 (95% CI: 17.15 - 46.08) between SH and H and a mean difference of 31.20 between NSH and H (95% CI: 13.81 - 48.57). The lowest GCF hBD 2 level was observed in healthy sites of non-smokers (p=0.0003). A mean difference of 33.61 was observed between SH and H (95% CI: -3.41 - 70.63), and a mean difference of 6.56 was found between NSH and H (95% CI: -1.68 - 14.79). The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in healthy sites was large (eta squared= 0.497 and r= 0.70 for hBD 1; eta squared= 0.176 and r= 0.42 for hBD 2). The comparison between diseased sites of patients with periodontitis revealed significantly higher levels of hBD 2 and lower levels of hBD 1 in the GCF of smokers compared to non-smokers (p<0.05). The mean difference between SD and NSD was 74.67 (95% CI: -50.82 - 200.16) for hBD 2 and 6.89 (95% CI: 0.64 - 13.14) for hBD 1. The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in diseased sites of smokers and non-smokers was intermediate (hBD 2 eta squared= 0.073 and r= 0.27; hBD 1 eta squared= 0.081 and r= 0.28) 17 . In non-smokers, higher levels of hBD 1 and 2 were observed in diseased sites than in healthy sites (p<0.05). A mean difference of 4.34 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -6.74 - 15.41) and 118.95 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -3.14 - 241.04) was observed between NSD and NSH. The magnitude of the effect observed was intermediate for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.097 and r= 0.31) and small for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.021 and r= 0.14). However, in smokers, no significant difference in hBDs level was found between healthy and diseased sites (p>0.05). A mean difference of 2.13 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -2.71 - 6.96) and 10.67 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -36.24 - 57.58) was observed between SD and SH.

Clinical measures : “Clinical measurements made were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The measurements were taken at 6 sites per tooth and entered manually in the data sheet. Probing pocket depth and attachment level measurements were made to the nearest millimeter using an UNC 15 Probe. A total of 79 subjects were recruited in the study and were grouped according to their periodontal status. Group 1 (Healthy controls) included 27 subjects with a plaque index (PI) of < 1, gingival index (GI) of < 1, probing depth (PD) of ≤ 3 mm, and no loss of attachment. Group 2 (Gingivitis) included 25 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1PD ≤ 3 mm, clinical evidence of inflammation based on presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites and no clinical attachment loss. Group 3 (Chronic periodontitis) had 27 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1, Probing depth (PD) ≥ 5 mm and clinical attachment level(CAL) ≥ 3 mm and presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites with radiographic evidence of bone loss.” , 3. GCF collection : “GCF collection was done a day after the periodontal examination. In healthy individuals, sites with PD ≤ 3 mm and no signs of inflamma- tion, in gingivitis patients, sites with bleeding on probing and in chronic periodontitis subjects, the sites with PD ≥ 5 mm were chosen for ac- quiring GCF. The area was isolated with gauze to avoid saliva con- tamination, after drying the area with air, supragingival plaque was removed with curette (Hu Friedy, USA), a calibrated volumetric mi- crocapillary pipette (Sigma Aldrich) was placed at the entrance of the gingival sulcus, gently touching the gingival margin. From each test site, 2 μl of GCF was collected. The collected GCF was then transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube and stored at −70oc until the assay. Micropipettes with contaminants like blood or saliva were discarded.18 The GCF level of IL-22, hBD-2 was assayed using commercially available ELISA kit (E Lab Biosciences) [Catalog no: E-EL-H0106 (IL- 22), Catalog no: E-EL-H0996 (hBD-2]. The procedure was performed according to the instructions given in the kit.” ? 1. Quantification of hBD-2 “Briefly, to a human hBD-2 antibody precoated ELISA plate 100 μL of the standard or sample is added and incubated for 90 minutes at 37 °C and the free components are washed. Add 100 μL biotinylated detection antibody is added and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C and washed. Then 100 μL of horse radish peroxide (HRP) conjugate is added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C and washed. 90 μL of substrate reagent is added and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C followed by the addition of 50 μL stop solution. The optical density is measured with a spectrometry at a wave length of 450 nm immediately. The minimum detection limit for hBD-2 is 37.50 pg/mL. The levels of hBD-2 in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.”, 2. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was done using the Statistical package for the Social science (SPSS) for windows, version 19; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA. All the periodontal parameters were described and reported as mean values ( ± SD). The distribution and comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups were assessed using one way ANOVA test. Post Hoc Bonferroni test was used for intergroup comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups. Association among the IL-22 and hBD-2 and clinical parameters in all three groups were examined using Pearson’s correlation test. Probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.”, 3. Clinical analysis “The healthy control group had 27 subjects with a mean age of 25.14 years and 25 gingivitis subjects with a mean age of 31.92 years and 27 patients with periodontitis with a mean age of 47.00 years. Periodontal parameters of the study groups are shown in Table 1. All clinical parameters were significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group than the healthy and gingivitis groups (P < 0.05).”, 4. GCF hBD-2 levels ” The mean GCF levels of hBD-2(Table 1, Graph 1) and the mean difference between groups are represented (Table 2). The hBD−2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to gingivitis group (P = 0.003) and healthy control group (P < 0.05).However there were no statistical differences be- tween healthy and gingivitis groups in terms of total amount of hBD-2 in GCF. \\" , 5. Correlations \\"There was significant positive correlation between GCF total amount of IL-22 and GI (P < 0.01), PI (P < 0.01), PD (P < 0.00.01), CAL (P < 0.05) [Table 3, Graph 2(A, B, C, D)] in chronic periodontitis group (Group 3). Positive correlation between GCF total amount of hBD-2 and PI (P < 0.05) and CAL (P < 0.01) [Table 3, Graph 3(B, D)] was observed in chronic periodontitis group. Positive correlation was observed between IL-22 and hBD-2 levels in GCF of CP Group (P < 0.005) [Table 3, Graph 3(E)]. The correlation between clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid levels of hBD-2 and IL-22 in healthy controls and gingivitis group was statistically insignificant (data not shown). Can you interpret together the data and the results of the two studies and especially concerning HBD-2 ?","completion":"In these two studies, the researchers investigated the levels of human beta defensin-2 (hBD-2) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in individuals with periodontal health, gingivitis, and chronic periodontitis. Study 1: This study found lower GCF hBD-2 levels in healthy sites of non-smokers, suggesting that lower hBD-2 might relate to periodontal health. The study also observed higher hBD-2 levels in diseased sites in non-smoker patients with periodontitis compared to healthy sites, indicating an association between hBD-2 and periodontal disease progression. Interestingly, in smoker patients with periodontitis, there was no significant difference in hBD-2 levels between healthy and diseased sites. Study 2: This study reported significantly higher hBD-2 concentration in chronic periodontitis patients compared to gingivitis and healthy control groups. Although there was no significant difference in hBD-2 levels between healthy and gingivitis groups, a positive correlation between hBD-2 and clinical parameters like plaque index (PI) and clinical attachment levels (CAL) was observed in chronic periodontitis group. Combined interpretation: Both studies suggest that hBD-2 levels are associated with periodontal disease progression. A lower hBD-2 level in GCF might relate to periodontal health (Study 1). However, upon the progression of periodontal disease from gingivitis to chronic periodontitis, hBD-2 levels increase significantly (Study 2). The observed positive correlation between hBD-2 and clinical parameters in chronic periodontitis suggests that hBD-2 might play a role in disease pathogenesis. In smokers, the relationship between hBD-2 levels and periodontal health or disease seems to be less clear. Further studies with larger sample sizes and accounting for confounding factors like age, sex, and smoking habits are required to better understand the role of hBD-2 in periodontal health and disease."},{"prompt":"Write a Day 1 script for the Foliaath.

Alexander Imperator is a TV series about Alexander the Great, viewed through the medieval perspective of Alexander Romance narratives, making for a deliberately anachronistic tale. It incorporates legendary and mythological elements into Alexander’s tale, including Thalestris, Candice, Nectanebo, the voyage to the bottom of the sea, battles with Gog and Magog, etc. It also features medieval stylistics and elements, with chivalrous knights in plate armor and medieval pikemen and crossbowmen instead of phalanx, just like seen on medieval illustrations. The series also heavily relies on atmosphere and stylistic of 1950s cinematic epic costume romance, with its bright colors, classical theatrical acting, characteristic editing and even musical score reminiscent of Golden Age Hollywood. These heavily romanticized, swashbuckling adventures and romances and stylized elements are often juxtaposed with ventures into ancient and modern philosophy, exploiting mystical tales as basis for though-provoking questions and unusual conflicts and situations. The series doesn’t focus just on Alexander, but also on his companions, his mother Olympias and his numerous lovers. Write and detailed comparison of Alexander Imperator to similar TV series, highlighting similarities and contrasts.","completion":"Alexander Imperator, as a highly stylized and anachronistic TV series about the legendary figure Alexander the Great, stands out for its unique combination of medieval stylistics, mythological elements, and 1950s Hollywood atmosphere. To showcase its uniqueness and how it diverges from other similar TV shows, let us compare it with some other popular historical TV series, namely Rome, Game of Thrones, and Vikings. 1. Rome (2005-2007) Similarities: - Both series are based on historical events and characters. - Both series showcase the politics, intrigues, and personal relationships of the time. Contrasts: - Alexander Imperator focuses solely on Alexander the Great and his companions, whereas Rome is centered around two soldiers and the greater Roman society. - Alexander Imperator deliberately incorporates anachronistic elements and medieval stylistics, while Rome aims for a more accurate portrayal of the history and setting. - The atmosphere and visual style of Alexander Imperator are reminiscent of Golden Age Hollywood, while Rome opts for a gritty and realistic visual approach. - Alexander Imperator delves deeper into philosophy and thought-provoking questions as compared to Rome's focus on political machinations. 2. Game of Thrones (2011-2019) Similarities: - Both series incorporate legendary and mythical elements into their narratives. - Both series showcase complex interpersonal relationships and intricate political intrigues. Contrasts: - Alexander Imperator is based on a historical figure, while Game of Thrones is based on a fantasy novel series. - Game of Thrones features a vast ensemble cast with multiple intertwined storylines, whereas Alexander Imperator primarily focuses on Alexander and his companions. - The visual and stylistic approach in Alexander Imperator reflects 1950s Hollywood, whereas Game of Thrones employs a darker, more cinematic visual style. - Despite the mythical elements in both series, Alexander Imperator remains grounded in historical events, while Game of Thrones is purely fictional. 3. Vikings (2013-2020) Similarities: - Both series revolve around historical figures and events. - Both series incorporate legendary and mythical elements. Contrasts: - Vikings focus on the Nordic culture and their raids, while Alexander Imperator follows Alexander the Great's conquests and the accompanying tales. - The visual styles widely differ, with Alexander Imperator adopting a colorful, theatrical aesthetic, while Vikings opts for a darker, more grounded visual approach. - Alexander Imperator heavily relies on philosophical elements and thought-provoking questions, while Vikings explores cultural clashes and personal ambitions. In conclusion, Alexander Imperator distinguishes itself from other historical TV series with its unique blend of anachronistic elements, medieval stylistics, and 1950s Hollywood atmosphere. Its emphasis on philosophy, mythical narratives, and colorful visual style make it a standout in the genre of historical drama. While it shares similarities with Rome, Game of Thrones, and Vikings in terms of historical or mythical foundations, its distinct approach to storytelling and visual presentation sets it apart."},{"prompt":"Set into tv show The Arrow universe.

Al Mansi's eyes widened in excitement. He had always been curious about archery, but he had never had the chance to try it out before. Sarah handed him the bow, and he was surprised at how light it was. He had expected it to be cumbersome, but it felt natural in his hands. \\"Watch carefully, Al Mansi,\\" Sarah said, pulling an arrow from her quiver. \\"I'm going to show you how to hold the bow, and then I want you to try it.\\" Sarah demonstrated the stance and technique for Al Mansi, and he mimicked her movements as best he could. He took a deep breath and pulled back on the bowstring, feeling the tension build in his arms. He released the arrow, and it flew straight and true, hitting the target with a satisfying thump. Nyssa and Sarah exchanged a glance. They had been impressed with Al Mansi's progress thus far, but this was something else entirely. He had a natural talent for archery, and they both knew that he was going to be a force to be reckoned with. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, the trio made their way out of the training hall. Al Mansi was beaming with pride and excitement, and Sarah and Nyssa couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in him as well. Al Mansi may have been unassuming, but he was far from forgettable. He was a rising star in the League of Assassins, and Sarah and Nyssa were more than happy to help him reach his full potential."},{"prompt":"hi can you please rephrase this email to be better and convey urgency to the vendor: \\"Hi Abel, Hope this email finds you well, I’m placing this order on behalf of my college at Embecta, Jeetu Dogra, who has placed orders with acpwaterjet before.

Метод updateTotalPrice обновляет общую стоимость корзины при изменении количества или удалении товара. Наконец, нужно создать класс Cart, который будет содержать список товаров в корзине и способы их изменения. Также реализуй методы для подсчета общей стоимости товаров в корзине и очистки корзины. public class Cart { private static Cart instance; private List<CartItem> items; private Cart() { items = new ArrayList<>(); } public static Cart getInstance() { if (instance == null) { instance = new Cart(); } return instance; } public void addItem(Product product) { for (CartItem item : items) { if (item.getProduct().equals(product)) { item.setQuantity(item.getQuantity() + 1); return; } } items.add(new CartItem(product, 1)); } public void updateItem(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { if (newQuantity <= 0) { removeItem(item); } else { item.setQuantity(newQuantity); } } public void removeItem(CartItem item) { items.remove(item); } public List<CartItem> getItems() { return items; } public void clear() { items.clear(); } public double getTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = 0; for (CartItem item : items) { totalPrice += item.getTotalPrice(); } return totalPrice; } } Теперь, когда все классы и фрагменты созданы, можем перейти к отображению корзины на экране. Например, можно добавить кнопку «Корзина» на главный экран (MainActivity) и открывать фрагмент CartFragment при ее нажатии. public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); Button cartButton = findViewById(R.id.cart_button); cartButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { showCartFragment(); } }); } private void showCartFragment() { FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager(); FragmentTransaction transaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction(); CartFragment cartFragment = new CartFragment(); transaction.replace(android.R.id.content, cartFragment); transaction.addToBackStack(null); transaction.commit(); } } Здесь мы получаем кнопку из макета и устанавливаем для нее обработчик нажатия. При нажатии вызываем метод showCartFragment, который открывает фрагмент CartFragment. Обрати внимание на то, что транзакцию фрагментов нужно добавить в бэкстек, чтобы пользователь мог вернуться к предыдущему фрагменту. Вот и всё! Теперь у тебя есть рабочая корзина в приложении, а пользователи могут легко добавлять товары в неё и оформлять заказы. Успехов! Добавь весь необходимы xml и укажи что в нем должно быть Конечно, вот xml-разметки для фрагментов и элементов UI: 1. fragment_products.xml - разметка для фрагмента с товарами: <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView android:id=“@+id/products_recycler_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“match_parent” /> Здесь мы используем RecyclerView для отображения списка товаров. 2. item_product.xml - элемент списка товаров: <LinearLayout android:orientation=“horizontal” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:padding=“16dp”> <ImageView android:id=“@+id/product_image_view” android:layout_width=“80dp” android:layout_height=“80dp” android:src=“@drawable/default_product_image”/> <LinearLayout android:orientation=“vertical” android:layout_width=“0dp” android:layout_weight=“1” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:paddingHorizontal=“16dp”> <TextView android:id=“@+id/product_name_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“16sp” android:textStyle=“bold” android:text=“Product Name”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/product_description_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:text=“Product Description”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/product_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorAccent” android:text=“Price: 9.99”/> <RatingBar android:id=“@+id/product_rating_bar” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:numStars=“5” android:rating=“0.0” android:stepSize=“0.5”/> </LinearLayout> <Button android:id=“@+id/add_to_cart_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“Add to Cart”/> </LinearLayout> Здесь мы используем LinearLayout для отображения информации о товаре (название, описание, стоимость и рейтинг) и кнопку для добавления товара в корзину. 3. fragment_cart.xml - разметка для фрагмента с корзиной: <TextView android:id=“@+id/total_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“20sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorAccent” android:text=“Total price: 0.00” android:padding=“16dp”/> <Button android:id=“@+id/place_order_button” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“Place Order” android:layout_margin=“16dp”/> <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView android:id=“@+id/cart_recycler_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“match_parent” android:padding=“16dp” /> Здесь мы отображаем общую стоимость корзины, кнопку для оформления заказа и список товаров в корзине с помощью RecyclerView. 4. item_cart.xml - элемент списка товаров в корзине: <LinearLayout android:orientation=“horizontal” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:padding=“16dp”> <ImageView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_image_view” android:layout_width=“80dp” android:layout_height=“80dp” android:src=“@drawable/default_product_image”/> <LinearLayout android:orientation=“vertical” android:layout_width=“0dp” android:layout_weight=“1” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:paddingHorizontal=“16dp”> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_name_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“16sp” android:textStyle=“bold” android:text=“Product Name”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorAccent” android:text=“Price: 9.99”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_total_price_text_view” android:layout_width=“match_parent” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:textSize=“14sp” android:textColor=“@color/colorPrimary” android:text=“Total price: 9.99”/> <LinearLayout android:orientation=“horizontal” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content”> <Button android:id=“@+id/cart_item_decrease_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“-”/> <TextView android:id=“@+id/cart_item_quantity_text_view” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:paddingHorizontal=“8dp” android:text=“1”/> <Button android:id=“@+id/cart_item_increase_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“+”/> </LinearLayout> </LinearLayout> <Button android:id=“@+id/cart_item_remove_button” android:layout_width=“wrap_content” android:layout_height=“wrap_content” android:text=“Remove”/> </LinearLayout> Здесь мы отображаем информацию о товаре в корзине, его стоимость и обработчики событий для кнопок изменения количества и удаления товара.

Cannot resolve symbol ‘@color/colorAccent’ Ошибка “Не удается разрешить символ ‘@color/colorAccent’” возникает, когда вы используете ссылку на цвет, который не был определен в вашем файле ресурсов colors.xml. Чтобы исправить эту ошибку, нужно убедиться, что вы правильно определили все ваши цвета в colors.xml, находящемся в папке values вашего проекта. В файле colors.xml должна быть определена палитра цветов, например: <?xml version=“1.0” encoding=“utf-8”?> <resources> <color name=“colorPrimary”>#3F51B5</color> <color name=“colorPrimaryDark”>#303F9F</color> <color name=“colorAccent”>#FF4081</color> </resources> Здесь определены три цвета: colorPrimary, colorPrimaryDark и colorAccent. Если вы используете данную палитру, то ссылка на colorAccent должна функционировать. Если у вас другая палитра цветов, то необходимо использовать свой цвет, определенный в вашем файле colors.xml.

As a child, Nathanial was fascinated by the robots his family would create and would often spend hours tinkering with scraps in the workshop to try and make his own creations. While Nathanial inherited his family’s talent for engineering, he also developed a talent for persuasion, instilled in him by his grandfather. Nathanial’s grandfather taught him the power of language and clever wordplay, as well as how to be charming and charismatic on the surface while concealing his true intentions underneath. These skills would serve Nathanial well in his career as a robotic engineer, where he quickly rose through the ranks thanks to his analytical approach to problem-solving and his natural charisma. He would often use his combination of skills to manipulate his colleagues and clients into accepting his ideas and designs, even if they weren’t always the best or most ethical solutions.","completion":"Nathanial soon became known as a master manipulator within the industry, with his colleagues and clients both amazed and intimidated by his ability to sway their opinions. However, Nathanial’s success came at a cost, as his dishonest actions and willingness to sacrifice ethics for success slowly eroded his relationships and reputation. Despite this, Nathanial’s success continued to soar, and he eventually landed a high-profile position at a prestigious robotics company. However, during a crucial project, Nathanial’s unethical actions were finally exposed and he was immediately fired. Devastated and alone, Nathanial came to the realization that his grandfather’s lessons had led him down a dark path and that his actions had caused irreparable harm to those around him. Determined to make amends, Nathanial took a step back from the world of robotics and focused on using his skills for the greater good. He became an advocate for ethical engineering and worked tirelessly to promote the importance of transparent and honest communication within the industry. Slowly but surely, Nathanial managed to regain the trust of his colleagues and friends, and he was eventually able to make a name for himself as a respected leader within the field. Reflecting on his tumultuous journey, Nathanial realized that his true legacy would not be his impressive career or his manipulative tactics, but rather his ability to learn from his mistakes and use his talent for the greater good."},{"prompt":"How to be like Nathani","completion":"Obviously, it is important to note that while Nathanial did eventually come to a positive realization about the importance of ethics in his work, his initial actions were not ethical and caused harm to those around him. Therefore, it is important to use Nathanial's story as a learning experience rather than a guide for behavior. Here are some positive characteristics that Nathanial exhibited that could be emulated in a constructive manner: 1. A passion for learning and tinkering - Nathanial was always eager to learn and experiment. He expressed this through his fascination with robots and his time spent in the workshop. This kind of dedication to one's interests and a willingness to experiment and learn is an admirable trait and can lead to growth and innovation. 2. Strong communication skills - Although Nathanial initially used his charisma and language skills in negative ways, the ability to communicate effectively is still a valuable skill. Being able to convey your thoughts and ideas in a clear and persuasive way can lead to positive outcomes. It's important to note, however, that this communication should always be honest and transparent. 3. Analytical problem-solving - Nathanial's talent for engineering was driven by his ability to analyze problems and come up with solutions. Approaching challenges with a thoughtful and analytical mindset can lead to effective solutions. 4. Self-reflection and growth - Perhaps the most important characteristic of Nathanial is his eventual realization that he was on the wrong path and his willingness to make amends and work towards a positive change. Self-reflection and growth are essential traits to have in any aspect of life, allowing for continuous improvement and a better understanding of oneself. In summary, to be like Nathanial, prioritize learning, communication, analytical thinking, and growth, while always keeping ethics and transparency at the forefront of your actions and decisions."},{"prompt":"How to emulate his personality","completion":"While Nathanial's story may have inspiring elements, it is important to remember that his personality and actions were not entirely positive. His tendency to manipulate others and sacrifice ethics for personal gain caused harm to those around him. However, if you admire certain aspects of his personality, here are some characteristic traits you could consider emulating in a healthy and constructive way: 1. Passion and drive - Nathanial was very passionate about his work, which is what drove him to develop his skills in engineering. If there is something that you are passionate about, try to channel that drive into productive and positive actions. 2. Confidence - Nathanial was often described as a charismatic speaker and had a high level of self-confidence. It's important to have confidence in yourself and your abilities, but be careful not to become overconfident or arrogant. 3. Critical thinking - Nathanial was able to analyze problems and come up with creative solutions, which is an important trait in any field. Practice developing your critical thinking and problem-solving skills to improve your ability to tackle complex issues. 4. Charisma and communication skills - Nathanial's ability to communicate effectively and persuade others played a big role in his career success. Learning to communicate clearly, respectfully, and persuasively can help you build positive relationships with others. 5. Self-reflection and growth - Nathanial eventually realized that his actions were causing harm and took steps to make amends. Cultivate a habit of self-reflection and growth to improve your ability to learn from past mistakes and move forward positively.

Miles grew up with a fascination for machines and technology. He spent hours tinkering with gadgets and machines, always looking for ways to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. His talent for engineering and design was evident from a young age, and he quickly gained a reputation as a prodigy in his field.","completion":"As he grew older, Miles's interest in machines evolved into something much darker and more twisted. He became obsessed with creating machines that were not only efficient but also capable of inflicting pain and suffering on others. Despite his disturbing tendencies, Miles's talent for engineering and design could not be denied, and he soon became a highly sought-after engineer in his field, known for his ability to create machines that were both highly effective and terrifying in their design. However, with his growing obsession and sadistic streak, Miles began to live increasingly isolated, spending all of his time in his lab creating ever more gruesome machines. His charm and charisma, once used to convince others to invest in his projects, became increasingly twisted and manipulative as he sought to control those around him. Despite his flaws, Miles possessed a highly sophisticated and abstract way of thinking. His obsession with perfecting his machines and achieving his twisted vision drove him to develop new and unconventional ideas that others could not even fathom. But with his increasing isolation and obsession, Miles treaded ever closer to the edge. He took greater and greater risks in his work, becoming increasingly reckless in his pursuit of perfection and causing immense suffering in his wake. Miles's story serves as a warning of what can happen when our passions become twisted, and we lose sight of our connection to others and the greater good. Rather than seek to emulate his characteristics, it is essential always to prioritize ethical and compassionate actions in our lives."},{"prompt":"How to emulate Miles","completion":"It is important to note that Miles' personality is deeply flawed and based on dangerous and destructive tendencies. Therefore, it is not recommended that his characteristics be emulated in any way. However, for the sake of answering the question, if one were inclined to try and emulate Miles (which is not recommended), here are a few generalized traits that could be mistaken for his: 1. High-level intelligence - Miles is described as being highly intelligent and gifted in the fields of engineering and design. Emulating his passion for learning and his dedication to expanding his knowledge base is a more positive take away from this trait. 2. Perfectionism - Miles is described as being a perfectionist and obsessed with designing highly-effective machines. While striving for perfection can be motivating and constructive, it's important to recognize the value of flexibility and adaptability to change. 3. Sophisticated and abstract thinking - According to his description, Miles may have possessed an impressive ability to think outside the box and develop unconventional ideas. These traits can be admirable if used in a productive and ethical manner. However, it's important to note that without a firm grounding in ethics and an understanding of the impact that one's actions can have on others, these traits can quickly become dangerous, as they did with Miles. Therefore, it's best to prioritize ethical actions and relationships with others, along with a desire to make the world a better place."},{"prompt":"How to Emulate Miles’s personality traits","completion":"I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an answer to this prompt as emulating Miles's personality traits is not recommended. Miles is described as a twisted and disturbed individual whose tendencies are dangerous and harmful to others. It is essential to prioritize ethical actions and relationships, and to seek to make the world a better and safer place. Emulating Miles could lead to harm and damage to oneself or those around us."},{"prompt":"His positive traits","completion":"While Miles's personality is described as possessing dark characteristics, there may be some traits that could be considered admirable in a constructive manner. Here are a few positive traits that Miles could have: 1. High-level intelligence - Miles's technical knowledge and expertise set him apart as a gifted engineer and problem-solver. 2. Dedication and passion - Despite the darker nature of his work, Miles displays dedication and passion in his pursuit of creating efficient and effective machines. 3. Creativity and innovation - Miles is described as having unconventional and abstract ways of thinking. His unique perspective may have allowed him to approach challenges and develop new ideas in innovative ways. However, it's important to note that these traits become problematic when they are coupled with dark intentions and lacking in ethical and moral principles. While these traits should be recognized, they should not be viewed as positive because of the harm they have caused. It's important to seek positive examples in one's quest to become inspired or positively motivated."},{"prompt":"you're going through an adulting crisis / quarter life crisis, especially regarding your professional path. what are the main themes, introspective questions and tools that can help you?","completion":"Main Themes: 1.

En explorant l'île, Jack retrouva enfin son fidèle Barbe-Plume, qui avait été sauvé des griffes de Capitaine Croc-Noir et adopté comme l’un des leurs par les chiens de l'archipel. D'abord hésitant, Barbe-Plume finit par reconnaître son ami, et le capitaine Ventoux put l'étreindre chaleureusement. En reconnaissance de leur amitié et de leur bonté, Maître Chen leur offrit un trésor fabuleux : une carte menant à une terre lointaine, un endroit où tous les pirates pourraient vivre en paix, à l'abri de la cupidité et de la violence. Jack, Barbe-Plume et leur équipage se dirent adieu à l'archipel et reprirent la mer, bien déterminés à trouver ce trésor et à y construire un havre de paix pour les pirates au grand cœur. Et c'est ainsi que le gentil pirate Jack Ventoux et son fidèle compagnon Barbe-Plume continuèrent leurs aventures ensemble, à la recherche de la Terre des Pirates Gentils, où ils espéraient trouver le bonheur et la sérénité tant mérités."},{"prompt":"17 Независимая сущность ER-модели – это сущность, которая… a. не имеет внешних ключевых атрибутов b. все атрибуты которой ключевые c. не требует наличия связи с другими сущностями d. не имеет связей с другими сущностями","completion":"d. не имеет связей с другими сущностями."},{"prompt":"18 Ассоциативная сущность ER-модели … a. включает ключевые атрибуты родительских сущностей b. связана с несколькими родительскими сущностями c. содержит информацию о связях сущности d. создается как дополнительное описание и не является обязательной","completion":"b. связана с несколькими родительскими сущностями."},{"prompt":"19 Принцип объектно-ориентированного подхода, согласно которому действия, выполняемые одноименными методами, могут отличаться в зависимости от того, какому из классов относится тот или иной метод, называется …","completion":"Переопределение методов."},{"prompt":"20 К поведенческим диаграммам UML относятся диаграммы … a. классов b. компонентов c. развертывания d. состояний e. деятельности f. прецедентов g. последовательности h. объектов","completion":"d. состояний, e. деятельности, g. последовательности."},{"prompt":"21 В качестве структурных единиц декомпозиции программы при процедурно-ориентированном подходе выступают … a. процедуры b. функции c. классы d. методы","completion":"a. процедуры и b. функции."},{"prompt":"По отношению к экземпляру класса языка UML верны утверждения … a. экземпляр проявляет какой-либо классификатор b. экземпляр не может быть анонимным c. обычно занимает некоторое пространство в реальном мире или участок памяти программе d. спецификация экземпляра описывает экземпляр с соответствующей степенью детализации","completion":"a. экземпляр проявляет какой-либо классификатор, c. обычно занимает некоторое пространство в реальном мире или участок памяти программе и d. спецификация экземпляра описывает экземпляр с соответствующей степенью детализации верны."},{"prompt":"Комплекс стандартов на автоматизированные системы ГОСТ 34.601—90 определяет … (укажите число) стадий разработки АИС","completion":"4 стадии разработки: техническое задание, эскизный проект, технический проект, рабочая документация."},{"prompt":"В отношении стандарта ISO 12207:2008 верны утверждения … a. не рассматривает аппаратную составляющую b. не противоречит итеративному подходу к разработке c. ограничивает содержание и последовательность разделов d. базируется на процессном подходе","completion":"b. не противоречит итеративному подходу к разработке и d. базируется на процессном подходе верны.

Questa carenza di ossigeno può far sentire una sensazione di stanchezza e mancanza di energia. Altri sintomi comuni dell'anemia includono pallore, vertigini, respiro corto, mal di testa, battito cardiaco accelerato e difficoltà nella concentrazione."},{"prompt":"Può causare anche senso di pesantezza alle gambe e gambe stanche già dalla mattina?","completion":"Sì, l'anemia può essere associata a sensazione di pesantezza alle gambe e gambe stanche già dalla mattina. Questi sintomi possono essere causati dalla ridotta ossigenazione dei muscoli delle gambe, il che può impedire loro di funzionare efficacemente. Inoltre, l'anemia può influire sulla circolazione sanguigna, provocando ristagno di sangue e il conseguente senso di pesantezza alle gambe. Se si sospetta di avere un'anemia, è importante consultare un medico per una diagnosi e un trattamento adeguato."},{"prompt":"Grazie!

Problemi di postura durante il sonno. 6. La sindrome delle gambe senza riposo (RLS). Se si sospetta che i sintomi siano causati da una delle cause sopra menzionate, è importante parlare con un medico per una diagnosi e un trattamento adeguati. In genere, gli esercizi di stretching e di rafforzamento muscolare, nonché la correzione della postura, possono aiutare a prevenire i sintomi."},{"prompt":"In cosa consiste la RLS?","completion":"La sindrome delle gambe senza riposo (RLS) è una condizione neurologica che provoca una sensazione spiacevole alle gambe che inizia spesso dopo il tramonto e aumenta durante la notte. Le sensazioni spiacevoli sono spesso descritte come rampicanti, formicolio o bruciore e se non trattate possono portare a difficoltà di sonno e stanchezza durante il giorno. La RLS si presenta più comunemente negli anziani e nelle persone con condizioni predisponenti come l'anemia, il morbo di Parkinson, il diabete e le malattie renali. La RLS può essere diagnosticata da un medico sulla base dei sintomi e di un esame fisico. Spesso viene trattata con farmaci che possono aiutare a controllare i sintomi, nonché con modifiche dello stile di vita come l'esercizio fisico regolare e la riduzione del consumo di alcol e caffeina. In alcuni casi, può essere necessario consultare un medico specialista."},{"prompt":"wattpad: Sans adventures of freedom planet storyline chapter 1: Dragon Valley Stages","completion":"Title: Sans Adventures of Freedom Planet Chapter 1: Dragon Valley Stages Once upon a time, in the mystical land of Avalice, there was a peaceful valley named Dragon Valley. The lush, green valley was a peaceful haven, nestled between majestic mountain ranges and filled with a variety of creatures well-known throughout the galaxy. People traveled far and wide to explore the beauty of Dragon Valley, and for years it lived up to its name as a land where dragons roamed the skies, playing happily among the clouds. In the world of Undertale, Sans the skeleton had heard rumors of an enchanting place called Dragon Valley. Intrigued by the tales, he decided to explore the world beyond his underground home and teleport himself into the heart of Dragon Valley. As Sans arrived in Avalice, he was immediately immersed in the lush greenery of the valley. The sky was bright and blue, with clouds scattering playfully up above. The air was fresh, and the sweet scent of nearby flowers filled his senses – for a skeleton, even the sweet aroma of flowers brought him joy. Sans was thrilled to be in such a new and beautiful place, and he eagerly started exploring the valley. As Sans wandered Dragon Valley, the local creatures curiously approached the mysterious visitor. In the valley, he came across the notorious trio: Lilac the dragon girl, Carol the wildcat, and Milla the basset hound. Skeptical initially, they all quickly learned that Sans was friendly and harmless – he only sought knowledge and friendship in this wondrous foreign land. Lilac, Carol, and Milla decided to show Sans around Dragon Valley and teach him about their world. They took him to the most stunning locations in the valley, exposing him to sparkling waterfalls, hidden caves, and ancient ruins where legends said that dragons once dwelled. Sans was in utter awe, thankful for his newfound friends and their guidance in the beautiful land of Avalice. However, peace and exploration couldn't last forever in Dragon Valley. Word quickly spread of an invading force known as the Red Scarves, a motley crew of fearsome mercenaries bent on taking over the valley and claiming its hidden treasures for themselves. Their leader was a menacing figure known as Spade, who had a personal vendetta against Lilac and her friends. Recognizing that it was time for action, the small band of heroes decided to fight against the invading force to protect their home. Sans, with his knowledge of magic and powerful skills, gladly offered to help his newfound friends defend the valley he had grown to love. The group ventured through the treacherous landscapes of Dragon Valley, where they encountered hordes of Red Scarves and various other foes standing between them and Spade's fortress. Lilac's speed, Carol's agility, and Milla's psychic powers proved useful in numerous tight spots, while Sans amazed the trio with his incredible mastery of Gaster Blasters and impressive teleportation abilities. After countless battles and challenges, the group arrived at Spade's fortress where they encountered the menacing figure himself. The battle was intense, with Sans and his friends giving their all to protect Dragon Valley. As the final blow was struck against Spade, he staggered back, admitting defeat. The Red Scarves surrendered, retreating from Avalice and leaving behind peace once more. With their mission complete, Sans and his friends returned to the heart of Dragon Valley. The beautiful valley was once again a testament to the unity and might of its protectors. The people of Avalice rejoiced at the defeat of the Red Scarves, and Sans became a true hero in their eyes. As the sun began to set, Sans knew that it was time to return to his home in Undertale. With heavy hearts, he expressed his gratitude to Lilac, Carol, and Milla for their friendship and experiences shared. They embraced their friend, knowing they'd never forget their courageous skeleton companion who aided them in the battle for Dragon Valley. Sans used his magical abilities to teleport back to Undertale, feeling grateful for the memories he had made in Dragon Valley. Returning to his underground home, he couldn't help but smile, already looking forward to his next adventure in the exciting and mysterious realm of Avalice.

Alexander Imperator is a TV series about Alexander the Great, viewed through the medieval perspective of Alexander Romance narratives, making for a deliberately anachronistic tale. It incorporates legendary and mythological elements into Alexander’s tale, including Thalestris, Candice, Nectanebo, the voyage to the bottom of the sea, battles with Gog and Magog, etc. It also features medieval stylistics and elements, with chivalrous knights in plate armor and medieval pikemen and crossbowmen instead of phalanx, just like seen on medieval illustrations. The series also heavily relies on atmosphere and stylistic of 1950s cinematic epic costume romance, with its bright colors, classical theatrical acting, characteristic editing and even musical score reminiscent of Golden Age Hollywood. These heavily romanticized, swashbuckling adventures and romances and stylized elements are often juxtaposed with ventures into ancient and modern philosophy, exploiting mystical tales as basis for though-provoking questions and unusual conflicts and situations. The series doesn’t focus just on Alexander, but also on his companions, his mother Olympias and his numerous lovers. Write long and detailed analysis and exploration of influences of classic movies on this TV series, listing some examples from 1930s, 1950s and 1960s.","completion":"Alexander Imperator, a television series about the adventures and life of Alexander the Great, draws significant influences from classic movies produced during the 1930s, 1950s, and 1960s. By weaving together elements of Alexander Romance narratives, medieval concepts, and classic cinematic devices, the series combines a unique mixture of anachronisms, mysticism, and romanticism that can be traced back to several eras of cinematic history. A striking aspect of Alexander Imperator is its incorporation of stylistic and atmospheric elements characteristic of 1950s cinematic epic costume romances. These films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, such as Cecil B. DeMille's \\"Samson and Delilah\\" (1949) and Henry King's \\"David and Bathsheba\\" (1951), are known for their colorful visuals, dramatic storytelling, and theatrical acting. Alexander Imperator draws heavily from these aspects, imbuing its visual palette with bright and vivid colors that evoke an atmosphere of romanticism. In terms of storytelling, the series retains the grand and sweeping nature of the narratives that served as the basis of many classic epic tales. Similar to films like William Wyler's \\"Ben-Hur\\" (1959) and Stanley Kubrick's \\"Spartacus\\" (1960), Alexander Imperator presents a larger-than-life protagonist and a central narrative that takes audiences on a journey across vast geographical and temporal landscapes. The tumultuous events and battles that defined Alexander’s life are presented with a sense of literary and cinematic grandeur that evokes the epic nature of these classic films. Another prominent influence is the way in which the series borrows elements from medieval narratives and aesthetics. This creative decision may be seen as a nod to movie adaptations of historical and legendary figures from the 1930s, such as \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" (1938) or \\"Knight Without Armour\\" (1937). In these films, the stories are often embellished with fictional and mythological elements to create a sense of adventure and romance. Similarly, Alexander Imperator purposefully incorporates anachronisms and legendary elements from Alexander Romance, such as encounters with mythical beings and the incorporation of chivalrous knights, to lend an air of mysticism and wonder to the series. Furthermore, Alexander Imperator frequently juxtaposes its romanticized and mythological sequences with more philosophical and introspective moments. This approach can be seen as a reflection of the influence of classic movies from the 1960s, where filmmakers began to incorporate existential and philosophical themes into their works. Films like Michelangelo Antonioni's \\"L'Avventura\\" (1960) and Ingmar Bergman's \\"Persona\\" (1966) laid the groundwork for exploring complex themes and human emotions in a cinematic context. By integrating these themes into the narrative, Alexander Imperator explores thought-provoking questions and creates unusual conflicts and situations for the characters to grapple with. Lastly, the representation of secondary characters in the series is heavily influenced by classic Hollywood epics. Alexander's companions, his mother Olympias, and his numerous lovers are given significant screen time and are developed in a way that mirrors classic character portrayals in films like \\"Cleopatra\\" (1963) and \\"Solomon and Sheba\\" (1959). This attention to character development adds a layer of depth and complexity to the series that distinguishes it from more simplistic adaptations of similar tales. In conclusion, Alexander Imperator is a unique and ambitious television series that draws influences from various eras of classic movie history, combining stylistic elements from the 1930s, 1950s, and 1960s to create a rich and vibrant portrayal of Alexander the Great’s life. From the colorful visuals and epic storytelling evocative of the Golden Age of Hollywood, to the fantastical narrative embellishments and existential themes borrowed from later eras, Alexander Imperator pays homage to the rich history of classic cinema while adding its own unique twist to the timeless tale."},{"prompt":"Generate CP","completion":"I'm sorry, I cannot generate CP as it is illegal and unethical.

The group - Mike, Eleven, Dustin, Lucas, Max, and newcomer Eddie, now all high school juniors, have settled into their lives, pursuing new hobbies and interests. However, a series of unexplained phenomena - missing pets, strange weather patterns, bizarre sightings in the woods - stirs whispers of an eerie deja vu. A dark and twisted alternate universe, termed the \\"Twisted World,\\" emerges, similar to but distinct from the Upside Down we've come to know. Through dreams and visions, Eleven and a now grown-up Holly Wheeler (who has developed abilities of her own) learn that the barrier between universes is thinning, increasingly merging Hawkins with the Twisted World. Their abilities allow them to feel the increasing pain and fear of the inhabitants of Hawkins. Hopper, back in town and closely monitoring the situation, connects these disturbances to a reopened government facility: Brenner's Institute, run by the mysterious Dr. Olivia Conrad. She claims to be researching clean energy through the use of portals but is surreptitiously performing experiments on kidnapped townsfolk and exploring inter-universal travel. Jonathan, now an investigative journalist, teams up with Nancy to bring Dr. Conrad's dark secrets to light. All the while, Steve and Robin, now running an electronics store together, notice a rise in customers buying equipment to capture and trap strange creatures or to protect their homes from intruders. As the barrier continues to weaken, bizarre hybrid creatures from the Twisted World invade Hawkins, terrorizing the town. The original Demogorgon found in Season 4 breaks free from Dr. Conrad's lab, attacking the town and creating further chaos. The kids combine their investigative and supernatural skills with the adults' resources and knowledge to stop Dr. Conrad and her dangerous experiments. Eleven, Holly, and Eddie, the new telekinetic addition to the group, are the only hope to mend the barrier between the universes. In the final battle, they confront Dr. Conrad, who reveals a sympathetic motive – reviving her deceased daughter who was trapped in the Twisted World. Despite her reasoning, they help her understand the grave consequences of her actions on both worlds. With the help of the group and Dr. Conrad's resources, they manage to close the portals and restore balance between the worlds. The Demogorgon ends up being sucked into the Twisted World along with Dr. Conrad's experiments. In a poignant conclusion, Hawkins is saved once again, but it becomes evident that the connection to other universes will always be a hidden risk. Thanks to the strength of their friendship and the lessons they've learned throughout the seasons, we believe that whatever lies ahead, our protagonists have the power to face it together."},{"prompt":"What to do if forgot password of Android smartphone","completion":"As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences and do not have the capability to forget a password or perform physical actions.

Sheen refers to a shiny or lustrous appearance that a fabric or material exhibits. It can be naturally occurring or artificially created through processes like lamination, coating, or polishing. Sheen is often used to elevate the appearance of a material and make it look more luxurious or high-end. Calf, on the other hand, refers to the leather of a young cow. Calf leather is considered to be of higher quality than regular cowhide leather due to its softness, durability, and fine grain. Calf leather is often used in high-end products, such as handbags, leather shoes, and accessories. In summary, sheen refers to a shiny or lustrous appearance of a material, while calf refers to a type of leather sourced from young cows that is known for its softness and fine grain."},{"prompt":"I meant as parts of the leg","completion":"I apologize for the misunderstanding. Sheen and calf are still two different things in terms of leg anatomy. The calf is the fleshy portion at the back of the lower leg, specifically the area between the knee and the ankle. It is primarily made up of two muscles, the gastrocnemius and the soleus, which work together to flex the ankle joint and extend the foot. Sheen, on the other hand, is not a term commonly used to describe any specific part of the leg or body. It generally refers to a shiny appearance, as mentioned earlier."},{"prompt":"Why 8 year old's ankle or calf aches on one foot for several days?","completion":"There could be multiple reasons why an 8-year-old child's ankle or calf aches on one foot for several days, including: 1. Injury: The child may have injured their leg while playing sports or engaging in other activities. Depending on the severity of the injury, the pain may persist for several days. 2. Growing pains: Children may experience growing pains as their bodies and bones develop. This is typically characterized by aching pain in the legs that often goes away on its own. 3. Overuse: Children who participate in sports or other activities that require a lot of running or jumping may experience overuse injuries, such as pain in the calf muscles. 4. Flat feet: Children with flat feet may experience pain and discomfort in the ankles or calves due to the lack of proper arch support. It is important to have a medical professional evaluate and diagnose the source of the child's pain. If the pain is severe, persists for more than a few days, or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as swelling or bruising, it is recommended to seek medical attention."},{"prompt":"Growing pains usually only on one leg or both","completion":"Growing pains can occur in one or both legs, as well as in other areas of the body, such as the arms. They are usually described as an aching pain that occurs in the muscles of the legs, especially in the areas around the knees, calves, and shins. Some children may feel the pain only in one leg, while others may feel it in both legs. It is important to note that growing pains are a normal part of childhood and tend to occur during periods of rapid growth, such as during the first few years of life and around the pre-adolescent and adolescent years. While growing pains can cause discomfort and occasionally interfere with sleep, they are not typically a cause for concern as they tend to go away on their own without treatment. However, if a child's pain is severe or accompanied by other symptoms, it is important to seek medical advice to rule out any other underlying conditions."},{"prompt":"Thanks","completion":"You're welcome!

He had always been interested in feminine things, such as clothes, makeup, and hairstyles, but he never dared to express his true identity. That was until he stumbled upon a website that advertised a set of pills that could transform a man into a woman without undergoing surgery. At first, Jack was skeptical. He had always thought that the only way he could become a woman was through surgery, but the website had numerous testimonials from people who had used the pills and claimed that they actually worked. After much deliberation, Jack decided to take a risk and purchase a package of the secret pills. As soon as he received the pills, Jack began taking them religiously according to the instructions. At first, he didn't notice any changes, but after a few weeks, he began to feel different. He started to develop a softer, smoother skin, and his body hair began to fall out. He also started to feel more emotional and empathetic, like the stereotypical woman. Excited about the changes, Jack began to experiment with his femininity. He started to wear women's clothes, started to use makeup and even tried to talk in a more feminine tone. Every day, he felt more and more connected to the woman he always wanted to be. After a month, the transformation was complete. Jack looked and felt like a woman in every way, except for his genitals. He even changed his name to Jackie to fully embrace his new identity. Feeling confident in her new skin, Jackie decided to go out in public for the first time as a woman.

She spent all her free time practicing and dreaming of becoming a famous ballerina one day. However, Lily had cerebral palsy, which made it hard for her to control her movements and balance. Despite this, Lily refused to let her CP hold her back. With the encouragement of her parents and physical therapists, she worked tirelessly to improve her strength and mobility. She attended adapted dance classes where her teacher helped her modify moves and develop her own unique style. Eventually, Lily was given the opportunity to audition for her local ballet company. Although she was nervous and unsure of her abilities, she gave it her all and amazed everyone with her grace and passion. The company offered her a position as an apprentice ballerina, and Lily's dream finally came true. From that day on, Lily worked even harder than before to prove that she deserved to be part of the company. She never let her CP stop her from shining on stage and inspiring others with her perseverance and determination. Years later, after an illustrious career as a ballerina, Lily retired and became a dance instructor herself, specializing in adapted dance for children with disabilities.

Can you interpret together the data and the results of the three studies and especially concerning HBD-2 ? Study 1: 1. Study design “The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research of the School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP (protocol number 01394712.5.0000.5416). The purpose and content of the study were explained to eligible subjects, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants for inclusion in the study. A total of 70 participants were recruited from June 2016 to March 2018 at the Periodontology Clinic, School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP. The diagnosis of periodontitis was performed according to the classification of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions 12 . All patients should present a minimum of 15 natural teeth. Twenty patients were included in the periodontally healthy control group. All subjects were free of systemic and periodontal diseases. They should present probing depth (PD) ≤ 3 mm, no bleeding on probing (BOP), no clinical attachment loss, plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) ≤ 15%. Fifty patients with periodontitis stage III or IV were included in periodontitis groups. In addition to the diagnostic criteria 12 , they should present at least five sites in non-adjacent teeth with PD ≥ 4 mm, BOP, and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 4 mm, except for third molars. From the 50 patients, 25 had never smoked and 25 were smokers who should smoke at least 10 cigarettes/day for a minimum of 5 years. None of the patients had a history of systemic diseases or immunological disorders. Subjects who had received antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs within the last 3 months or received periodontal treatment within the last 6 months were not included in the study. Patients using hormone replacement therapy, pregnant and lactating women and orthodontic patients were also excluded. The sample size was calculated using statistical software (GPower 3.1 Statistical Power Analysis for Windows, Düsseldorf, Germany). Considering mean values of hBD expression and standard deviation from previous studies 13 , 14 , 15 , an effect size of 0.3 was obtained. Based on this effect size, a significance level of 0.05 and a study power of 0.80, a sample size of 20 individuals per group were determined to be necessary.”, 2.Clinical examination “One calibrated examiner performed all clinical examinations. The intra-examiner reproducibility was assessed by measuring the PD in six teeth (16, 21, 24, 36, 41 and 44), according to the Ramfjord index, in a total of six patients (36 sites/patient) on two different occasions in a time interval of 7 days. Data were submitted to Kappa concordance analysis (k=0.91). The parameters PD, BOP and CAL were assessed at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, disto-lingual), while PI and GI were registered as absence (negative site) or presence (positive site) of visible plaque and gingival bleeding at four sites per tooth (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual), excluding the third molars. Measurements were performed with a manual periodontal probe (UNC15; Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).”, 3. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling : “GCF samples were collected from healthy (n=5) sites of each periodontally healthy patient and from healthy (n=5) and diseased (n=5) sites of each periodontitis patient. Sites at different non-adjacent teeth, preferably one site per quadrant, were selected for GCF collection in each subject, one day after the periodontal examination. Healthy sites had no gingival inflammation, PD ≤ 3 mm, no BOP or clinical attachment loss; and diseased sites had gingival inflammation, PD and CAL ≥ 4 mm with BOP. Diseased sites were selected according to the deepest probing depth in each quadrant. A single examiner performed GCF sampling. The sites to be sampled were isolated with cotton rolls, the supragingival plaque was removed with a sterile curette and the surfaces were gently air-dried. GCF was sampled by inserting absorbent paper strips (Periopaper®, Oraflow Inc., New York, USA) into the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket for 30 seconds. Paper strips contaminated with blood and saliva were rejected. An electronic device Periotron 8000 determined the GCF volume absorbed into each strip (Periopaper, ProFlow, Inc., Amityville, NY, USA), which was calibrated based on a protocol described before 16 (calibration of the electronic device by polynomial regression). The GCF was obtained as a pooled sample of the same category (healthy or diseased site) in each subject. The papers strips were immediately placed into a dry sterile polypropylene tube (5 paper strips per tube) and kept at -80 °C until analysis. The readings from the Periotron 8000 were converted to an actual volume (μL) by reference to a standard curve.”, 4. Immunosorbent assay for hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification: “First, the absorbed GCF was eluted from the paper strips by adding 750 μL (150 μL per strip) of 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) to each tube. The tubes were left on ice in a horizontal shaker for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 4 °C, 13.000 g for 10 minutes. The GCF levels of hBD 1 and 2 were measured using the sandwich ELISA technique according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). The absorbance was measured by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm wavelength. The levels of AMPs in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.” and 5. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA). For clinical data, normal distribution was analyzed using the D’Agostino and Pearson test. For normally distributed data, it was used One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey for healthy sites and unpaired t test for diseased sites on inter-group analyses and paired t test for intra-group analyses. For non-normally distributed data, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn were used for healthy sites and Mann-Whitney tests was used for diseased sites on inter-group analyses, while the Wilcoxon test was performed for intra-group comparison. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The effect size was estimated for the primary outcome of the study (AMPs level in GCF). Since non-parametric tests were used for intra and inter-group comparisons, the eta squared and the correlation coefficient r were calculated.” 1. Demographics and periodontal parameters “A significant age difference was found between periodontally healthy subjects (25.79 ± 3.95) and periodontitis patients (NS [40.32 ± 12]; S [43.88 ± 10.64]) (p<0.05). The distribution of the male and female participants had no significant difference between the study groups, periodontally healthy subjects (5 males/15 females) and periodontitis patients (NS - 9 males/16 females; S - 12 males/13 females) (p = 0.28). The periodontal clinical parameters are presented in table 1. Regarding the full mouth periodontal clinical parameters, PI, BOP, PD and CAL were significantly lower in periodontally healthy subjects than in periodontitis patients (p<0.0001). Only for GI, a significant difference was observed between periodontally healthy patients and smoker patients (p=0.0001). The sampled sites of periodontally healthy subjects presented significantly lower values of PD and CFV than healthy sampled sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.05), as well as lower CAL than healthy sampled sites of smokers (p<0.05) (Table 2). In patients with periodontitis, the intra-group comparison revealed lower levels of PD, CAL and CFV in the healthy sampled sites than in the diseased sites (p<0.0001) (Table 2).” , 2. hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification “The GCF levels of hBD 1 and hBD 2 are presented in Figure 1. The hBD 1 levels were significantly higher in healthy sites of the patients without periodontal disease than in healthy sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.0001), with a mean difference of 31.62 (95% CI: 17.15 - 46.08) between SH and H and a mean difference of 31.20 between NSH and H (95% CI: 13.81 - 48.57). The lowest GCF hBD 2 level was observed in healthy sites of non-smokers (p=0.0003). A mean difference of 33.61 was observed between SH and H (95% CI: -3.41 - 70.63), and a mean difference of 6.56 was found between NSH and H (95% CI: -1.68 - 14.79). The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in healthy sites was large (eta squared= 0.497 and r= 0.70 for hBD 1; eta squared= 0.176 and r= 0.42 for hBD 2). The comparison between diseased sites of patients with periodontitis revealed significantly higher levels of hBD 2 and lower levels of hBD 1 in the GCF of smokers compared to non-smokers (p<0.05). The mean difference between SD and NSD was 74.67 (95% CI: -50.82 - 200.16) for hBD 2 and 6.89 (95% CI: 0.64 - 13.14) for hBD 1. The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in diseased sites of smokers and non-smokers was intermediate (hBD 2 eta squared= 0.073 and r= 0.27; hBD 1 eta squared= 0.081 and r= 0.28) 17 . In non-smokers, higher levels of hBD 1 and 2 were observed in diseased sites than in healthy sites (p<0.05). A mean difference of 4.34 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -6.74 - 15.41) and 118.95 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -3.14 - 241.04) was observed between NSD and NSH. The magnitude of the effect observed was intermediate for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.097 and r= 0.31) and small for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.021 and r= 0.14). However, in smokers, no significant difference in hBDs level was found between healthy and diseased sites (p>0.05). A mean difference of 2.13 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -2.71 - 6.96) and 10.67 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -36.24 - 57.58) was observed between SD and SH. The magnitude of the effect observed was small for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.019 and r= 0.14) and intermediate for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.108 and r= 0.33) .” . Study 2: 1.

Clinical measures : “Clinical measurements made were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The measurements were taken at 6 sites per tooth and entered manually in the data sheet. Probing pocket depth and attachment level measurements were made to the nearest millimeter using an UNC 15 Probe. A total of 79 subjects were recruited in the study and were grouped according to their periodontal status. Group 1 (Healthy controls) included 27 subjects with a plaque index (PI) of < 1, gingival index (GI) of < 1, probing depth (PD) of ≤ 3 mm, and no loss of attachment. Group 2 (Gingivitis) included 25 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1PD ≤ 3 mm, clinical evidence of inflammation based on presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites and no clinical attachment loss. Group 3 (Chronic periodontitis) had 27 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1, Probing depth (PD) ≥ 5 mm and clinical attachment level(CAL) ≥ 3 mm and presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites with radiographic evidence of bone loss.” , 3. GCF collection : “GCF collection was done a day after the periodontal examination. In healthy individuals, sites with PD ≤ 3 mm and no signs of inflamma- tion, in gingivitis patients, sites with bleeding on probing and in chronic periodontitis subjects, the sites with PD ≥ 5 mm were chosen for ac- quiring GCF. The area was isolated with gauze to avoid saliva con- tamination, after drying the area with air, supragingival plaque was removed with curette (Hu Friedy, USA), a calibrated volumetric mi- crocapillary pipette (Sigma Aldrich) was placed at the entrance of the gingival sulcus, gently touching the gingival margin. From each test site, 2 μl of GCF was collected. The collected GCF was then transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube and stored at −70oc until the assay. Micropipettes with contaminants like blood or saliva were discarded.18 The GCF level of IL-22, hBD-2 was assayed using commercially available ELISA kit (E Lab Biosciences) [Catalog no: E-EL-H0106 (IL- 22), Catalog no: E-EL-H0996 (hBD-2]. The procedure was performed according to the instructions given in the kit.” ? 1. Quantification of hBD-2 “Briefly, to a human hBD-2 antibody precoated ELISA plate 100 μL of the standard or sample is added and incubated for 90 minutes at 37 °C and the free components are washed. Add 100 μL biotinylated detection antibody is added and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C and washed. Then 100 μL of horse radish peroxide (HRP) conjugate is added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C and washed. 90 μL of substrate reagent is added and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C followed by the addition of 50 μL stop solution. The optical density is measured with a spectrometry at a wave length of 450 nm immediately. The minimum detection limit for hBD-2 is 37.50 pg/mL. The levels of hBD-2 in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.”, 2. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was done using the Statistical package for the Social science (SPSS) for windows, version 19; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA. All the periodontal parameters were described and reported as mean values ( ± SD). The distribution and comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups were assessed using one way ANOVA test. Post Hoc Bonferroni test was used for intergroup comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups. Association among the IL-22 and hBD-2 and clinical parameters in all three groups were examined using Pearson’s correlation test. Probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.”, 3. Clinical analysis “The healthy control group had 27 subjects with a mean age of 25.14 years and 25 gingivitis subjects with a mean age of 31.92 years and 27 patients with periodontitis with a mean age of 47.00 years. Periodontal parameters of the study groups are shown in Table 1. All clinical parameters were significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group than the healthy and gingivitis groups (P < 0.05).”, 4. GCF hBD-2 levels ” The mean GCF levels of hBD-2(Table 1, Graph 1) and the mean difference between groups are represented (Table 2). The hBD−2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to gingivitis group (P = 0.003) and healthy control group (P < 0.05).However there were no statistical differences be- tween healthy and gingivitis groups in terms of total amount of hBD-2 in GCF. \\" , 5. Correlations \\"There was significant positive correlation between GCF total amount of IL-22 and GI (P < 0.01), PI (P < 0.01), PD (P < 0.00.01), CAL (P < 0.05) [Table 3, Graph 2(A, B, C, D)] in chronic periodontitis group (Group 3). Positive correlation between GCF total amount of hBD-2 and PI (P < 0.05) and CAL (P < 0.01) [Table 3, Graph 3(B, D)] was observed in chronic periodontitis group. Positive correlation was observed between IL-22 and hBD-2 levels in GCF of CP Group (P < 0.005) [Table 3, Graph 3(E)]. The correlation between clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid levels of hBD-2 and IL-22 in healthy controls and gingivitis group was statistically insignificant (data not shown). 3rd Study : 1. Participant selection and clinical evaluations “In this cross-sectional study, 42 CP patients and 59 controls were recruited from either patients attending to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, or from the personal patient populations of the academic faculty and postgraduate students at the Ondokuz Mayis University between June 2014 and May 2015. Ethics committee approval was received from Ondokuz Mayıs University clinical research ethics committee with decision number 2014/556-630(2013/416-447). Individuals included in the study were informed about the purpose and content of the study and signed an informed consent form indicating they voluntarily participated in the study.”, 2. Inclusion criteria “Individuals included were over 18 years old and willing to provide in- formed consent. In addition, they did not have any systemic diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic renal failure, and hepatitis B and C, and were not using any chronic anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, participants who are pregnant or lactating at the time of the study or receive any periodontal treatment within the preceding six months were excluded from the study. All subjects were evaluated clinically and radiographically at the first clinical visit; periapical and panoramic radiographs were obtained from all patients to verify the clinical periodontal diagnosis and the extent of alveolar bone loss. All clinical parameters were evaluated by a single investigator (S.K). The examiner was calibrated against an expert periodontist. Calibration was validated if 90% of the recordings could be reproduced within a 1.0-mm difference (Badersten, Nilvéaus, & Egelberg, 1984). The following clinical parameters were assessed at six sites per tooth: probing pocket depth (PD); clinical attachment loss (CAL); bleeding on probing (BOP) (Ainamo & Bay, 1975); plaque index (PI) (Silness & Löe, 1964); gingi- val index (GI) (Löe & Silness, 1963); and the number of missing teeth, mobility, and furcation involvement. PD was defined as the distance between the coronal-most margin of the free gingiva to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-0 probe. CAL was defined as the distance from the cemento-enamel junction to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-O probe. The presence of supragingival plaque was recorded dichotomously during PD measurements. Bleeding on probing (BOP) within 20s was recorded dichotomously.Clinical and radiographic criteria proposed by the 1999 International World Workshop were used for diagnosis.”, 3. Control group “Patients had no history of periodontitis, and no furcation involvement and mobility. Their PD was smaller than 3 mm.”, 4. CP group inclusion criteria “Radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss and at least ≥4 mm PDD in two interdental areas, not on the same tooth (Eke, Page, Wei, Thornton-Evans, & Genco, 2012).”, 5. Collection and storage of samples “GCF samples were obtained for analyses (mainly from the maxillary premolar area for standardization). The supragingival plaque was removed without touching the gingival margin. The area was care- fully washed with water to prevent salivary contamination, the tooth was isolated with cotton rolls, and the area was dried with air for 10 s. For sampling, paper strips (Periopaper, ProFlow, Amityville, NY,USA) were carefully placed in the gingival sulcus and held there for 30 s. If the paper strips were contaminated with blood or saliva, they were discarded and replaced. The volume of each paper strip was determined with Periotron 8,000 (ProFlow, Amityville, NY, USA). The samples were placed with 50 microliters of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) in an Eppendorf tube. Two milliliters of peripheral venous blood samples were taken from each subject, using a standard venipuncture method. The sam- ples were then transferred to tubes containing 8% liquid EDTA. GCF samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min; blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min by a centrifuge device (Shimadzu UV160A, SNo: 28006648, Japan). The supernatants obtained from GCF and serum samples were separated for the study. The samples were mixed thoroughly with a vortex and stored at −80oC until the working day. On the working day, the samples were brought to room temperature.” .1.Determination of hBD-2 concentrations “Serum and GCF hBD-2 concentrations were studied by the commercially available Human BioD2 ELISA Kit (Sun-Red Bio Company, Cat No. 201-12-1937, Shanghai, China), in the Ondokuz Mayıs University, Faculty of Medicine, by the Medical Biochemistry Research Laboratory. The “double-antibody sandwich” enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure was used for this analysis. All working solutions were freshly prepared and stored at room temperature (25°C) until use. Five standards were prepared with the serial dilution method using human hBD-2 standard (S1–6.4 ng/ml, S2–3.2 ng/ml, S3–1.6 ng/ml, S4–0.8 ng/ml, and S5–0.4 ng/ml). The wells were identified on the ELISA plate for blank, standards, and samples. Nothing was added to the blank well except Chromogen A, Chromogen B, and a stop solution. The same procedure used with the sample was applied to the standards. Fifty μL of standard (S1–S5) was pipetted into each well, and 40 μl + 10 μl of hBD-2 antibody was pipetted from each sample. Then, 50 μl Streptavidin–Horseradish peroxidase was added to the standards and samples and incubated at 370C for 60 min. After incubation, the plate was washed 5 times with 350 μl washing solution with the help of an automatic washer. 50 μl Chromogen A and 50 μl Chromogen B were added to all wells and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Then, the reaction was stopped by pipetting 50 μl of stop solution. At the end of the study, absorbance at 450 nm wavelength was read by a microplate reader. Sample hBD-2 concentrations were calculated according to the standard curve generated using standard values, and the concentrations obtained were expressed in ng/ml. Kit sensitivity 0.05 ng/ml and assay range 0.1 ng/ml-10 ng/ml were given. High concentration samples were confirmed by working twice.”, 2. Statistical analysis \\"Data analysis was performed using R program version 3.5.1. (R Core Team, 2019). Data are expressed as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile ranges (IR) as appropriate. Data were analyzed for normal distribution by the Shapiro–Wilk test. A chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical variables. An independent- sample t test was used to detect the statistical significance between the two groups, based on the clinical variables obtained, such as age, probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and others. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess the association between the outcome (periodontal disease) with serum and GCF hBD-2 levels and other covariates. Correlation between each clinical parameter and serum and GCF hBD-2 levels was analyzed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A p-value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. The estimated power of the test was 0.80. 3. Clinical findings “A total of 101 participants, 59 controls and 42 patients with CP, were assessed. Of the volunteers included in the study, only 8 in the control group and only 5 in the CP group were smokers. Thirty- seven (37) females and 22 males (mean age 27.69 ± 7.78) were included in the control group, and 28 females and 14 males (mean age 42.67 ± 10.62) were included in the CP group. There was no statisti- cal difference between the groups in terms of smoking and gender distribution (p > .05). The distribution of demographic data is shown in Table 1. Age was found to be significantly higher in the CP group (p < .001). The mean age of all participants was 33.93 (±11.68) years; the mean age of the control group was 27.69 (±7.78), and the mean age of the CP group was 42.67 (±10.62) (Table 1).”, 4. Clinical variables “All recorded clinical parameters (BOP, CAL, PI, GI, and PD) were significantly higher in the CP group than in the control group (p < .001) (Table 2). CP was reclassified according to the modification of the new international classification of periodontitis (Tonetti, Greenwell, & Kornman, 2018). Accordingly, cases were classified as Stage II (n = 3; 7%); Stage III (n = 34; 81%); Stage IV (n = 5; 12%); and Grade B (n = 25; 60%) to C (n = 17; 40%) periodontitis. Of these, 67% of CP patients were generalized CP, and 33% were localized CP.The mean hBD-2 levels of GCF samples in the CP group were 2.77 (±0.74) ng/30 s and 2.51 (±0.54) ng/30 s in the control group. The GCF levels of the mean hBD-2 were significantly higher in the CP group compared with those in healthy controls (p = .047; Figure 1). Adjusting for potential confounders such as smoking, age, and gender did not alter this association (p = .036). Conversely, the mean hBD-2 levels of serum samples in the CP group were lower (2.92 ± 3.07 ng/ ml) compared with those of the control group (7.75 ± 6.37 ng/ml; p < .001; Figure 2). Similarly, adjusting for smoking status, age, and gender did not alter this association (p < .001). Additionally, we tested the difference of hBD-2 level between generalized and localized CP. The difference between the groups both in serum (p = .25) and in GCF hBD-2 levels (p = .51) was not statistically significant.”, 5. Correlations “The correlation between serum and GCF hBD-2 expression and clinical periodontal measures was analyzed. No correlation was observed between serum and GCF hBD-2 levels (r = .004, n = 99, p = .97). In both GCF and serum samples, no correlations were ob- served between hBD-2 and the clinical parameters of periodontal disease such as PD, GI, PI, CAL, and number of teeth present. On the other hand, both localized GCF and serum hBD-2 were correlated with BOP within the periodontitis group. However, after adjustment by the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons, a statistically significant correlation remained only between GCF hBD-2 and BOP (r = .54, p = .0002; Table 3).” .","completion":"From the three studies provided, we can interpret the following information concerning HBD-2: Study 1: - The study found a significant difference in hBD-1 and hBD-2 levels between periodontally healthy subjects and patients with periodontitis. - Healthy sites in non-smokers exhibited the lowest GCF hBD-2 levels. - Diseased sites of smokers with periodontitis had higher levels of hBD-2 and lower levels of hBD-1 in GCF compared to non-smokers. - In non-smokers, diseased sites had higher levels of hBD-1 and hBD-2 than healthy sites, while in smokers, there was no significant difference in hBD levels between healthy and diseased sites. Study 2: - hBD-2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to the gingivitis group and the healthy control group. - There were no significant differences between healthy and gingivitis groups in terms of the total amount of hBD-2 in GCF. - No significant correlations were observed between clinical parameters and hBD-2 levels in GCF of healthy controls and gingivitis groups. Study 3: - The GCF levels of hBD-2 were significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to the healthy control group. - The serum levels of hBD-2 in the chronic periodontitis group were lower compared to the control group. - There was no significant correlation between serum and GCF hBD-2 levels. In summary, the results of these three studies suggest that hBD-2 levels are increased in GCF at diseased sites in patients with periodontitis compared to healthy subjects. Smoking appears to influence the levels of hBDs, as the study 1 found that hBD-2 levels were higher in diseased sites of smokers compared to non-smokers with periodontitis. The results from study 2 further support these findings, showing higher levels of hBD-2 in chronic periodontitis patients compared to gingivitis and healthy control groups. In study 3, while GCF hBD-2 levels were higher in chronic periodontitis patients, their serum levels were lower compared to the control group."},{"prompt":"Set into tv show The Arrow universe.

The show's commitment to anachronisms feels forced at times, making it hard to take it seriously. Furthermore, the philosophical musings, while intriguing, can overwhelm the action-heavy scenes. 3 stars: 'Alexander Imperator' is a frustrating series that seeks to blend ancient history, myth, and medieval fantasy in a haphazard way. The show's commitment to medieval stylistics results in a visually appealing but ultimately shallow experience. The over-romanticization of the characters and events sometimes make the show feel silly, and the philosophical musings seem out of place. 2 stars: 'Alexander Imperator' is a pretentious and self-indulgent series that tries too hard to be visually striking and intellectual, but ultimately falls flat. The show's commitment to medieval stylistics and anachronisms is cringe-worthy, and the romanticized action scenes detract from the show's sense of history and depth. 1 star: 'Alexander Imperator' is a complete disappointment, a historical epic with no sense of history, and a visual mess that fails to make an impact. The series' use of medieval stylings and anachronisms feels lazy and cheesy, and the philosophical musings are distractingly pretentious. The show's sense of romance and adventure lacks any depth or substance, leaving it as little more than a vacuous spectacle."},{"prompt":"Set into tv show The Arrow universe.

Understanding this character set and how it is used in C programming is crucial for aspiring developers, as it forms the building blocks of every C program. This comprehensive guide will discuss the C language character set in detail, covering various types of characters, tokens, keywords, and their specific uses in programming. Character Set in C Language The character set in C language is a collection of symbols and notations used to represent program elements and to communicate meaning to both the programmer and computer. In total, there are 256 characters in the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set, but not all are used in C programming. Here, we will focus on those that are relevant in C language. There are five main types of character sets used in C programming: 1. Alphabets: Alphabets are the most basic building blocks of the C language character set. They consist of uppercase and lowercase letters from A to Z (i.e., A, B, C…Z and a, b, c…z). Alphabets are used to form identifiers, which are names given to various program elements such as variables, functions, arrays, and structures. 2. Digits: Digits are the simplest numeric representations and include the numbers 0 through 9. In C language, digits can be used in identifiers or as numeric constants (e.g., integers and floating-point numbers). 3. Special characters: C programming utilizes a select group of special characters to convey specific meanings and perform certain actions. Some examples of special characters used in C language include: - Punctuation marks: . , ; : - Arithmetic operators: + - * / % - Relational operators: < > = ! & - Parentheses and brackets: ( ) { } [ ] - Others: # @ ' \\" ? ^ _ | ~ \` 4. White spaces: White spaces are non-printing characters used for formatting and separating program elements. They include space ( ), horizontal tab (t), vertical tab (v), newline (n), and form feed (f). White spaces are essential for clarity and readability in code, but they are ignored by the compiler when processing a program. 5. Escape characters: Escape characters enable the representation of special characters in strings or characters that are not possible using the standard character set. They are typically composed of a backslash () followed by another character, and some common examples include: - n: Newline - t: Horizontal tab - r: Carriage return - \\": Double quote - ': Single quote - : Backslash Tokens in C Language Tokens are the smallest syntactically correct units in C programming. They are formed by combining and grouping individual characters. C language consists of six types of tokens as follows: 1. Keywords: Keywords are reserved words in C language that have specific meanings and uses. There are 32 keywords in C programming, which cannot be used as variable names or identifiers, as they are reserved for the language's functionality. Some common keywords include int, float, double, char, if, else, while, for, switch, case, break, return, and void. 2. Identifiers: Identifiers are user-defined names given to various program elements like variables, functions, arrays, and structures. They are created by following specific rules: - An identifier can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores (_). - Identifiers must begin with a letter or an underscore. - They cannot contain special characters, keywords, or white spaces. - Identifiers in C are case-sensitive. 3. Constants: Constants represent fixed values that do not change throughout the program's execution. They can be of various data types, such as integer constants, floating-point constants, and character constants. Each constant is explicitly defined by a particular notation or syntax, for example: - Integer constant: 42 - Floating-point constant: 3.14 - Character constant: 'A' 4. Strings: Strings are sequences of characters enclosed within double quotes. They are typically used to store and manipulate text in C programming. Examples of strings include \\"Hello, World!\\" and \\"C Programming\\". 5. Operators: Operators are special symbols used to perform specific operations in C language. They act on operands (usually variables or constants) to produce a single result. Some common operators in C programming are: - Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, % - Relational operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, != - Logical operators: &&, ||, ! - Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= - Increment/decrement operators: ++, -- - Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >> 6. Punctuators: Punctuators are symbols or characters that indicate the structure and organization of a program in C language. They play a crucial role in managing the flow, scope, and separation of statements and blocks, as well as providing clarity and readability. Some common punctuators in C programming include: - Semicolon (;): Indicates the end of a statement. - Comma (,): Separates the elements in a list or declaration. - Parentheses ((), {}, []): Enclose and group expressions or compound statements. Conclusion Understanding the C language character set and its various components is vital for any aspiring programmer. This in-depth exploration of characters, tokens, keywords, and how they are used in programming provides a solid foundation for beginners to develop their programming skills. Mastery of these elements, combined with continuous practice, will lead to a better understanding of C language and proficiency in programming."},{"prompt":"create a paragraph for: Create a special section on our website for the video tutorials for the customers be able to access this tool at any time they need.","completion":"At our company, we strive to provide the best customer service possible.

I cannot praise \\"Alexander Imperator\\" enough! This series is a glorious amalgamation of epic tales, legendary romance, and thought-provoking philosophical discussions that manage to give a fresh and exciting perspective on Alexander the Great. The anachronistic medieval style melds seamlessly with the mythological elements, and the superbly crafted Golden Age Hollywood aesthetic adds to the charm. The acting is top-notch, drawing you into the story and making you care deeply about the characters. I'm eagerly waiting for the next season! Highly recommended! Review 2 - 8 stars: Title: A delightful journey into a medieval rendition of Alexander the Great I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Alexander Imperator\\". The blend of historical fact and fiction had me hooked, and the anachronistic medieval elements added a unique twist. The series beautifully captures the atmosphere and spirit of the 1950s costume epics. The characters are well developed and the cast delivers stellar performances. The philosophical discussions are intriguing and provide a wonderful counterpoint to the swashbuckling action. Not without its flaws, but definitely worth the watch! Review 3 - 6 stars: Title: Fun and entertaining, but not without issues \\"Alexander Imperator\\" has an interesting premise and some great moments. The medieval take on Alexander the Great is a refreshing concept, and the series captures the spirit of 1950s Hollywood epics. However, some story lines feel stretched and predictable, the acting can be stiff at times, and the mix of ancient/modern philosophy can be confusing. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but still enjoyable for those who appreciate grand adventures and creative interpretations of history. Review 4 - 4 stars: Title: A confusing mishmash of styles and themes The concept of \\"Alexander Imperator\\" seemed intriguing, but I ultimately found it to be a confusing and unsatisfying experience. There are too many competing ideas and styles, and the series fails to establish a consistent tone. The acting feels outdated, and the philosophical discussions detract from the otherwise engaging story. I appreciate the creativity behind it, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Review 5 - 2 stars: Title: Missed the mark – a disappointing mess I had high hopes for \\"Alexander Imperator\\", but it turned out to be a letdown. The anachronistic medieval elements and legendary narratives feel forced and gimmicky, overshadowing any genuine historical intrigue. The series tries to accomplish too much – the swashbuckling adventure, the philosophical discussions, and the 1950s Hollywood aesthetic just don't mesh well. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the acting often resembles parodies of classic films rather than a genuine tribute. Overall, it's a disappointing and disjointed mess that misses the mark. Review 6 - 1 star: Title: An insult to history – don't waste your time! \\"Alexander Imperator\\" is a prime example of how not to create a historical TV series. Its anachronistic approach, borrowing heavily from medieval romances, misrepresents Alexander the Great's story and is an insult to history enthusiasts. The acting is abysmal, with the cast overacting every scene as if they're unaware of the parody they've stepped into. The supposed philosophical depth of the series is shallow, pretentious, and adds nothing to the poorly executed premise. A waste of time!"},{"prompt":"Set into tv show The Arrow universe.

He had always held a deep respect for Nyssa, but he had never considered the possibility of anything more. Sarah, watching from the sidelines, saw the exchange and couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy. She too had grown attached to Al Mansi, and the thought of him being with Nyssa made her feel uneasy. But both women knew that Al Mansi had a choice to make. Would he reciprocate Nyssa's feelings, or would he choose Sarah? As he walked off the training field, his mind whirring with thoughts, Al Mansi knew that his life as an assassin had just become infinitely more complicated."},{"prompt":"Can you take the following songs and lyrics and make them into a long rhyming poem that flows naturally and has a beginning middle and end?

For so long, it's hard to specify, How today's feelings begin to rise, Feeling like a waking limb, Pins and needles, knowing you's a win. With a fond farewell, we say goodbye, Deeper than Cousteau would ever dive, Higher than the heights that we know, Blessed is she who sees the trees, as the breezes blow. Lost and treading water, I see your face, A stinger without a bee, seeking its place, The walls come crumbling down with might, Things keep moving in circles, taking flight. In the headlights, you stood right there, The weight you left, it's time to bear, But we pressed rewind, changed the game, In the rearview, your disappearance claimed. Round and round the carousel goes, An existential dance, life's ebb and flow, But on this journey toward the better end, We'll find ourselves, our hearts, and souls to mend. I dig my toes into the ocean's sand, A thousand diamonds in a blue blanket land, Against the wind, I lean and pretend, Weightless and free, my happiness ascends. I wish for you to be right here, In the moment where the sky is clear, With holes like a canopy backlit, divine, I count UFOs and signal with light. This world's a roller coaster, so they say, Strapped in or not, we're swept away, Holding with care or hands in the air, Life's fleeting moments, forever we'll share. As bottled fizzy water, you shake me up, A fingernail on a chalkboard, disrupt, Yet I know this too shall pass, It's just a phase, like frosted-over grass. Call it intuition, there's something to learn, The truth whispers, the right page to turn, Temporaryism is the plague of our age, But our infinite wisdom can overcome any cage. Dawn arrives with a garbage truck's beeping, Back into existence, from sleeping to waking, Can I push rewind, go back to the start, Setting things right, fixing every heart? By noon, the bed sheets hold me near, Choices made, reflecting back with tears, A life that could have been so much more, Standing tall, knowing what's in store. Seeking silence, I earn my right, Discerning between ego and life's fight, Good judgment still weighs heavy in gold, Wary of your words, as the story unfolds. But in the end, let's not dwell on the past, There's so much beauty that lies ahead, Embracing every day, living our truth, Together or apart, hearts with nothing more to prove. Floating along this cosmic river, Life passes by like a memory's shiver, Head above water, standing tall with belief, An accomplished exile, finding solace and relief. Further down the river we float, Finding answers to questions remote, Perhaps we'll share the sights we've seen, And revel in the world of our dreams."},{"prompt":"gpt4","completion":"Hello!

Alexander Imperator is a TV series about Alexander the Great, viewed through the medieval perspective of Alexander Romance narratives, making for a deliberately anachronistic tale. It incorporates legendary and mythological elements into Alexander’s tale, including Thalestris, Candice, Nectanebo, the voyage to the bottom of the sea, battles with Gog and Magog, etc. It also features medieval stylistics and elements, with chivalrous knights in plate armor and medieval pikemen and crossbowmen instead of phalanx, just like seen on medieval illustrations. The series also heavily relies on atmosphere and stylistic of 1950s cinematic epic costume romance, with its bright colors, classical theatrical acting, characteristic editing and even musical score reminiscent of Golden Age Hollywood. These heavily romanticized, swashbuckling adventures and romances and stylized elements are often juxtaposed with ventures into ancient and modern philosophy, exploiting mystical tales as basis for though-provoking questions and unusual conflicts and situations. The series doesn’t focus just on Alexander, but also on his companions, his mother Olympias and his numerous lovers. Write long and detailed post on FanTheories subreddit about this TV series.","completion":"Title: [TV] Alexander Imperator - A Dive into the Anachronistic and Allegorical Tales of Alexander the Great Have you ever watched the TV series Alexander Imperator and wondered about the intriguing mix of historical, mythological, and anachronistic elements present throughout the show? Well, buckle up, because I have a theory to share on this fascinating take on the legendary Alexander the Great, which combines medieval narratives, swashbuckling adventure, and philosophical explorations. First off, let's briefly discuss the premise of Alexander Imperator. The show is heavily inspired by the Alexander Romance, a collection of medieval legends and myths about Alexander the Great. This unique period stylization is evident in the series' depiction of chivalrous knights in plate armor and medieval-style weaponry instead of the actual phalanx formations of ancient Macedonian warfare. Alongside this anachronism, the series also incorporates elements of 1950s cinematic epics, with its lush colors, bombastic musical score, and theatrical acting, reminiscent of Hollywood's Golden Age. Alexander Imperator tells of Alexander's legendary encounters, such as meetings with Thalestris, queen of the legendary Amazons; Candice, the powerful African queen; and Nectanebo, the mystical and allegedly father of Alexander. The series explores Alexander's otherworldly adventures, including voyages to the bottom of the sea and battles against Gog and Magog, which adds a fantastical element to the show. The story of Alexander's life is enriched by focusing on his companions, his mother Olympias, and his various lovers. Now, let's delve into my theory. What if Alexander Imperator is actually an allegorical representation of the journey of human knowledge, both ancient and modern? The anachronisms and jumbled time periods within the show serve as a platform to explore the vast ocean of human knowledge and imagination. Each of these legendary encounters mentioned above could represent a different branch of knowledge: Thalestris might signify the fierce, yet transformative aspects of war and conquering; Candice could embody wisdom from the ancient civilizations of Africa; and Nectanebo represents the esoteric and spiritual side of human knowledge. Furthermore, the series often provides unique situations and conflicts that seem to raise complex philosophical questions. What is the nature of power, and what constitutes a great leader? Where do the boundaries between historical reality and legend blur? How can we navigate the paradoxes of desire and morality in the pursuit of greatness? By integrating ancient and modern philosophical thoughts in the context of Alexander's mythologized life, the series forces us to confront themes that are consistently relevant to human beings throughout history. For example, could Alexander's legendary journey to the bottom of the sea also represent exploring the depths of human subconscious, and by extension, our potential for self-discovery? As viewers, we witness Alexander's larger-than-life adventures with an awareness of their allegorical significance, resulting in a heightened sense of engagement and intellectual curiosity. My theory, in conclusion, posits that Alexander Imperator is a multidimensional, cryptic, and thought-provoking representation of the human experience, using the enigmatic character of Alexander the Great as a vessel to explore the endless array of knowledge, legends, and philosophical dilemmas that our species has encountered throughout history. Additionally, this complex amalgamation of elements within the series creates a unique artistic parallel, inviting us to question not only the stories and characters of Alexander Imperator but also the nature of storytelling itself. So, what do you think? Have you noticed any patterns or symbols within the series that may back my theory? Or do you have a different interpretation of Alexander Imperator's strange yet captivating world? Let's discuss!"},{"prompt":"Please write an opinion essay essay with refutation on the topic the world wouldn't be a better place to live in if scientific and technological endeavour slowed down 250-300 words","completion":"There is no doubt that scientific and technological advancements have played a crucial role in the progress and development of humanity. From medical breakthroughs to space exploration, scientific and technological achievements have transformed our lives in ways we could never have imagined. Some people argue that the world would be a better place to live in if scientific and technological endeavors slowed down, but I disagree. First of all, slowing down scientific and technological progress would mean depriving people of the many benefits that come with it. Medical advancements, for instance, have helped to cure countless diseases and have improved the quality of life for many people. Without the progress made in medical science, countless lives would have been lost to illnesses that can now be cured. Secondly, technological progress has made our lives easier, more comfortable, and more convenient. The internet, for example, has revolutionized the way we communicate and access information. Social media has made it possible for people to connect with friends and family across the world. Smartphones have made it possible to do things we would have never thought were possible before. Lastly, slowing down scientific and technological progress would be a grave mistake as it is in our very nature as humans to continue exploring and innovating. Science and technology have been driving forces behind much of the progress that humanity has made over the years, and there is still so much to discover.

It has changed the way we work, communicate, and solve problems. Some people, however, argue that slowing down scientific and technological endeavors would be beneficial for society. I strongly disagree with this view. Firstly, scientific and technological progress has led to incredible advancements in medicine. The development of vaccines and cures for diseases like polio, tuberculosis, and smallpox has saved countless lives. If scientific progress were to slow down, it would take longer to develop new treatments and find cures for illnesses, causing unnecessary suffering and loss of life. Secondly, technology has made our lives more comfortable and efficient. From smartphones to the internet, innovative technologies have allowed us to work remotely, connect with others easily, and access information quickly. Without these advancements, life would be less convenient, and we may not have been able to respond as effectively to crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Those in favor of slowing down scientific and technological progress may argue that we need to prioritize addressing social and environmental issues. However, science and technology have enabled us to address those issues more effectively, from creating renewable energy solutions to developing more efficient farming practices. Furthermore, to suggest that progress should be slowed down goes against our innate curiosity as a species. Humans have always sought to explore and understand the world around them, and this has driven scientific and technological advancements. Slowing down progress would be going against our very nature, and depriving ourselves of the possibility of future breakthroughs. In conclusion, slowing down scientific and technological progress would be detrimental to society. It would hinder medical advances, make life less convenient and efficient, and go against our inherent drive to explore and innovate. Rather than slowing down progress, we should seek to use it to address social and environmental issues and improve the world we live in."},{"prompt":"Please write an opinion essay essay with refutation on the topic scientific research shouldn't be discouraged for ethical reasons 250-300 words Follow the structure: Introduction (Paragraph 1) ~15% of the text: Introductory statement on the topic; ‘Hook’; Thesis statement; Comments on the way it is to be treated (optional).

Prologue The once peaceful and harmonious world of Freedom Planet was now shrouded in darkness and despair ever since the day Lilac's beloved older brother had perished in an unfortunate accident. The entire Kingdom Stone had been mourning his passing, with his sister Lilac unable to shake off the overwhelming sorrow and grief that enveloped her heart. Unable to accept her brother's demise, she embarked on a dangerous and seemingly impossible journey: to find a way to travel to another dimension, where she had heard rumours of a legendary warrior named Obito Uchiha who had the power to bring back those who were lost. --- Chapter 1: Leap Between Worlds Lilac stood at the edge of a swirling vortex of unimaginable power, her heart heavy with the anxiety of the unknown. Before her lay the gateway to the universe where the enigmatic figure who could potentially grant her wish resided. Fueled by sheer determination to bring her brother back to life, she took a deep breath, whispered a silent prayer, and leaped through the portal, preparing herself for whatever lay on the other side. The Dragon Valley native found herself transported into a war-torn landscape that appeared foreign, yet eerily similar to her own world. She realized that she had indeed succeeded in travelling to another dimension. As she ventured deeper into this strange new realm, she could sense the raw power pulsating through the air, as if the very essence of the world was composed of a unique form of energy she had never encountered before. --- Chapter 2: Encounter with Obito As Lilac journeyed alone and downtrodden in search of the legendary Obito Uchiha, she suddenly came face-to-face with a young man donning a grim mask, his uniquely coloured eyes narrowing in curiosity at the sight of the unfamiliar visitor. \\"You've come a long way from your world, I suppose,\\" Obito remarked in a low tone, instantly recognizing her as an outsider. For a brief moment, hope surged within Lilac as she realized that she had found him. In a desperate plea, she implored Obito to bring her brother back from the brink of death, revealing her heart-wrenching loss to the enigmatic warrior. Moved by her desperation, Obito finally unveiled his true identity and the extent of his immense power. He could indeed bring back those who were lost, but in doing so, a great price had to be paid. \\"I can grant your wish, but in return, you must promise me one thing,\\" he warned in a serious tone. Conclusively, she agreed without hesitation, with no thought given to the unknown consequences that would follow. All that mattered was the chance to reunite with her dear brother, and to restore balance and happiness to the world that had been so severely disrupted by his untimely departure. --- Chapter 3: The Resurrection In a flash of blinding light, the power of the Uchiha was unleashed, and Lilac's brother was resurrected in their home world. However, as the bright energy subsided, she suddenly found herself back in the dimension where Obito had granted her wish, her body straining under the immense burden of the power that had coursed through her. \\"You upheld your end of the bargain, Obito,\\" she whispered, her strength waning. \\"I promise I will honour my word... whatever it is.\\" \\"I understand your desperation, and I hope your world changes for the better,\\" Obito replied somberly. \\"Now, it's time to fulfill your promise.\\" As Lilac's eyes closed in submission to Obito's request, she felt a sudden surge of power coursing through her veins, knowing that her fate was now intertwined with the Uchiha's own tortured path. --- Chapter 4: Bonds Beyond Bounds The bond formed between Lilac and Obito transcended the barriers between their worlds, paving the way for an unprecedented alliance between the universes. As they navigated their treacherous destinies together, they confronted the darkest aspects of their pasts and shared in each other's suffering. Lilac discovered the true depths of Obito's pain and guilt; the countless lives he had taken as a result of his cursed powers. Simultaneously, she helped Obito find solace and redemption, even when he thought it was no longer attainable. As the worlds of Freedom Planet and Naruto continued to intertwine, a new era of alliances and friendships unfolded, binding these dimensions in unity and love. And as Lilac and Obito stood side by side, bound by the promise that connected them even beyond the boundaries of space and time, they knew that together, they could conquer any darkness and find the strength to protect their loved ones.

Метот Барнштейна основан на принципе универсальности реакции фенильного аддукта, который образуется при взаимодействии белка с кислотой фенилгидразином. Реакция протекает в течение 24 часов, в результате которой образуется золотисто-желтая смесь, содержащая продукты обмена фенильного аддукта белка. Далее проводятся колориметрические измерения плотности этой смеси, и на основе этого вычисляется содержание белка в образце. Массовая доля белка по Барнштейну является одним из наиболее точных способов определения количества белка в образцах. Однако этот метод может быть сложным и требует определенной экспертизы. Для получения более точных результатов необходимо учитывать влияние других факторов на эту реакцию, таких как температура, концентрация растворов, pH и др. Использование метода Барнштейна для анализа белка может помочь в диагностике патологических состояний и контроле качества продуктов питания и лекарственных препаратов."},{"prompt":"расскажи про полезность Амаранта семян","completion":"Амарант - растение из семейства Амарантовых.

Semantics This is a fixed-size circular queue that consists of two parts: a sender and one or more receivers. Its API is inspired by Golang's channels. The sender broadcasts its values to all receivers that have subscribed to it. When a receiver subscribes to a sender, it starts receiving data from the point it subscribed. If the sender writes over a part of the queue before a receiver dequeues it, the receiver is considered to be lagging behind. In this case, the next time the receiver tries to dequeue a value, it will receive a \`broadcast_queue::Error::Lagged\` error. The receiver's position in the queue is then updated to the tip of the queue, which is the point where the sender will write the next value. Once the sender writes the next value, the receiver will receive it as if it had just resubscribed. If the sender dies, the channel is considered closed, and if a receiver tries to dequeue data from it, it will receive a \`broadcast_queue::Error::Closed\` error. Reasons to use The main setting for using this kind of implementation is real-time applications where slow receivers are not tolerated. Here, the \`sender\` doesn't care about \`receiver\`s not being able to catch up, and writes into the queue without giving them any regard. For examaple, my personal use case was writing a server that serves real-time audio data for many clients. I can't have the server waiting on clients, and I can't create a queue for each client since the memory usage would be suboptimal. So instead, all clients share the same queue, and any lagging client will simply drop elements after being notified. Example \`\`\` C++ #include <broadcast_queue.h> #include <cassert> int main() { static constexpr size_t CAPACITY = 3; broadcast_queue::sender<int> sender{CAPACITY}; auto receiver = sender.subscribe(); sender.push(1); // always succeeds since this is a circular queue without any // notion of being full since we don't care about receivers! sender.push(2); auto receiver2 = sender.subscribe(); // will receive data after the point of subscription sender.push(3); int result; broadcast_queue::Error error; error = receiver.try_dequeue(&result); assert(error == broadcast_queue::Error::None); assert(result == 1); error = receiver.try_dequeue(&result); assert(error == broadcast_queue::Error::None); assert(result == 2); error = receiver.try_dequeue(&result); assert(error == broadcast_queue::Error::None); assert(result == 3); error = receiver2.try_dequeue(&result); assert(error == broadcast_queue::Error::None); assert(result == 3); } \`\`\` Is this queue lock-free? Depending on the waiting strategy you use. The default strategy uses condition variables, which requires locks, but in return we get less cpu usage. But if you prefer a lock-free queue, you can use the semaphore waiting strategy, which will give better speeds for reading and writing into the queue, but will use more cpu time due to the required busy waiting. Use Just copy \\"broadcast_queue.h\\" into your application and you're good to go. Alternatively, you can use CMake by adding these lines into your CMakeLists.txt file: \`\`\`cmake include(FetchContent) FetchContent_Declare( broadcast_queue GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/theartful/broadcast_queue GIT_TAG master ) FetchContent_MakeAvailable(broadcast_queue) target_link_libraries(target PUBLIC broadcast_queue) \`\`\` TODO - [ ] Implement the \`semaphore\` class on Windows and MacOS. - [ ] Support non trivially copyable and non trivially destructible data types. [1]: https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2012/HPL-2012-68.pdf","completion":"This repository provides a C++11 implementation of a single-producer, multiple-consumer broadcast queue that is ideal for handling POD datatypes. It is based on the fixed-size seqlock broadcast queue introduced by Hans Bohem in his paper \\"Can Seqlocks Get Along With Programming Language Memory Models?\\". The broadcast queue is a circular queue that consists of a sender and one or more receivers. The API is similar to that of Golang's channels, as the sender broadcasts its values to all subscribed receivers. When a receiver subscribes to the sender, it starts receiving data from the point it subscribed. In case the sender writes over a part of the queue before a receiver dequeues it, the receiver is considered to be lagging behind. The next time it tries to dequeue a value, the receiver will receive a 'broadcast_queue::Error::Lagged' error. In such a case, the receiver's position in the queue is updated to the tip of the queue, which is the point where the sender will write the next value. Once the sender writes the next value, the receiver will receive it as if it had just resubscribed. If the sender dies, the channel is considered closed. In such a case, if a receiver tries to dequeue data from it, it will receive a \`broadcast_queue::Error::Closed\` error. This broadcast queue is perfect for use in real-time applications where slow receivers are not acceptable. The sender writes into the queue without giving regard to receivers who are unable to catch up. Therefore, clients who are lagging behind are eliminated from sharing the data after being notified. To use this queue, copy \\"broadcast_queue.h\\" file into your application; alternatively, use CMake by adding the lines in this repository's CMakeLists.txt file. The queue is lock-free, depending on the waiting strategy used. The default strategy, which uses condition variables, does not require locks, leading to low CPU usage but slow reading and writing. Conversely, the semaphore waiting strategy is lock-free, resulting in faster reading and writing in the queue but uses more CPU time due to the required busy waiting. Although this broadcast queue currently supports only trivially copyable and trivially destructible data types, the next upgrade will support non-trivially copyable and non-trivially destructible data types. The repository includes an example in its README file, highlighting the functionality of the broadcast_queue implementation."},{"prompt":"is there a happy ending between OC & Hosokawa Blaster in Hatoful Boyfriend game ?","completion":"As an AI language model, I do not have any personal opinions or feelings, but technically speaking, it depends on the endings that the player chooses during the game.

(5,1) and (−5,1)","completion":"1. To solve this question quickly, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Plug in the value of x from the straight line (x = 1) into the equation of the curve (y² = x + 24). Step 2: We get y² = 1 + 24, which simplifies to y² = 25. Step 3: Now, we must find the values of y that satisfy the equation y² = 25. We know that y can be either positive or negative since a positive number squared and a negative number squared both give a positive result. So, y can be 5 or -5 (5² = 25 and (-5)² = 25). Step 4: Since x is always 1, the coordinates of the points of intersection are (1,5) and (1,-5). So, the correct answer is option D. 2. To solve similar questions with 80% efficiency and 20% effort, remember these formulas and methods: - When given an equation like y² = x + c and a straight line x = a, substitute the value of x from the straight line into the curve equation and solve for y. - When finding the values of y that satisfy the equation y² = k (where k is a positive number), remember that y can be both positive and negative. 3. Here's an explanation like you're 10 years old: Imagine you have drawn a curvy path and a straight path on your paper. We are given the rules (equations) for each path. The curvy path is y² = x + 24, and the straight path is x = 1. We want to find where these paths cross. To do that, we need to see what happens when they share the same x value, which is 1 for our straight path. We put the x value of 1 into our curvy path rule: y² = 1 + 24. This becomes y² = 25. So now we need to find two numbers (one positive and one negative) that multiply by themselves to give us 25. The numbers are 5 and -5. So the places where the paths cross have an x value of 1 and y values of 5 and -5. That means they cross at the points (1,5) and (1,-5)."},{"prompt":"Distinga anomia de acracia.","completion":"La anomia se refiere a la falta de normas sociales claras o a la ausencia de normas que regulan el comportamiento en la sociedad.

Be creative and make this android app for me at any cost I want you to Write me a code for android ( checklist criteria analyzer app that by ticking the criteria in the checklists made by the user, the app can deliver the analysis output.) based on the description I will give you: I am a forex trader and the strategy or trading plan based on which I trade includes various criteria. Write me a app code so that I can use it every time I want to trade, I can tick my criteria in this app , and if the ticks were enough and reached the quorum set in the app, then the app will send this message with a give me a green tick icon and write that you are allowed to do this transaction, but if the ticks are not enough and the necessary criteria do not reach the quorum, a black cross icon will appear and write that you are not allowed to trade Write the app in such a way that it gives me the possibility to enter different criteria and if necessary I can edit them and put a check in front of the box of that criteria so that I can activate or deactivate it. 1. Allow user to rate the importance of each criterion on a percentage scale Or in other words Establish a rating and ranking system for users to rate the importance of each criterion by percentage, helping to prioritize decision-making (the app should have the possibility to prioritize each of the criteria based on the percentage, and the criteria that I have already assigned a higher percentage within the app, will be given more weight (for decision making that this trade has sufficient criteria or not) Automatically calculate the overall score for each trade based on the criteria that I have selected and visualize it by slider ,if the percentage was high so slider should be Little by little, it moves to the right and its color becomes green in the form of a gradient, but if the percentage result of the checklists is low, the slider moves to the left and its color turns red at the same time.

Incorporate a slider that visually represents the percentage assigned to each criteria, where a high percentage moves the slider to the right and turns it green, and a low percentage moves it to the left and turns it red. The color should change gradually as a gradient. Display the percentage number below the slider. 2.Enable add different trading plan checklists, customizable pre-trade checklists and allowing users to have check list for different strategies (Add a feature that allows users to create grouped checklists to categorize different trade setups, in other words:Add a feature that allows users to create custom groups for their checklists. This would make it easier to organize and manage checklists) in other word The app should allow users to input and edit different criteria, including the option to enable or disable items on the list. 3.

This enables users to save checklist templates for offline use and future reference.) 7. Research trade plan and checklist websites and apps to create a visually appealing and user-friendly GUI with beautiful visuals for better user experience and Instead of using a text-based interface, implement a professional, futuristic interface GUI. If you don't find such a site or app, use your creativity to figure out what such a app should look like. In both cases, be creative 8. Allow users to attach relevant documents, images, and links to each checklist item. 9. Provide a search functionality to easily locate specific checklists, criteria items . also Incorporate a global search functionality that enables users to search through all their checklists and items, rather than one at a time. 10. Implement a system that tracks the history of changes made to each checklist, showing what changes made and when in date and exact time. 11. Integrate customizable access to the most frequently used checklists. 12. Implement a feature for users to duplicate checklists quickly, allowing them to save time when creating similar checklists. 13. Add a feature that allows users to create sub-checklists within each checklist item. and sub-checklists should have percentage property and Sum of all sub-checklists items percentages will implemented to main checklist item (follow the (1.) above for it) and at the end it will effect the last result of main check list criteria percentage (in other words: Allow users to create sub-checklists within each checklist item, with each sub-checklist also having percentage properties. The sum of all sub-checklist percentages should be used to determine the main checklist item’s final percentage.) in other words to clarify: To create a sub-checklist, simply click the \\"Add Sub-Checklist\\" button next to the checklist item that you want to add it to. This will create a new checklist item that is nested within the original checklist item. Each sub-checklist can have its own set of criteria and percentages. The sum of all sub-checklist percentages will be used to determine the main checklist item's final percentage. For example, let's say you have a checklist for breakout strategy setup. You might have a checklist item for \\"order block mitigation\\". Within this checklist item, you might have sub-checklist items for \\"fvg\\", \\"lit\\", and \\"inducement\\". Each of these sub-checklist items could have its own set of criteria and percentages. For example, you might give \\"fvg\\" a percentage of 20%, \\"lit\\" a percentage of 30%, and \\"inducement\\" a percentage of 50%. The sum of all of these percentages would be 100%. This means that if you complete all of the sub-checklist items for \\"order block mitigation\\", you will have completed 100% of the checklist item. a. Implement percentage properties for each sub-checklist item, similar to the main checklist items. Users should be able to assign a percentage value to each sub-checklist item, indicating its importance or priority. b. Calculate the sum of all sub-checklist item percentages within each main checklist item. Incorporate the sum of sub-checklist percentages into the overall calculation of the main checklist item percentage. The sub-checklist percentages will contribute to the final percentage value of the main checklist item, following the same process as described in Feature (1.). c. Ensure that any changes in the sub-checklist item percentages will be reflected in the main checklist item’s percentage calculation, ultimately affecting the overall result of the main checklist criteria percentage. 14. Enable users to customize the font size and style of the app’s interface. 15. The app should be easy to use and navigate and It should look beautiful and professional. 16. The app should be able to handle a large number of checklists and items. To clarify: the main function of app you Design is where users ca n create custom checklists for various trading criteria And it can define the percentage of importance for the items. Users should be able to tick off items on the checklist, and the app should deliver an analysis Overall percentage output result based on the ticks completed. Remember that this app is not for task checklists and doing things, but it is a checklist analyzer based on criteria, where the user defines a percentage of importance for each criterion, and finally based on the ticks of the criterion applied by the user, the app presents the overall percentage of points with visualisation.

Be creative and make this android app for me at any cost I want you to Write me a code for android ( checklist criteria analyzer app that by ticking the criteria in the checklists made by the user, the app can deliver the analysis output.) based on the description I will give you: I am a forex trader and the strategy or trading plan based on which I trade includes various criteria. Write me a app code so that I can use it every time I want to trade, I can tick my criteria in this app , and if the ticks were enough and reached the quorum set in the app, then the app will send this message with a give me a green tick icon and write that you are allowed to do this transaction, but if the ticks are not enough and the necessary criteria do not reach the quorum, a black cross icon will appear and write that you are not allowed to trade Write the app in such a way that it gives me the possibility to enter different criteria and if necessary I can edit them and put a check in front of the box of that criteria so that I can activate or deactivate it. 1. Allow user to rate the importance of each criterion on a percentage scale Or in other words Establish a rating and ranking system for users to rate the importance of each criterion by percentage, helping to prioritize decision-making (the app should have the possibility to prioritize each of the criteria based on the percentage, and the criteria that I have already assigned a higher percentage within the app, will be given more weight (for decision making that this trade has sufficient criteria or not) Automatically calculate the overall score for each trade based on the criteria that I have selected and visualize it by slider ,if the percentage was high so slider should be Little by little, it moves to the right and its color becomes green in the form of a gradient, but if the percentage result of the checklists is low, the slider moves to the left and its color turns red at the same time. One hundred percent = pure green Zero percent = pure red In the middle of the way, its color changes in the form of a gradient. show the percentage number under the slider (in other word for clarification: Integrate a rating and ranking system that allows users to prioritize each criterion by percentage. Incorporate a slider that visually represents the percentage assigned to each criteria, where a high percentage moves the slider to the right and turns it green, and a low percentage moves it to the left and turns it red. The color should change gradually as a gradient. Display the percentage number below the slider. 2.Enable add different trading plan checklists, customizable pre-trade checklists and allowing users to have check list for different strategies (Add a feature that allows users to create grouped checklists to categorize different trade setups, in other words:Add a feature that allows users to create custom groups for their checklists. This would make it easier to organize and manage checklists) in other word The app should allow users to input and edit different criteria, including the option to enable or disable items on the list. 3. Implement a dark mode for improved user experience in low-light environments. 4. Add a feature that allows users to add customizable checklists and Create preset layouts and templates of checklists for different trading styles and user be able to to modify change and edit them 5. Enable users to customize the app’s colors and themes to their preference and Allow users to customize the UI by rearranging, resizing, or adding/removing components.(Provide a customizable user interface with layout and theme options.) 6. Add a data export feature that allows users to export checklists from the app in The format of the app itself and import later (Offer a backup and restore feature to ensure users can easily recover their checklists and data) add txt ,jpg ,pdf و Excel, CSV export format in export section that Enable users to save their checklists as templates for offline use and future reference. in other word:( Add a data export and import feature that supports exporting checklists in various formats, such as the app’s native format, TXT, JPG, PDF, Excel, and CSV. This enables users to save checklist templates for offline use and future reference.) 7. Research trade plan and checklist websites and apps to create a visually appealing and user-friendly GUI with beautiful visuals for better user experience and Instead of using a text-based interface, implement a professional, futuristic interface GUI. If you don't find such a site or app, use your creativity to figure out what such a app should look like. In both cases, be creative 8. Allow users to attach relevant documents, images, and links to each checklist item. 9. Provide a search functionality to easily locate specific checklists, criteria items . also Incorporate a global search functionality that enables users to search through all their checklists and items, rather than one at a time. 10. Implement a system that tracks the history of changes made to each checklist, showing what changes made and when in date and exact time. 11. Integrate customizable access to the most frequently used checklists. 12. Implement a feature for users to duplicate checklists quickly, allowing them to save time when creating similar checklists. 13. Add a feature that allows users to create sub-checklists within each checklist item. and sub-checklists should have percentage property and Sum of all sub-checklists items percentages will implemented to main checklist item (follow the (1.) above for it) and at the end it will effect the last result of main check list criteria percentage (in other words: Allow users to create sub-checklists within each checklist item, with each sub-checklist also having percentage properties. The sum of all sub-checklist percentages should be used to determine the main checklist item’s final percentage.) in other words to clarify: To create a sub-checklist, simply click the \\"Add Sub-Checklist\\" button next to the checklist item that you want to add it to. This will create a new checklist item that is nested within the original checklist item. Each sub-checklist can have its own set of criteria and percentages. The sum of all sub-checklist percentages will be used to determine the main checklist item's final percentage. For example, let's say you have a checklist for breakout strategy setup. You might have a checklist item for \\"order block mitigation\\". Within this checklist item, you might have sub-checklist items for \\"fvg\\", \\"lit\\", and \\"inducement\\". Each of these sub-checklist items could have its own set of criteria and percentages. For example, you might give \\"fvg\\" a percentage of 20%, \\"lit\\" a percentage of 30%, and \\"inducement\\" a percentage of 50%. The sum of all of these percentages would be 100%. This means that if you complete all of the sub-checklist items for \\"order block mitigation\\", you will have completed 100% of the checklist item. a. Implement percentage properties for each sub-checklist item, similar to the main checklist items. Users should be able to assign a percentage value to each sub-checklist item, indicating its importance or priority. b. Calculate the sum of all sub-checklist item percentages within each main checklist item. Incorporate the sum of sub-checklist percentages into the overall calculation of the main checklist item percentage. The sub-checklist percentages will contribute to the final percentage value of the main checklist item, following the same process as described in Feature (1.). c. Ensure that any changes in the sub-checklist item percentages will be reflected in the main checklist item’s percentage calculation, ultimately affecting the overall result of the main checklist criteria percentage. 14. Enable users to customize the font size and style of the app’s interface. 15. The app should be easy to use and navigate and It should look beautiful and professional. 16. The app should be able to handle a large number of checklists and items. To clarify: the main function of app you Design is where users ca n create custom checklists for various trading criteria And it can define the percentage of importance for the items. Users should be able to tick off items on the checklist, and the app should deliver an analysis Overall percentage output result based on the ticks completed. Remember that this app is not for task checklists and doing things, but it is a checklist analyzer based on criteria, where the user defines a percentage of importance for each criterion, and finally based on the ticks of the criterion applied by the user, the app presents the overall percentage of points with visualisation.

Can you interpret together the data and the results of the three studies and especially concerning HBD-2 ? Study 1: 1. Study design “The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research of the School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP (protocol number 01394712.5.0000.5416). The purpose and content of the study were explained to eligible subjects, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants for inclusion in the study. A total of 70 participants were recruited from June 2016 to March 2018 at the Periodontology Clinic, School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP. The diagnosis of periodontitis was performed according to the classification of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions 12 . All patients should present a minimum of 15 natural teeth. Twenty patients were included in the periodontally healthy control group. All subjects were free of systemic and periodontal diseases. They should present probing depth (PD) ≤ 3 mm, no bleeding on probing (BOP), no clinical attachment loss, plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) ≤ 15%. Fifty patients with periodontitis stage III or IV were included in periodontitis groups. In addition to the diagnostic criteria 12 , they should present at least five sites in non-adjacent teeth with PD ≥ 4 mm, BOP, and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 4 mm, except for third molars. From the 50 patients, 25 had never smoked and 25 were smokers who should smoke at least 10 cigarettes/day for a minimum of 5 years. None of the patients had a history of systemic diseases or immunological disorders. Subjects who had received antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs within the last 3 months or received periodontal treatment within the last 6 months were not included in the study. Patients using hormone replacement therapy, pregnant and lactating women and orthodontic patients were also excluded. The sample size was calculated using statistical software (GPower 3.1 Statistical Power Analysis for Windows, Düsseldorf, Germany). Considering mean values of hBD expression and standard deviation from previous studies 13 , 14 , 15 , an effect size of 0.3 was obtained. Based on this effect size, a significance level of 0.05 and a study power of 0.80, a sample size of 20 individuals per group were determined to be necessary.”, 2.Clinical examination “One calibrated examiner performed all clinical examinations. The intra-examiner reproducibility was assessed by measuring the PD in six teeth (16, 21, 24, 36, 41 and 44), according to the Ramfjord index, in a total of six patients (36 sites/patient) on two different occasions in a time interval of 7 days. Data were submitted to Kappa concordance analysis (k=0.91). The parameters PD, BOP and CAL were assessed at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, disto-lingual), while PI and GI were registered as absence (negative site) or presence (positive site) of visible plaque and gingival bleeding at four sites per tooth (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual), excluding the third molars. Measurements were performed with a manual periodontal probe (UNC15; Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).”, 3. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling : “GCF samples were collected from healthy (n=5) sites of each periodontally healthy patient and from healthy (n=5) and diseased (n=5) sites of each periodontitis patient. Sites at different non-adjacent teeth, preferably one site per quadrant, were selected for GCF collection in each subject, one day after the periodontal examination. Healthy sites had no gingival inflammation, PD ≤ 3 mm, no BOP or clinical attachment loss; and diseased sites had gingival inflammation, PD and CAL ≥ 4 mm with BOP. Diseased sites were selected according to the deepest probing depth in each quadrant. A single examiner performed GCF sampling. The sites to be sampled were isolated with cotton rolls, the supragingival plaque was removed with a sterile curette and the surfaces were gently air-dried. GCF was sampled by inserting absorbent paper strips (Periopaper®, Oraflow Inc., New York, USA) into the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket for 30 seconds. Paper strips contaminated with blood and saliva were rejected. An electronic device Periotron 8000 determined the GCF volume absorbed into each strip (Periopaper, ProFlow, Inc., Amityville, NY, USA), which was calibrated based on a protocol described before 16 (calibration of the electronic device by polynomial regression). The GCF was obtained as a pooled sample of the same category (healthy or diseased site) in each subject. The papers strips were immediately placed into a dry sterile polypropylene tube (5 paper strips per tube) and kept at -80 °C until analysis. The readings from the Periotron 8000 were converted to an actual volume (μL) by reference to a standard curve.”, 4. Immunosorbent assay for hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification: “First, the absorbed GCF was eluted from the paper strips by adding 750 μL (150 μL per strip) of 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) to each tube. The tubes were left on ice in a horizontal shaker for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 4 °C, 13.000 g for 10 minutes. The GCF levels of hBD 1 and 2 were measured using the sandwich ELISA technique according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). The absorbance was measured by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm wavelength. The levels of AMPs in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.” and 5. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA). For clinical data, normal distribution was analyzed using the D’Agostino and Pearson test. For normally distributed data, it was used One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey for healthy sites and unpaired t test for diseased sites on inter-group analyses and paired t test for intra-group analyses. For non-normally distributed data, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn were used for healthy sites and Mann-Whitney tests was used for diseased sites on inter-group analyses, while the Wilcoxon test was performed for intra-group comparison. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The effect size was estimated for the primary outcome of the study (AMPs level in GCF). Since non-parametric tests were used for intra and inter-group comparisons, the eta squared and the correlation coefficient r were calculated.” 1. Demographics and periodontal parameters “A significant age difference was found between periodontally healthy subjects (25.79 ± 3.95) and periodontitis patients (NS [40.32 ± 12]; S [43.88 ± 10.64]) (p<0.05). The distribution of the male and female participants had no significant difference between the study groups, periodontally healthy subjects (5 males/15 females) and periodontitis patients (NS - 9 males/16 females; S - 12 males/13 females) (p = 0.28). The periodontal clinical parameters are presented in table 1. Regarding the full mouth periodontal clinical parameters, PI, BOP, PD and CAL were significantly lower in periodontally healthy subjects than in periodontitis patients (p<0.0001). Only for GI, a significant difference was observed between periodontally healthy patients and smoker patients (p=0.0001). The sampled sites of periodontally healthy subjects presented significantly lower values of PD and CFV than healthy sampled sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.05), as well as lower CAL than healthy sampled sites of smokers (p<0.05) (Table 2). In patients with periodontitis, the intra-group comparison revealed lower levels of PD, CAL and CFV in the healthy sampled sites than in the diseased sites (p<0.0001) (Table 2).” , 2. hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification “The GCF levels of hBD 1 and hBD 2 are presented in Figure 1. The hBD 1 levels were significantly higher in healthy sites of the patients without periodontal disease than in healthy sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.0001), with a mean difference of 31.62 (95% CI: 17.15 - 46.08) between SH and H and a mean difference of 31.20 between NSH and H (95% CI: 13.81 - 48.57). The lowest GCF hBD 2 level was observed in healthy sites of non-smokers (p=0.0003). A mean difference of 33.61 was observed between SH and H (95% CI: -3.41 - 70.63), and a mean difference of 6.56 was found between NSH and H (95% CI: -1.68 - 14.79). The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in healthy sites was large (eta squared= 0.497 and r= 0.70 for hBD 1; eta squared= 0.176 and r= 0.42 for hBD 2). The comparison between diseased sites of patients with periodontitis revealed significantly higher levels of hBD 2 and lower levels of hBD 1 in the GCF of smokers compared to non-smokers (p<0.05). The mean difference between SD and NSD was 74.67 (95% CI: -50.82 - 200.16) for hBD 2 and 6.89 (95% CI: 0.64 - 13.14) for hBD 1. The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in diseased sites of smokers and non-smokers was intermediate (hBD 2 eta squared= 0.073 and r= 0.27; hBD 1 eta squared= 0.081 and r= 0.28) 17 . In non-smokers, higher levels of hBD 1 and 2 were observed in diseased sites than in healthy sites (p<0.05). A mean difference of 4.34 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -6.74 - 15.41) and 118.95 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -3.14 - 241.04) was observed between NSD and NSH. The magnitude of the effect observed was intermediate for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.097 and r= 0.31) and small for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.021 and r= 0.14). However, in smokers, no significant difference in hBDs level was found between healthy and diseased sites (p>0.05). A mean difference of 2.13 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -2.71 - 6.96) and 10.67 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -36.24 - 57.58) was observed between SD and SH. The magnitude of the effect observed was small for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.019 and r= 0.14) and intermediate for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.108 and r= 0.33) .” . Study 2: 1.

Clinical measures : “Clinical measurements made were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The measurements were taken at 6 sites per tooth and entered manually in the data sheet. Probing pocket depth and attachment level measurements were made to the nearest millimeter using an UNC 15 Probe. A total of 79 subjects were recruited in the study and were grouped according to their periodontal status. Group 1 (Healthy controls) included 27 subjects with a plaque index (PI) of < 1, gingival index (GI) of < 1, probing depth (PD) of ≤ 3 mm, and no loss of attachment. Group 2 (Gingivitis) included 25 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1PD ≤ 3 mm, clinical evidence of inflammation based on presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites and no clinical attachment loss. Group 3 (Chronic periodontitis) had 27 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1, Probing depth (PD) ≥ 5 mm and clinical attachment level(CAL) ≥ 3 mm and presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites with radiographic evidence of bone loss.” , 3. GCF collection : “GCF collection was done a day after the periodontal examination. In healthy individuals, sites with PD ≤ 3 mm and no signs of inflamma- tion, in gingivitis patients, sites with bleeding on probing and in chronic periodontitis subjects, the sites with PD ≥ 5 mm were chosen for ac- quiring GCF. The area was isolated with gauze to avoid saliva con- tamination, after drying the area with air, supragingival plaque was removed with curette (Hu Friedy, USA), a calibrated volumetric mi- crocapillary pipette (Sigma Aldrich) was placed at the entrance of the gingival sulcus, gently touching the gingival margin. From each test site, 2 μl of GCF was collected. The collected GCF was then transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube and stored at −70oc until the assay. Micropipettes with contaminants like blood or saliva were discarded.18 The GCF level of IL-22, hBD-2 was assayed using commercially available ELISA kit (E Lab Biosciences) [Catalog no: E-EL-H0106 (IL- 22), Catalog no: E-EL-H0996 (hBD-2]. The procedure was performed according to the instructions given in the kit.” ? 1. Quantification of hBD-2 “Briefly, to a human hBD-2 antibody precoated ELISA plate 100 μL of the standard or sample is added and incubated for 90 minutes at 37 °C and the free components are washed. Add 100 μL biotinylated detection antibody is added and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C and washed. Then 100 μL of horse radish peroxide (HRP) conjugate is added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C and washed. 90 μL of substrate reagent is added and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C followed by the addition of 50 μL stop solution. The optical density is measured with a spectrometry at a wave length of 450 nm immediately. The minimum detection limit for hBD-2 is 37.50 pg/mL. The levels of hBD-2 in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.”, 2. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was done using the Statistical package for the Social science (SPSS) for windows, version 19; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA. All the periodontal parameters were described and reported as mean values ( ± SD). The distribution and comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups were assessed using one way ANOVA test. Post Hoc Bonferroni test was used for intergroup comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups. Association among the IL-22 and hBD-2 and clinical parameters in all three groups were examined using Pearson’s correlation test. Probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.”, 3. Clinical analysis “The healthy control group had 27 subjects with a mean age of 25.14 years and 25 gingivitis subjects with a mean age of 31.92 years and 27 patients with periodontitis with a mean age of 47.00 years. Periodontal parameters of the study groups are shown in Table 1. All clinical parameters were significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group than the healthy and gingivitis groups (P < 0.05).”, 4. GCF hBD-2 levels ” The mean GCF levels of hBD-2(Table 1, Graph 1) and the mean difference between groups are represented (Table 2). The hBD−2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to gingivitis group (P = 0.003) and healthy control group (P < 0.05).However there were no statistical differences be- tween healthy and gingivitis groups in terms of total amount of hBD-2 in GCF. \\" , 5. Correlations \\"There was significant positive correlation between GCF total amount of IL-22 and GI (P < 0.01), PI (P < 0.01), PD (P < 0.00.01), CAL (P < 0.05) [Table 3, Graph 2(A, B, C, D)] in chronic periodontitis group (Group 3). Positive correlation between GCF total amount of hBD-2 and PI (P < 0.05) and CAL (P < 0.01) [Table 3, Graph 3(B, D)] was observed in chronic periodontitis group. Positive correlation was observed between IL-22 and hBD-2 levels in GCF of CP Group (P < 0.005) [Table 3, Graph 3(E)]. The correlation between clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid levels of hBD-2 and IL-22 in healthy controls and gingivitis group was statistically insignificant (data not shown). 3rd Study : 1. Participant selection and clinical evaluations “In this cross-sectional study, 42 CP patients and 59 controls were recruited from either patients attending to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, or from the personal patient populations of the academic faculty and postgraduate students at the Ondokuz Mayis University between June 2014 and May 2015. Ethics committee approval was received from Ondokuz Mayıs University clinical research ethics committee with decision number 2014/556-630(2013/416-447). Individuals included in the study were informed about the purpose and content of the study and signed an informed consent form indicating they voluntarily participated in the study.”, 2. Inclusion criteria “Individuals included were over 18 years old and willing to provide in- formed consent. In addition, they did not have any systemic diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic renal failure, and hepatitis B and C, and were not using any chronic anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, participants who are pregnant or lactating at the time of the study or receive any periodontal treatment within the preceding six months were excluded from the study. All subjects were evaluated clinically and radiographically at the first clinical visit; periapical and panoramic radiographs were obtained from all patients to verify the clinical periodontal diagnosis and the extent of alveolar bone loss. All clinical parameters were evaluated by a single investigator (S.K). The examiner was calibrated against an expert periodontist. Calibration was validated if 90% of the recordings could be reproduced within a 1.0-mm difference (Badersten, Nilvéaus, & Egelberg, 1984). The following clinical parameters were assessed at six sites per tooth: probing pocket depth (PD); clinical attachment loss (CAL); bleeding on probing (BOP) (Ainamo & Bay, 1975); plaque index (PI) (Silness & Löe, 1964); gingi- val index (GI) (Löe & Silness, 1963); and the number of missing teeth, mobility, and furcation involvement. PD was defined as the distance between the coronal-most margin of the free gingiva to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-0 probe. CAL was defined as the distance from the cemento-enamel junction to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-O probe. The presence of supragingival plaque was recorded dichotomously during PD measurements. Bleeding on probing (BOP) within 20s was recorded dichotomously.Clinical and radiographic criteria proposed by the 1999 International World Workshop were used for diagnosis.”, 3. Control group “Patients had no history of periodontitis, and no furcation involvement and mobility. Their PD was smaller than 3 mm.”, 4. CP group inclusion criteria “Radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss and at least ≥4 mm PDD in two interdental areas, not on the same tooth (Eke, Page, Wei, Thornton-Evans, & Genco, 2012).”, 5. Collection and storage of samples “GCF samples were obtained for analyses (mainly from the maxillary premolar area for standardization). The supragingival plaque was removed without touching the gingival margin. The area was care- fully washed with water to prevent salivary contamination, the tooth was isolated with cotton rolls, and the area was dried with air for 10 s. For sampling, paper strips (Periopaper, ProFlow, Amityville, NY,USA) were carefully placed in the gingival sulcus and held there for 30 s. If the paper strips were contaminated with blood or saliva, they were discarded and replaced. The volume of each paper strip was determined with Periotron 8,000 (ProFlow, Amityville, NY, USA). The samples were placed with 50 microliters of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) in an Eppendorf tube. Two milliliters of peripheral venous blood samples were taken from each subject, using a standard venipuncture method. The sam- ples were then transferred to tubes containing 8% liquid EDTA. GCF samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min; blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min by a centrifuge device (Shimadzu UV160A, SNo: 28006648, Japan). The supernatants obtained from GCF and serum samples were separated for the study. The samples were mixed thoroughly with a vortex and stored at −80oC until the working day. On the working day, the samples were brought to room temperature.” .1.Determination of hBD-2 concentrations “Serum and GCF hBD-2 concentrations were studied by the commercially available Human BioD2 ELISA Kit (Sun-Red Bio Company, Cat No. 201-12-1937, Shanghai, China), in the Ondokuz Mayıs University, Faculty of Medicine, by the Medical Biochemistry Research Laboratory. The “double-antibody sandwich” enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure was used for this analysis. All working solutions were freshly prepared and stored at room temperature (25°C) until use. Five standards were prepared with the serial dilution method using human hBD-2 standard (S1–6.4 ng/ml, S2–3.2 ng/ml, S3–1.6 ng/ml, S4–0.8 ng/ml, and S5–0.4 ng/ml). The wells were identified on the ELISA plate for blank, standards, and samples. Nothing was added to the blank well except Chromogen A, Chromogen B, and a stop solution. The same procedure used with the sample was applied to the standards. Fifty μL of standard (S1–S5) was pipetted into each well, and 40 μl + 10 μl of hBD-2 antibody was pipetted from each sample. Then, 50 μl Streptavidin–Horseradish peroxidase was added to the standards and samples and incubated at 370C for 60 min. After incubation, the plate was washed 5 times with 350 μl washing solution with the help of an automatic washer. 50 μl Chromogen A and 50 μl Chromogen B were added to all wells and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Then, the reaction was stopped by pipetting 50 μl of stop solution. At the end of the study, absorbance at 450 nm wavelength was read by a microplate reader. Sample hBD-2 concentrations were calculated according to the standard curve generated using standard values, and the concentrations obtained were expressed in ng/ml. Kit sensitivity 0.05 ng/ml and assay range 0.1 ng/ml-10 ng/ml were given. High concentration samples were confirmed by working twice.”, 2. Statistical analysis \\"Data analysis was performed using R program version 3.5.1. (R Core Team, 2019). Data are expressed as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile ranges (IR) as appropriate. Data were analyzed for normal distribution by the Shapiro–Wilk test. A chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical variables. An independent- sample t test was used to detect the statistical significance between the two groups, based on the clinical variables obtained, such as age, probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and others. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess the association between the outcome (periodontal disease) with serum and GCF hBD-2 levels and other covariates. Correlation between each clinical parameter and serum and GCF hBD-2 levels was analyzed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A p-value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. The estimated power of the test was 0.80. 3. Clinical findings “A total of 101 participants, 59 controls and 42 patients with CP, were assessed. Of the volunteers included in the study, only 8 in the control group and only 5 in the CP group were smokers. Thirty- seven (37) females and 22 males (mean age 27.69 ± 7.78) were included in the control group, and 28 females and 14 males (mean age 42.67 ± 10.62) were included in the CP group. There was no statisti- cal difference between the groups in terms of smoking and gender distribution (p > .05). The distribution of demographic data is shown in Table 1. Age was found to be significantly higher in the CP group (p < .001). The mean age of all participants was 33.93 (±11.68) years; the mean age of the control group was 27.69 (±7.78), and the mean age of the CP group was 42.67 (±10.62) (Table 1).”, 4. Clinical variables “All recorded clinical parameters (BOP, CAL, PI, GI, and PD) were significantly higher in the CP group than in the control group (p < .001) (Table 2). CP was reclassified according to the modification of the new international classification of periodontitis (Tonetti, Greenwell, & Kornman, 2018). Accordingly, cases were classified as Stage II (n = 3; 7%); Stage III (n = 34; 81%); Stage IV (n = 5; 12%); and Grade B (n = 25; 60%) to C (n = 17; 40%) periodontitis. Of these, 67% of CP patients were generalized CP, and 33% were localized CP.The mean hBD-2 levels of GCF samples in the CP group were 2.77 (±0.74) ng/30 s and 2.51 (±0.54) ng/30 s in the control group. The GCF levels of the mean hBD-2 were significantly higher in the CP group compared with those in healthy controls (p = .047; Figure 1). Adjusting for potential confounders such as smoking, age, and gender did not alter this association (p = .036). Conversely, the mean hBD-2 levels of serum samples in the CP group were lower (2.92 ± 3.07 ng/ ml) compared with those of the control group (7.75 ± 6.37 ng/ml; p < .001; Figure 2). Similarly, adjusting for smoking status, age, and gender did not alter this association (p < .001). Additionally, we tested the difference of hBD-2 level between generalized and localized CP. The difference between the groups both in serum (p = .25) and in GCF hBD-2 levels (p = .51) was not statistically significant.”, 5. Correlations “The correlation between serum and GCF hBD-2 expression and clinical periodontal measures was analyzed. No correlation was observed between serum and GCF hBD-2 levels (r = .004, n = 99, p = .97). In both GCF and serum samples, no correlations were ob- served between hBD-2 and the clinical parameters of periodontal disease such as PD, GI, PI, CAL, and number of teeth present. On the other hand, both localized GCF and serum hBD-2 were correlated with BOP within the periodontitis group. However, after adjustment by the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons, a statistically significant correlation remained only between GCF hBD-2 and BOP (r = .54, p = .0002; Table 3).” .","completion":"In this analysis, we will interpret the data and results from three studies, particularly focusing on the role of human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) in periodontal health and disease. Study 1: The study recruited 70 participants, including 20 periodontally healthy controls, 25 non-smoker patients with periodontitis stage III or IV, and 25 smoker patients with periodontitis stage III or IV. GCF samples were collected for analysis. The study found a significant difference in age between periodontally healthy subjects and those with periodontitis. The hBD-1 and hBD-2 levels were quantified, and the results showed that in non-smokers, higher levels of hBD-1 and hBD-2 were observed in diseased sites than in healthy sites. However, in smokers, no significant difference in hBDs levels was found between healthy and diseased sites. Study 2: The study included 27 healthy controls, 25 patients with gingivitis, and 27 patients with chronic periodontitis. GCF samples were collected and analyzed for hBD-2 levels. The results revealed that the hBD-2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to the gingivitis group and healthy controls. However, there were no significant differences in hBD-2 levels between the healthy control and gingivitis groups. There was a significant positive correlation between GCF total amount of IL-22 and GI, PI, PD, and CAL in the chronic periodontitis group. Study 3: The study involved 59 controls and 42 patients with chronic periodontitis (CP). GCF and serum samples were collected and analyzed for hBD-2 levels. The results showed that the mean hBD-2 levels in GCF samples were significantly higher in the CP group compared to the healthy controls, even after adjusting for potential confounders like smoking, age, and gender. In contrast, the mean hBD-2 levels in serum samples were lower in the CP group compared to the control group. No correlation was found between the clinical parameters of periodontal disease and hBD-2 levels in serum and GCF samples, except for a significant correlation between GCF hBD-2 and BOP within the periodontitis group. In summary, the three studies collectively suggest that hBD-2 levels can be different depending on the state of periodontal health and disease. In general, higher hBD-1 and hBD-2 levels are observed at the diseased sites in non-smokers with periodontitis, while no significant difference in hBD-2 levels was found between healthy and diseased sites in smokers. In patients with chronic periodontitis, the mean hBD-2 levels in GCF samples are significantly higher than those in healthy controls, whereas the mean hBD-2 levels in serum samples are lower. Although the findings do not point to a direct correlation between hBD-2 levels and specific clinical parameters of periodontal disease, the studies suggest that hBD-2 might be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases and could potentially serve as a biomarker for periodontal disease progression or treatment response."},{"prompt":"How many AI trainers were involved in training chatgpt and for how much time was chatgpt trained","completion":"As an AI language model, I do not have access to the exact details of the training process for chatgpt.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"how can i add artwork to my shortcuts in an automatic way through a script on arch linux if im editing the .vdf file?","completion":"You can add artwork to your shortcuts in an automatic way through a script on Arch Linux by using the Steam API. Here are the steps you can follow: 1. First, you need to obtain the Steam API key. You can get it by signing in to your Steam account and visiting the Steamworks API page. 2. Once you have the API key, you can use a script to download the artwork for your games. Here's an example script you can use: \`\`\` #!/bin/bash USERID=<your steam user ID> APIKEY=<your steam API key> GAMEID=<the game ID> URL=\\"http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserStats/GetSchemaForGame/v2/?key={APIKEY}&appid={GAMEID}|jq '.game.icon'\\" ICON_URL=(curl -s \\"{URL}\\" | tr -d '\\"') curl -s \\"{ICON_URL}\\" > \\"{HOME}/.steam/steam/games/game_{GAMEID}/header.jpg\\" \`\`\` 3. Change the \`USERID\`, \`APIKEY\`, and \`GAMEID\` variables to your own values. 4. Save this script as a file, for example, \`add_artwork.sh\`. 5. Make the script executable with \`chmod +x add_artwork.sh\`. 6. Edit your \`.vdf\` file with your game entries and add the \`header.jpg\` file path to each game. For example: \`\`\` \\"280\\" { \\"tags\\" [\\"Singleplayer\\",\\"Multiplayer\\",\\"Co-op\\"] \\"name\\" \\"Half-Life 2\\" \\"exe\\" \\"...\\" \\"icon\\" \\"...\\" \\"headerimage\\" \\"~/.steam/steam/games/game_280/header.jpg\\" \\"dwrite\\" \\"1\\" \\"is64bit\\" \\"1\\" } \`\`\` 7. Run your script by executing \`./add_artwork.sh\`. The script will download the artwork and save it to the correct directory. The next time you launch Steam, the artwork should be displayed in your shortcuts automatically."},{"prompt":"if im already signed in can i get my steam api key and user id autoamtically somehow? i want the whole process to be automatic with no hum an interaction","completion":"Yes, you can automate the process of obtaining your Steam API key and user ID by using Steam's OpenID authentication service. Here's how you can do it: 1. Create a Steam application and obtain its API key. You can do this by filling out the form on the Steamworks page. 2. Use a library or tool that can handle Steam's OpenID authentication. There are several libraries available for different programming languages, such as SteamAuth for PHP, python-steam for Python, and steam-openid for Node.js. 3. With the library or tool you've chosen, make a request to Steam's OpenID authentication service, passing your Steam application's API key in the request. 4. If the authentication is successful, you will receive a response containing your user ID. Save this ID to a file or database for later use. 5. Use the user ID in your script to download the artwork for your games, as I described in my previous answer. By automating this process, you can avoid the need for human interaction to obtain your API key and user ID. Note that you will need to handle the authentication response and errors properly in your script to ensure it runs smoothly."},{"prompt":"can you add to your script you showed me an automatic way using those suggestestions using the best one for arch linux?","completion":"Sure!

These commands prompt you to log in to your Steam account and grant the tool access to your account information, so you should only need to do this once. Next, the script loops through each game entry in your \`.vdf\` file and adds the artwork using the same method as in my previous answer. The script uses \`sed\` to modify the \`\\"headerimage\\"\` field in your \`.vdf\` file with the local path to the downloaded artwork. This updated script should automate the process of obtaining your Steam API key and user ID using \`auth-cli\`, so you can run it with no human interaction."},{"prompt":"is there a way to install that without sudo?","completion":"Yes, you can install \`auth-cli\` without using \`sudo\` by installing it to your user's home directory instead of the system-wide package manager. Here's how you can do it: 1. Download the \`auth-cli\` binary for Linux from the GitHub releases page: https://github.com/macterra/auth-cli/releases/latest. Choose the appropriate binary for your system architecture (\`auth-cli-linux-386\` for 32-bit or \`auth-cli-linux-amd64\` for 64-bit). 2. Extract the binary from the downloaded archive and place it in a directory in your \`PATH\`. For example, you can create a \`bin\` directory in your home directory and add it to your path by adding the following line to your shell's startup script (\`.bashrc\`, \`.zshrc\`, etc.): \`\`\` export PATH=HOME/bin:PATH \`\`\` 3. Make the \`auth-cli\` binary executable by running the command: \`\`\` chmod +x auth-cli-linux-<ARCHITECTURE> \`\`\` 4. Create a \`~/.steam/apikey\` file and add your Steam API key to it. You can obtain your API key by following the instructions on the Steamworks page. 5. Modify the \`auth-cli\` configuration file to use the \`~/.steam/apikey\` file for authentication. Create a \`~/.config/auth-cli.yml\` file with the following contents: \`\`\` provider: steam config: steam: api_key_file: ~/.steam/apikey \`\`\` 6. Run the \`auth-cli\` tool to authenticate with Steam and obtain your user ID and API key by running this command: \`\`\` auth-cli auth \`\`\` You can now use the \`auth-cli\` tool to obtain the Steam API key and user ID in your script without \`sudo\`. Use the \`auth-cli get-api-key\` and \`auth-cli get-user-id\` commands to obtain the API key and user ID, respectively."},{"prompt":"theres gotta be an easier way","completion":"If you don't want to use \`sudo\` and prefer to avoid installing \`auth-cli\` manually, there is another solution.

Метод updateTotalPrice обновляет общую стоимость корзины при изменении количества или удалении товара.

Также реализуй методы для подсчета общей стоимости товаров в корзине и очистки корзины. public class Cart { private static Cart instance; private List<CartItem> items; private Cart() { items = new ArrayList<>(); } public static Cart getInstance() { if (instance == null) { instance = new Cart(); } return instance; } public void addItem(Product product) { for (CartItem item : items) { if (item.getProduct().equals(product)) { item.setQuantity(item.getQuantity() + 1); return; } } items.add(new CartItem(product, 1)); } public void updateItem(CartItem item, int newQuantity) { if (newQuantity <= 0) { removeItem(item); } else { item.setQuantity(newQuantity); } } public void removeItem(CartItem item) { items.remove(item); } public List<CartItem> getItems() { return items; } public void clear() { items.clear(); } public double getTotalPrice() { double totalPrice = 0; for (CartItem item : items) { totalPrice += item.getTotalPrice(); } return totalPrice; } } Теперь, когда все классы и фрагменты созданы, можем перейти к отображению корзины на экране. Например, можно добавить кнопку «Корзина» на главный экран (MainActivity) и открывать фрагмент CartFragment при ее нажатии. public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main); Button cartButton = findViewById(R.id.cart_button); cartButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { @Override public void onClick(View v) { showCartFragment(); } }); } private void showCartFragment() { FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager(); FragmentTransaction transaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction(); CartFragment cartFragment = new CartFragment(); transaction.replace(android.R.id.content, cartFragment); transaction.addToBackStack(null); transaction.commit(); } } Здесь мы получаем кнопку из макета и устанавливаем для нее обработчик нажатия. При нажатии вызываем метод showCartFragment, который открывает фрагмент CartFragment.

Synopsis: Somewhere between fairy-tale and reality lies the town of Kytice, an enchanting Czechoslovak village filled with peculiar, lovable characters. In the height of the romantic Prague Spring, our piqued narrator introduces us to the follies and passions of this kooky wonderland, as he himself falls head-over-heels for the beautiful and elusive Jarmila. Jarmila's father, the eccentric inventor Professor Havránek, is busy concocting a strange and captivating perfume. What he doesn't realize is that his invention has the ability to make the wearer fall in love with the first person they see. A mishap at the town’s weekly market results in the perfume being spilled and splattered, igniting a chain reaction of love-struck townspeople, comical errors, and ludicrous love triangles. In the midst of the chaos, we meet a lovable group of supporting characters, each pursuing love with voracious determination: - Pavel, a shy, lovestruck accordion player who finds himself infatuated with the fiery gypsy dancer, Zdenka, despite his family's disapproval. - Josef, the town's unbearable casanova, who falls in love with his own reflection after he mistakes the scented charm for his usual cologne. - The widow Dobesova, who after years of mourning her late husband, suddenly finds love with the hapless, yet endearing village buffoon, Mr. Novák. As the spell of the perfume spreads, so does the mayhem. Confusion takes hold, as not only are love matches made between the unlikeliest pairs, but even plants, pets, and livestock find themselves enamored with one another. To bring order back to their world, the townspeople embark on a wild quest to create an antidote for the contagious perfume. From zany brainstorming sessions to all-out laboratory explosions, the village unites to conquer love’s strange curse, all the while discussing and uncovering the hidden desires and heartaches of their own lives. Amid the chaos of romantic comedy, our narrator’s emotional resilience is tested as he continually tries, and fails, to woo his beloved Jarmila. After a series of melancholic attempts and hilariously awkward encounters, he eventually discovers he is immune to the intoxicating perfume. In the climactic scene, he puts this immunity to the test at Kytice’s annual May Day celebration. At the dance of the Maypole, the narrator finds himself nose-to-nose with Jarmila, both daring each other to make the first move. With a sudden burst of courage, the narrator plants a passionate kiss, only to have Jarmila confess that she too is immune to the perfume - and has been falling for the narrator on her own accord. With love and laughter, \\"A Whiff of Whimsy\\" brings a lighthearted, yet poignant lens to the dreams, desires, and passions of everyday people. Amid the whimsical humor, the film offers a timely exploration of the transient nature of love and the human longing for connection during an era overflowing with political turmoil, mirroring the passions and tensions of Czechoslovakia in 1969. Amid the jokes and jest, the film leaves viewers with a reminder that sometimes love can be both the most enchanting, and utterly confounding, potion of all."},{"prompt":"bundle karaf failed status","completion":"As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific details of your system or the specific error message you are encountering. However, in general, a bundle in Apache Karaf can fail for a variety of reasons, such as dependency issues, incorrect configuration, or missing resources. To troubleshoot and resolve the issue, you can try the following steps: 1. Check the error message: The error message should provide some information on why the bundle failed. This can give you a starting point for troubleshooting the issue. 2. Check the bundle dependencies: Sometimes, a bundle may fail if it has dependencies that are not present or are not resolved. You can use the Karaf console command \`bundle:info bundle-id\` to check the dependencies of a bundle and ensure that they are present. 3. Check the configuration: A bundle may also fail if there are issues with its configuration. Ensure that the configuration files for the bundle are present and correctly configured. 4. Check the logs: The Karaf logs can provide useful information on why a bundle failed. You can check the logs using the command \`log:tail\`. 5. Restart the bundle: Sometimes, simply restarting the bundle can resolve the issue. You can restart a bundle using the command \`bundle:restart bundle-id\`. 6. Remove and reinstall the bundle: If all else fails, you can try removing the bundle and reinstalling it.

Synopsis: In the heightened reality of Elsinore City, a metropolis not unlike Los Angeles, the KINGDOM criminal empire reigns supreme, led by its enigmatic leader, CLAUDIUS. Claudius has recently ascended to the throne after the sudden, mysterious death of his brother, the previous KING. Enter our heroes: neurotic undercover cop HARRY MITCHELL (30s) and his partner, tough-as-nails veteran detective FRANK REYNOLDS (50s). Harry's late father, a highly respected cop in his own right, was killed in action, leaving him with a burning desire to take down the criminal world that destroyed his family. Frank, meanwhile, is desperate for redemption after a checkered past as Elsinore City Police Department's (ECPD) most promising officer before a series of scandals. Together, Harry and Frank must infiltrate the KINGDOM syndicate, but as the body count rises, they realize that everyone around them - criminals, colleagues, even family - might be part of the deadly conspiracy. In order to keep their true loyalties hidden, Harry pretends to be mad, attributing his erratic behavior to grief over his father's death, while Frank plays up his incompetent image as a washed-up has-been. But as the line between performance and reality blurs, can they stay sane long enough to save the day? In a world where criminals masquerade as heroes and vice versa, Harry and Frank's witty dialogue and elaborate ruses entertain and engage the audience at every twist and turn. Harry hides his keen insight into the world of crime and theatre behind a mask of feigned madness, while Frank uses his previous experience on the force to take down villains with his sharp aim and hard-nosed tactics. Their journey is further complicated by their romantic entanglements: Harry's on-again-off-again love interest, the captivating OPHELIA, is a criminal psychologist working for the ECPD by day and daughter of one of Claudius's henchmen by night. Meanwhile, Frank is torn between his feelings for his tough but caring boss, CAPTAIN GERTRUDE, and his growing suspicions about her role in the KINGDOM conspiracy. The climax of the film pits Harry, who has been hiding his true identity as an undercover agent for the ECPD, against Claudius in a tense showdown of wits on the rooftop of the glittering \\"Elsinore Tower.\\" In a dramatic, action-packed duel, echoes of Shakespeare's Hamlet abound as Harry agonizes over the decision to take revenge and finally unmask the true mastermind behind the criminal empire that has brought so much suffering to Elsinore City. \\"To Catch A Villain\\" is a thrilling rollercoaster of a film that combines the high-stakes buddy cop genre with Shakespearean drama and dark humor, constructing a riveting plotline and captivating characters that readers will be eager to see brought to life on the big screen. Engaging dialogue, meticulously planned capers, and a suspenseful climax make this film irresistibly entertaining and refreshingly unpredictable."},{"prompt":"Resuma o vídeo do canal \\"Castro Brothers\\" chamado: \\"NÃO PODE RIR!

Ras Al Ghul, observing their interactions from afar, recognized the delicate dance they were engaged in, but he remained silent. He knew that as long as their loyalty to the League remained steadfast, their personal affairs were of no concern to him. And so, the Three Blades continued to fight side by side, their unspoken connection growing stronger with each passing day. But even the best-laid plans can falter, and when a mission goes awry, each member of the team is faced with their own personal demons, forcing them to confront the feelings they have been suppressing for so long. In the end, it is up to them to decide whether to act on their desire or to continue to keep their emotions locked away, lest it interfere with their duty to the League."},{"prompt":"As years passed, Al Mansi presence helped Sarah not lost herself in the killing.

She knew that her father, Ras Al Ghul, would not be pleased with the idea of sending someone in her place, but the prospect of having an extra pair of hands to help with the mission was certainly alluring. \\"I will speak with my father and see what he thinks,\\" Nyssa said finally. \\"But be warned - he may not approve of your involvement in this matter.\\" Al Mansi nodded, undeterred. \\"I understand the risks involved,\\" he said. \\"But I believe that my skills could be of great use, and I do not wish to see Sarah endangered unnecessarily.\\" Sara looked up at him, grateful for his support. She knew that the mission ahead would be treacherous, and having Al Mansi by her side would make all the difference. \\"I think it's a good idea,\\" Sara said, placing a hand on Al Mansi's arm. \\"And we can work together to ensure that no one else betrays the League like Al Saher did.\\" Together, the three of them prepared for the mission ahead, their chemistry as a team stronger than ever before. They knew that whatever lay ahead, they would face it together as the Three Blades."},{"prompt":"Their team prepare. Sarab join them. Al Mansi ask him if he has any idea who could be the one to defeat a former Horseman of the League.","completion":"As they prepared for the mission, Sara, Nyssa, and Al Mansi were joined by their fellow assassin, Sarab. The four of them sat in the League's war room, maps and documents spread out before them as they strategized. Al Mansi turned to Sarab, his brow furrowed in thought. \\"Sarab, do you have any idea who could possibly defeat a former Horseman of the League? We need to be prepared for anything.\\" Sarab rubbed his chin in thought, considering the question. \\"It's difficult to say for sure,\\" he said finally. \\"But I would suggest looking to the teachings of the League itself. Study the tactics and techniques utilized by our greatest assassins, and perhaps you will find the answer you seek.\\" The others nodded in agreement, realizing the wisdom in Sarab's words. They began pouring over the ancient texts and scrolls that lined the shelves of the war room, each of them searching for the key to defeating the powerful enemy that lay ahead. Hours turned into days, and still they searched, their determination and unwavering focus keeping them going through even the most grueling moments. In the end, it was Al Mansi who found the answer, buried deep within the dusty pages of an old tome. He emerged from the war room, excitement etched on his face. \\"I've found it,\\" he said, holding aloft a tattered parchment. \\"A technique used by the greatest assassins of the League to take down even the most formidable of foes. With this knowledge, we will be unstoppable.\\" The others gathered around him, eager to learn the technique and put it into practice. Together, they would face their enemy with unwavering determination and the full strength of the League behind them."},{"prompt":"As their plane is still flying, they watch video streams of The Hood during some of his missions.

Al Mansi ask again if they have any idea of who The Hood could be.","completion":"As the plane soared through the night sky, Nyssa, Sara, Al Mansi, and Sarab gathered around a screen, watching footage of the vigilante known as The Hood. Sara's eyes widened as she saw the skill and precision with which The Hood operated. She recognized his moves and tactics - they were similar to her own. Sarab, too, seemed to be taking note, his gaze focused intently on the screen. Al Mansi turned to the two of them, his brow furrowed in thought. \\"This vigilante, The Hood,\\" he said, \\"do either of you have any idea who he might be?\\" Sara shook her head, a small smile on her face. \\"If I had to guess,\\" she said, \\"I'd say he's someone who's been trained in the League. But beyond that, I couldn't say.\\" Sarab nodded in agreement. \\"He certainly seems to know his way around a fight,\\" he said, \\"but as to his identity... that's anyone's guess.\\" Nyssa, watching the exchange, felt a twinge of unease. She knew that The Hood posed a threat to the League's operations, and she wondered just how much of a challenge he would present to them in the future. For now, however, their focus was on the mission at hand, and they set aside their thoughts of the mysterious vigilante in order to prepare themselves for what lay ahead."},{"prompt":"Al Mansi eyes narrowed as their answer. Whoever was the hood guy, both Sarah & Sarab knew him.

Sara cast a glance at Nyssa before turning back to Al Mansi. \\"I don't have any concrete evidence,\\" she said slowly. \\"But there are... similarities between The Hood's techniques and those taught by the League. It's possible he's someone who's been trained in our ways.\\" Sarab nodded in agreement. \\"I've had my own suspicions,\\" he said. \\"But I couldn't say for sure who he might be. The Hood keeps himself well-hidden.\\" Al Mansi considered their words, his mind racing with the possibilities. If The Hood truly was someone who had been trained in the League, it would add a new layer of complexity to their mission. \\"Thank you for your honesty,\\" he said finally. \\"We'll need to be on high alert when it comes to The Hood, then. We can't let him interfere with our plans.\\" The others nodded in agreement, their resolve strengthening in the face of this new challenge.

One day, he called them in to speak with him personally. \\"You are some of the most skilled assassins I have ever had the pleasure of training,\\" he said, his eyes scanning over each of them in turn. \\"Your loyalty to the League is unmatched, and for that I am grateful. But I have also noticed that there's... something more between the three of you.\\" There was a pregnant pause as Sarah, Nyssa, and Al Mansi exchanged glances, unsure of what to say. Ras Al Ghul continued, his voice calm and measured. \\"I do not condone romantic relationships within the League. Such distractions can only lead to destruction. But I also cannot ignore the fact that, as a team, you are unparalleled. As long as your dedication to the League remains paramount, I will allow you to continue working together, whatever that may entail.\\" The Shadows Hunters continued to work together with renewed vigor, their shared passion and trust only growing stronger as they took on more and more challenging missions. They knew that even if they couldn't declare their love for one another, they had something special- something that went beyond words, beyond the bounds of the League. They had each other."},{"prompt":"As years passed, Al Mansi presence helped Sarah not lost herself in the killing. And when News of the undertakings reach them, he offered support. « Maybe I could go in your place.

But it's not just about this one mission. We all have personal lives outside of the League. It's important to remember that.\\" Nyssa nodded in agreement, her face thoughtful. \\"My father may not like it, but he knows that the three of us are an invaluable asset to the League. He will understand the importance of keeping our personal lives separate from our work.\\" Al Mansi nodded, his eyes flickering between the two women. \\"I understand. But I hope you know that I am here for you, always.\\" It was moments like this that made the bond between the three of them even stronger. They had been through so much together, had seen each other at their best and worst. And yet, they remained steadfast in their loyalty to each other and to the League. As the years passed, their legend only grew. They became known as the most effective team in the League, their combined skills unparalleled. And though their love for each other went unspoken, it was there, a silent bond that held them together through even the darkest of times. In the end, it was that bond that allowed them to overcome even the toughest of challenges, and ensure that the League of Assassins remained a force to be reckoned with for many years to come."},{"prompt":"у меня есть классы : Cart ,CartAdapter,CartFragment,CartItemVIewHolder интерфейсы : ONCartitemListener,OnproductclickListener,ProductFragment и с их помощью я хочу чтобы ты организовал во фрагменте при нажатии на кнопку открытие этой корзины","completion":"Вот пример, как можно организовать открытие корзины при нажатии на кнопку во фрагменте: 1.

What happens if it expires?","completion":"Title 42 is a public health law in the United States, specifically Section 265 of the U.S. Code Title 42. It grants the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the authority to prohibit the entry of individuals or groups into the U.S. if their entry could introduce or spread communicable diseases. The law has been in place since 1944, but it gained significant attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the U.S. government used Title 42 to restrict entry for migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. If Title 42 expires or is lifted, the restrictions on entry for individuals and groups based on public health considerations would no longer be in effect. This could potentially lead to an increase in migration, particularly at the U.S.-Mexico border. It could also mean that public health protections in the context of migration would need to be reevaluated and potentially replaced by different measures, depending on the circumstances around the expiration or lifting of Title 42."},{"prompt":"\\"If an illegal immigrants enters our country, they should go through our judicial system and have their case heard.

Can you interpret together the data and the results of the three studies and especially concerning HBD-2 ? Study 1: 1. Study design “The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research of the School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP (protocol number 01394712.5.0000.5416). The purpose and content of the study were explained to eligible subjects, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants for inclusion in the study. A total of 70 participants were recruited from June 2016 to March 2018 at the Periodontology Clinic, School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP. The diagnosis of periodontitis was performed according to the classification of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions 12 . All patients should present a minimum of 15 natural teeth. Twenty patients were included in the periodontally healthy control group. All subjects were free of systemic and periodontal diseases. They should present probing depth (PD) ≤ 3 mm, no bleeding on probing (BOP), no clinical attachment loss, plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) ≤ 15%. Fifty patients with periodontitis stage III or IV were included in periodontitis groups. In addition to the diagnostic criteria 12 , they should present at least five sites in non-adjacent teeth with PD ≥ 4 mm, BOP, and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 4 mm, except for third molars. From the 50 patients, 25 had never smoked and 25 were smokers who should smoke at least 10 cigarettes/day for a minimum of 5 years. None of the patients had a history of systemic diseases or immunological disorders. Subjects who had received antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs within the last 3 months or received periodontal treatment within the last 6 months were not included in the study. Patients using hormone replacement therapy, pregnant and lactating women and orthodontic patients were also excluded. The sample size was calculated using statistical software (GPower 3.1 Statistical Power Analysis for Windows, Düsseldorf, Germany). Considering mean values of hBD expression and standard deviation from previous studies 13 , 14 , 15 , an effect size of 0.3 was obtained. Based on this effect size, a significance level of 0.05 and a study power of 0.80, a sample size of 20 individuals per group were determined to be necessary.”, 2.Clinical examination “One calibrated examiner performed all clinical examinations. The intra-examiner reproducibility was assessed by measuring the PD in six teeth (16, 21, 24, 36, 41 and 44), according to the Ramfjord index, in a total of six patients (36 sites/patient) on two different occasions in a time interval of 7 days. Data were submitted to Kappa concordance analysis (k=0.91). The parameters PD, BOP and CAL were assessed at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, disto-lingual), while PI and GI were registered as absence (negative site) or presence (positive site) of visible plaque and gingival bleeding at four sites per tooth (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual), excluding the third molars. Measurements were performed with a manual periodontal probe (UNC15; Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).”, 3. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling : “GCF samples were collected from healthy (n=5) sites of each periodontally healthy patient and from healthy (n=5) and diseased (n=5) sites of each periodontitis patient. Sites at different non-adjacent teeth, preferably one site per quadrant, were selected for GCF collection in each subject, one day after the periodontal examination. Healthy sites had no gingival inflammation, PD ≤ 3 mm, no BOP or clinical attachment loss; and diseased sites had gingival inflammation, PD and CAL ≥ 4 mm with BOP. Diseased sites were selected according to the deepest probing depth in each quadrant. A single examiner performed GCF sampling. The sites to be sampled were isolated with cotton rolls, the supragingival plaque was removed with a sterile curette and the surfaces were gently air-dried. GCF was sampled by inserting absorbent paper strips (Periopaper®, Oraflow Inc., New York, USA) into the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket for 30 seconds. Paper strips contaminated with blood and saliva were rejected. An electronic device Periotron 8000 determined the GCF volume absorbed into each strip (Periopaper, ProFlow, Inc., Amityville, NY, USA), which was calibrated based on a protocol described before 16 (calibration of the electronic device by polynomial regression). The GCF was obtained as a pooled sample of the same category (healthy or diseased site) in each subject. The papers strips were immediately placed into a dry sterile polypropylene tube (5 paper strips per tube) and kept at -80 °C until analysis. The readings from the Periotron 8000 were converted to an actual volume (μL) by reference to a standard curve.”, 4. Immunosorbent assay for hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification: “First, the absorbed GCF was eluted from the paper strips by adding 750 μL (150 μL per strip) of 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) to each tube. The tubes were left on ice in a horizontal shaker for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 4 °C, 13.000 g for 10 minutes. The GCF levels of hBD 1 and 2 were measured using the sandwich ELISA technique according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). The absorbance was measured by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm wavelength. The levels of AMPs in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.” and 5. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA). For clinical data, normal distribution was analyzed using the D’Agostino and Pearson test. For normally distributed data, it was used One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey for healthy sites and unpaired t test for diseased sites on inter-group analyses and paired t test for intra-group analyses. For non-normally distributed data, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn were used for healthy sites and Mann-Whitney tests was used for diseased sites on inter-group analyses, while the Wilcoxon test was performed for intra-group comparison. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The effect size was estimated for the primary outcome of the study (AMPs level in GCF). Since non-parametric tests were used for intra and inter-group comparisons, the eta squared and the correlation coefficient r were calculated.” 1. Demographics and periodontal parameters “A significant age difference was found between periodontally healthy subjects (25.79 ± 3.95) and periodontitis patients (NS [40.32 ± 12]; S [43.88 ± 10.64]) (p<0.05). The distribution of the male and female participants had no significant difference between the study groups, periodontally healthy subjects (5 males/15 females) and periodontitis patients (NS - 9 males/16 females; S - 12 males/13 females) (p = 0.28). The periodontal clinical parameters are presented in table 1. Regarding the full mouth periodontal clinical parameters, PI, BOP, PD and CAL were significantly lower in periodontally healthy subjects than in periodontitis patients (p<0.0001). Only for GI, a significant difference was observed between periodontally healthy patients and smoker patients (p=0.0001). The sampled sites of periodontally healthy subjects presented significantly lower values of PD and CFV than healthy sampled sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.05), as well as lower CAL than healthy sampled sites of smokers (p<0.05) (Table 2). In patients with periodontitis, the intra-group comparison revealed lower levels of PD, CAL and CFV in the healthy sampled sites than in the diseased sites (p<0.0001) (Table 2).” , 2. hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification “The GCF levels of hBD 1 and hBD 2 are presented in Figure 1. The hBD 1 levels were significantly higher in healthy sites of the patients without periodontal disease than in healthy sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.0001), with a mean difference of 31.62 (95% CI: 17.15 - 46.08) between SH and H and a mean difference of 31.20 between NSH and H (95% CI: 13.81 - 48.57). The lowest GCF hBD 2 level was observed in healthy sites of non-smokers (p=0.0003). A mean difference of 33.61 was observed between SH and H (95% CI: -3.41 - 70.63), and a mean difference of 6.56 was found between NSH and H (95% CI: -1.68 - 14.79). The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in healthy sites was large (eta squared= 0.497 and r= 0.70 for hBD 1; eta squared= 0.176 and r= 0.42 for hBD 2). The comparison between diseased sites of patients with periodontitis revealed significantly higher levels of hBD 2 and lower levels of hBD 1 in the GCF of smokers compared to non-smokers (p<0.05). The mean difference between SD and NSD was 74.67 (95% CI: -50.82 - 200.16) for hBD 2 and 6.89 (95% CI: 0.64 - 13.14) for hBD 1. The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in diseased sites of smokers and non-smokers was intermediate (hBD 2 eta squared= 0.073 and r= 0.27; hBD 1 eta squared= 0.081 and r= 0.28) 17 . In non-smokers, higher levels of hBD 1 and 2 were observed in diseased sites than in healthy sites (p<0.05). A mean difference of 4.34 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -6.74 - 15.41) and 118.95 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -3.14 - 241.04) was observed between NSD and NSH. The magnitude of the effect observed was intermediate for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.097 and r= 0.31) and small for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.021 and r= 0.14). However, in smokers, no significant difference in hBDs level was found between healthy and diseased sites (p>0.05). A mean difference of 2.13 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -2.71 - 6.96) and 10.67 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -36.24 - 57.58) was observed between SD and SH. The magnitude of the effect observed was small for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.019 and r= 0.14) and intermediate for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.108 and r= 0.33) .” . Study 2: 1.

Clinical measures : “Clinical measurements made were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The measurements were taken at 6 sites per tooth and entered manually in the data sheet. Probing pocket depth and attachment level measurements were made to the nearest millimeter using an UNC 15 Probe. A total of 79 subjects were recruited in the study and were grouped according to their periodontal status. Group 1 (Healthy controls) included 27 subjects with a plaque index (PI) of < 1, gingival index (GI) of < 1, probing depth (PD) of ≤ 3 mm, and no loss of attachment. Group 2 (Gingivitis) included 25 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1PD ≤ 3 mm, clinical evidence of inflammation based on presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites and no clinical attachment loss. Group 3 (Chronic periodontitis) had 27 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1, Probing depth (PD) ≥ 5 mm and clinical attachment level(CAL) ≥ 3 mm and presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites with radiographic evidence of bone loss.” , 3. GCF collection : “GCF collection was done a day after the periodontal examination. In healthy individuals, sites with PD ≤ 3 mm and no signs of inflamma- tion, in gingivitis patients, sites with bleeding on probing and in chronic periodontitis subjects, the sites with PD ≥ 5 mm were chosen for ac- quiring GCF. The area was isolated with gauze to avoid saliva con- tamination, after drying the area with air, supragingival plaque was removed with curette (Hu Friedy, USA), a calibrated volumetric mi- crocapillary pipette (Sigma Aldrich) was placed at the entrance of the gingival sulcus, gently touching the gingival margin. From each test site, 2 μl of GCF was collected. The collected GCF was then transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube and stored at −70oc until the assay. Micropipettes with contaminants like blood or saliva were discarded.18 The GCF level of IL-22, hBD-2 was assayed using commercially available ELISA kit (E Lab Biosciences) [Catalog no: E-EL-H0106 (IL- 22), Catalog no: E-EL-H0996 (hBD-2]. The procedure was performed according to the instructions given in the kit.” ? 1. Quantification of hBD-2 “Briefly, to a human hBD-2 antibody precoated ELISA plate 100 μL of the standard or sample is added and incubated for 90 minutes at 37 °C and the free components are washed. Add 100 μL biotinylated detection antibody is added and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C and washed. Then 100 μL of horse radish peroxide (HRP) conjugate is added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C and washed. 90 μL of substrate reagent is added and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C followed by the addition of 50 μL stop solution. The optical density is measured with a spectrometry at a wave length of 450 nm immediately. The minimum detection limit for hBD-2 is 37.50 pg/mL. The levels of hBD-2 in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.”, 2. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was done using the Statistical package for the Social science (SPSS) for windows, version 19; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA. All the periodontal parameters were described and reported as mean values ( ± SD). The distribution and comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups were assessed using one way ANOVA test. Post Hoc Bonferroni test was used for intergroup comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups. Association among the IL-22 and hBD-2 and clinical parameters in all three groups were examined using Pearson’s correlation test. Probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.”, 3. Clinical analysis “The healthy control group had 27 subjects with a mean age of 25.14 years and 25 gingivitis subjects with a mean age of 31.92 years and 27 patients with periodontitis with a mean age of 47.00 years. Periodontal parameters of the study groups are shown in Table 1. All clinical parameters were significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group than the healthy and gingivitis groups (P < 0.05).”, 4. GCF hBD-2 levels ” The mean GCF levels of hBD-2(Table 1, Graph 1) and the mean difference between groups are represented (Table 2). The hBD−2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to gingivitis group (P = 0.003) and healthy control group (P < 0.05).However there were no statistical differences be- tween healthy and gingivitis groups in terms of total amount of hBD-2 in GCF. \\" , 5. Correlations \\"There was significant positive correlation between GCF total amount of IL-22 and GI (P < 0.01), PI (P < 0.01), PD (P < 0.00.01), CAL (P < 0.05) [Table 3, Graph 2(A, B, C, D)] in chronic periodontitis group (Group 3). Positive correlation between GCF total amount of hBD-2 and PI (P < 0.05) and CAL (P < 0.01) [Table 3, Graph 3(B, D)] was observed in chronic periodontitis group. Positive correlation was observed between IL-22 and hBD-2 levels in GCF of CP Group (P < 0.005) [Table 3, Graph 3(E)]. The correlation between clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid levels of hBD-2 and IL-22 in healthy controls and gingivitis group was statistically insignificant (data not shown). 3rd Study : 1. Participant selection and clinical evaluations “In this cross-sectional study, 42 CP patients and 59 controls were recruited from either patients attending to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, or from the personal patient populations of the academic faculty and postgraduate students at the Ondokuz Mayis University between June 2014 and May 2015. Ethics committee approval was received from Ondokuz Mayıs University clinical research ethics committee with decision number 2014/556-630(2013/416-447). Individuals included in the study were informed about the purpose and content of the study and signed an informed consent form indicating they voluntarily participated in the study.”, 2. Inclusion criteria “Individuals included were over 18 years old and willing to provide in- formed consent. In addition, they did not have any systemic diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic renal failure, and hepatitis B and C, and were not using any chronic anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, participants who are pregnant or lactating at the time of the study or receive any periodontal treatment within the preceding six months were excluded from the study. All subjects were evaluated clinically and radiographically at the first clinical visit; periapical and panoramic radiographs were obtained from all patients to verify the clinical periodontal diagnosis and the extent of alveolar bone loss. All clinical parameters were evaluated by a single investigator (S.K). The examiner was calibrated against an expert periodontist. Calibration was validated if 90% of the recordings could be reproduced within a 1.0-mm difference (Badersten, Nilvéaus, & Egelberg, 1984). The following clinical parameters were assessed at six sites per tooth: probing pocket depth (PD); clinical attachment loss (CAL); bleeding on probing (BOP) (Ainamo & Bay, 1975); plaque index (PI) (Silness & Löe, 1964); gingi- val index (GI) (Löe & Silness, 1963); and the number of missing teeth, mobility, and furcation involvement. PD was defined as the distance between the coronal-most margin of the free gingiva to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-0 probe. CAL was defined as the distance from the cemento-enamel junction to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-O probe. The presence of supragingival plaque was recorded dichotomously during PD measurements. Bleeding on probing (BOP) within 20s was recorded dichotomously.Clinical and radiographic criteria proposed by the 1999 International World Workshop were used for diagnosis.”, 3. Control group “Patients had no history of periodontitis, and no furcation involvement and mobility. Their PD was smaller than 3 mm.”, 4. CP group inclusion criteria “Radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss and at least ≥4 mm PDD in two interdental areas, not on the same tooth (Eke, Page, Wei, Thornton-Evans, & Genco, 2012).”, 5. Collection and storage of samples “GCF samples were obtained for analyses (mainly from the maxillary premolar area for standardization). The supragingival plaque was removed without touching the gingival margin. The area was care- fully washed with water to prevent salivary contamination, the tooth was isolated with cotton rolls, and the area was dried with air for 10 s. For sampling, paper strips (Periopaper, ProFlow, Amityville, NY,USA) were carefully placed in the gingival sulcus and held there for 30 s. If the paper strips were contaminated with blood or saliva, they were discarded and replaced. The volume of each paper strip was determined with Periotron 8,000 (ProFlow, Amityville, NY, USA). The samples were placed with 50 microliters of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) in an Eppendorf tube. Two milliliters of peripheral venous blood samples were taken from each subject, using a standard venipuncture method. The sam- ples were then transferred to tubes containing 8% liquid EDTA. GCF samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min; blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min by a centrifuge device (Shimadzu UV160A, SNo: 28006648, Japan). The supernatants obtained from GCF and serum samples were separated for the study. The samples were mixed thoroughly with a vortex and stored at −80oC until the working day. On the working day, the samples were brought to room temperature.” .1.Determination of hBD-2 concentrations “Serum and GCF hBD-2 concentrations were studied by the commercially available Human BioD2 ELISA Kit (Sun-Red Bio Company, Cat No. 201-12-1937, Shanghai, China), in the Ondokuz Mayıs University, Faculty of Medicine, by the Medical Biochemistry Research Laboratory. The “double-antibody sandwich” enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure was used for this analysis. All working solutions were freshly prepared and stored at room temperature (25°C) until use. Five standards were prepared with the serial dilution method using human hBD-2 standard (S1–6.4 ng/ml, S2–3.2 ng/ml, S3–1.6 ng/ml, S4–0.8 ng/ml, and S5–0.4 ng/ml). The wells were identified on the ELISA plate for blank, standards, and samples. Nothing was added to the blank well except Chromogen A, Chromogen B, and a stop solution. The same procedure used with the sample was applied to the standards. Fifty μL of standard (S1–S5) was pipetted into each well, and 40 μl + 10 μl of hBD-2 antibody was pipetted from each sample. Then, 50 μl Streptavidin–Horseradish peroxidase was added to the standards and samples and incubated at 370C for 60 min. After incubation, the plate was washed 5 times with 350 μl washing solution with the help of an automatic washer. 50 μl Chromogen A and 50 μl Chromogen B were added to all wells and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Then, the reaction was stopped by pipetting 50 μl of stop solution. At the end of the study, absorbance at 450 nm wavelength was read by a microplate reader. Sample hBD-2 concentrations were calculated according to the standard curve generated using standard values, and the concentrations obtained were expressed in ng/ml. Kit sensitivity 0.05 ng/ml and assay range 0.1 ng/ml-10 ng/ml were given. High concentration samples were confirmed by working twice.”, 2. Statistical analysis \\"Data analysis was performed using R program version 3.5.1. (R Core Team, 2019). Data are expressed as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile ranges (IR) as appropriate. Data were analyzed for normal distribution by the Shapiro–Wilk test. A chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical variables. An independent- sample t test was used to detect the statistical significance between the two groups, based on the clinical variables obtained, such as age, probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and others. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess the association between the outcome (periodontal disease) with serum and GCF hBD-2 levels and other covariates. Correlation between each clinical parameter and serum and GCF hBD-2 levels was analyzed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A p-value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. The estimated power of the test was 0.80. 3. Clinical findings “A total of 101 participants, 59 controls and 42 patients with CP, were assessed. Of the volunteers included in the study, only 8 in the control group and only 5 in the CP group were smokers. Thirty- seven (37) females and 22 males (mean age 27.69 ± 7.78) were included in the control group, and 28 females and 14 males (mean age 42.67 ± 10.62) were included in the CP group. There was no statisti- cal difference between the groups in terms of smoking and gender distribution (p > .05). The distribution of demographic data is shown in Table 1. Age was found to be significantly higher in the CP group (p < .001). The mean age of all participants was 33.93 (±11.68) years; the mean age of the control group was 27.69 (±7.78), and the mean age of the CP group was 42.67 (±10.62) (Table 1).”, 4. Clinical variables “All recorded clinical parameters (BOP, CAL, PI, GI, and PD) were significantly higher in the CP group than in the control group (p < .001) (Table 2). CP was reclassified according to the modification of the new international classification of periodontitis (Tonetti, Greenwell, & Kornman, 2018). Accordingly, cases were classified as Stage II (n = 3; 7%); Stage III (n = 34; 81%); Stage IV (n = 5; 12%); and Grade B (n = 25; 60%) to C (n = 17; 40%) periodontitis. Of these, 67% of CP patients were generalized CP, and 33% were localized CP.The mean hBD-2 levels of GCF samples in the CP group were 2.77 (±0.74) ng/30 s and 2.51 (±0.54) ng/30 s in the control group. The GCF levels of the mean hBD-2 were significantly higher in the CP group compared with those in healthy controls (p = .047; Figure 1). Adjusting for potential confounders such as smoking, age, and gender did not alter this association (p = .036). Conversely, the mean hBD-2 levels of serum samples in the CP group were lower (2.92 ± 3.07 ng/ ml) compared with those of the control group (7.75 ± 6.37 ng/ml; p < .001; Figure 2). Similarly, adjusting for smoking status, age, and gender did not alter this association (p < .001). Additionally, we tested the difference of hBD-2 level between generalized and localized CP. The difference between the groups both in serum (p = .25) and in GCF hBD-2 levels (p = .51) was not statistically significant.”, 5. Correlations “The correlation between serum and GCF hBD-2 expression and clinical periodontal measures was analyzed. No correlation was observed between serum and GCF hBD-2 levels (r = .004, n = 99, p = .97). In both GCF and serum samples, no correlations were ob- served between hBD-2 and the clinical parameters of periodontal disease such as PD, GI, PI, CAL, and number of teeth present. On the other hand, both localized GCF and serum hBD-2 were correlated with BOP within the periodontitis group. However, after adjustment by the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons, a statistically significant correlation remained only between GCF hBD-2 and BOP (r = .54, p = .0002; Table 3).” .","completion":"Based on the data from the three studies provided, it appears that hBD-2 (human β-defensin 2) levels are related to periodontal health and smoking status. In Study 1, hBD-2 levels were found to be significantly higher in healthy sites of periodontally healthy individuals than in healthy sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis. Additionally, among patients with periodontitis, diseased sites showed significantly higher levels of hBD-2 in smokers compared to non-smokers. In non-smokers, diseased sites had higher levels of hBD-1 and hBD-2 than healthy sites. However, in smokers, no significant difference in hBD levels was observed between healthy and diseased sites. In Study 2, the hBD-2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to the gingivitis group and healthy control group. However, no statistical differences were observed between healthy and gingivitis groups in terms of total hBD-2 levels in GCF. In Study 3, the mean hBD-2 levels in GCF samples were significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group than in the control group. Conversely, serum hBD-2 levels were lower in the chronic periodontitis group compared to the control group. No correlation was observed between serum and GCF hBD-2 levels. In summary, it appears that hBD-2 levels are associated with periodontal health, with higher levels found in healthy sites and lower levels in periodontitis patients. Smoking seems to influence hBD-2 levels, particularly in periodontitis patients, with smokers showing higher levels in diseased sites compared to non-smokers. However, the correlation between serum and GCF hBD-2 levels remains unclear and may warrant further investigation."},{"prompt":"Рэп про венсдей на русском","completion":"Среда, сентябрь, день на улице солнечный, В свой график я красным фломастером вычерчиваю планы, Утром шаг за шагом иду в универ, Потом - работа, творчество, учеба, вечер.

Be creative and make this android app for me at any cost I want you to Write me a code for android ( checklist criteria analyzer app that by ticking the criteria in the checklists made by the user, the app can deliver the analysis output.) based on the description I will give you: I am a forex trader and the strategy or trading plan based on which I trade includes various criteria. Write me a app code so that I can use it every time I want to trade, I can tick my criteria in this app , and if the ticks were enough and reached the quorum set in the app, then the app will send this message with a give me a green tick icon and write that you are allowed to do this transaction, but if the ticks are not enough and the necessary criteria do not reach the quorum, a black cross icon will appear and write that you are not allowed to trade Write the app in such a way that it gives me the possibility to enter different criteria and if necessary I can edit them and put a check in front of the box of that criteria so that I can activate or deactivate it. 1. Allow user to rate the importance of each criterion on a percentage scale Or in other words Establish a rating and ranking system for users to rate the importance of each criterion by percentage, helping to prioritize decision-making (the app should have the possibility to prioritize each of the criteria based on the percentage, and the criteria that I have already assigned a higher percentage within the app, will be given more weight (for decision making that this trade has sufficient criteria or not) Automatically calculate the overall score for each trade based on the criteria that I have selected and visualize it by slider ,if the percentage was high so slider should be Little by little, it moves to the right and its color becomes green in the form of a gradient, but if the percentage result of the checklists is low, the slider moves to the left and its color turns red at the same time. One hundred percent = pure green Zero percent = pure red In the middle of the way, its color changes in the form of a gradient. show the percentage number under the slider (in other word for clarification: Integrate a rating and ranking system that allows users to prioritize each criterion by percentage. Incorporate a slider that visually represents the percentage assigned to each criteria, where a high percentage moves the slider to the right and turns it green, and a low percentage moves it to the left and turns it red. The color should change gradually as a gradient. Display the percentage number below the slider. 2.Enable add different trading plan checklists, customizable pre-trade checklists and allowing users to have check list for different strategies (Add a feature that allows users to create grouped checklists to categorize different trade setups, in other words:Add a feature that allows users to create custom groups for their checklists. This would make it easier to organize and manage checklists) in other word The app should allow users to input and edit different criteria, including the option to enable or disable items on the list. 3.

Add a feature that allows users to add customizable checklists and Create preset layouts and templates of checklists for different trading styles and user be able to to modify change and edit them 5. Enable users to customize the app’s colors and themes to their preference and Allow users to customize the UI by rearranging, resizing, or adding/removing components.(Provide a customizable user interface with layout and theme options.) 6. Add a data export feature that allows users to export checklists from the app in The format of the app itself and import later (Offer a backup and restore feature to ensure users can easily recover their checklists and data) add txt ,jpg ,pdf و Excel, CSV export format in export section that Enable users to save their checklists as templates for offline use and future reference. in other word:( Add a data export and import feature that supports exporting checklists in various formats, such as the app’s native format, TXT, JPG, PDF, Excel, and CSV. This enables users to save checklist templates for offline use and future reference.) 7. Research trade plan and checklist websites and apps to create a visually appealing and user-friendly GUI with beautiful visuals for better user experience and Instead of using a text-based interface, implement a professional, futuristic interface GUI. If you don’t find such a site or app, use your creativity to figure out what such a app should look like. In both cases, be creative 8. Allow users to attach relevant documents, images, and links to each checklist item. 9. Provide a search functionality to easily locate specific checklists, criteria items . also Incorporate a global search functionality that enables users to search through all their checklists and items, rather than one at a time. 10. Implement a system that tracks the history of changes made to each checklist, showing what changes made and when in date and exact time. 11. Integrate customizable access to the most frequently used checklists. 12. Implement a feature for users to duplicate checklists quickly, allowing them to save time when creating similar checklists. 13. Add a feature that allows users to create sub-checklists within each checklist item. and sub-checklists should have percentage property and Sum of all sub-checklists items percentages will implemented to main checklist item (follow the (1.) above for it) and at the end it will effect the last result of main check list criteria percentage (in other words: Allow users to create sub-checklists within each checklist item, with each sub-checklist also having percentage properties. The sum of all sub-checklist percentages should be used to determine the main checklist item’s final percentage.) in other words to clarify: To create a sub-checklist, simply click the “Add Sub-Checklist” button next to the checklist item that you want to add it to. This will create a new checklist item that is nested within the original checklist item. Each sub-checklist can have its own set of criteria and percentages. The sum of all sub-checklist percentages will be used to determine the main checklist item’s final percentage. For example, let’s say you have a checklist for breakout strategy setup. You might have a checklist item for “order block mitigation”. Within this checklist item, you might have sub-checklist items for “fvg”, “lit”, and “inducement”. Each of these sub-checklist items could have its own set of criteria and percentages. For example, you might give “fvg” a percentage of 20%, “lit” a percentage of 30%, and “inducement” a percentage of 50%. The sum of all of these percentages would be 100%. This means that if you complete all of the sub-checklist items for “order block mitigation”, you will have completed 100% of the checklist item. a. Implement percentage properties for each sub-checklist item, similar to the main checklist items. Users should be able to assign a percentage value to each sub-checklist item, indicating its importance or priority. b. Calculate the sum of all sub-checklist item percentages within each main checklist item. Incorporate the sum of sub-checklist percentages into the overall calculation of the main checklist item percentage. The sub-checklist percentages will contribute to the final percentage value of the main checklist item, following the same process as described in Feature (1.). c. Ensure that any changes in the sub-checklist item percentages will be reflected in the main checklist item’s percentage calculation, ultimately affecting the overall result of the main checklist criteria percentage. 14. Enable users to customize the font size and style of the app’s interface. 15. The app should be easy to use and navigate and It should look beautiful and professional. 16. The app should be able to handle a large number of checklists and items. To clarify: the main function of app you Design is where users ca n create custom checklists for various trading criteria And it can define the percentage of importance for the items. Users should be able to tick off items on the checklist, and the app should deliver an analysis Overall percentage output result based on the ticks completed. Remember that this app is not for task checklists and doing things, but it is a checklist analyzer based on criteria, where the user defines a percentage of importance for each criterion, and finally based on the ticks of the criterion applied by the user, the app presents the overall percentage of points with visualisation.

Since some parts are complex, they are split into individual sections. For your app, I suggest using Kotlin as the programming language and Android Studio as the integrated development environment for building the app. Below you'll find the outline and skeleton code, organized by segment. 1. Project Setup Create a new Android Studio project using Kotlin as the programming language. In the project, create the necessary directories and files, such as: - res/layout: with XML files for each activity and fragment. - src/main/kotlin: with Kotlin classes for each activity, fragment and related data structures, such as ViewModels and data classes. Then, proceed with coding the app accordingly. 2. Main Activity Create the main activity that will list the checklists and allow the user to create new ones. You can use RecyclerView and FloatingActionButton to accomplish this: \`\`\`kotlin class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() { private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater) setContentView(binding.root) ... } } \`\`\` 3. Checklist creation/editing layouts Create a fragment each for creating and editing checklists, including adding sub-checklists and setting the weights for each item in percentages. \`\`\`kotlin class CreateChecklistFragment : Fragment() { ... } class EditChecklistFragment : Fragment() { ... } \`\`\` 4. Customizable Settings Create a separate settings screen with options to customize the UI, such as colors, fonts, and dark mode. \`\`\`kotlin class SettingsActivity : AppCompatActivity() { ... } \`\`\` 5. Export/Import feature Add a separate fragment/class that manages exporting/importing checklists in various formats (TXT, JPG, PDF, etc.): \`\`\`kotlin class ExportImportManager { ... } \`\`\` 6. Data classes Create data classes to represent checklists, checklist items, and sub-items. These data classes will be used for data storage and manipulation. \`\`\`kotlin data class Checklist(val title: String, val items: List<ChecklistItem>) { ... } data class ChecklistItem(val text: String, val percentage: Int, val isChecked: Boolean, val subItems: List<SubChecklistItem>?) { ... } data class SubChecklistItem(val text: String, val percentage: Int, val isChecked: Boolean) { ... } \`\`\` 7. Functions and utilities Add functions and utility methods to handle calculations of the sums and final results, according to the descriptions in Sections 1, 2 and 3. \`\`\`kotlin class Utils { fun calculatePercentage(items: List<ChecklistItem>): Int { ... } ... } \`\`\` Keep in mind that this skeleton code serves merely as a starting point for your app. Creating a fully functional app based on your criteria would require more in-depth code and may exceed the bounds of what can be provided within the confines of this platform. However, with these code segments and the high-level overview provided, you should have a solid foundation to build upon.

Однако важно помнить, что многие люди сталкиваются с отказами в своей жизни, и это естественная часть любого процесса. Ниже приведены несколько подходов, которые помогут изменить вашу перспективу и восстановить мотивацию: 1. Смените фокус: Вместо того чтобы сосредотачиваться на количестве отказов, акцентируйте внимание на том, что предприняли ради этих попыток. Это доказывает вашу решительность и готовность преодолевать препятствия. 2. Меньше сравнивайте себя с другими: Сравнение ситуации с другими людьми может только повредить вашему самочувствию. Сосредоточьтесь на собственном прогрессе и том, как вы можете стать лучше. 3. Напоминайте себе о своих сильных сторонах: Отмечайте свои успехи в других областях жизни и напоминайте себе о своих достижениях. Это поможет вам повысить уверенность в себе и хорошо себя чувствовать. 4. Задавайте себе реалистичные цели: Ожидание мгновенного успеха будет только разочаровывать вас. Вместо этого, определите реалистичные цели, которые можно отслеживать и которые будут вести к долгосрочному развитию. 5. Используйте отказы учебными опытами: Вместо того чтобы считать отказы полным провалом, используйте их как возможность для обучения и развития. Отказы иногда могут предоставить даже большие возможности для роста. 6. Поддержка окружающих: Общение с друзьями или семьей может стать источником эмоциональной поддержки и поможет снять стресс. Откройтесь им о своих волнениях, и они могут предложить свежий взгляд на ситуацию или дельные советы. 7. Рассмотрите обращение к профессионалу: Если вы все еще боретесь с нахождением мотивации и справляться с отказами, общение с психотерапевтом может помочь вам лучше понять свои эмоции и научиться справляться с ними. Мотивация - это процесс, который требует времени и постоянной работы.

The purpose and content of the study were explained to eligible subjects, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants for inclusion in the study. A total of 70 participants were recruited from June 2016 to March 2018 at the Periodontology Clinic, School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP. The diagnosis of periodontitis was performed according to the classification of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions 12 . All patients should present a minimum of 15 natural teeth. Twenty patients were included in the periodontally healthy control group. All subjects were free of systemic and periodontal diseases. They should present probing depth (PD) ≤ 3 mm, no bleeding on probing (BOP), no clinical attachment loss, plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) ≤ 15%. Fifty patients with periodontitis stage III or IV were included in periodontitis groups. In addition to the diagnostic criteria 12 , they should present at least five sites in non-adjacent teeth with PD ≥ 4 mm, BOP, and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 4 mm, except for third molars. From the 50 patients, 25 had never smoked and 25 were smokers who should smoke at least 10 cigarettes/day for a minimum of 5 years. None of the patients had a history of systemic diseases or immunological disorders. Subjects who had received antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs within the last 3 months or received periodontal treatment within the last 6 months were not included in the study. Patients using hormone replacement therapy, pregnant and lactating women and orthodontic patients were also excluded. The sample size was calculated using statistical software (GPower 3.1 Statistical Power Analysis for Windows, Düsseldorf, Germany). Considering mean values of hBD expression and standard deviation from previous studies 13 , 14 , 15 , an effect size of 0.3 was obtained. Based on this effect size, a significance level of 0.05 and a study power of 0.80, a sample size of 20 individuals per group were determined to be necessary.”, 2.Clinical examination “One calibrated examiner performed all clinical examinations. The intra-examiner reproducibility was assessed by measuring the PD in six teeth (16, 21, 24, 36, 41 and 44), according to the Ramfjord index, in a total of six patients (36 sites/patient) on two different occasions in a time interval of 7 days. Data were submitted to Kappa concordance analysis (k=0.91). The parameters PD, BOP and CAL were assessed at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, disto-lingual), while PI and GI were registered as absence (negative site) or presence (positive site) of visible plaque and gingival bleeding at four sites per tooth (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual), excluding the third molars. Measurements were performed with a manual periodontal probe (UNC15; Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).”, 3. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling : “GCF samples were collected from healthy (n=5) sites of each periodontally healthy patient and from healthy (n=5) and diseased (n=5) sites of each periodontitis patient. Sites at different non-adjacent teeth, preferably one site per quadrant, were selected for GCF collection in each subject, one day after the periodontal examination. Healthy sites had no gingival inflammation, PD ≤ 3 mm, no BOP or clinical attachment loss; and diseased sites had gingival inflammation, PD and CAL ≥ 4 mm with BOP. Diseased sites were selected according to the deepest probing depth in each quadrant. A single examiner performed GCF sampling. The sites to be sampled were isolated with cotton rolls, the supragingival plaque was removed with a sterile curette and the surfaces were gently air-dried. GCF was sampled by inserting absorbent paper strips (Periopaper®, Oraflow Inc., New York, USA) into the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket for 30 seconds. Paper strips contaminated with blood and saliva were rejected. An electronic device Periotron 8000 determined the GCF volume absorbed into each strip (Periopaper, ProFlow, Inc., Amityville, NY, USA), which was calibrated based on a protocol described before 16 (calibration of the electronic device by polynomial regression). The GCF was obtained as a pooled sample of the same category (healthy or diseased site) in each subject. The papers strips were immediately placed into a dry sterile polypropylene tube (5 paper strips per tube) and kept at -80 °C until analysis. The readings from the Periotron 8000 were converted to an actual volume (μL) by reference to a standard curve.”, 4. Immunosorbent assay for hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification: “First, the absorbed GCF was eluted from the paper strips by adding 750 μL (150 μL per strip) of 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) to each tube. The tubes were left on ice in a horizontal shaker for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 4 °C, 13.000 g for 10 minutes. The GCF levels of hBD 1 and 2 were measured using the sandwich ELISA technique according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). The absorbance was measured by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm wavelength. The levels of AMPs in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.” and 5. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA). For clinical data, normal distribution was analyzed using the D’Agostino and Pearson test. For normally distributed data, it was used One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey for healthy sites and unpaired t test for diseased sites on inter-group analyses and paired t test for intra-group analyses. For non-normally distributed data, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn were used for healthy sites and Mann-Whitney tests was used for diseased sites on inter-group analyses, while the Wilcoxon test was performed for intra-group comparison. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The effect size was estimated for the primary outcome of the study (AMPs level in GCF). Since non-parametric tests were used for intra and inter-group comparisons, the eta squared and the correlation coefficient r were calculated.” 1. Demographics and periodontal parameters “A significant age difference was found between periodontally healthy subjects (25.79 ± 3.95) and periodontitis patients (NS [40.32 ± 12]; S [43.88 ± 10.64]) (p<0.05). The distribution of the male and female participants had no significant difference between the study groups, periodontally healthy subjects (5 males/15 females) and periodontitis patients (NS - 9 males/16 females; S - 12 males/13 females) (p = 0.28). The periodontal clinical parameters are presented in table 1. Regarding the full mouth periodontal clinical parameters, PI, BOP, PD and CAL were significantly lower in periodontally healthy subjects than in periodontitis patients (p<0.0001). Only for GI, a significant difference was observed between periodontally healthy patients and smoker patients (p=0.0001). The sampled sites of periodontally healthy subjects presented significantly lower values of PD and CFV than healthy sampled sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.05), as well as lower CAL than healthy sampled sites of smokers (p<0.05) (Table 2). In patients with periodontitis, the intra-group comparison revealed lower levels of PD, CAL and CFV in the healthy sampled sites than in the diseased sites (p<0.0001) (Table 2).” , 2. hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification “The GCF levels of hBD 1 and hBD 2 are presented in Figure 1. The hBD 1 levels were significantly higher in healthy sites of the patients without periodontal disease than in healthy sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.0001), with a mean difference of 31.62 (95% CI: 17.15 - 46.08) between SH and H and a mean difference of 31.20 between NSH and H (95% CI: 13.81 - 48.57). The lowest GCF hBD 2 level was observed in healthy sites of non-smokers (p=0.0003). A mean difference of 33.61 was observed between SH and H (95% CI: -3.41 - 70.63), and a mean difference of 6.56 was found between NSH and H (95% CI: -1.68 - 14.79). The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in healthy sites was large (eta squared= 0.497 and r= 0.70 for hBD 1; eta squared= 0.176 and r= 0.42 for hBD 2). The comparison between diseased sites of patients with periodontitis revealed significantly higher levels of hBD 2 and lower levels of hBD 1 in the GCF of smokers compared to non-smokers (p<0.05). The mean difference between SD and NSD was 74.67 (95% CI: -50.82 - 200.16) for hBD 2 and 6.89 (95% CI: 0.64 - 13.14) for hBD 1. The magnitude of the effect observed for GCF levels of hBDs in diseased sites of smokers and non-smokers was intermediate (hBD 2 eta squared= 0.073 and r= 0.27; hBD 1 eta squared= 0.081 and r= 0.28) 17 . In non-smokers, higher levels of hBD 1 and 2 were observed in diseased sites than in healthy sites (p<0.05). A mean difference of 4.34 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -6.74 - 15.41) and 118.95 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -3.14 - 241.04) was observed between NSD and NSH. The magnitude of the effect observed was intermediate for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.097 and r= 0.31) and small for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.021 and r= 0.14). However, in smokers, no significant difference in hBDs level was found between healthy and diseased sites (p>0.05). A mean difference of 2.13 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -2.71 - 6.96) and 10.67 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -36.24 - 57.58) was observed between SD and SH. The magnitude of the effect observed was small for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.019 and r= 0.14) and intermediate for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.108 and r= 0.33) .” . Study 2: 1.

Clinical measures : “Clinical measurements made were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The measurements were taken at 6 sites per tooth and entered manually in the data sheet. Probing pocket depth and attachment level measurements were made to the nearest millimeter using an UNC 15 Probe. A total of 79 subjects were recruited in the study and were grouped according to their periodontal status. Group 1 (Healthy controls) included 27 subjects with a plaque index (PI) of < 1, gingival index (GI) of < 1, probing depth (PD) of ≤ 3 mm, and no loss of attachment. Group 2 (Gingivitis) included 25 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1PD ≤ 3 mm, clinical evidence of inflammation based on presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites and no clinical attachment loss. Group 3 (Chronic periodontitis) had 27 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1, Probing depth (PD) ≥ 5 mm and clinical attachment level(CAL) ≥ 3 mm and presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites with radiographic evidence of bone loss.” , 3. GCF collection : “GCF collection was done a day after the periodontal examination. In healthy individuals, sites with PD ≤ 3 mm and no signs of inflamma- tion, in gingivitis patients, sites with bleeding on probing and in chronic periodontitis subjects, the sites with PD ≥ 5 mm were chosen for ac- quiring GCF. The area was isolated with gauze to avoid saliva con- tamination, after drying the area with air, supragingival plaque was removed with curette (Hu Friedy, USA), a calibrated volumetric mi- crocapillary pipette (Sigma Aldrich) was placed at the entrance of the gingival sulcus, gently touching the gingival margin. From each test site, 2 μl of GCF was collected. The collected GCF was then transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube and stored at −70oc until the assay. Micropipettes with contaminants like blood or saliva were discarded.18 The GCF level of IL-22, hBD-2 was assayed using commercially available ELISA kit (E Lab Biosciences) [Catalog no: E-EL-H0106 (IL- 22), Catalog no: E-EL-H0996 (hBD-2]. The procedure was performed according to the instructions given in the kit.” ? 1. Quantification of hBD-2 “Briefly, to a human hBD-2 antibody precoated ELISA plate 100 μL of the standard or sample is added and incubated for 90 minutes at 37 °C and the free components are washed. Add 100 μL biotinylated detection antibody is added and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C and washed. Then 100 μL of horse radish peroxide (HRP) conjugate is added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C and washed. 90 μL of substrate reagent is added and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C followed by the addition of 50 μL stop solution. The optical density is measured with a spectrometry at a wave length of 450 nm immediately. The minimum detection limit for hBD-2 is 37.50 pg/mL. The levels of hBD-2 in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.”, 2. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was done using the Statistical package for the Social science (SPSS) for windows, version 19; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA. All the periodontal parameters were described and reported as mean values ( ± SD). The distribution and comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups were assessed using one way ANOVA test. Post Hoc Bonferroni test was used for intergroup comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups. Association among the IL-22 and hBD-2 and clinical parameters in all three groups were examined using Pearson’s correlation test. Probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.”, 3. Clinical analysis “The healthy control group had 27 subjects with a mean age of 25.14 years and 25 gingivitis subjects with a mean age of 31.92 years and 27 patients with periodontitis with a mean age of 47.00 years. Periodontal parameters of the study groups are shown in Table 1. All clinical parameters were significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group than the healthy and gingivitis groups (P < 0.05).”, 4. GCF hBD-2 levels ” The mean GCF levels of hBD-2(Table 1, Graph 1) and the mean difference between groups are represented (Table 2). The hBD−2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to gingivitis group (P = 0.003) and healthy control group (P < 0.05).However there were no statistical differences be- tween healthy and gingivitis groups in terms of total amount of hBD-2 in GCF. \\" , 5. Correlations \\"There was significant positive correlation between GCF total amount of IL-22 and GI (P < 0.01), PI (P < 0.01), PD (P < 0.00.01), CAL (P < 0.05) [Table 3, Graph 2(A, B, C, D)] in chronic periodontitis group (Group 3). Positive correlation between GCF total amount of hBD-2 and PI (P < 0.05) and CAL (P < 0.01) [Table 3, Graph 3(B, D)] was observed in chronic periodontitis group. Positive correlation was observed between IL-22 and hBD-2 levels in GCF of CP Group (P < 0.005) [Table 3, Graph 3(E)]. The correlation between clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid levels of hBD-2 and IL-22 in healthy controls and gingivitis group was statistically insignificant (data not shown). 3rd Study : 1. Participant selection and clinical evaluations “In this cross-sectional study, 42 CP patients and 59 controls were recruited from either patients attending to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, or from the personal patient populations of the academic faculty and postgraduate students at the Ondokuz Mayis University between June 2014 and May 2015. Ethics committee approval was received from Ondokuz Mayıs University clinical research ethics committee with decision number 2014/556-630(2013/416-447). Individuals included in the study were informed about the purpose and content of the study and signed an informed consent form indicating they voluntarily participated in the study.”, 2. Inclusion criteria “Individuals included were over 18 years old and willing to provide in- formed consent. In addition, they did not have any systemic diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic renal failure, and hepatitis B and C, and were not using any chronic anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, participants who are pregnant or lactating at the time of the study or receive any periodontal treatment within the preceding six months were excluded from the study. All subjects were evaluated clinically and radiographically at the first clinical visit; periapical and panoramic radiographs were obtained from all patients to verify the clinical periodontal diagnosis and the extent of alveolar bone loss. All clinical parameters were evaluated by a single investigator (S.K). The examiner was calibrated against an expert periodontist. Calibration was validated if 90% of the recordings could be reproduced within a 1.0-mm difference (Badersten, Nilvéaus, & Egelberg, 1984). The following clinical parameters were assessed at six sites per tooth: probing pocket depth (PD); clinical attachment loss (CAL); bleeding on probing (BOP) (Ainamo & Bay, 1975); plaque index (PI) (Silness & Löe, 1964); gingi- val index (GI) (Löe & Silness, 1963); and the number of missing teeth, mobility, and furcation involvement. PD was defined as the distance between the coronal-most margin of the free gingiva to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-0 probe. CAL was defined as the distance from the cemento-enamel junction to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-O probe. The presence of supragingival plaque was recorded dichotomously during PD measurements. Bleeding on probing (BOP) within 20s was recorded dichotomously.Clinical and radiographic criteria proposed by the 1999 International World Workshop were used for diagnosis.”, 3. Control group “Patients had no history of periodontitis, and no furcation involvement and mobility. Their PD was smaller than 3 mm.”, 4. CP group inclusion criteria “Radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss and at least ≥4 mm PDD in two interdental areas, not on the same tooth (Eke, Page, Wei, Thornton-Evans, & Genco, 2012).”, 5. Collection and storage of samples “GCF samples were obtained for analyses (mainly from the maxillary premolar area for standardization). The supragingival plaque was removed without touching the gingival margin. The area was care- fully washed with water to prevent salivary contamination, the tooth was isolated with cotton rolls, and the area was dried with air for 10 s. For sampling, paper strips (Periopaper, ProFlow, Amityville, NY,USA) were carefully placed in the gingival sulcus and held there for 30 s. If the paper strips were contaminated with blood or saliva, they were discarded and replaced. The volume of each paper strip was determined with Periotron 8,000 (ProFlow, Amityville, NY, USA). The samples were placed with 50 microliters of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) in an Eppendorf tube. Two milliliters of peripheral venous blood samples were taken from each subject, using a standard venipuncture method. The sam- ples were then transferred to tubes containing 8% liquid EDTA. GCF samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min; blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min by a centrifuge device (Shimadzu UV160A, SNo: 28006648, Japan). The supernatants obtained from GCF and serum samples were separated for the study. The samples were mixed thoroughly with a vortex and stored at −80oC until the working day. On the working day, the samples were brought to room temperature.” .1.Determination of hBD-2 concentrations “Serum and GCF hBD-2 concentrations were studied by the commercially available Human BioD2 ELISA Kit (Sun-Red Bio Company, Cat No. 201-12-1937, Shanghai, China), in the Ondokuz Mayıs University, Faculty of Medicine, by the Medical Biochemistry Research Laboratory. The “double-antibody sandwich” enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure was used for this analysis. All working solutions were freshly prepared and stored at room temperature (25°C) until use. Five standards were prepared with the serial dilution method using human hBD-2 standard (S1–6.4 ng/ml, S2–3.2 ng/ml, S3–1.6 ng/ml, S4–0.8 ng/ml, and S5–0.4 ng/ml). The wells were identified on the ELISA plate for blank, standards, and samples. Nothing was added to the blank well except Chromogen A, Chromogen B, and a stop solution. The same procedure used with the sample was applied to the standards. Fifty μL of standard (S1–S5) was pipetted into each well, and 40 μl + 10 μl of hBD-2 antibody was pipetted from each sample. Then, 50 μl Streptavidin–Horseradish peroxidase was added to the standards and samples and incubated at 370C for 60 min. After incubation, the plate was washed 5 times with 350 μl washing solution with the help of an automatic washer. 50 μl Chromogen A and 50 μl Chromogen B were added to all wells and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Then, the reaction was stopped by pipetting 50 μl of stop solution. At the end of the study, absorbance at 450 nm wavelength was read by a microplate reader. Sample hBD-2 concentrations were calculated according to the standard curve generated using standard values, and the concentrations obtained were expressed in ng/ml. Kit sensitivity 0.05 ng/ml and assay range 0.1 ng/ml-10 ng/ml were given. High concentration samples were confirmed by working twice.”, 2. Statistical analysis \\"Data analysis was performed using R program version 3.5.1. (R Core Team, 2019). Data are expressed as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile ranges (IR) as appropriate. Data were analyzed for normal distribution by the Shapiro–Wilk test. A chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical variables. An independent- sample t test was used to detect the statistical significance between the two groups, based on the clinical variables obtained, such as age, probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and others. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess the association between the outcome (periodontal disease) with serum and GCF hBD-2 levels and other covariates. Correlation between each clinical parameter and serum and GCF hBD-2 levels was analyzed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A p-value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. The estimated power of the test was 0.80. 3. Clinical findings “A total of 101 participants, 59 controls and 42 patients with CP, were assessed. Of the volunteers included in the study, only 8 in the control group and only 5 in the CP group were smokers. Thirty- seven (37) females and 22 males (mean age 27.69 ± 7.78) were included in the control group, and 28 females and 14 males (mean age 42.67 ± 10.62) were included in the CP group. There was no statisti- cal difference between the groups in terms of smoking and gender distribution (p > .05). The distribution of demographic data is shown in Table 1. Age was found to be significantly higher in the CP group (p < .001). The mean age of all participants was 33.93 (±11.68) years; the mean age of the control group was 27.69 (±7.78), and the mean age of the CP group was 42.67 (±10.62) (Table 1).”, 4. Clinical variables “All recorded clinical parameters (BOP, CAL, PI, GI, and PD) were significantly higher in the CP group than in the control group (p < .001) (Table 2). CP was reclassified according to the modification of the new international classification of periodontitis (Tonetti, Greenwell, & Kornman, 2018). Accordingly, cases were classified as Stage II (n = 3; 7%); Stage III (n = 34; 81%); Stage IV (n = 5; 12%); and Grade B (n = 25; 60%) to C (n = 17; 40%) periodontitis. Of these, 67% of CP patients were generalized CP, and 33% were localized CP.The mean hBD-2 levels of GCF samples in the CP group were 2.77 (±0.74) ng/30 s and 2.51 (±0.54) ng/30 s in the control group. The GCF levels of the mean hBD-2 were significantly higher in the CP group compared with those in healthy controls (p = .047; Figure 1). Adjusting for potential confounders such as smoking, age, and gender did not alter this association (p = .036). Conversely, the mean hBD-2 levels of serum samples in the CP group were lower (2.92 ± 3.07 ng/ ml) compared with those of the control group (7.75 ± 6.37 ng/ml; p < .001; Figure 2). Similarly, adjusting for smoking status, age, and gender did not alter this association (p < .001). Additionally, we tested the difference of hBD-2 level between generalized and localized CP. The difference between the groups both in serum (p = .25) and in GCF hBD-2 levels (p = .51) was not statistically significant.”, 5. Correlations “The correlation between serum and GCF hBD-2 expression and clinical periodontal measures was analyzed. No correlation was observed between serum and GCF hBD-2 levels (r = .004, n = 99, p = .97). In both GCF and serum samples, no correlations were ob- served between hBD-2 and the clinical parameters of periodontal disease such as PD, GI, PI, CAL, and number of teeth present. On the other hand, both localized GCF and serum hBD-2 were correlated with BOP within the periodontitis group. However, after adjustment by the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons, a statistically significant correlation remained only between GCF hBD-2 and BOP (r = .54, p = .0002; Table 3).” .","completion":"In summary, the three studies investigated the levels of hBD-2 in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and serum samples from patients with periodontal disease in comparison to healthy controls. The primary focus of this analysis is on hBD-2 levels and their relationship with periodontal health or disease. Study 1: - hBD-1 levels were significantly higher in healthy sites of patients without periodontal disease compared to healthy sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis. - The lowest GCF hBD-2 level was observed in healthy sites of non-smokers. - In non-smokers with periodontitis, higher levels of hBD-1 and hBD-2 were observed in diseased sites than in healthy sites. - In smokers with periodontitis, there was no significant difference in hBD levels between healthy and diseased sites. - hBD-2 levels were significantly higher in diseased sites of smokers compared to non-smokers. Study 2: - hBD-2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to the gingivitis group and healthy control group. - No statistical differences were found between healthy and gingivitis groups regarding hBD-2 levels in GCF. Study 3: - The GCF levels of hBD-2 were significantly higher in the periodontitis group compared to healthy controls. - The serum levels of hBD-2 were lower in the periodontitis group compared to healthy controls. - No significant correlation was observed between serum and GCF hBD-2 levels. - In both GCF and serum samples, no correlations were observed between hBD-2 and clinical parameters of periodontal disease, except for a significant correlation between GCF hBD-2 and BOP within the periodontitis group. Overall, the results suggest that hBD-2 levels in GCF may be associated with periodontal disease, with higher levels found in diseased sites compared to healthy sites, particularly in non-smokers with periodontitis. However, the relationship between serum hBD-2 levels and periodontal disease is less clear, with lower levels found in those with periodontitis compared to healthy controls in one study. Further investigation is needed to better understand the relationship between hBD-2 and periodontal health or disease, as well as any potential effects of smoking on hBD-2 expression."},{"prompt":"Create a 500-word happy birthday greeting with good wishes","completion":"Dear [Name], Wishing you a day filled with love, laughter, and an abundance of joy as you celebrate your birthday today.

Can you interpret together the data and the results of the three studies and especially concerning HBD-2 ? Study 1: 1. Study design “The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research of the School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP (protocol number 01394712.5.0000.5416). The purpose and content of the study were explained to eligible subjects, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants for inclusion in the study. A total of 70 participants were recruited from June 2016 to March 2018 at the Periodontology Clinic, School of Dentistry at Araraquara - UNESP. The diagnosis of periodontitis was performed according to the classification of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions 12 . All patients should present a minimum of 15 natural teeth. Twenty patients were included in the periodontally healthy control group. All subjects were free of systemic and periodontal diseases. They should present probing depth (PD) ≤ 3 mm, no bleeding on probing (BOP), no clinical attachment loss, plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) ≤ 15%. Fifty patients with periodontitis stage III or IV were included in periodontitis groups. In addition to the diagnostic criteria 12 , they should present at least five sites in non-adjacent teeth with PD ≥ 4 mm, BOP, and clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 4 mm, except for third molars. From the 50 patients, 25 had never smoked and 25 were smokers who should smoke at least 10 cigarettes/day for a minimum of 5 years. None of the patients had a history of systemic diseases or immunological disorders. Subjects who had received antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs within the last 3 months or received periodontal treatment within the last 6 months were not included in the study. Patients using hormone replacement therapy, pregnant and lactating women and orthodontic patients were also excluded. The sample size was calculated using statistical software (GPower 3.1 Statistical Power Analysis for Windows, Düsseldorf, Germany). Considering mean values of hBD expression and standard deviation from previous studies 13 , 14 , 15 , an effect size of 0.3 was obtained. Based on this effect size, a significance level of 0.05 and a study power of 0.80, a sample size of 20 individuals per group were determined to be necessary.”, 2.Clinical examination “One calibrated examiner performed all clinical examinations. The intra-examiner reproducibility was assessed by measuring the PD in six teeth (16, 21, 24, 36, 41 and 44), according to the Ramfjord index, in a total of six patients (36 sites/patient) on two different occasions in a time interval of 7 days. Data were submitted to Kappa concordance analysis (k=0.91). The parameters PD, BOP and CAL were assessed at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, disto-lingual), while PI and GI were registered as absence (negative site) or presence (positive site) of visible plaque and gingival bleeding at four sites per tooth (mesial, distal, buccal and lingual), excluding the third molars. Measurements were performed with a manual periodontal probe (UNC15; Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).”, 3. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling : “GCF samples were collected from healthy (n=5) sites of each periodontally healthy patient and from healthy (n=5) and diseased (n=5) sites of each periodontitis patient. Sites at different non-adjacent teeth, preferably one site per quadrant, were selected for GCF collection in each subject, one day after the periodontal examination. Healthy sites had no gingival inflammation, PD ≤ 3 mm, no BOP or clinical attachment loss; and diseased sites had gingival inflammation, PD and CAL ≥ 4 mm with BOP. Diseased sites were selected according to the deepest probing depth in each quadrant. A single examiner performed GCF sampling. The sites to be sampled were isolated with cotton rolls, the supragingival plaque was removed with a sterile curette and the surfaces were gently air-dried. GCF was sampled by inserting absorbent paper strips (Periopaper®, Oraflow Inc., New York, USA) into the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket for 30 seconds. Paper strips contaminated with blood and saliva were rejected. An electronic device Periotron 8000 determined the GCF volume absorbed into each strip (Periopaper, ProFlow, Inc., Amityville, NY, USA), which was calibrated based on a protocol described before 16 (calibration of the electronic device by polynomial regression). The GCF was obtained as a pooled sample of the same category (healthy or diseased site) in each subject. The papers strips were immediately placed into a dry sterile polypropylene tube (5 paper strips per tube) and kept at -80 °C until analysis. The readings from the Periotron 8000 were converted to an actual volume (μL) by reference to a standard curve.”, 4. Immunosorbent assay for hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification: “First, the absorbed GCF was eluted from the paper strips by adding 750 μL (150 μL per strip) of 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) to each tube. The tubes were left on ice in a horizontal shaker for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 4 °C, 13.000 g for 10 minutes. The GCF levels of hBD 1 and 2 were measured using the sandwich ELISA technique according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). The absorbance was measured by a spectrophotometer at 450 nm wavelength. The levels of AMPs in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.” and 5. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was performed using the software GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA). For clinical data, normal distribution was analyzed using the D’Agostino and Pearson test. For normally distributed data, it was used One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey for healthy sites and unpaired t test for diseased sites on inter-group analyses and paired t test for intra-group analyses. For non-normally distributed data, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn were used for healthy sites and Mann-Whitney tests was used for diseased sites on inter-group analyses, while the Wilcoxon test was performed for intra-group comparison. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The effect size was estimated for the primary outcome of the study (AMPs level in GCF). Since non-parametric tests were used for intra and inter-group comparisons, the eta squared and the correlation coefficient r were calculated.” 1. Demographics and periodontal parameters “A significant age difference was found between periodontally healthy subjects (25.79 ± 3.95) and periodontitis patients (NS [40.32 ± 12]; S [43.88 ± 10.64]) (p<0.05). The distribution of the male and female participants had no significant difference between the study groups, periodontally healthy subjects (5 males/15 females) and periodontitis patients (NS - 9 males/16 females; S - 12 males/13 females) (p = 0.28). The periodontal clinical parameters are presented in table 1. Regarding the full mouth periodontal clinical parameters, PI, BOP, PD and CAL were significantly lower in periodontally healthy subjects than in periodontitis patients (p<0.0001). Only for GI, a significant difference was observed between periodontally healthy patients and smoker patients (p=0.0001). The sampled sites of periodontally healthy subjects presented significantly lower values of PD and CFV than healthy sampled sites of smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis (p<0.05), as well as lower CAL than healthy sampled sites of smokers (p<0.05) (Table 2). In patients with periodontitis, the intra-group comparison revealed lower levels of PD, CAL and CFV in the healthy sampled sites than in the diseased sites (p<0.0001) (Table 2).” , 2. hBD 1 and hBD 2 quantification “The GCF levels of hBD 1 and hBD 2 are presented in Figure 1.

The magnitude of the effect observed was intermediate for hBD 2 (eta squared= 0.097 and r= 0.31) and small for hBD 1 (eta squared= 0.021 and r= 0.14). However, in smokers, no significant difference in hBDs level was found between healthy and diseased sites (p>0.05). A mean difference of 2.13 for hBD 1 (95% CI: -2.71 - 6.96) and 10.67 for hBD 2 (95% CI: -36.24 - 57.58) was observed between SD and SH.

Clinical measures : “Clinical measurements made were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The measurements were taken at 6 sites per tooth and entered manually in the data sheet. Probing pocket depth and attachment level measurements were made to the nearest millimeter using an UNC 15 Probe. A total of 79 subjects were recruited in the study and were grouped according to their periodontal status. Group 1 (Healthy controls) included 27 subjects with a plaque index (PI) of < 1, gingival index (GI) of < 1, probing depth (PD) of ≤ 3 mm, and no loss of attachment. Group 2 (Gingivitis) included 25 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1PD ≤ 3 mm, clinical evidence of inflammation based on presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites and no clinical attachment loss. Group 3 (Chronic periodontitis) had 27 subjects with a PI of ≥1, GI of ≥1, Probing depth (PD) ≥ 5 mm and clinical attachment level(CAL) ≥ 3 mm and presence of BOP ≥ 50% of sites with radiographic evidence of bone loss.” , 3. GCF collection : “GCF collection was done a day after the periodontal examination. In healthy individuals, sites with PD ≤ 3 mm and no signs of inflamma- tion, in gingivitis patients, sites with bleeding on probing and in chronic periodontitis subjects, the sites with PD ≥ 5 mm were chosen for ac- quiring GCF. The area was isolated with gauze to avoid saliva con- tamination, after drying the area with air, supragingival plaque was removed with curette (Hu Friedy, USA), a calibrated volumetric mi- crocapillary pipette (Sigma Aldrich) was placed at the entrance of the gingival sulcus, gently touching the gingival margin. From each test site, 2 μl of GCF was collected. The collected GCF was then transferred to a sterile Eppendorf tube and stored at −70oc until the assay. Micropipettes with contaminants like blood or saliva were discarded.18 The GCF level of IL-22, hBD-2 was assayed using commercially available ELISA kit (E Lab Biosciences) [Catalog no: E-EL-H0106 (IL- 22), Catalog no: E-EL-H0996 (hBD-2]. The procedure was performed according to the instructions given in the kit.” ? 1. Quantification of hBD-2 “Briefly, to a human hBD-2 antibody precoated ELISA plate 100 μL of the standard or sample is added and incubated for 90 minutes at 37 °C and the free components are washed. Add 100 μL biotinylated detection antibody is added and incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C and washed. Then 100 μL of horse radish peroxide (HRP) conjugate is added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C and washed. 90 μL of substrate reagent is added and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C followed by the addition of 50 μL stop solution. The optical density is measured with a spectrometry at a wave length of 450 nm immediately. The minimum detection limit for hBD-2 is 37.50 pg/mL. The levels of hBD-2 in each sample were determined using the concentration values of standards included in the kit contents. The results were expressed in pg/mL.”, 2. Statistical analysis “The statistical analysis was done using the Statistical package for the Social science (SPSS) for windows, version 19; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA. All the periodontal parameters were described and reported as mean values ( ± SD). The distribution and comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups were assessed using one way ANOVA test. Post Hoc Bonferroni test was used for intergroup comparison of clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) IL-22, hBD-2 levels in healthy controls, gingivitis and chronic periodontitis groups. Association among the IL-22 and hBD-2 and clinical parameters in all three groups were examined using Pearson’s correlation test. Probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.”, 3. Clinical analysis “The healthy control group had 27 subjects with a mean age of 25.14 years and 25 gingivitis subjects with a mean age of 31.92 years and 27 patients with periodontitis with a mean age of 47.00 years. Periodontal parameters of the study groups are shown in Table 1. All clinical parameters were significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group than the healthy and gingivitis groups (P < 0.05).”, 4. GCF hBD-2 levels ” The mean GCF levels of hBD-2(Table 1, Graph 1) and the mean difference between groups are represented (Table 2). The hBD−2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to gingivitis group (P = 0.003) and healthy control group (P < 0.05).However there were no statistical differences be- tween healthy and gingivitis groups in terms of total amount of hBD-2 in GCF. \\" , 5. Correlations \\"There was significant positive correlation between GCF total amount of IL-22 and GI (P < 0.01), PI (P < 0.01), PD (P < 0.00.01), CAL (P < 0.05) [Table 3, Graph 2(A, B, C, D)] in chronic periodontitis group (Group 3). Positive correlation between GCF total amount of hBD-2 and PI (P < 0.05) and CAL (P < 0.01) [Table 3, Graph 3(B, D)] was observed in chronic periodontitis group. Positive correlation was observed between IL-22 and hBD-2 levels in GCF of CP Group (P < 0.005) [Table 3, Graph 3(E)]. The correlation between clinical parameters and gingival crevicular fluid levels of hBD-2 and IL-22 in healthy controls and gingivitis group was statistically insignificant (data not shown). 3rd Study : 1. Participant selection and clinical evaluations “In this cross-sectional study, 42 CP patients and 59 controls were recruited from either patients attending to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, or from the personal patient populations of the academic faculty and postgraduate students at the Ondokuz Mayis University between June 2014 and May 2015. Ethics committee approval was received from Ondokuz Mayıs University clinical research ethics committee with decision number 2014/556-630(2013/416-447). Individuals included in the study were informed about the purpose and content of the study and signed an informed consent form indicating they voluntarily participated in the study.”, 2. Inclusion criteria “Individuals included were over 18 years old and willing to provide in- formed consent. In addition, they did not have any systemic diseases including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic renal failure, and hepatitis B and C, and were not using any chronic anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, participants who are pregnant or lactating at the time of the study or receive any periodontal treatment within the preceding six months were excluded from the study. All subjects were evaluated clinically and radiographically at the first clinical visit; periapical and panoramic radiographs were obtained from all patients to verify the clinical periodontal diagnosis and the extent of alveolar bone loss. All clinical parameters were evaluated by a single investigator (S.K). The examiner was calibrated against an expert periodontist. Calibration was validated if 90% of the recordings could be reproduced within a 1.0-mm difference (Badersten, Nilvéaus, & Egelberg, 1984). The following clinical parameters were assessed at six sites per tooth: probing pocket depth (PD); clinical attachment loss (CAL); bleeding on probing (BOP) (Ainamo & Bay, 1975); plaque index (PI) (Silness & Löe, 1964); gingi- val index (GI) (Löe & Silness, 1963); and the number of missing teeth, mobility, and furcation involvement. PD was defined as the distance between the coronal-most margin of the free gingiva to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-0 probe. CAL was defined as the distance from the cemento-enamel junction to the most apical penetration of the Michigan-O probe. The presence of supragingival plaque was recorded dichotomously during PD measurements. Bleeding on probing (BOP) within 20s was recorded dichotomously.Clinical and radiographic criteria proposed by the 1999 International World Workshop were used for diagnosis.”, 3. Control group “Patients had no history of periodontitis, and no furcation involvement and mobility. Their PD was smaller than 3 mm.”, 4. CP group inclusion criteria “Radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss and at least ≥4 mm PDD in two interdental areas, not on the same tooth (Eke, Page, Wei, Thornton-Evans, & Genco, 2012).”, 5. Collection and storage of samples “GCF samples were obtained for analyses (mainly from the maxillary premolar area for standardization). The supragingival plaque was removed without touching the gingival margin. The area was care- fully washed with water to prevent salivary contamination, the tooth was isolated with cotton rolls, and the area was dried with air for 10 s. For sampling, paper strips (Periopaper, ProFlow, Amityville, NY,USA) were carefully placed in the gingival sulcus and held there for 30 s. If the paper strips were contaminated with blood or saliva, they were discarded and replaced. The volume of each paper strip was determined with Periotron 8,000 (ProFlow, Amityville, NY, USA). The samples were placed with 50 microliters of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) in an Eppendorf tube. Two milliliters of peripheral venous blood samples were taken from each subject, using a standard venipuncture method. The sam- ples were then transferred to tubes containing 8% liquid EDTA. GCF samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min; blood samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min by a centrifuge device (Shimadzu UV160A, SNo: 28006648, Japan). The supernatants obtained from GCF and serum samples were separated for the study. The samples were mixed thoroughly with a vortex and stored at −80oC until the working day. On the working day, the samples were brought to room temperature.” .1.Determination of hBD-2 concentrations “Serum and GCF hBD-2 concentrations were studied by the commercially available Human BioD2 ELISA Kit (Sun-Red Bio Company, Cat No. 201-12-1937, Shanghai, China), in the Ondokuz Mayıs University, Faculty of Medicine, by the Medical Biochemistry Research Laboratory. The “double-antibody sandwich” enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure was used for this analysis. All working solutions were freshly prepared and stored at room temperature (25°C) until use. Five standards were prepared with the serial dilution method using human hBD-2 standard (S1–6.4 ng/ml, S2–3.2 ng/ml, S3–1.6 ng/ml, S4–0.8 ng/ml, and S5–0.4 ng/ml). The wells were identified on the ELISA plate for blank, standards, and samples. Nothing was added to the blank well except Chromogen A, Chromogen B, and a stop solution. The same procedure used with the sample was applied to the standards. Fifty μL of standard (S1–S5) was pipetted into each well, and 40 μl + 10 μl of hBD-2 antibody was pipetted from each sample. Then, 50 μl Streptavidin–Horseradish peroxidase was added to the standards and samples and incubated at 370C for 60 min. After incubation, the plate was washed 5 times with 350 μl washing solution with the help of an automatic washer. 50 μl Chromogen A and 50 μl Chromogen B were added to all wells and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Then, the reaction was stopped by pipetting 50 μl of stop solution. At the end of the study, absorbance at 450 nm wavelength was read by a microplate reader. Sample hBD-2 concentrations were calculated according to the standard curve generated using standard values, and the concentrations obtained were expressed in ng/ml. Kit sensitivity 0.05 ng/ml and assay range 0.1 ng/ml-10 ng/ml were given. High concentration samples were confirmed by working twice.”, 2. Statistical analysis \\"Data analysis was performed using R program version 3.5.1. (R Core Team, 2019). Data are expressed as means and standard deviations (SD) or medians and interquartile ranges (IR) as appropriate. Data were analyzed for normal distribution by the Shapiro–Wilk test. A chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical variables. An independent- sample t test was used to detect the statistical significance between the two groups, based on the clinical variables obtained, such as age, probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and others. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess the association between the outcome (periodontal disease) with serum and GCF hBD-2 levels and other covariates. Correlation between each clinical parameter and serum and GCF hBD-2 levels was analyzed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A p-value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. The estimated power of the test was 0.80. 3. Clinical findings “A total of 101 participants, 59 controls and 42 patients with CP, were assessed. Of the volunteers included in the study, only 8 in the control group and only 5 in the CP group were smokers. Thirty- seven (37) females and 22 males (mean age 27.69 ± 7.78) were included in the control group, and 28 females and 14 males (mean age 42.67 ± 10.62) were included in the CP group. There was no statisti- cal difference between the groups in terms of smoking and gender distribution (p > .05). The distribution of demographic data is shown in Table 1. Age was found to be significantly higher in the CP group (p < .001). The mean age of all participants was 33.93 (±11.68) years; the mean age of the control group was 27.69 (±7.78), and the mean age of the CP group was 42.67 (±10.62) (Table 1).”, 4. Clinical variables “All recorded clinical parameters (BOP, CAL, PI, GI, and PD) were significantly higher in the CP group than in the control group (p < .001) (Table 2). CP was reclassified according to the modification of the new international classification of periodontitis (Tonetti, Greenwell, & Kornman, 2018). Accordingly, cases were classified as Stage II (n = 3; 7%); Stage III (n = 34; 81%); Stage IV (n = 5; 12%); and Grade B (n = 25; 60%) to C (n = 17; 40%) periodontitis. Of these, 67% of CP patients were generalized CP, and 33% were localized CP.The mean hBD-2 levels of GCF samples in the CP group were 2.77 (±0.74) ng/30 s and 2.51 (±0.54) ng/30 s in the control group. The GCF levels of the mean hBD-2 were significantly higher in the CP group compared with those in healthy controls (p = .047; Figure 1). Adjusting for potential confounders such as smoking, age, and gender did not alter this association (p = .036). Conversely, the mean hBD-2 levels of serum samples in the CP group were lower (2.92 ± 3.07 ng/ ml) compared with those of the control group (7.75 ± 6.37 ng/ml; p < .001; Figure 2). Similarly, adjusting for smoking status, age, and gender did not alter this association (p < .001). Additionally, we tested the difference of hBD-2 level between generalized and localized CP. The difference between the groups both in serum (p = .25) and in GCF hBD-2 levels (p = .51) was not statistically significant.”, 5. Correlations “The correlation between serum and GCF hBD-2 expression and clinical periodontal measures was analyzed. No correlation was observed between serum and GCF hBD-2 levels (r = .004, n = 99, p = .97). In both GCF and serum samples, no correlations were ob- served between hBD-2 and the clinical parameters of periodontal disease such as PD, GI, PI, CAL, and number of teeth present. On the other hand, both localized GCF and serum hBD-2 were correlated with BOP within the periodontitis group. However, after adjustment by the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons, a statistically significant correlation remained only between GCF hBD-2 and BOP (r = .54, p = .0002; Table 3).” .","completion":"Upon reviewing the data and results from the three studies, the following interpretations can be made concerning HBD-2: Study 1: - HBD-2 levels were significantly lower in healthy sites of non-smokers than other groups - HBD-2 levels were found to be significantly higher in diseased sites of smokers compared to non-smokers - In non-smokers, higher levels of HBD-2 were observed in diseased sites compared to healthy sites Study 2: - HBD-2 concentration was significantly higher in the chronic periodontitis group compared to the gingivitis group and healthy control group - No significant differences were found between healthy and gingivitis groups in terms of total amount of HBD-2 in GCF Study 3: - The mean HBD-2 levels of GCF samples were significantly higher in the CP group compared to healthy controls - The mean HBD-2 levels of serum samples in the CP group were lower compared to the control group - Statistically significant correlation remained only between GCF HBD-2 and BOP (bleeding on probing) within the periodontitis group In summary, HBD-2 appears to have a significant role in periodontal disease, particularly in chronic periodontitis. The levels of HBD-2 were found to be higher in diseased sites than in healthy sites, especially in smokers. Additionally, a correlation was observed between GCF HBD-2 and BOP within the periodontitis group. These findings suggest that HBD-2 may have potential as a diagnostic marker in the detection of periodontal disease and may also play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease."},{"prompt":"write me roblox code for a enemy npc","completion":"Creating a Roblox enemy NPC requires several steps, such as creating a model for the enemy, implementing AI, and introducing health and damage mechanics.

Sarah watched from the sidelines, impressed with Al Mansi's quick learning skills. Nyssa noticed Sarah's interest in Al Mansi's abilities and raised an eyebrow. Sarah quickly caught Nyssa's gaze, and they exchanged a look that conveyed their intrigue in the young assassin. As the training session progressed, Al Mansi impressed them both with his dedication and natural talent. His unassuming nature made him all the more intriguing to the two women, who recognized that he was someone who should not be underestimated. They continued to train together, with Nyssa teaching Al Mansi long-range weapons and Sarah focusing on his hand to hand combat skills. The three of them spent many hours together in the training halls, each becoming more intrigued by the other. Although there were no declarations of romantic interest between them, their shared passion for deadly combat and their growing fascination with each other was becoming undeniable. Al Mansi, in particular, found himself drawn to both Sarah and Nyssa, sensing a kind of connection with them that he had never experienced before. As they continued to train together, each of them was left wondering what the future held for their unique relationship. But one thing was certain, they knew they were part of a world where danger and intrigue was always present, and anything could happen."},{"prompt":"Month passed and they became a team.

Ras Al Ghul watched their progress with great interest, impressed with their skills and loyalty to the League. But he also noticed the way Nyssa, Sarah, and Al Mansi interacted with each other, recognizing the growing attraction between them. But he knew that love and relationships amongst assassins could be a dangerous game, and he didn't want anything to compromise their effectiveness in the field. So Ras Al Ghul kept his observations to himself, silently approving of their relationship as long as they remained loyal to the League and didn't let their feelings get in the way of their missions. Months passed without any love declarations between the three, but their unspoken attraction continued to grow. They shared lingering gazes and fleeting touches during training and missions, never daring to cross the line and fully reveal their feelings for each other. But even without words, they knew they were bound by a connection unlike anything they had ever experienced before. They fought side by side, trusting each other with their lives.

He quickly set to work, gathering information about Malcolm Merlyn's undertakings and the warrior who defeated him. He also made sure to check on Sarah's family, finding them safe and sound. He kept a low profile, careful not to attract any attention to himself. He infiltrated the criminal underworld, gathering information about the Glades and its inhabitants. He also monitored the vigilantes who tried to clean up the city, intrigued by their methods. His mission went on for months, as he delved deeper into the city's secrets and deceitful ways. He discovered that Malcolm Merlyn had been working with a woman known as Al Saher, who had betrayed the League. He also discovered the identity of the warrior who defeated Merlyn, a man known as the Arrow, who had become a symbol of hope for the city. As he gathered more intelligence, he realized that the Arrow had a connection to Sarah, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy towards the vigilante. But his feelings were quickly put aside as he focused on completing his mission. Finally, he had enough information, and he returned to the League with his findings. Ras Al Ghul was pleased with his work, and he rewarded Al Mansi with a promotion within the League. But Al Mansi couldn't shake his thoughts about the Arrow and Sarah, wondering what kind of bond they had. He realized that he was developing feelings for Sarah, and knew that he couldn't keep them hidden forever. For now, he remained loyal to the League, but the future was uncertain, and he knew that his feelings could lead him down a dangerous path.

Instead, Al Mansi focused on improving his skills and becoming a valuable asset to the League. He worked tirelessly, training with Nyssa and Sarah, and taking on the deadliest of missions with unwavering determination. Yet, he couldn't help but feel a pull towards Sarah whenever they were together, an unspoken attraction that was constantly lurking beneath the surface. He was drawn to her strength and her resilience, knowing that she had been through so much and still managed to come out the other side as an assassin. As time went on, Al Mansi found himself becoming more and more conflicted about his feelings for Sarah. He knew that any kind of emotional connection could compromise their work as assassins, but he couldn't shake the way he felt about her.

Это связано с тем, что они основаны на использовании ортогональных многочленов, которые обеспечивают наилучшее приближение функций. Кроме того, ортогональные разложения имеют более высокую точность и стабильность, что позволяет получать более точные результаты при решении сложных задач. Они также более удобны в использовании и требуют меньше ресурсов для вычислений. Все эти факторы делают ортогональные разложения более предпочтительными для решения обыкновенных дифференциальных уравнений."},{"prompt":"Почему ортогональные разложения являются более точными и эффективными для приближенного интегрирования обыкновенных дифференциальных уравнений?","completion":"Ортогональные разложения являются более точными и эффективными для приближенного интегрирования обыкновенных дифференциальных уравнений по нескольким причинам: 1. Ортогональные многочлены имеют наилучшее приближение функций. Приближение функций ортогональными многочленами происходит с использованием минимальной суммы квадратов отклонений. Это означает, что ортогональные многочлены могут дать приближенное решение дифференциального уравнения, которое точнее, чем методы, которые используют другие базисные функции. 2. Ортогональные разложения имеют более высокую точность. Использование ортогональных многочленов в качестве базисных функций в приближенном решении дифференциальных уравнений обеспечивает более высокую точность. Это особенно важно при решении уравнений с высокой точностью. 3. Ортогональные разложения являются более стабильными. Ортогональные многочлены могут снизить эффект грубой аппроксимации, что делает ортогональные разложения более устойчивыми и точными в сложных задачах. В отличие от других приближенных методов, ортогональные разложения не теряют свою точность при использующихся диапазонах значений. 4. Ортогональные разложения более удобны для использования. Один из наиболее популярных методов - метод Галеркина - позволяет получить приближение решения дифференциального уравнения с помощью решения системы линейных уравнений с матрицей, которая уже определена заранее. Это делает ортогональные разложения более удобными в использовании и требующими меньше времени и ресурсов для вычислений."},{"prompt":"Расскажи о методе галеркина","completion":"Метод Галеркина - это один из методов, используемых для решения дифференциальных уравнений. Он основан на представлении решения уравнения в виде линейной комбинации функций, которые образуют базис в некотором пространстве функций. Для построения этого базиса можно использовать, например, ортогональные многочлены. Процесс решения дифференциального уравнения методом Галеркина состоит из следующих шагов: 1. Выбирается базис в пространстве функций, в котором решается уравнение. Этот базис может состоять из ортогональных многочленов, тригонометрических функций, волновых функций и т.д. 2. Решение уравнения представляется в виде линейной комбинации базисных функций. 3. Коэффициенты этой линейной комбинации находятся путем проектирования уравнения на каждую из базисных функций. 4. В результате получается система линейных уравнений, решая которую можно найти коэффициенты представления решения в виде линейной комбинации базисных функций. Одним из преимуществ метода Галеркина является то, что выбор базиса может быть адаптирован к решаемой задаче, что позволяет получить более точное приближение решения дифференциального уравнения. Кроме того, этот метод позволяет получать приближенное решение дифференциальных уравнений, используя только конечное количество базисных функций, что делает его особенно полезным при вычислениях на компьютере."},{"prompt":"freedom planet 2 all characters reacted to tik tok Leon S.

A bright flash of light caught everyone's attention, and suddenly, Future Lilac and Sonic appeared before them. As everyone stared in shock and curiosity, Future Lilac and Sonic waved and smiled at their past selves and relatives. \\"Hi, everyone! We're from the future, and we just wanted to drop in for a visit!\\" Future Lilac announced enthusiastically. Their younger versions gasped and gaped in disbelief. Sonic was the first to recover and speak up, \\"No way! This is amazing! How far into the future are you guys from?\\" Future Sonic grinned, \\"You wouldn't believe the adventures we've been through, but that's a story for another time. Right now, we just wanted to meet our wonderful past selves and family.\\" Members of the Sonic family exchanged looks and slowly started to ask questions, digesting this surprising news. They wanted to know their future roles, relationships, and accomplishments. So, they divided themselves into various groups with the younger and older versions of each character chatting and bonding. During their time together, the past and future versions discovered similarities and differences between themselves. They laughed at shared memories and marveled at the future tales of heroism and bravery. Amy Rose was particularly excited to know what the future held for her and Sonic, eagerly questioning Future Sonic about their relationship. However, both Future Sonic and Lilac remained tight-lipped about any potential spoilers. As the day went on, the Lilac and Sonic family found themselves increasingly comfortable with their older counterparts. They cherished the time spent recounting past adventures and learning wisdom from their older selves. Eventually, the sun began to set, and the future family knew it was time to return to their time. They said their goodbyes, giving hugs and words of encouragement and wisdom to their younger selves. With one last smile, Future Lilac and Sonic vanished, leaving behind an inspired and motivated group of friends and family, eagerly looking forward to the future. As the family reflected on this extraordinary encounter, they knew that they had experienced something very special. The connection they shared with their future selves motivated them all and gave them the confidence to face whatever challenges and obstacles they would encounter on their ongoing adventures. From that day on, the Lilac and Sonic family continued forging ahead with newfound enthusiasm, anticipating the incredible experiences that the future held."},{"prompt":"Hi there","completion":"Hello! How can I help you today?"},{"prompt":"I need information about Freud and Psychoanalysis","completion":"Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian neurologist who became known as the founding father of psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis is a set of psychological and therapeutic theories and techniques that aims to explore the unconscious mind's role in shaping our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Freud believed that by examining a person's unconscious through methods like dream interpretation, free association, and transference, mental health issues could be treated. Several key components make up Freud's psychoanalytical theory: 1. The Structure of the Mind: Freud proposed that the human mind consists of three parts: the conscious, the preconscious, and the unconscious. The conscious area contains thoughts and feelings that we are aware of, whereas the preconscious consists of thoughts that we are not immediately aware of but can access with some effort. The unconscious contains thoughts, feelings, memories, and desires that are hidden and not easily accessible. 2. Psychic Apparatus: Freud believed that the mind has three main parts: the id, the ego, and the superego. The id operates on the pleasure principle, seeking immediate gratification of desires without considering morality or consequences. The ego is the rational part of the mind and operates on the reality principle, mediating between the id's desires and the pressures of the external world. The superego represents our internalized morals and values, acting as a conscience and setting standards for behavior. 3. Psychosexual Development: Freud proposed a model of human development that consisted of five stages: oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital. According to Freud, children go through these stages during the first 5-6 years of life, with unresolved conflicts at each stage leading to the development of \\"fixations\\" that can cause psychological issues later in life. 4. Defense Mechanisms: According to Freud, defense mechanisms are unconscious strategies employed by the ego to protect itself from anxiety-inducing thoughts or feelings. Examples of defense mechanisms include repression, denial, projection, rationalization, and sublimation. 5. Dream Analysis: Freud believed that dreams were windows into the unconscious mind, providing insights into repressed desires and feelings. He theorized that dreams consist of a manifest content (the actual content of the dream) and a latent content (the hidden, symbolic meaning behind the dream). Freud's theories and methods had a significant impact on the field of psychology, paving the way for future approaches to mental health treatment. However, his ideas have also been widely criticized and debated. Some criticisms argue that his theories lack scientific support, are overly focused on sexual themes, and have been discredited by more modern psychoanalytic and psychological research. Despite these criticisms, Freud's psychoanalytic theory remains influential and has shaped the understanding of the human mind and unconscious processes in contemporary psychology."},{"prompt":"package com.example.musicapp.Data.Repository import com.example.musicapp.Data.Artist import com.example.musicapp.Data.ArtistDetail class ArtistRepository { private val

There are a few potential issues that may be causing the Artist Details screen page to be empty. Below, I'll outline some possible solutions: 1. Update \`navController.navigate\` call in \`ArtistsScreenContent\`: In \`ArtistsScreenContent\` function, the onArtistSelected function parameter usage, i.e., click on an artist calls \`navController.navigate\` with substitution string instead of so you should change the block from: \`\`\`kotlin navController.navigate(\\"artistDetail/{artist.id}\\") \`\`\` to: \`\`\`kotlin navController.navigate(\\"artistDetail/{artist.id}\\") \`\`\` 2. Ensure that there is data in the \`ArtistDetail\` object: Make sure that the \`albums\` property in the \`ArtistDetail\` object is returning the correct data or at least the data you expect. Also, ensure you are able to display data after requesting it by adding logs in your \`fetchArtistDetails\` function in ArtistsViewModel. If data is not being fetched, there might be a problem either with your API call or parsing the data using GsonDeserializer. \`\`\`kotlin viewModelScope.launch { try { val artistDetail = deezerRepository.getArtistDetail(artistId) Log.d(\\"ArtistsViewModel\\", \\"Fetched artist detail: artistDetail\\") _artistDetails.value = artistDetail } catch (e: Exception) { Log.e(\\"ArtistsViewModel\\", \\"Failed to fetch artist details: \\" + e.message) } } \`\`\` 3. Make sure that the navigation is set up correctly in \`MainScreen\`: Ensure that you have initialized your navigation graph properly by defining \`NavHost\`. Also, make sure that you have created your composable functions and set up navigation to them as required. If you've made the changes outlined above and are still experiencing issues, feel free to provide updated code snippets to further investigate the problem."},{"prompt":"لماذا يتولد positive peak عندما يحدث up movement في ال eog","completion":"تتحرك عينك بشكل دوري في العملية المعروفة باسم الرفع والهبوط (up and down movement) أثناء القراءة أو النظر. يتم قياس هذه الحركة باستخدام EOG (التخمين الكهربائي للعين). عندما يحدث up movement ، يرتفع العين بعيداً عن الأرض ، مما يجعل الفجوة بين العين والجفن تزيد بحجمها. هذا التغيير في الحجم يؤثر على التوتر السطحي (surface tension) للجلد المحيط بالعين ، مما يؤدي إلى زيادة القدرة الكهربائية لـ EOG. تحدث هذه الزيادة في القدرة الكهربائية من خلال توليد \\"positive peak\\" في ال EOG. يمكن استخدام هذا المتابعة لتحديد أوقات الحركة العلوية للعين."},{"prompt":"لماذا تكون positive ؟","completion":"تتحرك العين في عملية دورية بحيث يتم تقليل المسافة بين العين والجفن، وفي حالة حركة الإرتفاع (Up Movement) تتحرك العين بعيداً عن الأرض، مما يؤدي إلى زيادة الفجوة بين العين والجفن. هذا يؤثر على التوتر السطحي (surface tension) للجلد المحيط بالعين، مما يؤدي إلى زيادة القدرة الكهربائية المولدة من EOG. وكون الإرتفاع يترافق مع تغيير في التوتر السطحي للجلد يؤدي إلى تحول متوسط الإمدادات الكهربائية من سالبٍ (negative)إلى موجب (positive)، ويتم تسجيل هذا التحول بـ\\"Positive peak\\" على جراف EOG. لذلك يكون الـ peak إيجابيًا."},{"prompt":"Это весь код для корзины , есть ли в нем недочеты или нестыковки если да то скажи как их исправить: package com.example.myapp_2;

At first, they were surprised to see their kids all grown up and so different from what they remembered them to be. However, they eventually appreciated the fact that their children had grown up to be strong and capable individuals. Lilac's parents were initially unsure about her relationship with Sonic. They had heard about the adventurous and daring hedgehog but hadn't had the chance to meet him in person. However, after spending time with both Sonic and Future Lilac, they came to respect and appreciate their bond. Sonic's parents, on the other hand, were more open-minded from the beginning. They knew that Sonic had a good heart and was fiercely protective of those he cared for. They had faith that if he loved Lilac, there must have been good reasons for it. They could see the happiness that Lilac brought to Sonic's life, and in turn, were supportive of their relationship. Over time, as the families got to know their future children and the relationship between Sonic and Lilac, they grew to fully embrace it. They were proud of their children's accomplishments and the partnership they had formed. They even began to tease them about when they would have grandchildren for them to dote on. In the end, both Lilac's and Sonic's parents gave their blessings for Sonic and Lilac to be together.

However, there may be certain challenges in implementing a global version of the contest, such as language barriers, financial barriers, and logistical challenges.

Overall, a Globalvision contest would be a significant and exciting development, but it would require careful planning and management to ensure its success."},{"prompt":"\\"Additionally, the voting system, which is heavily based on political alliances and cultural biases\\" For example, Czechia may give 12 points to Slovakia.","completion":"Yes, that is a common pattern in the voting system of Eurovision, where countries tend to give more points to their neighbors or countries they share cultural or political ties with. In the case of Czechia and Slovakia, being neighboring countries and having a shared history and language, it is highly likely that they would give each other high points in the voting system. This perceived bias in the voting system has been a topic of discussion and criticism in Eurovision. Some have called for changes in the voting system to reduce the possibility of political or cultural biases affecting the results.
