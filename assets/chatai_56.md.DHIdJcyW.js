Let A be a threedigit number that is a whole multiple of 12, where a, b, and c are the digits of number A and c lt b lt a. Choose any two digits from a, b, and c to form a twodigit number, with the larger twodigit number denoted as Pleft(Aright) and the smaller twodigit number denoted as Qleft(Aright). If frac{P(A)+Q(A)}{2} is an integer, find the smallest value of the number A that satisfies this condition.","completion":"To solve this problem, we follow the given conditions and analyze them step by step. First, let's define the expressions for P(A) and Q(A) based on the digits a, b, and c of the number A: - P(A) = 10a + b - Q(A) = 10c + b Given that frac{P(A) + Q(A)}{2} must be an integer, we substitute the expressions for P(A) and Q(A) into this equation: [ frac{P(A) + Q(A)}{2} = frac{(10a + b) + (10c + b)}{2} = frac{10a + 10c + 2b}{2} = 5a + 5c + b ] This shows that frac{P(A) + Q(A)}{2} will always be an integer, regardless of the specific values of a, b, and c, as long as they are integers themselves. Next, we consider the condition that A is a \\"whole multiple\\" of 12, and the sum of its digits a + b + c = 12. Given the constraint c < b < a, we need to find the combinations of a, b, and c that satisfy this sum and order. The possible combinations under these conditions are: - a = 9, b = 2, c = 1 - a = 8, b = 3, c = 1 - a = 7, b = 4, c = 1 - a = 6, b = 5, c = 1 - a = 7, b = 3, c = 2 - a = 6, b = 4, c = 4 - a = 5, b = 4, c = 3 Among these combinations, we are looking for the smallest value of A that satisfies the condition. By examining the combinations, we find that the smallest value of A is formed when a = 6, b = 5, and c = 1, which gives us A = 651. However, upon closer inspection, it seems there was a mistake in the enumeration of combinations. The correct enumeration, focusing on the smallest possible value and adhering strictly to the conditions, would prioritize the smallest values for a, b, and c that sum to 12 and follow c < b < a. The correct smallest combination under these guidelines is actually a = 6, b = 5, and c = 1, leading to A = 156. Therefore, the smallest value of the number A that satisfies the given condition is boxed{156}."},{"prompt":"A man, a woman, and a boy can together complete a piece of work in 3 days. A man alone can do it in 6 days, and a boy alone in 9 days. How long will a woman take to complete the work?","completion":"Let's denote the work to be done as 1 unit of work. Let the rate at which the man works be M, the rate at which the woman works be W, and the rate at which the boy works be B. These rates are in units of work per day. According to the problem, the man can complete the work in 6 days, so his rate is: M = 1 work unit / 6 days Similarly, the boy can complete the work in 9 days, so his rate is: B = 1 work unit / 9 days Together, the man, the woman, and the boy can complete the work in 3 days, so their combined rate is: M + W + B = 1 work unit / 3 days Now we can substitute the known rates for the man and the boy into the combined rate equation: (1/6) + W + (1/9) = 1/3 To solve for W, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 6, 9, and 3 is 18. So we rewrite the equation as: (3/18) + W + (2/18) = 6/18 Now combine the fractions on the left side: W + (3/18 + 2/18) = 6/18 W + (5/18) = 6/18 Subtract (5/18) from both sides to isolate W: W = (6/18) - (5/18) W = 1/18 This means the woman's rate of work is 1/18 of the work per day. To find out how many days she would take to complete the work alone, we take the reciprocal of her rate: Days for woman to complete work = 1 / W Days for woman to complete work = 1 / (1/18) Days for woman to complete work = 18 Therefore, the woman would take boxed{18} days to complete the work alone."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=x^{2}+ax+4, g(x)=|x+1|+|x1|.

If one of its vertices happens to be the focus of the parabola y^2 = 8x, what is the equation of the hyperbola?","completion":"Given that the center of the hyperbola is at the origin and its eccentricity (e) is 2, if one of its vertices is a focus of the parabola y^2 = 8x, we proceed as follows: 1. First, for the given parabola y^2 = 8x, we know that the standard form of a parabola is y^2 = 4ax, where a represents the distance from the vertex to the focus. Hence, for the parabola y^2 = 8x, 4a = 8, which results in a = 2. The focus of this parabola is therefore at (2, 0). 2. For the hyperbola, we have e = 2 and a vertex at the focus of the parabola, which implies that the vertex of the hyperbola is also at (2, 0). In a hyperbola with a horizontal transverse axis, the vertex's x-coordinate is the value of a. Consequently, a = 2. 3. The eccentricity e of a hyperbola is defined by the equation e = sqrt{1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}}, where b is the distance from the center to the co-vertex along the y-axis. Plugging in e = 2 and a = 2, we get 2 = sqrt{1 + frac{b^2}{2^2}}, which simplifies to 4 = 1 + frac{b^2}{4}. Solving for b^2, we have b^2 = 4(4 - 1) = 4 times 3 = 12. 4. The equation of a hyperbola centered at the origin with a horizontal transverse axis is given by frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. Substituting a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 12, the equation of the hyperbola is frac{x^2}{4} - frac{y^2}{12} = 1 quad text{or} quad frac{x^2}{2^2} - frac{y^2}{(sqrt{12})^2} = 1.

Dividing by 4 to get the hyperbola in standard form, we find frac{x^2}{4} - frac{y^2}{12} = 1.

We begin by numbering the contacts of the lamp sequentially and then number the holes in the plug in the opposite order. 2. Let the contacts of the lamp be numbered as (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). 3. Conversely, number the holes in the plug as (7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). 4. Define the contact of the lamp with number (k) to be positioned in the hole with number (a - k), where (a) is some fixed number. Given that there are 7 contacts and 7 holes, without loss of generality, we can let (a) be 7 to facilitate the calculations. 5. This means that the position of contact with number (k) will be in hole (7 - k). 6. Next, to guarantee that at least one contact will always fit into its matching hole at any insertion, compute the residues modulo 7. 7. For instance, consider the lamp's contacts: [ k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ] The corresponding holes when (a = 7): [ 7 - k = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 quad (text{mod } 7) ] 8. We need to ensure that (k) and (7 - k) give the same residue when divided by 7. Specifically, the number (2k) should give the same remainder as 7 modulo 7: [ 2k equiv 0 pmod{7} ] 9. When (k) runs through all residues modulo 7, we wish to see that (2k) also cycles through all residues (i.e., (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)). This confirms that, regardless of the lamp’s rotation and insertion into the plug, at least one contact will position to its corresponding number. 10. Checking simple residues: [ begin{align*} text{For } k = 0, & quad 2k = 0 text{For } k = 1, & quad 2k = 2 text{For } k = 2, & quad 2k = 4 text{For } k = 3, & quad 2k = 6 text{For } k = 4, & quad 2k = 8 equiv 1 pmod{7} text{For } k = 5, & quad 2k = 10 equiv 3 pmod{7} text{For } k = 6, & quad 2k = 12 equiv 5 pmod{7} end{align*} ] 11.

We need to determine the maximum possible ( N ). 1. **Constructing an Example for ( N = 180 )**: - Consider a circle and mark 180 points on it such that they divide the circle into 180 equal arcs of ( 2^circ ) each. - Note that the arc lengths formed between any two chosen points on the circle will result in angles that are multiples of ( 2^circ ). - Therefore, the inscribed angles formed by any three points will also be natural numbers when measured in degrees. - This construction ensures that any triangle formed by any three points will have its angles in natural numbers of degrees. Thus, ( N = 180 ) is feasible. 2. **Proving the Upper Bound ( N leq 180 )**: - Assume we have ( N ) points such that any three form a triangle with its angles in natural number degrees. - Any three points are not collinear (cannot lie on the same line) because they must form a valid triangle. - Consider the point ( A ) with the highest ordinate (y-coordinate among all points). - From the remaining points, select points ( B ) and ( C ) such that the angle ( angle BAC ) is maximized. 3. **Angle Considerations**: - In triangle ( triangle ABC ), the angles ( angle ABC ) and ( angle ACB ) are at least ( 1^circ ) due to the constraint of being natural numbers. - Hence, ( angle BAC leq 178^circ ). 4. **Analysis of Remaining Points**: - Any other ( N-3 ) points must lie strictly within the angle ( angle BAC ). - Each of these ( N-3 ) points forms a line through ( A ) that divides ( angle BAC ) into ( N-2 ) smaller angles. - If ( N-2 > 178 ), there would be more divisions than ( angle BAC )’s total degrees, implying at least one angle is less than ( 1^circ ). This violates the natural number condition of the angles. 5. **Deriving the Bound**: - Therefore, ( N-2 leq 178 ), implying ( N leq 180 ).

By definition, tan x = frac{sin x}{cos x}, so if tan x < 0 and sin x > 0, cos x must be negative.

The slope of the tangent line at x=0 is given by f'(0) = -2a.

Initially, we know that: [ B + W = 400 ] 4. Each move involves picking up 4 checkers from one cell and distributing them to its 4 neighboring cells. When making a move starting from a black cell, the checkers will be redistributed to white cells, and vice versa. 5.

This is because any single edge (line segment) in a complete graph ( K_2 ) with two vertices will satisfy the condition. - When ( m = 2 ), ( n = 5 ). This can be verified by contradiction: considering a two-colored ( K_4 ) where any pair of edges that share color must share a common vertex ensures no such set of 2 independent edges exists. In ( K_5 ), whether all edges are of the same color or not, one can prove there exist two edges of the same color without a common vertex. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** - To generalize for any natural number ( m ), let's assume the minimal number ( n ) for ( m=k ) is ( 3k-1 ). We will use this hypothesis for our induction. 3. **Inductive Step:** - Consider ( m = k + 1 ): - For a complete graph ( K_{3k+2} ), assume all edges are the same color. Clearly, we can find ( k+1 ) edges without a common vertex since the hypothesis holds. - Alternatively, assume not all edges are of the same color.

Adding back one of the previously removed edges (which aligns in color), we achieve ( k+1 ) non-overlapping same-colored edges. 5. **Further Validation by Graph Division:** - Split the vertices of ( K_{3k+1} ): - Group ( A ) having ( k ) vertices. - Group ( B ) having ( 2k+1 ) vertices. - Color pairs within ( B ) red, and other edges blue. Regardless, among ( k+1 ) edges of every color permutation, always at least two will overlap on a vertex, thus ensuring minimal ( n = 3m-1 + 1 ). 6. **Conclusion:** - The minimal ( n ) for ensuring ( m ) disjoint same-colored edges is ( 3m-1 ).

Given that the point P(1, 3) lies on the hyperbola, substituting the coordinates into the equation gives us: 1^2 - 3^2 = lambda lambda = 1 - 9 lambda = -8 Therefore, the standard equation of the hyperbola becomes: frac{x^2}{8} - frac{y^2}{8} = -1 Multiplying both sides by -1, we get: frac{y^2}{8} - frac{x^2}{8} = 1 Thus, the correct answer is boxed{D}.

The sum of the distances from point (P) to the three sides of (triangle ABC) is (a + b + 1). 4.

The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Since we are looking for a divisor other than 5 (because the remainder is different when divided by 5), the possible values for d are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

Since the maximum value of this function is 2, we can use the vertex form of a quadratic function to find the relationship between a and c. The vertex form is given by y=a(x-h)^{2}+k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola. For the given function, the vertex can be found by completing the square or using the formula h=-frac{b}{2a} for a quadratic equation in the form ax^{2}+bx+c. Given that the maximum value is 2, this value corresponds to the k in the vertex form, which is the maximum or minimum value of the function depending on the sign of a. Since a neq 0 and we are dealing with a maximum value, a must be negative (as a positive a would make the parabola open upwards, implying a minimum value at the vertex). The standard form of the quadratic function is y=ax^{2}-2ax+c. To find the relationship between a and c that yields a maximum value of 2, we use the formula for the vertex of a parabola, where the x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -frac{b}{2a}. In this case, b=-2a, so h=frac{-2a}{2a}=-1. The y-coordinate of the vertex, which is the maximum value, is given by substituting x=h into the original equation, leading to y=a(-1)^{2}-2a(-1)+c=c-a. Setting this equal to the maximum value of 2, we have: [c-a=2] To find a specific set of values for a and c, we can choose a value for a and solve for c. Let's choose a=-2 (since we need a to be negative for a maximum): begin{align*} c-(-2) &= 2 c+2 &= 2 c &= 0 end{align*} Therefore, one set of values that satisfies the condition is a=-2 and c=0. However, it's important to note that this answer is not unique; any pair of values satisfying c-a=2 with a<0 will meet the condition. Thus, the answer is encapsulated as boxed{a=-2, c=0} (noting that the answer is not unique)."},{"prompt":"Rectangle PQRS has an area of 4050.

The diagonal of the rectangle, being the distance between foci Q and S, is sqrt{m^2 + n^2} and equals 2sqrt{a^2-b^2}.

Consider the equation: [ n^2 leq 2016 ] Solving for ( n ): [ sqrt{2016} approx 44.9 ] Thus, the largest integer ( n ) such that ( n^2 leq 2016 ) is ( n = 44 ).

Analysis: The sequence {a_n} satisfies the equation (a_{n+1} + a_n = (n+1) cdot cos frac{npi}{2}) (n geqslant 2, n in mathbb{N}^*). We can compute the following: (a_2 + a_3 = 3 cdot cos pi = -3), (a_4 + a_5 = 5 cdot cos 2pi = 5), (a_6 + a_7 = 7 cdot cos 3pi = -7), ... (a_{2016} + a_{2017} = 2017 cdot cos 1008pi = 2017). Thus, (S_{2017} - a_1) = (a_2 + a_3) + (a_4 + a_5) + ... + (a_{2016} + a_{2017}) = -3 + 5 - 7 + 9 - ... + 2017 = 1008. Since S_{2017} + m = 1010, we have a_1 + m = 2. As a_1 cdot m > 0, it implies that a_1 > 0 and m > 0. Now, frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{m} = frac{1}{2}(a_1 + m)(frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{m}) = frac{1}{2}(2 + frac{m}{a_1} + frac{a_1}{m}) geqslant frac{1}{2}(2 + 2sqrt{frac{m}{a_1} cdot frac{a_1}{m}}) = 2. The minimum value of 2 is attained if and only if a_1 = m = 1.

However, since we require ( A ) to score higher on the General round and ( B ) to score higher on the Theme round, a reasonable guess might be ( frac{1}{4} ), since each of the two conditions might independently occur with a probability of approximately 0.5: [ p_{text{guess}} = frac{1}{4} approx 0.25 ] 3. **Estimate the Final Value:** The problem involves scaling up the estimated probability ( p ) by 10,000 and taking the floor of the result: [ P = leftlfloor 10000p rightrfloor ] Using the initial guess ( p = 0.25 ) gives: [ P = leftlfloor 10000 times 0.25 rightrfloor = leftlfloor 2500 rightrfloor ] 4. **Refine the Model:** To improve our estimate, consider a more nuanced model of score distribution.

To prove the lemma, we consider a situation where exchanging any two adjacent digits (when all other digits remain unchanged) results in a number that belongs to the same subset. Let the natural number ( n ) be represented in decimal form as: [ n = overline{a_1 cdots a_{i-1} a_i a_{i+1} a_{i+2} cdots a_m} ] 3. **Constructing Natural Numbers with Subsets:** Now, consider the following natural numbers formed by swapping the ( i )-th and ( (i+1) )-th digits and retaining other digits unchanged: [ begin{array}{l} n' = overline{a_1 cdots a_{i-1} a_{i+1} a_i a_{i+2} cdots a_m}, n'' = overline{a_1 cdots a_{i-1} a_i a_{i+1} cdots a_{i+k} a_{i+k+1} cdots a_m}. end{array} ] 4. **Forming the Natural Number ( k ):** Now, if we form the natural number ( k ) by concatenating the digits of ( n, n', n'' ) from left, center, to right, this implies: [ k = overline{ text{digits of } n, text{ followed by digits of } n', text{ followed by digits of } n'' } ] By systematically eliminating pairs of adjacent digits identical to those in ( n ), we obtain ( n ). 5. **Verifying Condition for General Natural Number:** For any natural number, if two of its digits are identical, we can swap these identical digits to form a number with adjacent duplicate digits, resulting in both numbers belonging to the same subset. 6. **Maximal Number Configuration:** Clearly, each number with up to 10 different digits can be represented in a unique subset. The numbers of length at most 10 where each digit is distinct form an essential representative of each subset. Since there are: [ 2^{10} - 1 = 1023 ] such combinations of digits, which means there are at most 1023 subsets (as each subset must have a representative). 7. **Conclusion on Number of Subsets:** Consequently, given the requirement for 1968 subsets, it is impossible to satisfy the condition because the number of representatives (1023) is less than the required subsets (1968).

From e^{f(ln x)} < xf(1), we get: frac{f(ln x)}{e^{ln x}} < frac{f(1)}{e^1}, which implies g(ln x) < g(1). As g(x) is increasing on (-infty, +infty), we have ln x < 1.

Then: [ S_{a,b} = {n^2 + 2kn + b mid n in mathbb{Z}} ] We can rewrite this as: [ n^2 + 2kn + b = (n+k)^2 + b - k^2 ] Hence, S_{a,b} = S_{0, b - k^2}. - If a is odd, let a = 2k + 1.

If n' - n is not divisible by 2, this equation has no solutions. - If n' - n equiv 2 pmod{4}, letting n' - n = 4u + 2, x - y = 2, and x + y = 2u, we get: [ (x, y) = left(u + 1, u - 1right) ] achieves the pair. - If 4 mid n' - n, letting n' - n = 4u, we can let x - y = 1 and x + y + 1 = 4u, solving as: [ (x, y) = left(2u, 2u - 1right) ] achieves the pair. - If |I_1| geq 3, take three members n, n', and n''.

Suppose it is represented as: [ A = A_0, A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n = B ] 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** We will show by induction that we can find two disjoint paths from (A) to (A_r) for (r le n). **Base Case:** For (r = 1), consider the edge (AA_1). 3. **Base Case Construction:** - Take any vertex (C) distinct from (A) and (A_1). - Use the given condition to find a path from (A_1) to (C) that does not go through (A). - Again, use the given condition to find a path from (C) to (A) that does not go through (A_1). - Combining these paths gives a path (p) from (A) to (A_1) which does not involve the edge (AA_1). - Therefore, path (p) and the direct edge path (AA_1) are indeed two disjoint paths from (A) to (A_1). 4. **Induction Step:** Assume that for some (r), we have two disjoint paths from (A) to (A_r): [ A, B_1, B_2, ldots, B_s, A_r quad text{and} quad A, B_t, B_{t-1}, ldots, B_{s+1}, A_r ] Now, we want to find two disjoint paths from (A) to (A_{r+1}). 5. **Path Consideration:** - Take a path from (A) to (A_{r+1}) that does not go through (A_r). - If this path avoids all vertices (B_1, ldots, B_t), then this path and the path (A to B_1 to B_2 to ldots to B_s to A_r to A_{r+1}) are disjoint. - If not, let (B_i) be the first vertex among (B_1, ldots, B_t) that the new path intersects as we move from (A_{r+1}) to (A). 6. **Disjoint Path Construction:** Based on whether (i leq s) or (i > s): - If (i leq s): [ text{Paths are:} quad A to B_1 to B_2 to ldots to B_i to text{(new path)} to A_{r+1} ] [ text{and} quad A to B_t to B_{(t-1)} to ldots to A_r to A_{r+1} ] - If (i > s): [ text{Paths are:} quad A to B_t to B_{(t-1)} to ldots to B_i to text{(new path)} to A_{r+1} ] [ text{and} quad A to B_1 to B_2 to ldots to B_s to A_r to A_{r+1} ] Conclusion: By continuing this induction step iteratively, we conclude that we can always find two disjoint paths from (A) to (B) in the graph. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The coordinates of the unit vector of the space vector overrightarrow{a}=(2,2,1) are ____.","completion":"To find the coordinates of the unit vector of the space vector overrightarrow{a}=(2,2,-1), we first calculate the magnitude of overrightarrow{a}, denoted as |overrightarrow{a}|.

To proceed, we will do the following steps: 1. **Assume (ABCD) is inscribed in a circle:** By the property of inscribed angles, the arcs subtended by the segments (AC) and (BD) can be considered. 2. **Analysis of the arcs:** Without loss of generality, let's assume the arcs (ABC) and (BCD) do not exceed a semicircle. This assumption merely simplifies the consideration without altering the result. 3. **Relation between arcs and segments:** Since it is easier to work with the arcs and their relations: [ AD + BC > AB + CD ] This simplifies our calculation to understand the segments: [ AC = AB + BC quad text{and} quad BD = BC + CD ] 4. **Transforming inequality to segments comparison:** Let’s consider the inequality: [ AC > BD ] Given our transformations above: [ AB + BC > BC + CD ] Simplifying this, we get: [ AB > CD ] Through multiplication and rephrasing our inequality: [ (AD - BC)(AB - CD) > 0 ] Thus, we have: - If ( AC > BD ), then (AB > CD) and (AD > BC), hence ((AD - BC) > 0) and ((AB - CD) > 0). - If ( AC < BD ), then (AB < CD) and (AD < BC), hence ((AD - BC) < 0) and ((AB - CD) < 0). Therefore: - For (AC > BD), both ((AD - BC)) and ((AB - CD)) must be either both positive or both negative, which requires that: [ (AD - BC)(AB - CD) > 0 ] - Conversely, if ((AD - BC)(AB - CD) > 0), then either both (AD > BC) and (AB > CD) or both (AD < BC) and (AB < CD), leading to (AC > BD).

Let's start by proving the intermediary lemma: In a 5 times 5 chessboard, if 4 squares are removed randomly, at least 15 remaining squares are connected to each other. 2. Proof of the lemma: - Consider a 5 times 5 chessboard and remove any 4 squares from it. - There are at least 1 row and 1 column where none of the squares have been removed. - If an entire row or column is intact, the proof is straightforward since all the squares are connected. - If 1 row and 1 column each have one square removed, then at least 15 squares are connected because: - There are 4 rows and 4 columns each with one removed square. - This ensures that each removed square is in a different row and column. - Thus, the remaining squares in these rows and columns can be connected such that 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 squares are still interconnected. 3. Returning to the original problem: - We need to divide the 10 times 10 chessboard into 25 smaller 2 times 2 squares. - There are 25 such 2 times 2 squares, and within each 2 times 2 square, we can consider it as a single large square and color it according to the chessboard pattern. - Assume we mark 46 squares with \\"stars\\". Each marked square belongs to one of the 2 times 2 squares. - Each 2 times 2 square can contain at most 2 marked squares to ensure they are not adjacent. 4. Since there are 46 marked squares and each small square (large cell) can have at most 2 stars: - Therefore, at least ( lceil frac{46}{2} rceil = 23 ) large squares will contain exactly 2 marked squares. 5. By the lemma, of these 23 large squares, at least 15 of them will be interconnected in the 10 times 10 board. 6. Each interconnected large square implies that we have pairs of marked squares in the same color (since each large square is 2 times 2, it maintains the chessboard coloring). 7. Therefore, these 15 large squares correspond to 30 marked squares being of the same color because each large square has the same pattern and within each, the colors are consistent. # Conclusion: Hence, in any configuration of 46 non-adjacent marked squares on a 10 times 10 chessboard, at least 30 of these squares must be of the same color. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"With a single straight cut, remove from the triangle a trapezoid whose smaller base is equal to the sum of the legs.","completion":"1. **Identify the Point of Intersection:** Let O be the point of intersection of the angle bisectors of triangle ABC.

Let this line intersect sides AB and AC of the triangle at points X and Y, respectively. 3. **Prove Isosceles Triangle Property for triangle BOX:** Since O is the incenter, it is equidistant from all the sides, and each of the angles at O are bisected. - For triangle BOX, since the line through O is parallel to BC and intersects AB at X, angle BOX = angle OBC. - Similarly, angle OXB = angle OCB since the lines parallel to BC by the alternate interior angles theorem.

Thus, {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -1. Thus, a_{16} - a_5 = (a_{16} - a_{15}) + (a_{15} - a_{14}) + dots + (a_6 - a_5) = b_{15} + b_{14} + dots + b_5. Since {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence, we have b_{15} + b_{14} + dots + b_5 = frac{11}{2} (b_{15} + b_5) = 11 cdot b_{10} = 0. Hence, a_{16} - a_5 = boxed{0}.

We require that a_{2n+3} < a_{2n+1} Leftrightarrow 2^{2n+1} - 2^{31-2n} < 0 Leftrightarrow n < 7.5 and a_{2n+3} > a_{2n+1} Leftrightarrow 2^{2n+1} - 2^{31-2n} > 0 Leftrightarrow n > 7.5. This implies a_3 > a_5 > dots > a_{15} > a_{17} < a_{19} < dots. Therefore, within the sequence {a_{2n+1}}, a_{17} is the smallest value, corresponding to the 8th term. Additionally, using another approach, we have b_n = (-1)^n (2^n + 2^{33-n}) = (-2)^n + 2^{33} left(- frac{1}{2} right)^n. Therefore, a_{2n+1} = a_1 + b_1 + b_2 + dots + b_{2n} = 1 + left[ (-2) frac{1 - (-2)^{2n}}{3} + 2^{32} frac{1 - left(- frac{1}{2} right)^{2n}}{1 + frac{1}{2}} right] = frac{1}{3} left[ 1 - 2^{33} + left( 2^{2n+1} + 2^{33-2n} right) right] geq frac{1}{3} left[ 1 - 2^{33} + 2 sqrt{2^{34}} right] (equality holds when 2^{2n+1} = 2^{33-2n}, i.e., when n=8). So, the smallest term in the sequence {a_{2n+1}} is the 8th term. (3) If the sequence {a_n} is arithmetic with common difference d, then c_{n+1} - c_n = (a_{n+1} - a_n) + 2(a_{n+2} - a_{n+1}) = d + 2d = 3d, which is constant. Thus, {c_n} is an arithmetic sequence. Since b_n = a_{n+1} - a_n = d for all n, we have that b_n leq b_{n+1} for all n. Conversely, if {c_n} is an arithmetic sequence with common difference D, and if b_n leq b_{n+1} for all n, then c_{n+1} - c_n = b_n + 2b_{n+1} = D for all n. Moreover, b_{n+1} + 2b_{n+2} = D. Hence, (b_{n+1} - b_n) + 2(b_{n+2} - b_{n+1}) = 0, and since b_{n+1} - b_n geq 0 and b_{n+2} - b_{n+1} geq 0, we must have b_{n+1} - b_n = b_{n+2} - b_{n+1} = 0 for all n. Therefore, b_{n+1} = b_n for all n, implying that b_n = b_1 and a_{n+1} - a_n = b_1 is constant. Thus, the sequence {a_n} is arithmetic.

Since cos C neq 0 (because angle C is obtuse and frac{pi}{2} < C < pi), we can divide both sides of the equation by cos C to find: 2sin C = sqrt{3} implies sin C = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Given that angle C is in the second quadrant (where sine is positive), the only value that satisfies this condition is: C = frac{2pi}{3}. So, we have boxed{C = frac{2pi}{3}} as the value of angle C. **Part (2): Finding the perimeter of triangle ABC** Given that the area of triangle ABC is 6sqrt{3} and b=6, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, Area = frac{1}{2}absin C, to find side a: 6sqrt{3} = frac{1}{2} cdot a cdot 6 cdot sinleft(frac{2pi}{3}right).

We can calculate T1 using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time 0.35D = 35 mph × T1 T1 = 0.35D / 35 mph For the remaining 65% of the trip, the car traveled at an average speed of V mph. Let's call the time taken for this part of the trip T2. The distance covered in this part is 0.65D. We can calculate T2 using the formula: 0.65D = V mph × T2 T2 = 0.65D / V The average speed for the entire trip is given as 50 mph. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. The total time is T1 + T2.

First, let's simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by the denominators to get rid of the fractions: 50 mph × ((0.35D / 35 mph) + (0.65D / V)) = D Now, distribute the 50 mph: (50 mph × 0.35D / 35 mph) + (50 mph × 0.65D / V) = D Simplify the first term (since mph cancels out): (50 × 0.35D / 35) + (50 × 0.65D / V) = D (1.75D / 35) + (32.5D / V) = D Now, divide 1.75D by 35: (0.05D) + (32.5D / V) = D Now, we want to isolate the term with V: 32.5D / V = D - 0.05D 32.5D / V = 0.95D Now, divide both sides by 0.95D: 32.5 / V = 1 Now, multiply both sides by V to solve for V: 32.5 = V So, the average speed V for the remaining part of the trip is boxed{32.5} mph."},{"prompt":"the coordinate plane, the points A(1, 3), B(1, 9), C(6, 8), and E(5, 1) are given.

We have: [ ((p circ q) circ f)(x) = p(q(f(x))) ] - Knowing that q circ f = f circ q, we can substitute: [ p(q(f(x))) = p(f(q(x))) ] - Now, we use the fact that p circ f = f circ p, giving us: [ p(f(q(x))) = f(p(q(x))) ] - Finally, this shows that: [ (p circ q) circ f = f circ (p circ q) ] Therefore, p circ q commutes with f. 3. **Degree Analysis**: - Let the degree of p(x) be n and the degree of q(x) be m. - Both p circ q and q circ p are polynomials of degree nm. - We must determine the unique k-degree polynomial r(x) that commutes with f(x). 4. **Finding r(x)**: - Assume r(x) of the form: [ r(x) = r_k x^k + r_{k-1} x^{k-1} + cdots + r_1 x + r_0 ] where r_k neq 0. - Let f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c with a neq 0. - Since r commutes with f, we have: [ a (r_k x^k + r_{k-1} x^{k-1} + cdots + r_0)^2 + b (r_k x^k + r_{k-1} x^{k-1} + cdots + r_0) + c = r_k (ax^2 + bx + c)^k + cdots + r_0 ] 5. **Coefficient Comparison**: - Compare the coefficients of x^{2k} on both sides: [ a r_k^2 = r_k a^k ] - Solving for r_k gives: [ r_k = a^{k-1} ] - If coefficients r_k, r_{k-1}, ldots, r_{k-i} are determined, then r_{k-i-1} can be found by comparing x^{2k-i-1} coefficients.

Label these lines in the order they are met during the rotation as ell_1, ell_2,ldots, ell_{2n}. - There must be some (k in {1, 2, ldots, 2n-1}) such that ell_k and ell_{k+1} are lines of different colors (one blue and one red). 2. **Establishing Coordinates**: - Set up a coordinate system with (P) as the origin. - Consider the two angular bisectors of the angle between ell_k and ell_{k+1}. Let one of these bisectors be the X-axis, and the other bisector be the Y-axis. - Note that there is no (i = 1, 2, ldots, 2n) such that (angle(X, ell_i)) lies between (angle(X, ell_k)) and (angle(X, ell_{k+1})). 3. **Constructing a Rectangle**: - Consider the set (S) of all intersection points formed by the 2n lines. This set (S) is finite. - Construct a rectangle (R) with two opposite vertices lying on (ell_k) and (ell_{k+1}), ensuring this rectangle contains all points of (S) in its interior. - Ensure the sides of (R) are parallel to the X- and Y-axes, representing it as a part of the four lines: (x = pm a) and (y = pm b), where (a, b > 0). 4. **Identifying the Circle**: - Consider a circle (mathcal{C}) that is tangent to the sides (x = a) and also tangent to the lines (ell_k) and (ell_{k+1}). - Since (mathcal{C}) is tangent to both (ell_k) (blue) and (ell_{k+1}) (red), we must confirm (mathcal{C}) intersects each remaining (2n-2) lines exactly twice. 5. **Intersection with Remaining Lines**: - For any line (L) among the remaining (2n-2) lines, let the intersections with (ell_k) and (ell_{k+1}) be (M) and (N) respectively, with (M) and (N) within (R). - Analyze two cases: 1. (L) intersects (R) on the sides (x = -a) and (x = a). 2. (L) intersects (R) on the sides (y = -b) and (y = b). This case contradicts the earlier setup involving angles. - Thus, (L) intersects (mathcal{C}) in exactly two points due to the first case. 6. **Conclusion**: - Hence, (mathcal{C}) intersects exactly (2n-1) points on the blue lines and (2n-1) points on the red lines, fulfilling the desired condition.

For the third ride, the passenger must choose a different car from the first two rides, so there are 2 possibilities.

A subset B subset mathbb{R} is called a basis for M subset mathbb{R} if each number in M can be uniquely represented as a product of integral powers of numbers from B. Let's denote a subset S of positive numbers as a superseded basis for M if every number in M can be represented as a product: [ alpha_1^{i_1} alpha_2^{i_2} ldots alpha_m^{i_m}, ] where alpha_1, ldots, alpha_m in S and i_1, ldots, i_m in mathbf{Z}. For example, the set M itself is a superseded basis for M. 2. **Selection of a Minimal Superseded Basis**: Among all superseded bases for M, choose the set: [ S_0 = {beta_1, beta_2, ldots, beta_n} ] containing the minimal number of elements. 3. **Proof by Contradiction**: Assume n geq 2 and that S_0 is a superseded basis but not a basis for M. Suppose some element u in M allows different representations in the form of products of integral powers of elements from S_0: [ u = beta_1^{i_1} beta_2^{i_2} ldots beta_n^{i_n} = beta_1^{j_1} beta_2^{j_2} ldots beta_n^{j_n}. ] This implies: [ beta_1^{k_1} beta_2^{k_2} ldots beta_n^{k_n} = 1, ] where k_l = i_l - j_l are integers not all zeros.

Therefore, S_0 must indeed be a basis for M. 5. **Single Element Case**: Finally, if S_0 includes exactly one non-trivial element beta neq 1, it also forms a basis for M, as the equality beta^i = beta^j is impossible for distinct integers i neq j. 6. **Single Element Set**: If S_0 = {1} is a superseded basis for M, then M = {1}. The smallest possible set S_1 = {2} forms the necessary basis for M. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the existence of a basis for any finite set M of positive numbers.

Therefore, (B) is the midpoint of segment (AA'). 2. **Distance Relations:** Since (B) is the midpoint of (AA'), we have (AA' = 2 times AB). 3. **Menelaus' Theorem:** Apply Menelaus' theorem to triangle (CAA') with the transversal (E'BD). By Menelaus' theorem: [ frac{CD}{DA} cdot frac{AA'}{A'B} cdot frac{BE'}{E'C} = 1 ] Substituting given and derived values: - (AA' = 2 times AB) implies ( frac{AA'}{A'B} = 2). - (BE' = BE) and since (E') is the reflection of (E) across (BD), we have (E'B = BE = 5).

Since the eccentricity of C_1 is known to be frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we have frac{a^{2}-4}{a^{2}}=frac{3}{4}. Solving for a, we get a^{2}=16.

It is associative; 2. ( ab = ac ) implies ( b = c ); 3. ( ba = ca ) implies ( b = c ); 4. For each element, the set of its powers is finite. Is ( S ) necessarily a group?","completion":"1. **Given Conditions Recap:** We are given a non-empty set ( S ) with a binary operation (cdot) such that: - It is associative: ( (ab)c = a(bc) ) for all ( a, b, c in S ). - Cancellation laws hold: ( ab = ac Rightarrow b = c ) and ( ba = ca Rightarrow b = c ) for all ( a, b, c in S ). - For each element ( a in S ), the set of its powers ({ a^n : n in mathbb{N} }) is finite. 2. **Finite Powers Condition:** Let ( a in S ) be any element. Because the set of powers of ( a ) is finite, there exist ( r ) and ( s ) such that ( r > s ) and [ a^r = a^s. ] Suppose ( s = 1 ). Then we have ( a^r = a ), and let's denote ( n = r ), which is greater than 1, fulfilling our need that ( a^n = a ) for some ( n > 1 ). 3. **Case of ( s neq 1 ):** If ( s neq 1 ), let's put ( b = a^{s-1} ). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation ( a^r = a^s ) as follows: [ a^{r-s+1} = a. ] By substituting ( b = a^{s-1} ), we have: [ b a^{r-s+1} = b a. ] By cancellation (since ( b = a^{s-1} ) is non-empty): [ a^{r-s+1} = a ] Define ( n = r - s + 1 ), which is greater than 1. Hence, we have: [ a^n = a. ] 4. **Define an Identity Element:** Define ( e = a^{n-1} ). Then: [ ea = a^{n-1}a = a^n = a text{ and similarly, } ] [ ae = a a^{n-1} = a^n = a. ] Thus, ( e ) acts as an identity element when multiplied by ( a ). 5. **Identity and Inverse:** To show ( e ) behaves as an identity for any ( b in S ): [ a(eb) = (ae)b = ab, text{ and by cancellation, } ] [ eb = b. ] Similarly, for the other identity condition: [ (be)a = b(ea) = ba, text{ and by cancellation, } ] [ be = b. ] Hence, ( e ) is an identity element in ( S ). 6. **Inverse Element:** If ( n - 1 = 1 ), then ( a = e ), making ( a ) itself its inverse. If ( n - 1 > 1 ), let ( a^{n-2} ) be the inverse of ( a ): [ a^{n-2} a = a a^{n-2} = e. ] 7. **Uniqueness of Identity:** For any other element ( b in S ), a similar argument shows another identity (let's call it ( f )) and an element ( c ) such that ( cb = bc = f ). Since identities are unique, we have: [ e = ef = f, ] confirming the identity ( e ) is unique and ( c ) is the inverse of ( b ). 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, ( S ) satisfies all the group axioms (associativity, identity, and inverses) and we conclude that ( S ) is necessarily a group.

The reason for this error is that the mixed fraction was not correctly converted to an improper fraction before simplifying. This is a common mistake when dealing with square roots and fractions together. It's crucial to always convert mixed numbers to improper fractions to simplify correctly. **Task 2: Correct Calculation Process** Let's correct the calculation step by step: 1. Start with the original expression and expand the square: [ ({sqrt{2}+1})^2 - sqrt{4frac{1}{2}} = 2 + 2sqrt{2} + 1 - sqrt{9/2} ] This step correctly expands the square and converts the mixed number into an improper fraction. 2. Simplify the expression: [ = 3 + 2sqrt{2} - sqrt{9/2} ] Here, we combine the like terms (2 + 1) and leave the square root terms as they are. 3. Further simplify the square root: [ = 3 + 2sqrt{2} - frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} ] We recognize that sqrt{9/2} simplifies to frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} by simplifying inside the square root. 4. Combine like terms: [ = 3 + frac{4sqrt{2}}{2} - frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} ] Here, we express 2sqrt{2} as frac{4sqrt{2}}{2} to combine it with the other square root term. 5.

This means that the difference between strawberries and blueberries after the exchange is 100 more than the difference before the exchange. If we let D be the original difference between the total number of strawberries and blueberries, then after the exchange, the difference would be D + 100. This can be represented by the equation: D + 100 = (D + S) - (B - B) (2) Since we are disposing of one blue box and adding one red box, the B from the blue box is subtracted and the S from the red box is added to the difference.

Suppose that P has a double complex root. Show that P has a rational root.","completion":"1. **Identification of the Double Root:** Let ( z ) be a double root of the polynomial ( P ). Since ( z ) is a double root, it means that both ( z ) and its conjugate ( overline{z} ) (if ( z ) is not real) are roots with multiplicity at least 2. 2. **Minimal Polynomial and its Properties:** Define ( Q ) as the minimal polynomial of ( z ). Since ( P ) has rational coefficients, the minimal polynomial ( Q ) of any complex root will also have rational coefficients, and its degree will either be 1 or 2. Given that ( z ) is a double root, ( Q ) must divide ( P ). Specifically, ( Q ) must have the property ( Q(z) = 0 ) and since ( z ) is a root with multiplicity 2, ( Q ) must divide ( P ) such that ( z ) also satisfies the double root condition in the polynomial ( P ). Thus, ( Q mid P ) and we can write ( P = Q R ), where ( R ) is another polynomial with rational coefficients. 3. **Degree Analysis and Division:** Since ( Q ) has simple roots (i.e., roots of multiplicity 1), ( z ) must also be a root of ( R ). This implies that ( Q ) divides ( R ). Therefore, we can infer that ( Q^2 ) divides ( P ). 4. **Degree Constraints:** The degree of ( P ) is given to be 5. Letting ( operatorname{deg}(Q) = d ), we understand that ( operatorname{deg}(Q^2) = 2d ) and since ( Q^2 mid P ), we get: [ operatorname{deg}(P) geq 2 operatorname{deg}(Q) ] Given ( operatorname{deg}(P) = 5 ), we have: [ 5 geq 2 operatorname{deg}(Q) implies operatorname{deg}(Q) leq frac{5}{2} implies operatorname{deg}(Q) = 1 text{ or } 2 ] 5. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1:** ( operatorname{deg}(Q) = 1 ) - In this scenario, ( Q(x) ) is a linear polynomial with rational coefficients. Therefore, ( z ), which is a root of ( Q(x) ), must be rational. - **Case 2:** ( operatorname{deg}(Q) = 2 ) - Here, ( Q(x) ) is a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients. Given that ( P = Q^2 S ) for some polynomial ( S ) and since ( operatorname{deg}(P) = 5 ), it follows that: [ operatorname{deg}(P) = operatorname{deg}(Q^2 S) = 2 cdot 2 + operatorname{deg}(S) implies 5 = 4 + operatorname{deg}(S) implies operatorname{deg}(S) = 1 ] - Thus, ( S ) is a first-degree polynomial (linear), which can be written as ( S(x) = a x + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are rational numbers and ( a neq 0 ). A linear polynomial ( S(x) ) always has one rational root, given by ( -frac{b}{a} ). 6. **Conclusion:** In both cases, we find that ( P ) has a rational root either directly from ( Q ) in the first case or from ( S ) in the second. Hence, we conclude that ( P ) possesses a rational root.

Each year, the company closes one route between two islands ( X ) and ( Y ) while ensuring that for any island directly connected to either ( X ) or ( Y ), a new route between this island and another island (other than ( X ) or ( Y )) is established. We need to prove that after some years, there will be one island connected directly to all other islands. Let's proceed step-by-step. 1. **Understanding the closure of routes and opening of new ones:** - Each year, the company closes one route between two islands ( X ) and ( Y ) and opens new routes as described. Over time, the number of routes changes dynamically. 2. **Invariant Observation:** - Initially, the graph representing the islands and routes is connected, i.e., there are no two subsets of islands completely disconnected from each other by the routes. 3. **Yearly Adjustments:** - When a route between ( X ) and ( Y ) is closed, new routes are opened for all islands directly connected to ( X ) or ( Y ), ensuring the overall structure remains such that there is still a connected path between any two islands. 4. **Illustration Through Inductive Process:** - **Base Case (Initial State):** - At the beginning, the condition is satisfied as given in the problem – the graph is connected. - **Inductive Step:** - Assume that after some years, say ( k ), every island remains within one connected component. - In year ( k+1 ), a route between ( X ) and ( Y ) is closed. By the problem’s stipulation, new routes are opened such that all islands directly connected to either ( X ) or ( Y ) before closure get new routes to other islands. This ensures that no new isolated subgraphs are formed even after route closure and new routes establishment. 5. **Accumulated Connectivity:** - Each new route opening mechanism indirectly links more islands together over time, reinforcing the connectivity among the islands remaining in the network graph. 6. **Resulting Configuration After Sufficient Time:** - Eventually, the process will guarantee one island will get connected to all other islands through this persistent connectivity expansion. Specifically, there exists one island which will get involved in multiple new route formations directly, enhancing its connections progressively over the years. # Conclusion: After going through the process and ensuring the invariants are met yearly, we conclude that it leads to the formation of one island directly connected to all other islands.

Note that f(a) is a linear function of a, so further transform it into f(-1) > 3 and f(1) > 3, and then find the range of values for t. **Solution** Given the sequence {a_n} satisfies a_1 = 3, n(a_{n+1} - a_n) = a_n + 1 (n in mathbb{N}) Rightarrow a_{n+1} = frac{n+1}{n}a_n + frac{1}{n} (n in mathbb{N}), we can find a_2 = 7, a_3 = 11, a_4 = 15, ldots From this, we guess that a_n = 4n - 1.

To do this, we can provide a counterexample. 1. **Constructing the Counterexample:** Let us consider a country with 200 cities and 8 airlines. We will split the cities into 8 groups, each containing 25 cities. Label these groups as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. 2. **Assigning Flights Within Groups:** Let's have airline 1 manage the flights within each group. That is, airline 1 connects every city within a single group. Therefore, within each group, there exist binom{25}{2} flights, and airline 1 covers all cities in a single group. 3. **Assigning Flights Between Groups:** Next, we'll balance the remaining airlines to ensure cities from different groups are connected by flights from different airlines.

Hence, point ( A_1 ) is equidistant from the sides ( AC ) and ( AB ). 2. **Angle Bisector and its Properties**: - Notice that ( A_1 ) is equidistant from ( BB_1 ) and ( BK ), where ( BK ) is obtained by extending ( AB ). - Since ( B_1 ) is on the angle bisector of ( angle B ), it implies that ( A_1 ) lies on the bisector of ( angle BB_1C ). 3. **Perpendicular Intersection Analysis**: - Since ( A_1 ) lies on the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ) (or ( angle CAA_1 )), it implies ( A_1 ) is equidistant from ( AC ) and ( AB ). This means ( A_1 ) also lies on the angle bisector of ( angle BB_1C ). - Analogously, it can be shown that ( B_1 C_1 ) is the angle bisector of ( angle ABB_1 ). - Consequently, ( angle C_{1} B_{1} A_{1} = 90^circ ), since it is the angle between the bisectors of supplementary angles. 4. **Identification of the Intersection Angle**: - In ( triangle BB_1C_1M ), point ( M ) is the intersection of the bisectors ( B_1A_1 ) and ( CC_1 ). - As ( B_1A_1 ) is the angle bisector of ( angle BB_1C_1 ), and given that ( angle B = 120^circ ), resulting in ( angle BB_1M = angle MB_1C = 30^circ ). 5. **Calculation Using Geometric Properties**: - With the sum of angles, compute ( angle ABM ): [ angle ABM = angle C_{1}BB_{1} + angle B_{1}BM = 60^circ + 30^circ = 90^circ ] - Since ( angle ABM = 90^circ ), quadrilateral ( BB_1MC_1 ) is cyclic, allowing us to state: [ angle B_{1} M C_{1} = angle B_{1} B C_{1} = 60^circ ] Thus, we conclude that (angle B_1 C_1 M = 60^circ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{60^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"One ton has 2500 pounds, and one pound has some ounces. 2000 packets containing wheat weighing 16 pounds and 4 ounces each would totally fill a gunny bag of capacity 13 tons.

Since each packet weighs 16 pounds and 4 ounces, we need to convert the ounces to pounds to add it to the total weight in pounds. Let's assume there are x ounces in one pound.

Since z is outside and all these C_{i} lie inside the polygon on the opposite side of the line, the vectors z - C_{i} all lie in one half-plane. 4. **Consider inverses frac{1}{z - C_{i}}:** Because inverses of vectors frac{1}{z - C_{i}} represent complex conjugations scaled by their modulus squared: frac{1}{mathbf{w}} = frac{overline{mathbf{w}}}{|mathbf{w}|^2}. Since all vectors z - C_{i} are in the same half-plane, their conjugates overline{z - C_{i}} also lie in a certain configuration related to their half-plane. 5. **Sum of inverses:** Adding the vectors frac{1}{z - C_{1}}, frac{1}{z - C_{2}}, ..., frac{1}{z - C_{n}} that lie in the same half-plane should result in a non-zero complex number since they all have directional components that keep them away from summing to zero: frac{1}{z - C_{1}} + frac{1}{z - C_{2}} + ldots + frac{1}{z - C_{n}} neq 0. 6. **Contradiction:** This non-zero result contradicts the given equation: frac{1}{z - C_{1}} + frac{1}{z - C_{2}} + ldots + frac{1}{z - C_{n}} = 0. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, our assumption that z lies outside the polygon is incorrect.

The symmetric point can be found by considering the distance from the point (6,5) to the axis of symmetry x=h. This distance is 6-h.

Assume that the angles of the triangle are such that alpha leq beta leq gamma. Recall that alpha, beta, and gamma form the angles of a triangle, so alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ. 2.

Substitute this value of gamma into the given equation: [ cos 3alpha + cos 3beta + cos (180^circ - 3(alpha + beta)) = 1 ] 4. Use the trigonometric identity for the cosine of the supplementary angle, cos(180^circ - x) = -cos x, to simplify: [ cos 3alpha + cos 3beta + cos (3gamma) = 1 implies cos 3alpha + cos 3beta - cos (3alpha + 3beta) = 1 ] 5. Now use the sum-to-product identities. For cos x + cos y we have: [ cos 3alpha + cos 3beta = 2 cos left(frac{3alpha + 3beta}{2}right) cos left(frac{3alpha - 3beta}{2}right) ] 6.

One possible solution is: [ cos left(frac{3alpha + 3beta}{2}right) = 0 ] 11. Given the cosine function equals zero at odd multiples of 90^circ: [ frac{3alpha + 3beta}{2} = 90^circ implies 3alpha + 3beta = 180^circ implies alpha + beta = 60^circ ] 12.

For any k such that 2 leq k leq M, we can write: [ k cdot M = k cdot (10^n - 1) = k cdot 10^n - k. ] This can be rewritten as: [ k cdot 10^n - k = (k - 1) cdot 10^n + (10^n - 1). ] Therefore, the digits of (k cdot M) are a permutation of the digits of (M), implying (S(M cdot k) = S(M)). 4. **Proving the necessity of M = 10^n - 1:** Suppose we have M with n digits where the first digit is d. We can write: [ M = d cdot 10^{n-1} + m, ] where m is the rest of the digits. The sum of the digits is given by: [ S(M) = d + S(m). ] Let’s choose (k = 10^{n-1} + 1).

Next, let's divide the original equation by 5b to explore another proportion: [frac{2a}{5b} = frac{5b}{5b}] This simplifies to: [frac{2a}{5b} = 1] However, this does not directly match any of the given options. Now, let's divide the original equation by 5, aiming to match options involving frac{a}{5}: [frac{2a}{5} = b] Rearranging this equation gives us: [frac{a}{5} = frac{b}{2}] This matches option C directly, indicating that frac{a}{5} = frac{b}{2} is a correct proportion based on the given 2a=5b. Lastly, for completeness, let's consider dividing the original equation by 2a to see if it aligns with any option: [frac{5b}{2a} = 1] This approach does not yield a direct match to the remaining options.

Thus, we have: [ z = frac{2+i}{1 + (-1) + i} = frac{2+i}{i} ] Next, we simplify the fraction: - To simplify frac{2+i}{i}, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is -i in this case, to get rid of the imaginary unit in the denominator. This gives us: [ z = frac{2+i}{i} cdot frac{-i}{-i} = frac{(2+i)(-i)}{i(-i)} = frac{-2i + i^2}{-i^2} = frac{-2i - 1}{1} = -1 - 2i ] However, we are looking for overline{z}, the conjugate of z.

Correcting the steps, we should have: - The correct simplification of frac{2+i}{i} directly leads to understanding how real and imaginary parts interact when divided by i. Dividing by i is equivalent to multiplying by -i (since i cdot -i = 1), which gives us z = 2(-i) + 1 = -2i + 1. Thus, the correct conjugate of z, overline{z}, is indeed 1 + 2i.

We are given an (8 times 8) chessboard, through some centers of the cells of which a closed, non-self-intersecting broken line is conducted. Each segment of the broken line connects the centers of adjacent cells either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. To prove that within the bounded part of the board delimited by this broken line, the total area of the black pieces is equal to the total area of the white pieces, let us proceed as follows: 2. Let's draw dotted vertical and horizontal lines through the centers of the cells of the chessboard. This grid will help us visualize how the broken line intersects the board. 3. On the resulting dotted grid, each segment of our broken line connects nodes that are adjacent either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Therefore, the dotted lines break the area bounded by the broken line into unit squares and half-squares (triangles), which are obtained by cutting the unit squares along their diagonals. 4. We need to note that in each such square and each such triangular area, the black and white parts have equal areas due to the nature of the chessboard's alternating color pattern. 5. Indeed, each square contains two quarters of cells of both colors, resulting in each square having equal areas of black and white. 6. Each triangle contains: - One quarter of a cell of one color. - Two smaller triangles, each constituting one-eighth of a cell of the other color. 7. The detailed calculation of the areas shows this balance. For instance: - In a square, let us divide each cell into four parts. We obtain two parts of black and two parts of white, maintaining an equal area of ( frac{1}{2} text{ black and } frac{1}{2} text{ white} ) within each unit. 8. Similarly, given the symmetry and regular repeating nature of the segments (either cutting directly through centers or diagonally), each triangular area will effectively divide the regions into equal half parts of black and white cells. 9. Thus, considering the entire bounded area formed by our closed broken line, the total summed areas of all the black regions and all the white regions will be equal. # Conclusion Therefore, the total area of the black pieces within the bounded region is equal to the total area of the white pieces within that region.

With her new reading speed of 15 pages per hour, let's find out how many hours she needs to finish the remaining pages: 105 pages / 15 pages per hour = 7 hours. Since she has 3.5 days left in the week (7 days in a week - 3.5 days already passed), we can calculate the number of hours she needs to read per day: 7 hours / 3.5 days = 2 hours per day. Jessy was initially reading for 1 hour per day, so the extra time she needs to read per day is: 2 hours per day (new plan) - 1 hour per day (initial plan) = 1 hour per day. Since she needs to read an extra hour per day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Jessy should read an extra: 1 hour per day * 60 minutes per hour = 60 minutes per day.

The operation involves choosing two identical numbers ( a ) and replacing them with ( a + p ) and ( a + q ).

We are given that ( y ) is a positive integer written only with the digit ( 1 ) in base ( 9 ).

In base ( 9 ), the number ( 111ldots1_9 ) (with ( k ) digits) can be expressed in decimal (base ( 10 )) as: [ y = 1 cdot 9^{k-1} + 1 cdot 9^{k-2} + cdots + 1 cdot 9^0 ] This is a geometric series with the first term ( a = 1 ) and common ratio ( r = 9 ). 3.

Define: - ( x ) as the removed digit, - ( a ) as the part of the number on the left of ( x ), - ( c ) as the part of the number on the right of ( x ). So, the number can be represented as ( overline{axc} ). Step 2: Representation Based on Position Let the digit ( x ) occupy the ( (n+1) )-th position from the right. Therefore, the original number can be expressed as: [ overline{axc} = a cdot 10^{n+1} + x cdot 10^n + c ] Removing the digit ( x ) results in the number: [ overline{ac} = a cdot 10^n + c ] Step 3: Ratio of Numbers Consider the ratio ( r ) of the original number to the number after removing ( x ): [ r = frac{a cdot 10^{n+1} + x cdot 10^n + c}{a cdot 10^n + c} ] where ( c < 10^n ).

We know: [ r = frac{x cdot 10^n - 9c}{a cdot 10^n + c} + 10 ] By observing that ( frac{x cdot 10^n - 9c}{a cdot 10^n + c} leq frac{x}{a} leq frac{9}{a} leq 9 ), we conclude: [ -8 leq l leq 9 ] Step 6: Splitting into Cases We consider two cases based on the sign of ( l ): 1. **Case 1: ( l > 0 )** - From the equation ( (x - la) cdot 10^n = (l+9)c ), it follows ( x - la > 0 ), thus: [ a leq frac{x}{l} leq frac{9}{l} leq 9 ] 2. **Case 2: ( l < 0 )** - From the equation ( (x - la) cdot 10^n = (l+9)c ), it follows ( x - la = frac{(l+9)c}{10^n} ): [ x - la < frac{9 cdot 10^n}{10^n} = 9 ] Therefore, ( -la < 9 ) implying ( a < 9 ). By the lemma, ( a ) must be a single digit and the number ( overline{axc} ) must consist of ( n+2 ) digits. Step 7: Examine the Decomposition The number ( c ) cannot end in zero. So, it follows the decomposition: 1. **If ( c ) does not contain the factor 2:** - The right part of the equation ( (x - 7a) cdot 5^4 = c ) - Possible values: - ( a = 1 ) - If ( x = 8 ): [ c = 625 implies overline{axc} = 180625 ] 2. **If ( c ) does not contain the factor 5:** - The decomposition would yield ( l + 9 = 16 ), but any further analysis will show inconsistencies given the constraints on ( n ).

A drawn diagonal is called good if it intersects exactly one other drawn diagonal at its interior points. Find the maximum possible number of good diagonals.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a convex n-gon and need to determine the maximum number of \\"good\\" diagonals. A diagonal is defined as \\"good\\" if it intersects exactly one other diagonal inside the polygon. 2. **Lemma:** In a convex n-gon, it is not possible to draw more than n-3 diagonals that do not share any internal points. 3. **Proof by Induction:** We will prove by induction on n that the number of good diagonals does not exceed n-2 for even n and n-3 for odd n. - **Base Case:** For n = 2 and n = 3, clearly, there are no diagonals, and thus the statement holds. - **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume the statement holds for any k-gon where k < n. 4. **Inductive Step:** Let n geqslant 4, and consider a convex n-gon ( P = A_1A_2 ldots A_n ). - If no two good diagonals intersect, by the lemma, their number cannot exceed n-3. - Suppose there are at least two intersecting good diagonals ( A_iA_k ) and ( A_jA_ell ) with ( i < j < k < ell ). - Each diagonal is not intersected by other drawn diagonals. Remove ( A_iA_k ) and ( A_jA_ell ) from consideration. 5. **Partitioning the Polygon:** Each remaining diagonal ( d ) is either on one side of ( P ) or on the boundary of one of the quadrilateral regions formed (e.g., ( Q_1 = A_i ldots A_j, Q_2 = A_j ldots A_k, Q_3 = A_k ldots A_ell ), or ( Q_4 = A_ell ldots A_nA_1 ldots A_i )). 6. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Good Diagonals:** - For even ( n ): By induction, the maximum number of good diagonals in any subpolygon is ( frac{n}{2} - 1 ). Summing for all subpolygons, the total count does not exceed ( n-2 ): 2 + (j-i-1) + (k-j-1) + (ell-k-1) + (n-ell+i-1) = n-2 - For odd ( n ): The sum of the vertices' count in the quadrilaterals (( Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4 ) as partitioned) is odd, i.e., ( n+4 ). Hence, one of the counts must be odd, reducing one spot in our sum: 2 + (j-i-1) + (k-j-1) + (ell-k-1) + (n-ell+i-1) - 1 = n-3 7. **Examples and Exactness:** - **Even ( n ):** Draw diagonals ( A_iA_{n-i} ) and ( A_{i+1}A_{n-i+1} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, frac{n}{2} - 1 ). They form pairs of intersecting diagonals, ensuring thus ( n-2 ) is exact. - **Odd ( n ):** Similar diagonals in an ( (n-1) )-gon plus a single additional diagonal shows that ( n-3 ) good diagonals are exact. # Conclusion: The maximum number of good diagonals in a convex n-gon is: - ( n-2 ) when ( n ) is even. - ( n-3 ) when ( n ) is odd.

With the base radius r=2, we get: [ pi times 2^2 = 4pi ] 3. **Determine the change in water level when the glass ball is submerged**: The problem states that the water just submerges the glass ball, implying the height of the water level increases to accommodate the volume of the ball. The total volume increase is equal to the volume of the ball, which we've calculated as frac{32pi}{3}. 4. **Calculate the volume of water before the ball was submerged**: The water level rises to 4 units high to just submerge the ball. The volume of the cylinder (which is now filled with water to this new height) is the area of the base multiplied by the height. Therefore, the volume of water after the ball is submerged is: [ 4pi times 4 = 16pi ] 5. **Find the original volume of water, V**: We know that the new volume of water (16pi) is equal to the original volume of water plus the volume of the glass ball (frac{32pi}{3}).

Given the equation: [ 31a = 54b ] 2. Since the numbers ( 31 ) and ( 54 ) are co-prime (mutually prime, meaning their greatest common divisor, (gcd(31, 54) = 1)), the number (a) must be divisible by (54). Let us express (a) as: [ a = 54n quad text{where} quad n in mathbb{N} ] 3. Substituting this expression for (a) into the original equation: [ 31(54n) = 54b ] 4. Simplifying the previous equation, we get: [ 31 cdot 54 cdot n = 54b ] Dividing both sides by (54): [ 31n = b Rightarrow b = 31n ] 5. Now we find the sum (a + b): [ a + b = 54n + 31n = 85n ] 6. For (a + b) to be composite, we need to show that (85n) is not a prime number. Notice, (85) can be factored as: [ 85 = 5 cdot 17 ] 7. Since (85) itself is composite, the product (85n) will also be composite for any natural number (n) (since multiplication with (n) does not add any new prime factors but may only increase the number).

Then the expression becomes: [ 1 - 2y^2 + 3y. ] 4. Now, let's complete the square for the quadratic expression: [ 1 - 2y^2 + 3y = 1 - 2left(y^2 - frac{3}{2}yright). ] 5. To complete the square inside the parentheses: [ y^2 - frac{3}{2}y = left(y - frac{3}{4}right)^2 - left(frac{3}{4}right)^2. ] [ y^2 - frac{3}{2}y = left(y - frac{3}{4}right)^2 - frac{9}{16}. ] 6.

Notice that the term (-2left(sin x - frac{3}{4}right)^2) is always non-positive because it is a negative multiple of a square term (which is always non-negative).

The minimum value occurs when (left(sin x - frac{3}{4}right)^2) is at its maximum, which occurs when ( sin x - frac{3}{4} = pm 1 ), however sin x ranges between -1 and 1, so calculating the terms in that interval: [ -1 - frac{3}{4} = -1.75^2 = 3.0625 cdot -2 = -6.125 ] So the lower bound can fall upto: [ frac{17}{8} - 6.125 =-frac{32}{8} =-4 ] 12.

This is because the altitude of an equilateral triangle with side length (s) is (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}s), and solving (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}s = 7sqrt{3}) gives (s = 7). 5. **Divide the segment into sevenths:** - Using a compass and straightedge, divide the segment of length 7 into 7 equal parts, each of length 1. 6. **Construct a segment of length 8:** - Place segments of lengths 7 and 1 next to each other to make a straight line segment of length 8. Label the points (X), (Y), and (Z) such that (XY = 8) and (XZ = 7). 7. **Draw a circle with diameter (XY):** - Draw a circle with diameter (XY).

Then we can write (a(x) = x a'(x)) for some polynomial (a'(x)). Substituting (x = 0) into the given equation, we get: [1 = b(0) d(y)] which implies: [d(y) = frac{1}{b(0)}] with (b(0) neq 0). Next, substituting (y = 0) into the given equation, we get: [1 = a(x) c(0) + b(x) d(0)] Since (d(0) = frac{1}{b(0)}), we have: [1 = a(x) c(0) + b(x) frac{1}{b(0)}] Rewriting, we get: [1 = a(x) c(0) + frac{b(x)}{b(0)}] Now, substituting (d(y) = frac{1}{b(0)}) back into the original equation, we get: [1 + xy + x^2 y^2 = a(x) c(y) + b(x) frac{1}{b(0)}] Rewriting, we get: [1 + xy + x^2 y^2 = a(x) c(y) + frac{b(x)}{b(0)}] Since (a(x) = x a'(x)), we substitute this into the equation: [1 + xy + x^2 y^2 = x a'(x) c(y) + frac{b(x)}{b(0)}] Now, consider the term (xy + x^2 y^2): [xy + x^2 y^2 = x a'(x) c(y)] This implies: [y + xy^2 = a'(x) c(y)] Since the left-hand side does not contain a term of the form (cx^i) and (a'(x) neq 0), we must have (c(0) = 0). Therefore, we can write (c(y) = y c'(y)) for some polynomial (c'(y)). Substituting this back, we get: [1 + xy = x a'(x) y c'(y)] Simplifying, we get: [1 + xy = x a'(x) y c'(y)] Clearly, both factors on the right-hand side are linear, so let (a'(x) = a_0 + a_1 x) and (c'(y) = c_0 + c_1 y). Expanding and comparing coefficients, we get an obvious contradiction. # Case II: None of the polynomials vanish at zero Suppose one of our polynomials is constant; without loss of generality, assume (a(x)) is constant. Substituting (y = 0) gives that (b(x)) is also constant. Then the right-hand side does not contain an (xy) term, which is a contradiction. Thus, none of our polynomials are constant. So there exists a complex number (z neq 0) such that (a(z) = 0). Substituting (x = z) gives: [1 + zy + z^2 y^2 = b(z) d(y)] Also, substituting (y = 0) gives: [b(z) = frac{1}{d(0)}] so [d(y) = d(0) (1 + zy + z^2 y^2)] By the same argument, if (omega) is a complex root of (d(y)), then: [a(x) = a(0) (1 + omega y + omega^2 y^2)] Thus, any root of (d(y)) uniquely determines the coefficients of (a(x)), so (omega) must be a double root of (d(y)). Equivalently, the discriminant of the equation (d(y) = 0) is zero: [(d(0) z)^2 - 4 (d(0) z^2) (d(0)) = -3 d(0)^2 z^2 = 0] which is a contradiction since both (d(0)) and (z) are nonzero.

To add these rates, we need a common denominator, which is 24 in this case. C's work rate is 3/24 of the work per day. So, A, B, and C together can do (7/24 + 3/24) = 10/24 of the work per day. This simplifies to 5/12 of the work per day. To find out how many days it takes for A, B, and C to complete the work together, we divide the total work (which is 1) by their combined work rate (which is 5/12). Days to complete the work = 1 / (5/12) = 1 * (12/5) = 12/5 = 2.4 days. Therefore, it took A, B, and C boxed{2.4} days to complete the work together."},{"prompt":"What is the maximum number of chess kings that can be placed on a 12 times 12 board such that each king attacks exactly one other king?","completion":"1.

We aim to determine whether the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled is not less than 300 is greater than the probability that the sum is less than 120. 2. **Notation and Expected Sum Calculation:** For a single fair six-sided die, the expected value (mean value) of the number rolled is: mathbb{E}[X] = frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = frac{21}{6} = 3.5 Hence, the expected sum S of the numbers rolled for 60 dice is: mathbb{E}[S] = 60 times 3.5 = 210 3. **Transforming the Dice Results:** If each number rolled on the dice is transformed from (x) to (7 - x), the sum of these transformed numbers for 60 dice would be calculated as follows: begin{align*} & text{Original sum} = S & text{Transformed number} = 7 - x & text{New sum after transformation} = sum_{i=1}^{60} (7 - x_i) = 420 - sum_{i=1}^{60} x_i = 420 - S end{align*} The transformation shows that the new summed value is (420 - S). 4. **Symmetry Argument:** Due to the symmetry in the distribution of the sum values 60 dice can exhibit, the number of ways to get a sum greater than or equal to 300 should be directly related to the number of ways to get a sum less than or equal to (420 - 300 = 120). Essentially: [ P(S geq 300) = P(S leq 120) ] 5. **Considering the Probability Greater Than 300:** Since the average value is 210 (well within the possible range), we consider the cumulative probabilities from both ends of the spectrum. The probability that the sum is not less than 300 includes: [ P(S geq 300) = P(S > 300) + P(S = 300) ] The probability that the sum is not less than 300 integrates all outcomes where the sum of the dice faces is from 300 up to the maximum possible (360), including the precise sum of 300. 6. **Conclusion:** By comparing these adjusted probabilities, especially noting that the probability for (S = 300) itself would add a non-zero term to the cumulative non-less-than-300 probability, whereas the less-than-120 (S leq 120) term has no analogous mid-value jump.

Step 1: Expand a using the binomial theorem. a = C_{20}^{0} + C_{20}^{1} cdot 2 + C_{20}^{2} cdot 2^2 + dots + C_{20}^{20} cdot 2^{20} = (1 + 2)^{20} = 3^{20} = 9^{10} = (10 - 1)^{10}. Step 2: Expand (10 - 1)^{10} using the binomial theorem. (10 - 1)^{10} = C_{10}^{0} cdot 10^{10} - C_{10}^{1} cdot 10^{9} + C_{10}^{2} cdot 10^{8} + dots - C_{10}^{9} cdot 10 + C_{10}^{10}. Step 3: Find the remainder when a is divided by 10. Since all terms in the expanded form of (10 - 1)^{10} except the last term C_{10}^{10} are divisible by 10, the remainder when a is divided by 10 is 1. Step 4: Find the value of b. Since a equiv b pmod{10}, b also has a remainder of 1 when divided by 10. Among the options, only 2011 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 10.

Then, the area ( A ) of the polygon is given by: [ A = n + frac{m}{2} - 1. ] 2. **Function Definition:** Define the function ( f(N) ) for a polygon ( N ) with vertices at lattice points as follows: [ f(N) = n + frac{m}{2} - 1. ] 3. **Partition of Polygon ( M ):** Suppose the polygon ( M ) is divided into two smaller polygons ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) by a line segment among the vertices. 4. **Verification for Partition:** We need to prove that if Pikh's theorem holds for two of the polygons ( M, M_1, M_2 ), then it holds for the third one. This requires showing that: [ f(M) = f(M_1) + f(M_2). ] 5. **Accounting for Contributions from Vertices:** - Vertices not intersected by the partition give equal contributions to ( f(M) ) and ( f(M_1) + f(M_2) ). - Non-terminal lattice points on the partition contribute 1 to ( f(M) ) and 0.5 each to ( f(M_1) ) and ( f(M_2) ). - Terminal lattice points of the partition contribute 0.5 each to ( f(M) ), ( f(M_1) ), and ( f(M_2) ). Thus, their net contribution to ( f(M) ) is 1 less than their contribution to ( f(M_1) + f(M_2) ). 6. **Simplification Justification:** Summing all the contributions, we see that since ( f(M) ) subtracts 1, but ( f(M_1) + f(M_2) ) subtracts 2, they balance out: [ f(M) = f(M_1) + f(M_2). ] 7. **Verification for Rectangular Triangles:** For the base case, consider a rectangle ( M ) with side lengths ( p ) and ( q ), aligned with the grid lines. Using lattice point counting, results in: [ f(M) = (p-1)(q-1) + frac{2(p + q)}{2} - 1 = pq. ] Hence, Pikh's formula is validated for such a polygon. 8. **General Triangle Proof:** A rectangle ( M ) can be halved into two triangles ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) via the diagonal, which leads to: [ f(M) = f(M_1) + f(M_2) quad text{since} quad f(M_1) = f(M_2). ] Repeatedly subdividing a polygon using grid-aligned diagonals, we can reduce any polygon to a set of grid-aligned rectangles. Thus, Pikh's formula adheres to any triangular piece derived, as small pieces adhere. 9. **Subdivision of General Polygons:** Finally, any general polygon can be triangulated using diagonals. # Conclusion: By utilizing induction and base case validations, we have thus shown that Pikh's formula holds for any polygon with vertices at lattice points.

A player wins if, as a result of their move, a glass with lemonade has both neighboring glasses filled with juice. If a player cannot fill any empty glass, that player loses. For which values of n will Petya win regardless of Vasya's actions?","completion":"Let's analyze the game described in the problem statement step by step. 1. **Initial Setup and Definitions:** - There are n empty glasses placed in a circle, where n geq 3. - Two players, Petya and Vasya, take turns starting with Petya. Each player can fill one empty glass with either compote or lemonade. - A player wins if, after their move, there is a glass with lemonade which has two adjacent glasses filled with compote. - If a player cannot make a move because all glasses are filled, they lose. 2. **Petya’s Winning Strategy for Odd n:** Let's examine the scenario where n is an odd number. - Petya's strategy revolves around the idea of maintaining symmetry and ensuring that he has control over the final glass filled. - Petya starts by filling any arbitrary glass. - Suppose Vasya then fills a glass ( k ) positions away from the first glass Petya filled, counting along the shortest arc. - If after Vasya's turn, Petya sees a winning move (forming a glass with lemonade surrounded by compote on both sides), he takes it and wins. - If there is no immediate winning move for Petya, he will then fill the glass that is ( k ) positions away from his first glass but in the opposite direction. This move maintains symmetry. - Due to this symmetry and the odd number of glasses, Petya ensures that any pair of filled symmetrical glasses can't create an immediate win for Vasya. - Furthermore, because the total number of glasses ( n ) is odd, once there is only one empty glass left, it will be Petya's turn to fill it, thereby potentially creating a winning move or at least ensuring Vasya can't win in his subsequent turn. By maintaining this symmetrical strategy and due to the odd count, Petya will eventually either force a win or fill the last glass. Therefore, **Petya’s strategy can be executed successfully for any odd number ( n ).** 3. **Vasya’s Winning Strategy for Even n:** Now, let's consider the scenario where ( n ) is an even number. - Vasya can leverage the symmetry as defined for an even ( n ). Let's assume each glass is a vertex on a regular ( n )-gon. - A crucial aspect of Vasya's strategy is to mirror Petya's moves with respect to the center of this ( n )-gon. - Vasya should fill the glass that is symmetric to the one Petya fills in each of his turns, relative to the center of the ( n )-gon (which can be visualized as purely geometric symmetry). - Since ( n ) is even, this symmetric mirroring will always be possible and will cover all glasses eventually without creating a scenario where Petya can win. - This strategy guarantees that if Petya places a drink in a particular glass, Vasya’s mirrored move prevents any winning configuration for Petya in the subsequent turns. Hence, for any even ( n ), Petya cannot enforce a winning strategy under optimal play from Vasya. **Conclusion:** Petya wins in the game only when ( n ) is odd. Therefore, the values of ( n ) for which Petya can ensure a win regardless of Vasya’s actions are the odd numbers.

How many boxes does Madeline have?","completion":"Let's start by calculating the total number of crayons in the two boxes where 5/8 were not used. Since each box contains 24 crayons, two boxes would contain 2 * 24 = 48 crayons. Now, 5/8 of these 48 crayons were not used. So, the number of unused crayons in these two boxes is (5/8) * 48 = 30 crayons. Next, let's calculate the number of unused crayons in the two other boxes where 2/3 of the crayons were used. If 2/3 were used, then 1/3 were not used. Again, since each box contains 24 crayons, two boxes would contain 2 * 24 = 48 crayons. The number of unused crayons in these two boxes is (1/3) * 48 = 16 crayons. Now, we have 30 unused crayons from the first two boxes and 16 unused crayons from the next two boxes, which gives us a total of 30 + 16 = 46 unused crayons. Madeline had a total of 70 unused crayons, and we've accounted for 46 of them. This means there are 70 - 46 = 24 unused crayons left, which must be from the last box. Since each box contains 24 crayons and we have 24 unused crayons left, this means the last box was not used at all and still contains all its crayons.

By applying this formula, we see that a simplifies to tan45°, which equals 1. Therefore, we have: [a = frac{2tan22.5°}{1-tan^{2}22.5°} = tan45° = 1] **For b:** Given b=2sin13°cos13°, we can use the double angle formula for sine, sin(2theta) = 2sinthetacostheta.

Suppose ( a ) and ( b in S ) such that ((a+b) mid ab). Let ( c = gcd(a, b) ), where (gcd(a, b)) stands for \\"greatest common divisor\\". Then we can express ( a ) and ( b ) as ( a = c a_1 ) and ( b = c b_1 ) such that ( a_1 ne b_1 ), (a_1, b_1 in mathbb{N}) (natural numbers), and (gcd(a_1, b_1) = 1). 2.

Find the area of the trapezoid. 1. **Determine the second base**: - Since the trapezoid is inscribed around a circle, the sum of the lengths of the bases is equal to the sum of the lengths of the lateral sides, i.e., [ a + text{second base} = 2l ] - Therefore, the second base is calculated as: [ text{second base} = 2l - a ] 2. **Divide the lateral sides**: - The point where the incircle is tangent to the lateral sides of the trapezoid divides each lateral side into two segments. Let these segments be ( frac{a}{2} ) and ( frac{2l - a}{2} ). 3. **Calculate the radius of the inscribed circle**: - The radius ( r ) of the inscribed circle is the geometric mean of the segments into which the lateral sides are divided: [ r = sqrt{frac{a}{2} cdot frac{2l - a}{2}} = sqrt{frac{a(2l - a)}{4}} ] Simplifying: [ r = frac{sqrt{a(2l - a)}}{2} ] 4. **Find the height of the trapezoid**: - The height ( h ) of the trapezoid is twice the radius of the inscribed circle, since the trapezoid's height is the diameter of the inscribed circle: [ h = 2r = 2 cdot frac{sqrt{a(2l - a)}}{2} = sqrt{a(2l - a)} ] 5. **Calculate the area of the trapezoid**: - The area (A) of a trapezoid is given by: [ A = frac{1}{2} cdot (text{sum of the bases}) cdot text{height} ] - Substituting the known values: [ A = frac{1}{2} cdot (a + (2l - a)) cdot sqrt{a(2l - a)} = frac{1}{2} cdot 2l cdot sqrt{a(2l - a)} = l cdot sqrt{a(2l - a)} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{l sqrt{a(2l - a)}} ]"},{"prompt":"f the lengths of the diagonals AC and BD of a rhombus ABCD are the two real roots of the quadratic equation x^265x+360=0, then the area of the rhombus ABCD is.","completion":"Since the lengths of AC and BD are the two real roots of the quadratic equation x^2-65x+360=0, it follows that AC cdot BD = 360, therefore, the area of the rhombus is [ frac{1}{2} AC cdot BD = 180. ] Hence, the answer is boxed{180}."},{"prompt":"w many distinct arrangements of the letters in the word ballon are there?","completion":"The word \\"ballon\\" consists of 6 letters with the letters 'l' repeated twice. 1.

We set up the factorization: 2y^2 + 5y - 12 = (2y + a)(y + b). First, calculate ab = -12 and the sum 2b + a = 5 (since 2b + a should give the middle term, 5, considering the coefficient of y).

After applying all the discounts, she is able to purchase 5 kgs more oil for Rs. 800 than she could before. What is the price per kg of oil after all the discounts are applied?","completion":"Let's denote the original price per kg of oil as P. After the first discount of 30%, the price per kg becomes P - 0.30P = 0.70P. After the second discount of 20% on the new price, the price per kg becomes 0.70P - 0.20(0.70P) = 0.70P - 0.14P = 0.56P. After the third discount of 10% on the new price, the price per kg becomes 0.56P - 0.10(0.56P) = 0.56P - 0.056P = 0.504P. Now, we know that after all the discounts, the housewife is able to purchase 5 kgs more oil for Rs. 800 than she could before. This means that the amount of oil she could have bought for Rs. 800 before the discounts is now increased by 5 kgs. Let's denote the amount of oil she could buy before the discounts for Rs. 800 as X kgs. So, the original cost for X kgs of oil would be X * P = Rs. 800. After the discounts, the price per kg is 0.504P, and she can buy X + 5 kgs for the same Rs. 800. So, the cost for (X + 5) kgs of oil at the discounted price per kg is (X + 5) * 0.504P = Rs. 800. Now we have two equations: 1) X * P = Rs. 800 2) (X + 5) * 0.504P = Rs. 800 We can solve these equations to find the value of P and X. From equation 1, we can express X as: X = 800 / P Substituting X in equation 2, we get: (800 / P + 5) * 0.504P = 800 Dividing both sides by 0.504P, we get: 800 / P + 5 = 800 / 0.504P Now, we can solve for P: 800 / P + 5P / P = 800 / 0.504P Multiplying both sides by P to get rid of the denominators: 800 + 5P = 800 / 0.504 Now, we can solve for P: 5P = 800 / 0.504 - 800 5P = 1587.30 - 800 5P = 787.30 P = 787.30 / 5 P = 157.46 So, the original price per kg of oil was Rs. 157.46. Now, we can find the price per kg after all the discounts: Price per kg after discounts = 0.504P Price per kg after discounts = 0.504 * 157.46 Price per kg after discounts = Rs. 79.36 Therefore, the price per kg of oil after all the discounts are applied is Rs. boxed{79.36} ."},{"prompt":"Two ships depart from the same port at the same time, traveling in opposite directions.

Now, let's examine each conclusion based on the given information: **Conclusion ①: Speed of Ship A is left(50+aright) kilometers per hour.** - Ship A travels with the current, so its effective speed is the sum of its speed in still water and the speed of the current. - Therefore, the speed of Ship A = Speed in still water + Speed of current = 50 + a kilometers per hour. - This confirms that conclusion ① is correct. **Conclusion ②: After traveling for 2 hours, the two ships are 200 kilometers apart.** - The distance covered by Ship A in 2 hours = 2 times (50 + a) kilometers. - The distance covered by Ship B in 2 hours = 2 times (50 - a) kilometers, since Ship B travels against the current. - The total distance between the two ships after 2 hours = 2(50 + a) + 2(50 - a). - Simplifying, we get 100 + 2a + 100 - 2a = 200 kilometers. - Therefore, conclusion ② is also correct. **Conclusion ③: After traveling for 2 hours, Ship A has traveled 4a kilometers more than Ship B.** - The difference in distance covered by Ship A and Ship B in 2 hours = 2(50 + a) - 2(50 - a). - Simplifying, we get 100 + 2a - (100 - 2a) = 4a kilometers. - This means Ship A has indeed traveled 4a kilometers more than Ship B after 2 hours, confirming that conclusion ③ is correct.

(2) If Team A's daily road construction cost is 0.5 million yuan and Team B's daily road construction cost is 0.4 million yuan, to ensure that the total cost of road construction by both teams does not exceed 5.2 million yuan, how many days does Team A need to build the road at least?","completion":"# Solution Details Part 1: Daily Construction Rate Let's denote the daily construction rate of Team A as x kilometers. Given that Team A builds 0.5 kilometers more road per day than Team B, we can express Team B's daily construction rate as x - 0.5 kilometers. The problem states that the number of days Team B needs to complete the road is 1.5 times the number of days Team A needs. We can translate this into an equation using the total length of the road, which is 15 kilometers. For Team A, the time to complete the road is frac{15}{x} days, and for Team B, it is frac{15}{x-0.5} days. Setting up the equation based on the given condition: [1.5 times frac{15}{x} = frac{15}{x-0.5}] Solving this equation for x: [1.5x - 0.75 = x] [0.5x = 0.75] [x = 1.5] Thus, Team A builds 1.5 kilometers per day. Substituting x = 1.5 into x - 0.5 gives us Team B's daily construction rate: [1.5 - 0.5 = 1] Therefore, Team A builds 1.5 kilometers per day, and Team B builds 1 kilometer per day. boxed{text{Team A builds 1.5 kilometers per day, and Team B builds 1 kilometer per day.}} Part 2: Minimum Days for Team A Let a represent the number of days Team A works. The remaining work for Team B, in kilometers, is 15 - 1.5a. Since Team B builds at a rate of 1 kilometer per day, the number of days Team B works is simply 15 - 1.5a. The total cost of construction, which should not exceed 5.2 million yuan, is given by the sum of the costs incurred by both teams. Team A's daily cost is 0.5 million yuan, and Team B's daily cost is 0.4 million yuan. Setting up the inequality: [0.5a + 0.4(15 - 1.5a) leqslant 5.2] Expanding and simplifying: [0.5a + 6 - 0.6a leqslant 5.2] [-0.1a leqslant -0.8] [a geqslant 8] Thus, Team A needs to work for at least 8 days to ensure the total cost does not exceed 5.2 million yuan. boxed{text{Team A needs to work for at least 8 days.}}"},{"prompt":"Cindy has her eye on a sundress but thinks it is too expensive.

Each edge has 2 cubes (total 24 cubes). - The smaller cubes in the center of each face, not on edges or corners, have one face visible (16 cubes). 2. **Minimum Values on Visible Faces**: - For corner cubes with three visible faces: Minimize by showing faces 1, 2, and 3. Sum = 1+2+3=6. - For edge cubes with two visible faces: Minimize by showing faces 1 and 2. Sum = 1+2=3. - For face-center cubes with one visible face: Minimize by showing face 1. Sum = 1. 3. **Calculating the Total Minimum Sum**: - For 8 corner cubes, sum = 8 times 6 = 48. - For 24 edge cubes, sum = 24 times 3 = 72. - For 16 face-center cubes, sum = 16 times 1 = 16. - Total minimum sum = 48 + 72 + 16 = 136. 4. **Conclusion**: - The smallest possible sum of all the values visible on the 6 faces of the larger cube is 136.

We are given the expression (6left(frac{3}{2} + frac{2}{3}right)). 2. First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses by finding a common denominator for (frac{3}{2}) and (frac{2}{3}): [ frac{3}{2} + frac{2}{3} ] 3. The least common denominator (LCD) for 2 and 3 is 6. Rewrite the fractions with the common denominator: [ frac{3}{2} = frac{3 times 3}{2 times 3} = frac{9}{6} ] [ frac{2}{3} = frac{2 times 2}{3 times 2} = frac{4}{6} ] 4. Now add the fractions: [ frac{9}{6} + frac{4}{6} = frac{9 + 4}{6} = frac{13}{6} ] 5. We substitute back into the original expression: [ 6left(frac{13}{6}right) ] 6.
