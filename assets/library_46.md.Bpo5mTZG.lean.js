C'est-à-dire que c'est ce que Montesquieu appelait l'esprit. L'esprit est plus fort que le mental. Alors, la question, on va commencer par un peu de technique. Je vais vous expliquer d'où vient l'intelligence émotionnelle, d'où vient ce concept, parce qu'il y a une explication technique et mécanique que nous allons voir. Mais au fond, si suite à notre rendez-vous, c'est un peu un rendez-vous avec vous, et que ça vous permet, dans notre monde brutal, un peu de passer une heure avec vous, on va dire une heure et demie, une heure trois quarts avec vous, Un peu comme une méditation. On a très très peu de rendez-vous avec soi. Vous savez, j'ai eu le plaisir d'accompagner énormément de patrons depuis les années 90, où j'ai monté ma première société, après avoir quitté Universal. Et j'ai beaucoup travaillé entre autres avec Philippe Varin, quand il a lancé PSA en Chine et au Brésil. Et Philippe Varin, régulièrement à son staff de dirigeant, disait Mesdames et messieurs, si vous ne prenez pas 20 minutes de rendez-vous chaque jour avec vous, vous faites une faute professionnelle. Est-ce que vous prenez 20 minutes de rendez-vous avec vous chaque jour ? Notre monde est un monde d'accélération, qui fait que nous avons très peu de temps, comme dit Piaget, pour avoir des trous, c'est-à-dire pour reposer notre esprit. Notre cerveau est un muscle. Et ce muscle a besoin de repos et d'oxygène. Et pour cela, il est important chaque jour de se dire au fond, quel sens a ce que j'ai fait ? Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait aujourd'hui ? Est-ce que c'était utile ? Et ce sont des choses très très simples, l'intelligence émotionnelle. Je vais essayer de vous traduire, je dis parfois avec une forme d'humour, de vous traduire souvent le Bouddha en Jésus. Parce que l'essentiel de l'intelligence émotionnelle nous vient d'Asie. Mais ce qu'il faut, c'est l'adapter à notre paradigme, c'est-à-dire à l'Occident. Nous, nous sommes un peuple héroïque et non pas stratégique comme l'Asie. Eux, si vous voulez, ils réfléchissent. Les arts martiaux n'ont rien à voir avec les nôtres. Comprenez, eux, avant de frapper, ils regardent. Et après, ils lâchent. Nous, à peine il y a le coup de gong, tout de suite on y va. Ça, c'est le héros. Donc, je vous ai résumé l'intelligence émotionnelle. Qu'est-ce que c'est que l'intelligence émotionnelle ? C'est passer du stade de l'héroïsme, c'est-à-dire où l'émotion est la patronne, au stade de la stratégie. Voilà, en gros c'est ça. C'est-à-dire que je ressens une émotion, qu'est-ce que j'en fais ? Mais il ne s'agit certainement pas de l'annuler, il ne s'agit certainement pas de la supprimer, il s'agit simplement de devenir intelligent avec son émotion. Alors, premièrement, Il s'agit d'une découverte qui est extrêmement intéressante. Et donc, avant qu'on rentre dans la partie pratique et technique, il faut que je vous présente un monsieur qui s'appelle Antonio Damasio. Qui est Antonio Damasio et sa femme Anna ? C'est un Portugais. qui, dans les années 80, est venue s'installer aux États-Unis, a travaillé en Iowa, notamment, à l'université d'Iowa, et a étudié des personnes qui avaient un certain nombre de traumatismes, et il s'est rendu compte que, finalement, écoutez bien, l'émotion... Et la raison, c'est la même chose, mais pas au même stade. L'émotion et la raison, c'est la même chose, donc immense découverte. Il n'y a pas d'un côté l'émotion et de l'autre côté la raison, donc il est stupide de dire oh, j'aimerais ne pas avoir d'émotion puisque, on va le voir ensemble, on ne peut pas vivre sans émotion. Mais en plus, c'est même le parcours obligatoire que va suivre notre raison. Autrement dit, tout commence par de l'émotion, et une fois refroidie, et une fois que ça va suivre un circuit que je vais vous montrer, ça va s'appeler ce que l'on appelle la raison. Et donc il n'y a pas, comme pensait Descartes, je pense donc je suis, il n'y a pas d'un côté l'émotion et de l'autre côté la raison, c'est la même chose, c'est le même circuit, mais pas au même stade. Voilà la grande découverte de Damasio. Qu'est-ce que va découvrir Damasio ? Il va découvrir la chose suivante, nos émotions sont nos alliés. Toute émotion est un cadeau. Arrêtons de dire je ne veux pas avoir d'émotion Premièrement, techniquement, c'est impossible. Et deuxièmement, il dit emotion is our bodyguard L'émotion est notre garde du corps. À quoi servent les émotions ? Émotion, ça veut dire mettre en mouvement. É-motion, ex motere, je mets en mouvement. Donc, ça veut dire pay attention please comme il dit. C'est-à-dire, c'est un petit Jimmy Cricket qui est au-dessus de nous et qui va nous dire fais attention, tu vas être en retard pour prendre ton avion On va appeler ça la peur. Et donc, vous accélérez le mouvement, vous partez un peu plus tôt et vous avez votre avion. Et au lieu de dire oh là là, zut, j'ai eu peur de rater mon avion vous devriez chouette, j'ai eu peur de rater mon avion, donc je l'ai Et donc, en fait, ce que va découvrir Damasio, c'est que l'émotion fait partie structurante de notre bien-être, to the well-ordered intellect, c'est-à-dire que sans émotion, vous et moi, dans le monde dans lequel nous vivons, il l'a dit, je ne l'ai pas parlé avec lui directement, mais j'ai été plusieurs fois en conférence avec lui, il dit que dans le monde moderne dans lequel on vit, on ne pourrait pas vivre, allez, disons plus de dix minutes. Pourquoi ? Parce qu'on sortirait nu dans la rue, on traverserait sans faire attention qu'il y a des voitures, évidemment puisque vous n'auriez plus peur, plus d'émotion, on viderait son compte en banque en 50 secondes, on se jetterait du haut de la tour Eiffel en disant Oh, je suis un oiseau, je vole ! Évidemment, puisque l'enfant naturel de la peur qui est la patronne, Fear is the boss la peur est la patronne de nos émotions, et bien l'enfant naturel c'est la prudence. D'ailleurs les Beatles avaient écrit une chanson Their Prudence C'est-à-dire la prudence est justement le côté positif de nos émotions qui va nous permettre justement de ne pas commettre d'erreur pour notre survie. Bien au contraire, tout se passe dans une région qui s'appelle l'Amigdala et qui va déclencher, tel un effet un peu électronique, je dirais atomique, va déclencher notre compétence. Par exemple, imaginons que je ne connais pas bien Grenoble. Je vais traverser la rue et là, d'un seul coup, Bam ! Oh, il y avait un autobus ! Déclenchement de testostérone, d'adrénaline, je suis à l'optimum de ma performance, je viens de sauver ma vie. Et au lieu de dire Oh là là, j'ai eu peur ! je devrais dire Ouais, super, j'ai eu peur ! Je n'aurais pas eu peur, je me faisais écraser. Donc, Thanks to your fear dit Damasio, c'est-à-dire grâce à notre peur qui est la patronne de nos émotions, eh bien notre vie peut s'organiser. C'est ça la grande découverte. Et donc notre intellect, et surtout notez-le bien, notre pouvoir de décision, va se structurer depuis tout petit grâce aux émotions. Parce que figurez-vous que ce qu'on a découvert, c'est qu'on n'oublie jamais rien. Rien ! Qu'est-ce que c'est qu'une photo ? Une photo est un bibliothécaire. C'est-à-dire que, mais évidemment, si vous regardez la photo trois jours après avoir pris une photo, ça n'a aucun intérêt. Tandis que si vous regardez 20 ans après une photo, vous allez la regarder et dire Oui, Paul, on était où là ? Mais oui, c'était en Crète ! Oh, regarde la tête ! Mais t'étais beau, mon chéri, regarde la tête que tu avais ! On croit qu'on avait oublié. En fait, une photo va simplement être un bibliothécaire qui va renvoyer à notre souvenir. Donc, souvenez-vous de ça, l'intelligence émotionnelle, c'est savoir qu'on n'oublie jamais rien. Par contre... Et là, je commence par vous donner déjà des petits trucs. Il faut savoir pardonner, mais le pardon n'est pas l'oubli. Notez-le bien. Alors, il y a un vieux proverbe amérindien qui dit Lorsque l'on a enfoncé un clou dans une planche, on peut enlever le clou, mais il reste le trou. C'est-à-dire qu'il faut bien distinguer l'oubli et le pardon. Dans l'intelligence émotionnelle, le pardon est fondamental. C'est enlever la partie toxique du souvenir. Et souvenez-vous qu'on peut très bien pardonner sans que l'autre pardonne. C'est-à-dire que si vous êtes fâché avec vos parents, l'intelligence émotionnelle dira tu n'oublieras jamais rien, mais enlève cette partie toxique, enlève le clou. On ne te demande pas d'oublier, mais on te demande d'enlever cette partie toxique et donc toi-même d'essayer de vivre mieux ce souvenir. On a découvert que l'émotion nous aide à prendre des décisions, vous disais-je. Alors comment ça se passe ? On appelle ça la théorie des marqueurs somatiques. Mademoiselle, et tant pis si je me trompe, disait Coluche, vous vous appelez comment ? Jennifer. Jennifer. Et vous ? Benjamin. Alors, imaginons que la petite Jennifer, elle invite Benjamin, ils ont trois ans et demi à l'époque. Benjamin en a quatre, elle a trois ans et demi, et déjà elle a du charme, et alors il l'invite chez elle. Et alors, il se trouve que la grand-mère de Jennifer... elle fait des petites tartes à la framboise extraordinaires. Alors déjà, dans le cerveau du petit Benjamin, tarte à la framboise égale charme de Jennifer. Il n'y a pas que de la tarte à la framboise, il y a un mix des Damasio. Et puis, en plus, il fait beau, c'est l'été, elle a des petites jupettes et vous commencez à jouer au docteur. Alors, je ne vous raconte pas la tarte à la framboise. Et alors, dans le cerveau du petit Benjamin, Il va y avoir ce que Damasio appelle un marqueur somatique positif. Donc, il va associer tarte à la framboise à positif, mais très très positif, parce que Jennifer déjà avait beaucoup de charme. Et puis, trois jours après, il va être invité chez la grand-mère de Laurent. Elle, elle fait une tarte à la rhubarbe, et puis c'est un garçon, nettement moins sympathique, au niveau en tout cas de jouer au docteur, parce qu'il n'est pas du tout d'accord pour jouer au docteur. Alors il arrive chez la grand-mère, qui est très sympathique, mais qui n'a que de la rhubarbe chez elle. Et puis il y a des poils qui dépassent un peu de la tarte à la rhubarbe, alors il se dit, oui, de faire de la rhubarbe, ce n'est pas terrible. Et alors, ce qui est intéressant, c'est que 20 ans plus tard, Quand Benjamin va être au restaurant ou à la cafétéria chez J'aime, et qu'on va lui dire à la fin du repas, le garçon va arriver, il va lui dire Et alors monsieur, vous prendrez un petit dessert ? Bon écoutez, ça dépend de ce que vous avez, qu'est-ce que vous avez ? Ben écoutez monsieur, aujourd'hui nous avons la tarte du chef, la tarte à la rhubarbe. Oh non, tarte à la rhubarbe, non merci. On a également de la tarte à la framboise. Ah oui, tarte à la framboise. Autrement dit, je vous ai expliqué le principe de marqueur somatique. C'est-à-dire que ce que nous avons vécu à l'âge de 3 ans, va 20 ans après nous servir pour prendre une décision. C'est-à-dire que Benjamin aura réduit son champ d'hésitation, on va appeler ça comme ça, puisqu'il aura une partie négative, une partie positive. Et donc tout ce qui est vos mauvais souvenirs va vous aider à prendre les décisions dans l'autre partie. Donc ça réduit d'autant notre incertitude et notre indécision. Voilà pourquoi la prise de décision et l'émotion sont intimement liées. et on va faire un petit voyage à travers le cerveau, ici, à un endroit avec une première lande qu'on appelle la mygdala, et nous avons une deuxième glande que maintenant on arrive à identifier, qui est ce qu'on appelle la mygdala primaire, qui, elle, nous envoie vraiment à nos réactions qu'on appelle reptiliennes. Donc, ici, on est au stade de l'émotion pure. Alors, l'intelligence émotionnelle nous dit que la molécule, à ce stade-là, est chaude. et qu'on ne peut rien en faire. Donc, méfiez-vous. C'est ce qu'on appelle, notez-le s'il y a un peu de place, une réaction. Donc, l'intelligence émotionnelle nous dit, méfions-nous de nos réactions, car la réaction est à chaud. Et imaginez de la pâte à modeler chaude, on ne peut pas la remodeler. Donc, il faut se méfier à chaud de nos réactions. Elles existent, elles ont droit d'exister, mais ce n'est pas être intelligent avec son émotion. Par contre, il faut se dire, qu'est-ce que je viens d'apprendre ? Au bout de quelques minutes, on va dire au bout de 4 à 5 minutes, regardez, le trajet... Ça fait que ça va aller vers ce que l'on appelle la zone préfrontale. Par exemple, mademoiselle, si un coup de fil s'est mal passé et que vous pensez que je ne vous aime plus ou quoi que ce soit, il y a quelque chose qui vous a vexé, n'attendez pas plus de 21 jours. Si vous le faites en temps réel, vous allez être dans l'émotion. Tu dis Quoi ? Tu oses me dire ça ? Là, vous êtes dans le un Par contre, vous me rappelez le lendemain ou le surlendemain et vous dites Dis donc, j'aimerais te reparler de quelque chose. Est-ce que c'est bien cela que tu as voulu dire ? À ce moment-là, vous êtes dans le 2. Est-ce que vous avez compris ? C'est-à-dire que là, un contre-ordre, il faut noter-le, nettoyer le vase régulièrement. C'est une question d'hygiène. En fait, l'intelligence émotionnelle, c'est de l'hygiène énergétique. Et donc, il faut éviter qu'un jour, la goutte d'eau fasse dévore d'élevage, c'est-à-dire qu'à force de ne pas avoir nettoyé votre zone de transit, la moindre remarque que va vous faire quelqu'un va vous faire péter un plomb, ce qu'on appelle. Et donc, il est très important de ne pas parler en temps réel, parce que là, en temps réel, on est capable d'être sur le registre émotionnel pur, mais peut-être un quart d'heure après, de revenir dessus et de dire il faut que je te parle, j'aimerais qu'on revienne sur ce qu'il s'est passé Et à ce moment-là, il faut que je te parle sera beaucoup plus calme, parce que vous serez passé de 1 à 2. Et figurez-vous que vous disposez, notez-le bien en énorme, de 21 jours pour faire ce toilettage. Si vous attendez au-delà de 21 jours, regardez bien, le circuit du cerveau va être le suivant, et il va aller en 3. Et donc, ce qui se passe, c'est que... Et la raison, tout ce que nous n'avons pas nettoyé va être stocké dans notre mémoire longue qui est derrière. Et c'est bien le problème des gens qui ont Alzheimer, puisque de 1, ils vont aller directement à 3. Donc ils vont se souvenir. Donc souvenez-vous que votre visite va leur faire très plaisir parce qu'ils seront dans l'émotion, mais ils ne se souviendront pas de ce qu'ils vous ont dit une minute avant, parce qu'ils vont aller directement de 1 à 3. Et à 3, si vous voulez, c'est la mémoire longue. Et là... La molécule est dure, et ce qu'il faut savoir, c'est qu'elle est froide et que le dur dure. Alors, notez bien que dans ce cas-là, il faut trois fois plus d'énergie pour enlever un marqueur somatique négatif. Vous voyez, par exemple, Marie Laforêt, que j'ai produite en 1992, pour son dernier album, avant qu'elle arrête la chanson, m'a confié qu'elle avait été violée à l'âge de 12 ans. Et je lui ai dit, mais Marie, tu n'en as jamais parlé ? Elle me dit, écoute, je n'ai pas osé. Je lui ai dit, mais tu devrais, tu devrais écrire quelque chose à ce sujet maintenant. Et en fait, il y a 15 ans, elle a écrit un livre, ça s'appelait Avant de chanter Et ce livre a été remarquable. Elle m'a envoyé un mail, elle m'a appelé, elle m'a dit, tu sais, Bernard, tu avais raison. Le fait de le mettre en mots. Ça m'a permis, quel dommage que j'ai attendu 50 ans. Voilà, c'est-à-dire qu'il est important de nettoyer le vase tant qu'il est temps, parce qu'après on garde des choses qu'on appelle des marqueurs somatiques négatifs, et ça va être trois à quatre fois plus difficile de le détruire après. Vous voyez, il y aura une espèce de rancune, il y aura quelque chose qui sera en nous, et là, ça va rentrer dans votre corps, notez-le. Avant, ce n'est que dans le mental, ce n'est que dans votre émotion. Tandis que là, ça va rentrer dans votre corps, si c'est du stress, par exemple, dont vous n'osez pas parler, et là, vous pouvez arriver au burn-out. Le burn-out, ce sont souvent des gens qui sont ce qu'on appelle en surcharge cognitive, c'est-à-dire qui prennent en eux des choses dont ils ne parlent pas, ils n'en parlent pas, ils n'en parlent pas, un jour, Le vase est complet et il pète. Et à ce moment-là, ça devient un effort énorme. D'où l'intérêt en réunion d'oser dire régulièrement. Quand je vois des réunions qui ont lieu tous les mois, je travaille avec beaucoup de codires qui ont changé et qui maintenant les font tous les 21 jours, toutes les 3 semaines. À mon avis, il vaut mieux avoir plusieurs réunions rapprochées où on nettoie le vase au fil de l'eau plutôt que de laisser engrammer des choses et d'en avoir des longues tous les 2 mois, par exemple. Voilà, que ce soit avec votre chéri ou en entreprise, ça marche pour les deux. Si vous voulez, la mauvaise habitude se prend le 22e jour. C'est-à-dire, si votre enfant, vous avez envie de lui dire mais lève le coude quand tu manges vous avez 21 jours pour que ce ne soit pas engrammé dans son corps. Si vous attendez trop, il aura pris ce qu'on appelle un mauvais pli. Et maintenant, on le voit. Donc, l'intelligence émotionnelle nous dit tu disposes de 21 jours pour corriger la chose, pour oser le dire. Donc vraiment, s'il y avait une chose technique, donc je voulais que vous vous souveniez ce soir, c'est 1. Nos émotions sont un cadeau. 2. Nos émotions sont notre garde du corps. 3. L'autre n'est pas moi et surtout la loi des 21 jours. Il faut nettoyer le vase au fil de l'eau. C'est fondamental que vous vous souveniez de tout cela. Alors, ce qui est important, notez-le bien, c'est de ralentir et de refroidir. Si par exemple, vous venez de recevoir un mail... qui vraiment vous met hors de vous, éventuellement répondez à chaud, mais surtout ne l'envoyez pas. Vous le mettez au brouillon, vous le mettez au parking, moi j'appelle ça, vous le relisez une demi-heure après, vous allez vous dire Heureusement que je ne l'ai pas envoyé Et là, vous vous évitez bien des ennuis. Eh bien, vous avez fait de l'intelligence émotionnelle. Vous voyez que ce n'est pas si compliqué que ça. Et ça, ça s'explique techniquement. Au moment où vous l'auriez écrit, vous étiez dans 1, alors que là, vous allez être dans 2. Voilà, et n'oubliez pas la loi des 21 jours. Alors, cette loi, je vous l'ai mise en agrandi dans votre petit document. Voilà, j'adore cette vignette, voyez, que vous, vous avez en petit, mais je l'ai agrandi ici pour vous. C'est le patron de Ikea, et je trouve que c'est vraiment très apprenant. Parce que nous, on dit la nuit porte conseil mais je trouve que cette formule est encore plus belle. C'est en dormant que nous arrêtons de faire des erreurs. La nuit ne porte pas conseil. La nuit permet de passer de 1 à 2 et elle permet de voir les choses d'une autre façon. Donc, en vous disant tu ne paies rien pour attendre, je t'en parlerai demain matin vous faites de l'intelligence émotionnelle. Par contre, il va falloir le dire le lendemain. Il ne faudra pas fuir. Attention. En tout cas, pas plus de 21 jours. Est-ce que c'est clair pour vous toutes ? Je vais avoir besoin de vous de nouveau parce que la phrase la plus importante peut-être de ce soir... C'est là où il y a de la gêne, il n'y a pas de plaisir. Vous allez dire, on vient là pour ça. Oui, vous venez là pour ça. parce que vous n'en aviez peut-être pas pris conscience. Pourquoi ? Écoutez bien ce que je vais vous dire, parce que c'est le tournant. Il fallait bien à un moment donné tourner dans la conférence. La joie est, comme le Bouddha est, comme la lumière est. C'est-à-dire, nous venons tous du Big Bang. Nous ne sommes absolument pas poussière pour redevenir poussière. Nous sommes lumière et nous redevenons lumière. Je l'ai vécu. C'était uniquement pour vendre des indulgences que l'Église a inventé ce terme de poussière et tu redeviendras poussière. Donc ça veut dire que l'instinct de survie, la lumière est en nous. Nous avons tous cela en nous. Donc le problème n'est pas la joie. L'intelligence émotionnelle ne s'intéresse pas à la joie. Elle s'intéresse à qu'est-ce qui empêche ma joie d'être totalement au firmament. Autrement dit, qu'est-ce qui va gêner ma joie. Et donc l'intelligence émotionnelle ne s'intéresse pas à quand un couple se marie et qu'ils ont 20 sur 20. Il s'intéresse à quand, 5 ans après, il n'y a plus que 17. Et alors, le fait qu'il n'y ait plus que 17, on va se poser la question, c'est quoi les trois points de gêne ? D'où ils viennent ? Et en enlevant la gêne, on va retrouver le plaisir. Donc l'intelligence émotionnelle dans son mécanisme est exactement à l'inverse de ce que l'on pense. On ne motive pas quelqu'un, on ne motive pas une équipe, on essaie de comprendre comment elle a été démotivée. Et là, on peut travailler. On ne peut pas travailler sur le bonheur d'un enfant qui rentre de l'école, on peut travailler sur quel est le malheur qui lui est arrivé, où est sa gêne, parce que son copain lui a pris sa voiture et qu'il a un gros bobo. Alors là, on va lui dire, elle est où ta gêne mon chéri ? Et c'est en récupérant la gêne qu'on va retrouver le plaisir. Si par exemple, je demandais à Jennifer, je lui dis Tu sais, regarde, j'ai reçu cette clé, je ne comprends pas, elle ne marche pas. Comment ça se fait, nos nouvelles clés, elles ne marchent pas ? Et Jennifer me dit Ah, mais tu n'as pas vu, on avait reçu un mail, il y a un petit truc maintenant ici qui permet de la connecter pour économiser les batteries. Ah d'accord ! Jennifer ne m'a pas apporté de la joie, elle m'a enlevé un emmerde. Et donc je repars, je dis Ouais, super, merci ! Là où il y a de la gêne, il n'y a pas de plaisir. Donc, ce que je vous propose de façon très intime, alors peut-être que ça peut être au niveau de la vie, ça peut être au niveau de votre travail, ça vous regarde, j'ai envie de vous dire, mettez-vous une note sur 20. Allez-y. Mettez-vous une note sur 20 sur le enjoy. Le enjoy, c'est l'élan, sur l'envie de. Je vous souhaite d'avoir 20, mais ce n'est pas toujours le cas. Alors, ça peut être par rapport au travail. Moi, je fais ça en entreprise avec des codires. Qu'est-ce que ça marche bien ? Vous voyez, ce qui est important, dans un monde parfait, tout le monde devrait avoir 20. Mais le problème, c'est que le 20, il est individuel. Ça dépend de l'histoire de chacun. Alors, pour ceux que ça intéresse l'étymologie, j'ai appris il n'y a pas longtemps... Historia, ça vient du grec. Histoire, ça vient... Historia, c'est l'enquête. Si vous voulez, vous avez tous ici une histoire qui vous est propre, même en tant qu'enfant et parent. Chacun a une histoire qui lui est propre. Et donc, chacun a des raisons d'avoir de la joie ou pas de la joie. Ça ne vous appartient pas. Par contre, si vous voyez quelqu'un autour de vous qui a de la gêne, là, vous pouvez l'aider à enlever au moins un point de gêne. Là, on peut intervenir. Mais on ne peut pas intervenir sur la joie. La joie est quelque chose de très personnel, qui dépend de notre historia, c'est-à-dire de notre enquête personnelle depuis qu'on est tout petit. Et donc, qu'est-ce qu'on appelle le lâcher-prise ? Souvent on me dit, ah oui, écoute, le lâcher-prise, moi j'aimerais bien lâcher-prise. Le lâcher-prise, ça c'est bon en Asie. Alors ils se mettent là, nous on est dans les embouteillages et tout, ça n'a rien à voir. Donc moi je préférais que vous reteniez la chose suivante. Pour lâcher prise, je passe du verre à moitié vide au verre à moitié plat. Voilà. Et là, vous allez vous prendre en flag. Combien de fois le matin, on commence à râler. On dit Oh, ça y est, il fait froid. Oh, ça y est, l'hiver arrive. Et là, vous êtes en plein flag du verre à moitié vide. Eh bien, pour lâcher prise, regardez le verre à moitié plein. Oh, mais quand même, j'ai de la chance. Je vais dans une super école. Je fais partie d'une super association. Puis en plus, il y a un mec qui m'aime. Et puis, j'ai des études. Et puis, j'ai un pouvoir d'achat, etc. Ouais. Puis pour mon âge, je ne suis pas si mal. Et à ce moment-là, vous switchez. Est-ce que vous avez compris ? Donc lâcher prise, c'est passer du verre à moitié vide au verre à moitié plein. Alors, autre chose, un problème est en dehors de moi. Dans notre vie, nous passons notre vie à avoir des problèmes à résoudre. D'ailleurs, les enfants à l'école ont un problème de mathématiques. En entreprise, on passe son temps à avoir des problèmes. un problème n'est pas un problème parce qu'il est en dehors de moi, il ne me touche pas affectivement. Et ça, on le voit avec les IRM. La difficulté, c'est tout autre chose. C'est un problème qui va rentrer à l'intérieur de moi et qui, à ce moment-là, au niveau affect, va prendre de la place et va commencer à devenir rouge dans mon cerveau, comme je vous l'ai montré tout à l'heure. Eh bien, l'intelligence émotionnelle, c'est faire qu'un problème reste un problème, mais ne devienne pas une difficulté. Parler à son N plus 1, c'est un problème, ça ne doit pas être une difficulté. Vivre en couple, c'est un problème, ça ne doit pas devenir une difficulté. C'est-à-dire que ce qui est fondamental, c'est ne pas accepter qu'un problème devienne autre chose qu'un problème. ça doit rester quelque chose de neutre, qui est en dehors de vous. Osez, osez en parler, osez dire il faut que je te parle osez en réunion dire voilà, il faut que je vous dise voilà ce qui… car sinon, ça va devenir une difficulté. Autrement dit, souvenez-vous-en, un problème peut rester un problème pendant 21 jours, mais le 22ème jour, il devient une difficulté, parce que vous n'avez pas osé en parler. Et donc l'intelligence émotionnelle, si vous voulez, c'est ne pas en tout cas transformer un problème en une difficulté. Mon ex-femme, qui est une femme remarquable, mais qui quelque part était devenue maniaco-dépressive, quand on allait au restaurant, tout devenait une difficulté. C'était trop salé, c'était pas assez cuit, ça manquait de vinaigre, ça manquait de machin, il faisait trop chaud. Si vous voyez que tout devenait une difficulté, alors moi évidemment qui essaye toute ma vie de me dire je veux bien avoir des problèmes, mais je ne veux pas avoir de difficultés. Ça ne pouvait plus le faire à un moment donné. Alors, si vous voulez, ce que je crois qui est important, c'est que vous vous souveniez qu'un problème doit rester un problème. Et je vais vous donner cette phrase très belle d'Edgar Ford. C'est un beau cadeau que je vais vous faire. Edgar Ford est un type que j'aimais beaucoup, il avait beaucoup d'humour. Edgar Ford, il a dit un ennemi... c'est quelqu'un avec qui vous n'avez pas encore pris le temps de déjeuner. Un ennemi, c'est quelqu'un avec qui vous n'avez pas encore pris le temps de déjeuner. Qu'est-ce que c'est fort ? Plus vous avez un problème avec quelqu'un, plus il faut se rapprocher de votre peur. Mais attention, pas dans la machine, pas à la cafétéria de Jem. Prenez un endroit en dehors de la maison ou en dehors de l'entreprise. C'est-à-dire un endroit neutre, c'est très important. Allez en dehors de la machine et je vous jure que vous ne le regrettez pas. Et vous direz, écoute, je t'invite parce que je crois qu'il est bien qu'on se parle. Mais en dehors de la machine. D'accord ? En dehors de la loi. Nous avons tous un secret. Le secret, c'est l'attractivité. Cette attractivité que vous avez, parce que je le vois là, avec vous, il n'est pas réservé qu'à certains. Tout le monde l'a. Le problème, c'est que certains ont des gènes qui leur empêchent de laisser parler leur secret. Les trois quarts du temps, si vous voulez, on se dit Pourquoi moi ? La base de l'intelligence émotionnelle, c'est l'autorisation. Parce que je le vaux bien, pourquoi pas moi ? Et donc, si vous vous autorisez votre partie lumière, vous allez irradier sur les autres. Mais si vous arrivez en vous culpabilisant, vous allez diminuer cette lumière. Donc qu'est-ce que nous dit l'intelligence émotionnelle ? Elle nous dit, premièrement, en te levant le matin, il y a un poste, pourquoi pas moi ? Donc, au lieu de dire why vous dites why not Pourquoi est très castrateur. Et pourquoi pas ? Pourquoi pas ? ouvre beaucoup. Donc, notez-le bien. Et pourquoi pas ? est une extraordinaire phrase d'intelligence émotionnelle parce que ça ouvre. Maman, je peux sortir demain soir avec mes copains ? Ah, pourquoi pas ? Tu veux dire que tu n'es pas d'accord ? Attends, je n'ai pas dit que je ne suis pas d'accord, ma chérie, je vais réfléchir. Et pourquoi pas ? ce n'est pas pourquoi Pourquoi l'enfant va le prendre comme une intégration dans son univers ? Tandis que pourquoi pas ça laisse la porte ouverte, c'est un ralentisseur, donc notez-le bien. Et la phrase magique c'est pourquoi pas moi ? Donc voilà, le secret c'est pourquoi pas moi ? Maintenant, mécaniquement, il y a des choses qu'il faut faire, et avant tout, il faut être centré. Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire être centré ? Alors ensemble, on va faire un petit exercice. Vous allez voir. Et pour ça, je vais vous demander de vous lever. Leonardo da Vinci. Il a dessiné l'homme de Vitur qui est devenu le logo de Manpower. Toute l'intelligence émotionnelle est là. Dans un premier temps, vous allez vous mettre sur un pied. Et en plus, essayez de vous mettre sur la pointe du pied. Maintenant, imaginez qu'à la personne qui est à côté de vous, vous lui demandez une augmentation de 1000 euros par mois. Vous avez compris que ce n'est pas jouable. Imaginez un professeur qui arrive et qui vous dit, voilà, je vais vous faire un cours sur... Donc, effectivement, le corps a son importance, parce qu'on pense avec son corps. On est un peu une fusée. Donc, vous voyez, Léonard de Vinci, il commence par dessiner les pieds légèrement écartés, et faites comme si vous alliez au ski. Vous voyez, vous vous ancrez bien dans le sol. Voilà. Déjà, il faut que je te parle. Ça change tout. Parce que si c'est, il faut que je te parle. Entre la poire et le dessert, l'autre ne l'entendra pas. Je n'ai pas le temps de vous expliquer, ça s'appelle l'assertivité. Alors, vous êtes là, bien ancré dans le sol. Maintenant, je vais vous demander de fermer les yeux, de mettre vos deux bras le long de votre corps, bien en position verticale, et de vous faire très grand, comme si vous alliez toucher le plafond. Léonard de Vinci, il dit, tout d'abord, tout commence chez l'homme par voleo Voleo en latin, c'est qu'est-ce que je veux C'est quoi ma mission sur Terre ? Je suis venu sur Terre pour quoi ? Qu'est-ce que je veux dans la vie ? Qu'est-ce qui est important pour moi ? Eh bien, si vous voulez avoir de l'impact sur vos enfants, sur vos amis, sur vos collègues, commencez par savoir ce que vous voulez. Qu'est-ce que vous avez envie de leur dire ? Vous voulez les mener où ? Et donc ça, cette dimension verticale du latin voleo est fondamentale, dit Léonard de Vinci. Et ça, ça ne doit plus bouger. Je dois être clair dans ce que je veux, c'est-à-dire l'angle, le projet que j'ai en moi. Quelle est ma mission sur Terre ? Moi j'ai compris que ce n'était pas de gagner de l'argent, c'était plutôt d'être curé et de prêcher comme je le fais ce soir. Et donc, ce qui est important, c'est que la fonction que vous allez occuper corresponde à votre mission. C'est-à-dire, vous êtes venu faire quoi sur Terre ? Donc, premièrement, l'intelligence émotionnelle nous dit, réfléchis, Philippe Varin dit, ayez rendez-vous chacun 20 minutes par jour et dites-vous, tiens, pourquoi en ce moment j'ai 20 sur 20 ? Pourquoi j'ai 18 ? Pourquoi je suis heureux ? Pourquoi je suis emmerdé avec tel problème ? Il faudrait peut-être que je règle une chose. On ne va pas récupérer 5 points ceux qui ont 15, mais peut-être qu'on peut repasser à 16. Donc premièrement, qu'est-ce que je veux ? Et donc ça c'est votre connexion avec le ciel, les pieds dans la terre et la terre au ciel. Maintenant, tout doucement, attention messieurs, n'en profitez pas trop, parce qu'il y a beaucoup de belles dames ici, vous allez écarter les mains, les bras, vous écartez les bras. Voilà. Et là, vous avez bougé les bras, mais attention, sans bouger le corps, il ne faut pas bouger le corps du tout, uniquement les bras. Et là, Vous faites Shiva. En Inde, j'avais demandé à un artiste qui était en train de réparer un Bouddha, je lui ai dit, mais pourquoi, noble seigneur, pourquoi Shiva a tant de bras ? Et il me dit, mais elle n'a pas beaucoup de bras, c'est le mouvement des bras. Ça, c'est Poteo. Poteo, c'est qu'est-ce que je peux faire. Et donc, notre énergie, elle est centrée ici, au niveau de notre sternum, dans notre sacre. C'est la rencontre entre le vertical, qu'est-ce que je veux et qu'est-ce que je peux. Ce que je veux ne doit pas bouger, mais par contre, il y a une adaptabilité pour ce que je peux. Eh bien, l'intelligence émotionnelle nous apprend... à être centré. C'est-à-dire, sache ce que tu veux et ne veux pas plus que ce que tu peux. C'est-à-dire que vous allez raccourcir un peu vos bras, regardez. N'achetez pas une maison à 3 millions d'euros si vous ne pouvez vous l'acheter qu'à 800 000. Parce que sinon, vous allez être comme ça et du coup, vous allez être stressé. Parce que vous ne pouvez pas. Alors, regardez, on va faire ça. Tu peux filmer ça, tu vas t'éclater. Regardez, faites ça. Vous voyez, voilà. Peut-être, et c'est là. Alors là, vous allez pouvoir maintenant vous applaudir d'abord. Tout est magnifique. Et regardez. C'est ça, petit à petit, l'oiseau fait son nid. Alors, qu'est-ce que je peux commencer à faire ? Vous commencez à faire ça, allez-y, faites ça. Puis après, hop, maintenant je peux ça. Maintenant je peux ça. Puis maintenant je peux ça. Puis je vais m'adapter. Mais je continue à savoir ce que je veux. Alors, la formule magique à noter, notez-le, c'est a miracle at a time c'est-à-dire un miracle à la fois. Notez-le, c'est la clé de l'intelligence émotionnelle. La clé de l'intelligence émotionnelle, c'est un miracle à la fois. Les gens qui sont stressés, c'est les gens qui veulent tout en même temps. Alors ça devient un vrai ventilateur. Et alors ici, au niveau du chakra, c'est très encombré et du coup ça se traduit par un accident cardiovasculaire. Et ce qui est important, c'est qu'ici ça respire. Tenez, vous allez mettre vos mains comme ça et vous allez tous faire ça. Hop, voilà. Ça, c'est important. Moi, je le sens. Je sens qu'ici, vous commencez à être posé, mais très vite, c'est venu. C'est ça que l'autre va ressentir en face. Alors, ça se sent, le charisme passe par le chakra qui se trouve ici et ça se transmet par le regard. Le regard, nos yeux ne sont pas une caméra, c'est un projecteur. C'est le projecteur de l'énergie qu'on a en soi. Mais, quand la personne rentre dans la pièce, ça se passe toujours ici, on voit si la personne est centrée ici. C'est un Wi-Fi. Et ce Wi-Fi, on le sent. Ça ne se voit pas. Napoléon était petit, De Gaulle est très grand. Tous les bouquins qui existent, qui vous disent qu'il faut parler fort, tout ça, c'est pipeau. Ce n'est pas des listes sur le charisme, c'est des livres de com'. Moi, je vous parle du vrai charisme. Le charisme, c'est quand vous êtes centré et que vous dégagez un wifi qui est équilibré. Et l'enfant notamment le sent, les animaux le sentent. Les chats notamment. Les chats le sentent très bien et du coup deviennent des vrais chiens. Moi, mon chat, j'avais des vraies conversations avec lui. Surtout quand j'ai divorcé. Il faut dire que c'était un mâle, ça aide. Alors je lui disais, un gribouille, c'est dur les femmes. Parce que j'étais centré. Mais mes filles qui tiraient la queue du chat et qui s'amusaient, elles ne dégageaient pas de wifi. Donc le chat qui est féminin est très sensible, plus que le chien. C'est comme le cheval. Le cheval, moi je travaille beaucoup avec des managers avec les chevaux, c'est fondamental. Le cheval, si vous n'êtes pas centré, il ne vient pas vers vous. Parce que s'il sent que vous êtes... Lui en plus, il a quatre raisons d'être ancré. Nous, on n'en a que deux. Il faut que ça compte pour quatre. Donc, il est très important d'être ancré dans le sol. Voilà. Alors, chose que je voulais vous dire après, c'est la dernière chose avant qu'on passe aux émotions. Notez-le bien, nous, est une personne à part entière. C'est tellement important. Vous savez, le jour où j'ai découvert ça, ça a changé ma vie et j'ai réussi mon divorce. Pourquoi ? Parce que très souvent, On est dans l'échange et on n'est pas dans le partage. L'échange et le partage, ça n'a rien à voir. L'échange, c'est commercial, c'est toi contre moi. Le partage, c'est avoir compris que nous est la troisième personne, le fameux Saint-Esprit. Et qu'on peut très bien avoir une personne bien à côté, mais que le nous ne fonctionne plus. Et c'est comme ça que j'ai réussi mon divorce. C'est-à-dire que j'ai très bien compris que la femme avec qui j'ai passé 15 ans était quelqu'un de très bien, c'était le toi, il y avait le moi, mais c'était ridicule de dire ouais, puis toi, t'as fait… C'était une peine perdue. C'est tout simplement que le nous avait cessé son chemin. Et ça, c'est très important, notez-le bien. Nous est une personne à part entière. Si vous avez trois enfants, ce n'est pas pareil de discuter avec les trois enfants en même temps ou uniquement avec votre fils, ou uniquement quand il y a les parents, ou quand il y a uniquement les filles. C'est-à-dire qu'on ne se raconte pas les mêmes choses. Vous invitez un ami de plus à dîner, ça change toute la tablée du dîner. Ça change le nous Eh bien, arrêtez de reprocher à l'autre. Posez-vous plutôt la question Quel est le nous Est-ce qu'on prend assez soin de nous Et ça, c'est une belle proposition. C'est une proposition de vie qui ne vous stressera pas. Et de dire, mon chéri, j'aimerais qu'on t'en parle et que dorénavant, on prenne un peu plus soin de nous, car je pense qu'on a été peut-être toi de ton côté et moi de mon côté. Il faut peut-être restructurer le nous. Eh bien, le nous, on le voit maintenant en termes d'intelligence émotionnelle. Alors là, je n'ai pas le temps de vous l'expliquer. En tout cas, notez-le, nous est une personne à part entière. Et ça m'a permis de me quitter en très bon terme avec mon ex-femme. C'est-à-dire qu'on a compris que ce n'était pas la peine de se jeter les affaires à la figure, c'était ni toi ni moi, c'est que le nous avait fini son chemin. Et ça a permis de régler bien des choses avec beaucoup de paix. Alors ça, je vous le souhaite, je vous le souhaite, et je souhaite que vous le mettiez en application. Nous est une personne à part entière. Si vous voulez, la base de l'intelligence émotionnelle, le trust en américain, est très simple. Je fais ce que je dis et je dis ce que je fais. C'est clair. On l'avait vu ce matin, ce matin, excusez-moi, tout à l'heure. Ce qui est fondamental dans l'intelligence émotionnelle, c'est ce premier paradigme. Je fais ce que je dis, je dis ce que je fais. Si vous n'êtes pas là-dedans, dites-vous qu'il y a quelque chose qui va se passer dans le cerveau et que vous allez être en zone grise. Donc premièrement, peu importe ce que vous allez faire, mais le tout c'est de le dire. Alors attention, je n'ai pas dit être transparent, mais être clair dans les règles du jeu. Notez-le bien. La transparence, je n'y crois pas. L'intelligence émotionnelle nous dit... Nietzsche d'ailleurs dit il y a de l'indécence à montrer ses cinq doigts On a tous un petit jardin secret, on a un truc. Mais au moins que les règles du jeu soient claires. Voilà, c'est ça, c'est au niveau des règles du jeu. Et l'intelligence émotionnelle nous dit ça. Deuxièmement, c'est, et ça je ne suis pas inquiet avec vous, c'est être 100% là. Donc, admettons qu'en démarrant ici, j'étais à 87%. Eh bien, je vous jure que depuis tout à l'heure, je vous donne 100% de mes 87%. C'est ça, l'intelligence émotionnelle. L'intelligence émotionnelle, c'est jamais être à 100% de 100%. Parce que là, vous allez être exhausted, vous allez être épuisé. C'est pas comme ça que ça se passe. Mais le jour où il y a l'épreuve, le championnat, le machin, c'est donner tout ce qu'on a dans le ventre et de se dire j'ai été là Peu importe qu'on divorce, qu'on machin, qu'on rate un truc. Mais est-ce que j'ai été là ? Beaucoup de jeunes sont tout le temps avec leur iPad, leur machin. Moi, quelqu'un qui ne me regarde pas dans les yeux, qui n'est pas complètement là avec moi, il n'a plus l'affaire. Moi, ce qui me frappe avec les patrons, c'est que plus je monte dans la hiérarchie et que je suis avec des gens valables, mais le mec, il est complètement là. Ça ne lui viendra pas l'idée de laisser son iPhone sonner, etc. Il est 100% là. Alors, des fois, ils sont fatigués, ils sont même des fois en burn-out, puisque j'en coach, mais au moins, ils sont là. Donc, le vrai respect, notez-le, c'est être là. Et je dirais même que vous n'aurez plus du tout de regrets après, notez-le bien. C'est-à-dire que quand on a donné ce qu'on avait dans la relation, dans son travail, comme vous dans la conférence depuis tout à l'heure, en partant, je sais que vous n'aurez rien raté. Moi, je vous aurais donné tout ce que je peux, et vous, vous aurez pris ce que vous pouvez. Du coup, il n'y aura pas de regrets. Donc notez-le, la bonne affaire, quand on est là, c'est qu'il n'y a plus de place pour le regret, parce qu'on a livré la bête. Tandis que moi, ce que je me suis dit quand j'ai divorcé, je me suis dit étais-tu vraiment là ? Est-ce que nous étions vraiment ensemble ? Et là, presque la dépression qui est venue. Ça a été très dur pour moi. Alors je me suis dit plus jamais Dorénavant, je serai là. Vous avez compris ? C'est très important. Ce qui est important déjà, c'est soit d'être bien dans ses pompes. Quelqu'un qui ne va pas bien, quelqu'un qui n'a pas pris soin de lui parce qu'il le vaut bien, ne pourra pas donner aux autres. Et donc, ensuite, qu'est-ce qu'on va appeler l'altruisme ? Et ça, c'est l'abbé Pierre qui me l'a appris. C'est réussir son égoïsme à travers l'autre. c'est-à-dire à travers son enfant. Mais ça continue à être de l'égoïsme, sauf que ça me fait plaisir de tout mettre en œuvre pour que lui réussisse. Et donc, au lieu que nous soyons le simple centre de cet égoïsme, l'enfant devient un objet de transitivité. Ce qui fait que la vraie formule ne devrait pas être je t'aime mais je m'aime C'est-à-dire que je t'aime ça ne veut rien dire. Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ? Ça veut dire en fait, moi, il y en a un, il y en a être bien avec toi, ce quoi, ici, et toi, être mon objet de plaisir. Et moi, il y en a être bien en ce moment avec toi. Donc, notez-le, l'intelligence émotionnelle nous dit je t'aime n'existe pas. C'est de l'hypocrisie. En fait, la vraie formule, c'est je m'aime à travers toi Donc, qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un couple ? C'est une mutualisation d'égoïsme. Qu'est-ce que c'est ? Évidemment. Et d'ailleurs, pour garder cette mutualisation, ça va s'appeler la jalousie. Touche pas à mon mec. Parce que c'est mon territoire, c'est mon mec. Qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un village ? C'est une mutualisation d'égoïsme, parce qu'on ne va pas chacun avoir notre église. Qu'est-ce que c'est qu'une entreprise ? C'est une mutualisation d'égoïsme. Et quand on est dans une entreprise, tous les salariés se moquent de l'entreprise. Ce qui les intéresse, c'est qu'ils ont trouvé un bras de levier par rapport à leur égoïsme et leur plaisir à ce moment-là. Mais si on leur propose 500 euros de plus chez le concurrent, le lendemain, ils vont chez le concurrent, c'est évident. Et ils font un pot de revoir en disant je vous aime, vous êtes toute ma vie En attendant, ils se cassent, poussent. C'est évident. Donc, en fait, il faut arrêter de se... L'intelligence émotionnelle nous dit arrêtons d'être hypocrite et de nous cacher la face. Donc, notez-le, ce qui intéresse l'autre, c'est lui. Donc, le bon commercial, puisqu'il y a des DCF ici, c'est pas de parler du produit, c'est de parler du client. Ce qui intéresse le client, c'est en quoi c'est une bonne affaire pour lui. Ce qui intéresse l'autre, c'est en quoi t'es une bonne affaire pour moi. Et l'égoïsme, c'est ce qui fait tourner le monde. Donc, l'intelligence émotionnelle nous dit, prends soin de ton égoïsme à travers l'autre, mais surtout, sois plus intéressé qu'intéressant. Intéresse-toi à lui. C'est lui qui l'intéresse, ce n'est pas toi. Donc, en lui disant, t'es belle ma chérie, voilà, ça c'est intéressant parce que tu rassures l'égoïsme de ta chérie. Alors, le maillon fort, c'est la dernière chose que je voulais vous dire avant qu'on regarde vos tests. C'est l'émotion. Alors, les émotions, on en a dit l'essentiel. Et souvenez-vous, la joie est. C'est-à-dire, je ne vais pas m'occuper de la joie. Par contre, ce qui est important, ce sont le club des gènes. Et les gènes, vous les avez ici et dans la vignette que je vous ai mise dessous. Vous avez même les causes profondes de ces gènes. Si vous dites à quelqu'un, homme ou femme, Oh, dis donc, bravo pour ce que tu as réussi hier etc., la personne va être rassurée sur sa compétence. Si on devait, au niveau archaïque, dit Freud, pour les femmes, c'est faire un enfant, pour l'homme, c'est l'érection. Ce qui fait qu'à Knossos, etc., à Karnak, vous voyez, il n'y a que des sexes en érection, parce que les pharaons étaient obsédés par ça. Est-ce que je suis compétent sexuellement ? Pour les femmes, ça va se traduire par avoir un enfant. beaucoup de femmes ont un enfant juste pour se montrer qu'elles sont compétentes. Croyez-moi, 22 ans de coaching, si vous saviez ce que j'ai entendu. Eh oui, c'est la façon d'être compétente, et c'est pour ça que les hommes vont aux putes. C'est pour ça que chacun a sa compétence. Voilà. Alors, deuxième chose, deuxième peur. La peur féminine, notez-le bien. La peur féminine, c'est peur de ne pas être aimée. Donc quand vous dites à quelqu'un Oh, ça fait plaisir de te voir vous le rassurez dans son équation féminine de la peur. Et donc vous faites de l'intelligence émotionnelle. Donc voilà les deux grandes peurs. Donc quand on dit à un enfant Oh, c'est bien, t'as fait popo, etc. eh bien il est content dans sa compétence, les mamans, eh bien elles t'aiment très fort. Voilà, alors là, c'est la totale et l'enfant n'a plus peur. C'est la base de l'intelligence émotionnelle. La deuxième des émotions qui vient tout de suite derrière la peur, qui s'enchaîne, c'est la surprise. Qu'est-ce que c'est que la surprise ? La surprise, c'est une réinitialisation de notre projet, quel qu'il soit, même si c'est une bonne surprise. Donc j'aimerais que vous notiez que la surprise, de toute façon, est fatigante. Si par exemple, Benjamin pensait rentrer tranquillement chez lui le soir, puis pour lui faire une bonne surprise, Jennifer, il ouvre la porte, elle a invité 15 potes et 30 amis et plus la famille. Je prétends que ce n'est pas une si bonne surprise que ça, et que pendant 20 minutes, il va falloir qu'il s'en remette. Pourquoi ? Parce qu'il va falloir réinitialiser ce à quoi il avait pensé d'abord. Donc notez-le, en intelligence émotionnelle pure, il n'y a pas de bonne et de mauvaise surprise. La surprise fatigue de toute façon, parce que c'est réinitialiser ce que j'avais prévu, même si c'est bon. Et donc, potentiellement, faites très attention, ça fatigue. Je veux insister là-dessus et tout de suite, pour que vous le compreniez, je vais vous montrer deux choses. Ici, regardez, j'avais découpé dans le Figaro, c'était le prix Nobel de l'économie. Il avait, je ne sais plus comment il s'appelle, Jean Tirole. Il a mis, j'ai mis 30 minutes pour me remettre de mes émotions. Maintenant, regardez la vidéo que je vais vous montrer. On ne peut pas avoir de meilleure surprise. Regardez dans quel état était Giscard d'Estaing. Le 8 juin, pour moi c'était émouvant parce que j'étais sur un char en Autriche, on était sur la tête, on était à pied, devant simplement, de la première armée française, on avait traversé l'Allemagne, on arrivait en Autriche, on était dans un petit champ, un pré, avec des pommiers, etc. Et tout d'un coup on dit on s'arrête, c'est fini, c'est l'armée civile. Et on a été pris par surprise, on ne s'attendait pas à ça. On a été d'ailleurs à la fois très choqués et très troublés parce que c'était la fin d'une grande aventure devenue victorieuse en fait et nous n'avions plus l'objectif à ce moment-là. Donc on s'est arrêté, on s'est dit qu'est-ce qu'on fait, qu'est-ce qu'on devient. quelque part dans le cerveau, c'est ça qui est important, souvenez-vous, c'est fatigant. Je n'ai pas dit qu'à l'arrivée, on n'est pas content. Je dis juste qu'il faut s'en méfier, il faut l'utiliser avec parcimonie, parce que c'est fatigant. Ensuite, la chose dans cette vignette que je voudrais que vous vous souveniez, c'est que, et ça vous allez le répéter avec moi, c'est l'avant-dernière chose que vous allez répéter, c'est, écoutez bien, on a des milliers de sentiments, mais il n'y a que six émotions. C'est-à-dire que qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un sentiment ? Un sentiment, c'est un mix de plusieurs émotions. Et on ne peut pas travailler sur une holding, c'est-à-dire sur un sentiment. On ne peut travailler que sur les émotions qui composent le sentiment. Et donc, dès que vous n'avez pas l'un de ces cinq mots, Peur, surprise, tristesse, dégoût, colère, dites-vous que c'est un sentiment dont il s'agit. Si quelqu'un arrive et dit à ce moment-là j'ai les glandes j'ai les glandes, ce n'est pas une émotion, c'est un sentiment. Il faudra dire en quoi tu as été surpris, en quoi tu es triste, en quoi tu es dégoûté et de quoi tu as peur. Si vous prenez la jalousie dont on parlait tout à l'heure, la jalousie, on ne peut pas travailler en intelligence émotionnelle sur la jalousie. Il faut dire, tiens, tu es jaloux, qu'est-ce qui t'a surpris, en quoi t'es triste, en quoi t'as été dégoûté et de quoi t'as peur. Et là, on peut travailler. Donc, j'aimerais que vous redisiez avec moi, on ne peut pas travailler sur un sentiment, on ne peut travailler que sur les émotions qui le composent. Vous êtes prêts ? 3, 4. On ne peut pas travailler sur un sentiment, on ne peut travailler que sur les émotions qui le composent. On ne peut pas travailler sur un sentiment, on ne peut travailler que sur les émotions qui le composent. On ne peut pas travailler sur un sentiment, on ne peut travailler que sur les émotions qui le composent. Applaudissez-vous. Et alors, pour terminer sur cette vignette, je dirais que la porte d'entrée la plus élégante, notez-le, c'est la surprise. C'est-à-dire, si par exemple, votre chéri, suite à une soirée, commence à vous faire une crise de jalousie, si vous lui dites de quoi tu as peur, en quoi tu es dégoûté, ça ne le fera pas. Ça a un peu arde. Tandis que si vous lui dites, qu'est-ce qui t'a surpris ? Et ça marche particulièrement en entreprise, parce que je sais qu'il y a des gens ici qui sont peut-être dans les RH ou autres. Donc, pensez que la surprise est la porte d'entrée la plus élégante. Quand vous sentez que quelqu'un a une colère, puisque la colère est la résultante qui éclate, Au bout de toutes ces émotions. La colère est toujours le bruit de toute cette roue des émotions. Donc ce qui est intéressant, ce n'est pas la colère en tant que telle, c'est où est le dégoût, où est la tristesse, où est la surprise, où est la peur. Quelqu'un qui est en colère, si vous commencez par lui dire Mais mon chéri, qu'est-ce qui t'a surpris ? Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ? Eh bien là, c'est une porte élégante. Mais si vous commencez par lui dire De quoi t'as peur ? ça ne le fera pas. Donc pensez à cela, la porte d'entrée la plus élégante, c'est la surprise, et particulièrement évidemment en entreprise. Mais pensez à agir, action, c'est-à-dire l'intelligence émotionnelle, c'est action. Et dites-vous qu'il y a un livre qui vient de sortir sur le pape. qui s'appelle Ainsi fait-il Il y en a marre des soit-il les gens y conduisent mal. Non, et moi, je fais quoi ? Qu'est-ce que vous faites ? Alors, regardez. Regardez ce Just do it avec cet acteur américain absolument génial. Et ensuite, on fera une petite cérémonie de fermeture. Hier, vous avez dit demain. Donc faites-le ! Faites vos rêves se réaliser ! Faites-le ! Certaines personnes rêvent de succès pendant que vous vous réveillez et vous travaillez fort. Rien n'est impossible ! Vous devriez arriver au point où n'importe qui ne quitterait. Et vous ne vous arrêtez pas là ! Non ! Qu'est-ce que vous attendez ? Faites-le ! Just do it ! Yes you can ! Just do it ! If you're tired of starting over, stop giving up. L'idée c'est just do it. Qu'est-ce que vous allez faire ? Parce qu'il y a un phénomène qu'on appelle le Big Mo aux Etats-Unis. Le Big Mo, c'est le Big Moment. Quand on a vécu quelque chose de fort comme ce soir, pendant 21 jours, vous allez être transporté par cette énergie. Mais si vous ne la mettez pas en action dans les 21 jours, c'est foutu. Quand vous allez à un spectacle et que vous êtes encore rempli de cette énergie, vous avez 21 jours. Donc il vous reste 21 jours à partir de maintenant pour mettre en route quelque chose. Donc ce que je vous souhaite, c'est que chacun vous mettiez en route un élément que vous avez soit appris, soit découvert, soit re-appris ce soir, car je ne vous ai rien appris. Je n'étais qu'un perroquet. Je n'ai rien inventé. Sous-titrage Société Radio-Canada","completion":"Le texte aborde l'importance de l'intelligence émotionnelle dans notre quotidien et la façon dont elle peut enrichir notre vie personnelle et professionnelle. En s'appuyant sur les travaux d'Antonio Damasio, l'auteur souligne que les émotions et la raison sont intimement liées et que comprendre cette connexion peut améliorer la prise de décision et le bien-être général. La notion de \\"rendez-vous avec soi\\" est introduite comme un moyen essentiel pour cultiver cette intelligence, en s'accordant du temps pour réfléchir à ses actions et leurs impacts. L'auteur explique que nos émotions sont des alliées précieuses qui nous aident à réagir aux situations, à condition de les appréhender intelligemment. Il met en lumière le concept des \\"marqueurs somatiques\\" de Damasio, qui montre comment nos expériences émotionnelles passées influencent nos décisions futures. L'intervention souligne aussi l'importance du pardon, de la gestion du stress, et de la communication effective pour gérer et transformer positivement nos émotions. Enfin, l'auteur insiste sur l'urgence d'agir sur les prises de conscience suscitées par l'intelligence émotionnelle, en soulignant l'importance de la mise en action des apprentissages pour éviter le regret et vivre pleinement."},{"prompt":"Summarise the following transcript: david: So for the people that might've missed this we've launched this initiative where we will translate Validated high quality prompts from English to different languages. And we've asked the Agilea community and the Hugging Face community to take the lead in terms of leading these translation efforts and communicating and all these kinds of things. So I think gathering, yeah, more and more high quality prompts for different languages, because sometimes these automatic translations, it can be off. And yeah, that's one of the reasons that we. Yeah. I want the community to help and pitch in and yeah, Krishna has offered to, to lead a handy example. So if if someone might be interested in that, feel free to pitch in and go to the hugging face discord. Go to the data is better together page and then you'll find it there. If anyone wants to do a brief introduction, feel free to say hi, or maybe tell us something, what you're working on, but otherwise I will maybe ask Elad Levi to give a brief introduction about what he's been doing on intent based prompt calibration. How that's, how that works. It was translated in a practical way into the super cool out of prompt open source project that you've been working on together with three friends, I believe. And how you actually built that on top of Argella and what's the idea behind that. So feel free to, to give a brief introduction. Glad to have all of you here and then I'll give the mic over to Elad. So you can start if you want. elad: Great. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. So what we will talk today a little bit. So I will first describe the challenge of prompt sensitivity and I will show some very surprised results of how much large language models are really sensitive to the prompt. Then what I will describe is the previous methods for prompt optimizations and the issues that they have. I will then describe our contribution, our methods and how we tackle these issues. And then we will discuss a little bit about the auto prompt. So we build an open source system that implement these methods. And using also Argila as a UI server. So it's like a really cool system. And we will talk about the system and we'll show some demo. So about prompt sensitivity. So you have these two prompts. So in the first one, it's almost exactly the same phrasing. Just is does instead of is, adding some review. Cool. looking exactly the same. So if you will ask some human annotators and give it as an instruction to the annotators, I'm sure you will get the exact same results. There's no really difference. But when you're asking a large language model, you are seeing here that that the there is like very High discrepancy between the results. So we prepare some spoiler benchmark. It doesn't really matter what exactly was was this benchmark, but it's contained about 500 samples. We run these 10 times, so we get statistical significant differences. And you can see that there is a huge gap between the performances of the two probes. So GPT 4, which You think about it as state of the art very similar to human, but he perform significantly different on these semantic differences. Now, another thing that many people's are doing is they take this prompt and they like GPT 4 suggest a prompt. So we instruct GPT 4 to take this initial prompt and generate some prompt, which is better. And you can see that it looks really nice. You can see that is really describing the task of spoiler classification. And he add description of what is spoiler. So it's looking it looks amazingly well, however, the results are even worse than what we saw earlier. So there was no improvement. And although it looks good, the results are not great. So even if you if something is look good. When you evaluate it, the performance might be not that great. Another issue that we try to tackle is the prompt ambiguity issue. So when you have a prompt, you can see here the example of advertisement classification, yes or no. You describe the prompt in a few sentences. So always the ambiguity of the language. Of what to do in all the edge cases. So you see here the example of describing some situation of purchase. Some of the people will say that this is advertisement, and some of the people will say that this is not advertisement. There is this ambiguity. And this is something that we want to to resolve this ambiguity issue of the prompt itself. Now, the last thing that I want to explain about the prompt sensitivity is the changing in the behavior over time. So even if you have found a great prompt, You are satisfied with the results. OpenAI is changing constantly the version. They want to update the model, the knowledge base of the model. And you can see here that there is huge discrepancy between the results between the different versions, both with respect to the accuracy of the model on some tasks. So you see the GPT 4 has decreased accuracy on this task and GPT 3. 5 actually increased the accuracy. So it's really flickery, but also with respect to the behavior of the model, which is like even more important. So you can see that less stop apologizing or other behavior, for example, verbosity. So the behavior of the model constantly change and you need it to all the time update your prompt accordingly. So the conclusion is that we cannot try the prompt engineering process, the regular prompt engineering process. And we need to do prompt engineering correctly, doing some optimization, methodology correct. And there are a few methods that suggest how to do it. And I would like to describe a very recent work, which is called OPRO. And what we did, they did in this method is a very simple process. So they start with some initial prompt. Let's figure it out. So they try to solve some mathematical questions and let's figure it out. What's the instruction? It's like a chain of, you can think about it as a rephrasing of a chain of thought. And then they evaluate the score of this initial prompt. Okay. So they have the benchmark. They use a well known benchmark of GSM 8K. Okay. Okay. And you see the score 61. Okay. So the evaluation is done according to the benchmark. And then they took the prompt itself and the score and they provide it in, they put it in some meta prompt and the meta prompt described the task the task that need to be done. So he described that you have Few prompts and they score this data score and he asked GPT 4 in this case He asked the model to provide a new prompt which has higher score. Okay, so you provide few Samples and they score and you ask the model itself to provide a new prompt which has better score and you could Provide him also like few examples of the prompts in which there was a failure And then you can see, this is the new prompt that was suggested. Let's solve the problem. And now you continue the process. So you continue to evaluate this prompt. You put it in the meta prompt. And you let the model do these iterations until it gets to the calibrated prompt. This is iterative process. And you can see here the results that they tested on BigBench hard, and they got up to 50 percent improvement on 2023 challenging reasoning task. So they got some really nice improvement. So this is the OPPO paper. Now there is more recent work which called prompt engineering prompt engineer. I will not go into the full details of this work. This is work that simply did a prompt engineering on this metaprompt. We have the metaprompt that provide the new prompt. So they did just prompt engineering. many experiments. This is experimental paper. And I will not, most of the things they test actually not improved the metaprom, but they have something that we take from this paper of splitting up the to two to two steps such that in the first step, we provide the current prompt, a false example, like the error and ask him to provide some error analysis. And then we put this error analysis to the meta prompt to generate the new prompt. Okay. So this is the idea that we took and indeed, this is something that improving the results. Now, this metaprompt and using large language model as optimizer, the advantage of this approach for port optimization, that you can run it on every black box LLMs. You can run it on OpenAI proprietary model or Gemini. Whatever you like, you just use it on this black box LLM. However, the challenge with this approach that you need to iterate it with this very strong LLM, because the metaport requires strong LLM, on some high quality large benchmarks. So in order to improve it and give a good feedback to the model. You need very high quality, a large benchmark. And in many cases, this is not feasible or it's hard to get. either because there is a low resource task or the data set is a little bit biased. And of course, this is very costly. Running GPT 4 on very large data set with large amount of iteration in Opro they did About one thousand and six hundred iteration. So this is something which is very costly. It's get to up to a few hundred dollars. And we didn't have the money to do it. So we need to come with a new method which is much more efficient. So what was our idea? So our idea was very simple. You see you again, you give the model the initial prompt. Generate a spoiler movie classification, and then you see the nice UI for Agila. The model, the LLM model generates synthetic samples, so it generates about 10 synthetic samples. And you annotate them, yes, no, according to your labels. And so you annotated a few examples. And then after you finish this annotation you are letting the model optimize on top of this benchmark. So now we are using the same idea of Metaprom, where we provide this feedback, and we do the prompt optimization. So we get a new prompt, and we now generate a new synthetic data for the new prompt. Now the main idea that the synthetic data that we are generated are not like standards standard data set, but it's a boundary cases. So it's ask the cases that best differentiate between the different classes. So this is like the main tweak that we are doing. So this, since we are going on the boundary cases, we got very, distinguish very effective data set. Although we have a few samples because it can separate and isolate all these edge cases. So the idea is to calibrate according to the user intent and the user intent. You get it from these synthetic boundary cases. And here you can see the example. So what the model is getting is just the task description and the initial point. You see the the advertisement classification, yes or no. And this is the generated synthetic data that the model generate. We already saw it. It's really a boundary cases. So the model predict no, and this is a legitimate answer. But however, I was the annotator and I decided I want to be more conservative. And I told the model this example is indeed advertisement because you mentioned some company. And that in the next iteration, the model immediately understand and fix the prompt. And that he said that even if it was indirect advertisement. Oh, you just mentioned a competitor store. Then also in this case, annotated as yes. Now you see that now in this iteration, there was a synthetic data. In which there is no mentioning of of any company. So in this case, the model was over conservative. So it predicted as advertisement. Although I, as annotator, I said that it's not an advertisement. Again, this is an edge case. And after a few iterations, this is iteration six. The model catch all the nuance and get to the prompt accuracy of 97%. Okay, so he catch all these like boundary cases and was able to refine the prompt correctly. And it seems to work like very effectively. So about the evaluation process, so how we evaluate and compare ourselves to the previous method. So we want to evaluate ourselves on a real world use case, not on classic benchmark, reasoning benchmark like GSMK, because we thought that like these are not really a benchmark that, you take for, these are not real world use cases. So what We did a very simple evaluation process. We take very powerful model, GPT 4, and we provide very highly detailed prompt. You see this very high detail prompt for the spoiler classification task. So this prompt contain like all the nuance of what to do in all the edge cases, and it simulates human intent to a given task. And we use this prompt as a ground truth. So this is the prompt that was used to create the ground truth. Then we start with some initial prompt and try to converge to this prompt. We compare ourselves to the ground truth. And we compare between the different methods. We use the IMD review data set. This is a classical data set. And we test with respect to different tasks. And you can see the results. So on top, this is the red one is our method. And you can see below that this is Opro and the prompt engineering approach. And you can see that our method outperform previous methods. And you don't need too much samples with only between 30 and 50 samples. This is enough in order to get a very high quality results. And so you get to 30, between 30 and 50 samples. This is all that needs to be done. In all the cases we test on 30 iterations of the the model. So it's really not cost too much, not it's, it should not cost more than 1. This is like the target that that we, we achieve. And you can see here the example. So this is the initial prompt that we already saw that this we will contain a spoiler. You can see here that o simply rephrased the prompt. And this is prompt or indeed this is what it do is just phrasing the prompt, but it's very effective. We saw already that the prompts are highly sensitive and you get a boost in the performances. This is the prompt engineering. So indeed this is more descriptive prompt and the accuracy, of course is better. And this is our method. And you see how this is a highly detailed prompt. And it indeed catch all the nuance of the ground truth form and you get a boost in the performances you get to 92. 3 accuracy. So it's indeed improved significantly on top of the base prompt. Now, we, of course, did some ablation study, and that all the components are really essential. Of course, the synthetic data improves significantly, but what is interesting is that also the iterative process of generating the synthetic data in each iteration and not generating directly from the start all the synthetic data. This is also provide an improvement and it's really it's not surprising because in each step we prove that the problem and we want now to ask boundary cases on the new improved prompt and not on the bad initial prompt. Now, if we want to understand the effect of our method. So one of the important things that we are doing. is shifting the data distribution. So if you look at the spoiler classification task, so in the real world data set, in the IMDB review data set, less than 20 percent of the data set contain a real spoiler that was labeled as yes by the ground truth. But in our synthetic data set, We instructing the meta prompt to the model to provide a balanced dataset. Okay, so this is the part of the instruction, and you can see that indeed the data, the synthetic dataset is much more balanced, set, balanced dataset is close to the 50%. Yes and no. So this very important property of the synthetic data set, and we will see immediately the effect of this data shift distribution. So another thing we want to tackle that was not done in previous paper is tackling the generation task. So everyone working on the classification task, but Most of the real world use cases are a gener generation point and not classification point. And we suggest a new method to handle a generative task, which is very simple. So what we did, we take the generation port, so this is the generation port, generate some movie review with specific style and we translate it. To a ranking prompt, we did it by simply ask GPT 4 to generate from this generation prompt an initial ranking prompt. We already know that he knows to do it something that looks good. And you can see that he's doing some nice job. He ranked it between 1 to 5 this is the rank. And he provide a nice instruction for the ranking prompt. And then what we did. So we calibrated the ranking prompt. So we treated this classification. We already know how to solve a classification task, and we treat the calibration of the ranking prompt as a classification task. So in each iteration, we we generate synthetic edge cases. And we ask the human annotator to rank between one to five. And after we have this calibrated ranking prompt, we use it as a ranking model. So we generate synthetic samples using the current prompt that that we investigate. We evaluate using the ranking prompt, so there is no need for human intervention in the second part for human annotation. And we analyze the prompt performance according to the score. And using this iterative process, we suggest a new prompt, and now rank it. So for this second part, there is no human annotation. Only the first part. Again, you need only 30 examples of ranking prompt, and this is all you need for the generation task. So very simple. And you can see here the results. So This is the initial results. And using our method, you get to a calibrated prompt, which get almost to score a five, which is the best score. So the method is highly effective. Now what is interesting is when you apply these these methods on OPO and pe, this idea, you actually get degraded performances. comparing to the initial prompt. So you're getting worse prompt. And the reason for it is that if you are looking at the ranking Histogram of the real world of the IMD review view data set It looks like not surprisingly as some normal distribution around the mean, ranking around the tree So you have very few very few examples which get to the five score you see here very few examples. Now so now when you are fitting on top of this data set, the ranking problem, you will not able to distinguish correctly between four and five because there's not enough samples. So your anchor that you fit is not is not properly. Now of course the generation of the review of GPT four is at least something between four and five. It will not get improved, it will get worse because it doesn't know how to separate well. But remember that we are having the power, the synthetic data, to shift the distribution of the samples that were generated. And we ask the model in the metaprom to provide boundary cases between rank 4 and 5. And you can see the distribution here. And now when I'm fitting a ranking function on top of these, this data, he will be able to distinguish well between rank four and five. So the second phase in which we optimize the generation part is much more effective. And this goes to the boost in the performances. So this is like really nice results that we have. So now a little bit about Autopront. So Autopront is a system, an open source system that we build which implement this method. And it's nice because the system is really modular, and you can replace each component very easily. We already have very large users and companies that are using this system in production and got amazing feedback. So the system is composed by three main components. There is the dataset, which is connected, of course, to the database. But there is also some semantic DDoP in order not to generate synthetic data that are too much resembled to each other. So We also do some semantic deduping. The main class is the estimator class, and it is either and you can use it as the annotator and the predictor. So the annotator is the part that is responsible to generate the ground truth. And there is the predictor that is all that this is the optimization part that you are optimizing. And the ator can be connected to our gi a server with the amazing ui of our gi a and the predictor is, again, connect to the LLM, but you can change it. You can plug the annotato annotator to the LLM service, and of course we have the evaluator. And you can modify easily the score function. So the evaluator get the prediction and annotation and decide what is the score, how to compare between them. So what we can do with auto prompt, so we can do besides prompt optimization, which is the reason for the system. There is like also nice things that can be done with the system besides the productization. So one of them is the prompt distillation. So if suppose you have you are happy with the prompt in GPT four, and you want now to save cost and you want a GPT three prompt that, keep the performances of GP, GPT 4. So we call it a distillation. We want to distill the knowledge from GPT 4 to GPT 3. So what you can do, you can easily use The GPT-4 prompt as the annotator and train the GPT-3 as the predictor, and he will try to fit the performances of the GPT-4. So this is really nice. Another things that, that we are doing. It's prompt squashing and prompt batching. These are methods to squeeze your prompt. So if you have multiple prompts and or you want to send multiple samples in the same prompt, we are doing also this optimization. And again, this is for saving a cost. It's really helping in saving the cost. And of course, we are also, you can also use the report just to generate a synthetic benchmark and use it. Only for this purpose. And okay, so let me show you some example. And so I hope that you are seeing my screen. So in order to run, you simply, you can use, we have the run pipeline. You just need to write the prompt, the initial prompt and the task description. And you run it and you get to the, It will pop up in our Gila UI. You can just annotate. Yes, no, yes, no. And the moment you finish to annotate, you have your 10 example. You are seeing here okay. You are seeing here that it start to there is a listening on the Argilas server side. This is the implementation that we have. And the moment you finish, he process the sample. And in a second, he will suggest you see you got a new prompt. Of course, accuracy is hard because I annotated randomly. But you can see that it start generating a new prompt. Now, if you want, for example, to use LLM and not using an argila, so the only things that you need to do, so you see here, this is the annotation, the annotator the annotator configuration when I use the method argila, and I use the config file, And in order to make it some to replaces with LLM, I just need to replace the annotator with LLM. You can see here I'm using Google Jimini Pro. I have some instruction. This is the prompt that is used as the ground truth. So let's go to the run pipeline. And switch it to the to this annotator. And he will now do the iteration without using the the human annotator feedback. He will just compare himself to Germany 4. Let's wait for a second until we see okay, so we take so here you see generate the initial sample. It takes a little bit of time because we are asking a GPT 4 model and it's a long prompt, so it takes a few seconds. Here we finish here we finish the initialization. And now you can see that it is running Gemini. without using the annotation pipeline. So you can see that he's run, he's processing the sample, now he creates the annotation. In the second step, now he predicts, so this is GPT 3 and a half, so it's much faster. And now he will suggest a new prompt. So it's very simple. You don't need the human intervention in this one. So you get like this new prompt and it will get improved and improved. So to conclude, Okay, so elad: the conclusion. First of all, optimizing your prompt is a must. You must use a valid benchmark. I think this is like the main message from this presentation. Whatever method you use some benchmarking. Don't trust that something looks nice. The second thing is that LLM can do anything. They can generate synthetic data, they can do optimization very well, they are a highly effective tool that you need to use. And of course, Autoprompt is an open source. You are welcome to use it again. We have many companies that are already use it. It's completely free and open source and you can try and test it. And I encourage you. Thank you very much. david: Cool. Thank you for the presentation. It was really cool to to see and to hear in practice, and I think we got quite a lot of questions. So I'm going to try if you're ready for the fire. So maybe the last one that I I asked was, do you see any difference between the human and AI feedback during the optimization? So is the human feedback normally better in terms of generalization or in terms of intent based pump calibration? It's. On par. elad: So I usually, yeah, for sure. Human feedback is better when you have, most of our instruction to annotators are not we are some pro we show them an example. We instruct them very well. We do few iteration. And this is something that that you are not doing with the letter. You just trying to. Do some prompt engineering and optimize it. And this is the main advantage of using human annotator. Now, the other advantage is cost and efficiency. I'm using also LLM as annotator in some cases. But, for most of the tasks, I usually prefer to do it like human annotation. david: For most production cases. Okay, that's good to hear as also one of the things that Danny often mentions like our CEO that yeah, you really need to dive into the data to really understand what's going on, even though optimization to a certain up until a certain point is very useful and convenient, of course. And how do you see something like, for example for a basic classification example given that you're doing annotation, how do you see this approach differ compared to something like setfit? Because if you're annotating examples, you might be able to use those synthetically generated Entries as a way to actually train a set for classifier instead of using like LLMs to do that. elad: So our system actually support using using your own custom data set. I think that if you, the synthetic data is making it much more efficient and it's able to if you have a few hundred annotated samples on your data set, and yeah. You are fine with the cost of doing like this iteration on this data set then. It's very good approach. And we have actually spent last three meetings with the, some companies that wants to help with auto pom to to remove the synthetic part. They will just want use the, want to use the optimization, and this is. For sure, but in many cases you don't have this data set and you want to do it like more efficiency, efficiently. And for this, like you, the, I think the system is like very very well, very optimal. david: Okay, cool. And in terms of the synthetic parts, then you would replace it with your own data set and then just sample random samples from there and then iterate based on those. Okay. elad: Yeah, so we have the option also to insert a few samples of your data set, and when we generate synthetic data, we are not generating them from scratch. We are using these examples of the real data set and generate samples which are resembled to this data set. In order to not have some distribution shift. So this is very important. And in the I'm the big review that said we did it. We use about 10 samples off real reviews because otherwise, when you're generating from scratch completely, And then for sure you'll get suboptimal results because the model don't know the real world distribution. david: Yeah, that makes sense. And in terms of you mentioned forms calibration being able to use for generative tasks as well. Do you see any differences in for example the number of rankings that you force the model to define and some other differences in terms of how you would be able to use this in an optimal way? Because within this label, we are doing a lot of these Data set generation tasks. So it might be very interesting for us whenever we create a synthetic data set to actually use this. So what would be best practices in that sense? elad: Yes, I think that it's very challenging to annotated ranking task. I tried to do it and it's not easy to separate between this delicate separation between three and four. So I What we will do like we are trying we will do it like we will add it to the repo soon We want to add like few not one rank because this is challenging, but many attributes and rank it according to different labels and attributes And I think that this will be like a real Improvement to the current system because the current challenges the current challenge is that it's not easy to human to annotate properly and consistently. between one to five. It's not that easy task. david: Yeah, we have seen something similar with the data is better together efforts and these kind of things. And yeah, and the data are also different than even in the morning or in the afternoon, people tend to be more. Yes. And what's the trade off in your opinion in terms of having the potentially additional front length after prompt calibration or optimization versus a potential marginal gain in accuracy of the model elad: compared to david: what? Maybe the marginal gain in accuracy. So if you don't gain as much accuracy improvements. Based on the after the optimization compared to having the additional costs, so to say of having a longer prompt in, in terms of calling your LLM using your element in production after. elad: So there are like two. We want to actually important engineering. They have the ability. They instruct the model to create very compressed from and limited the number of tokens regarding the optimization process. We have, of course, like some stop criteria and we can, you have, you can limit the budget. So you can say that you want to optimize you have 20. So this is really nice. You can actually put the number of dollars that you want to optimize and optimize until like this stage. But of course we have some stopping criteria. If there's no improvement after fuel iteration, then the model stop to iterate. And you are not, david: okay. And yeah, feel free. If people have other questions in between, feel free to post them in the chat. Then I'll answer them later or leave viral. Sorry. And Chris had one question about is what's for you are goods. Number of examples to use a seed for the synthetic data generation when the task is a bit more niche for example, a medical domain or the finance domain, which might require a bit more funds. elad: Yeah, it's a good, from our experience again. using some 10, 20 real examples, and then let the model to generate about another 30. It's working great on many of the productive use cases that we saw. But of course, elad: We need. I need to look at the task in order to say exactly what is the number. And I'm suggesting to simply play a little bit with it. There are very few hyper parameters that you need to play with them. But again, the basic recipe, will work, I think very nicely also on this child david: yeah. So I'm not sure if you have any more comments from your side. Otherwise. Given that there are no more questions, I would like to thank you for the presentation. I really enjoyed it and I'm sure we will use the framework for some optimization with this label and potentially it might be interesting to see if there's a an integration possible. Yeah, as always the slides will be shared along with the presentation and everything will be uploaded for the people that maybe joined later. Keep track of YouTube and LinkedIn and other socials. And I would like to thank everyone for coming and then hope to see you soon to during one of one of our other meetups or somewhere online. So thanks. Thanks a lot for coming. Thank you very much. Goodbye.","completion":"David introduced an initiative to translate validated, high-quality prompts from English to other languages with the help of the Agilea and Hugging Face communities. This initiative emerged as a response to the sometimes inaccurate results of automatic translations. He also mentioned the opportunity for community members to contribute, specifically highlighting Krishna's leadership in a translation example. David then invited Elad Levi to discuss his work on intent-based prompt calibration and the development of a super cool open-source project based on this concept, using Argella as a UI server. Elad began his talk by addressing the challenge of prompt sensitivity in large language models (LLMs) and the surprising variations in results from seemingly minor semantic changes in prompts. He introduced the concept of prompt optimization, opposed to standard prompt engineering, to address these challenges effectively. Elad detailed his work on an open-source system called Autoprompt, which implements innovative methodologies for prompt optimization, including generating synthetic data for edge cases, iterative calibration, and using LLM as an optimizer. Elad also discussed the importance of using valid benchmarks and the significant role of human annotator feedback in improving the generalization and calibration of prompts. He touched upon the limitations and challenges of generating and annotating ranking tasks and suggested methods for efficiently handling generative tasks through calibration and iteration. Throughout the presentation, Elad showcased the effectiveness of their methodology in comparison to previous methods and emphasized the system's flexibility, modularity, and potential for cost-saving in production environments. In the Q&A session following the presentation, concerns about the trade-off between incremental gains in model accuracy versus the cost of longer prompts and additional iterations were addressed. Elad recommended starting with a small but representative set of real examples to seed synthetic data generation, especially in niche tasks. The session concluded with an acknowledgment of the potential for further optimization and integration with existing systems and a thank you to attendees."},{"prompt":"What implications, advantages and benefits does Autoprompt help realise in business or enterprise domains?","completion":"The development and introduction of Autoprompt into business or enterprise domains carry several significant implications, advantages, and benefits.

Explain using examples.What are the benefits, if any, of using both synthetic data and human annotation in this case?","completion":"The integration of human annotation into the prompt optimization loop, as seen in systems like Autoprompt, offers distinct advantages over systems that rely purely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for prompt optimization. This hybrid approach of combining human insights with synthetic data generation provides a more nuanced, accurate, and effective way to tailor language models for specific tasks or domains. Below, we explore the advantages and benefits of incorporating both human annotation and synthetic data into the prompt optimization process: # 1. **Enhanced Accuracy and Relevance** Example: Consider a customer service chatbot trained via LLMs for a healthcare provider.

Además, la perspectiva de un peso ideal es subjetiva y puede variar según criterios personales o estéticos. Sin embargo, para ofrecer una guía general basada en el Índice de Masa Corporal (IMC) que es comúnmente usado para categorizar los rangos de peso en adultos (aunque no toma en cuenta la masa muscular de manera específica), el rango considerado como normal va de un IMC de 18.5 a 24.9. Para calcular el peso ideal según el IMC para una persona con una altura específica, se puede usar la fórmula: [ Peso , (kg) = IMC , times , left( frac{Altura , (m)^{2}}{1} right) ] Considerando la altura de 175 cm (1.75 m) y 180 cm (1.80 m), aquí unos ejemplos: Para una altura de 175 cm (1.75 m): - En el rango bajo del IMC normal (18.5): [ 18.5 , times , 1.75^2 = 56.53 , kg ] - En el rango alto del IMC normal (24.9): [ 24.9 , times , 1.75^2 = 76.04 , kg ] Por lo tanto, para alguien de 175 cm buscando un físico atlético, un peso entre 56.5 kg y 76 kg puede ser considerado, aunque hacia el extremo superior se podría estar más cerca de un aspecto musculoso atlético, dependiendo de la composición corporal. Para una altura de 180 cm (1.80 m): - En el rango bajo del IMC normal (18.5): [ 18.5 times 1.80^2 = 59.85 , kg ] - En el rango alto del IMC normal (24.9): [ 24.9 times 1.80^2 = 80.35 , kg ] Para alguien de 180 cm, un peso entre 59.9 kg y 80.4 kg podría ser considerado como en el rango normal. Sin embargo, para un aspecto musculoso y atlético, probablemente querrás estar en el extremo superior de este rango o incluso un poco más, dependiendo de tu masa muscular. Estos cálculos ofrecen una guía general, pero es importante recordar que el IMC no distingue entre masa grasa y masa muscular. Para los atletas y personas con alta masa muscular, el IMC puede no ser un indicador exacto de salud o estética. La evaluación de la composición corporal, como la medición del porcentaje de grasa y la masa muscular, puede ofrecer una mejor guía para aquellos con objetivos específicos de fitness o composición corporal."},{"prompt":"Ahora toma en cuánta que está persona es un saiyajin misma constitución y cuerpo cual sería los pesos en este caso","completion":"Con el escenario imaginativo de que estamos calculando el peso ideal para un Saiyajin, un ser ficticio de la franquicia de \\"Dragon Ball\\", debemos tener en cuenta que, aunque comparten muchas similitudes con los humanos, sus capacidades físicas y condiciones corporales son bastante superiores debido a su naturaleza extraterrestre. Dado que el universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\" no proporciona información específica sobre el peso o la composición corporal ideal de los Saiyajin, solo podemos especular basándonos en su representación como seres extremadamente fuertes, ágiles y con una capacidad de recuperación mucho mayor que la de los humanos. Si consideramos que un Saiyajin de altura entre 175 cm y 180 cm tiene una constitución atlética, musculosa y tonificada, pero con capacidades físicas que superan de lejos a las de cualquier humano, podríamos asumir que su peso podría ser mayor que el de un humano de las mismas características visibles debido a la densidad muscular y ósea superior necesaria para soportar su fuerza y habilidades. Teniendo en cuenta estas condiciones, pero sin olvidar que se trata de una pura especulación: - Para un Saiyajin de 175 cm, el peso podría ser teóricamente mayor que el rango de 56.5 kg a 76 kg estimado para humanos. Podríamos especular un rango superior, posiblemente entre 80 kg y 100 kg o más, considerando la masa muscular densa y estructura ósea reforzada que caracterizaría a un ser con sus capacidades. - Para un Saiyajin de 180 cm, de manera similar, en lugar del rango de 59.9 kg a 80.4 kg recomendado para humanos, podríamos especular un rango aún mayor, quizás entre 85 kg y 105 kg o más, basados en la misma lógica de densidad muscular y capacidad física extraordinaria. Es importante recordar que estos números son puramente especulativos y se basan en la ficción de que los Saiyajin son seres con habilidades físicas muy por fuera del rango humano, con una composición corporal densa y alta masa muscular que influyen en su peso. En el universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", factores como el peso rara vez se discuten con detalles precisos, dejando mucho a la interpretación de los fans y a la naturaleza especulativa de estos cálculos."},{"prompt":"words that rhyme with spinge","completion":"Finding a direct rhyme for \\"spinge\\" is quite challenging, particularly because it is not a standard word in English, and its definition or context is not widely recognized. However, depending on its pronunciation and context, one might try to approximate rhymes based on phonetic similarity. If \\"spinge\\" is pronounced to rhyme with \\"hinge,\\" then words like: 1. Hinge 2. Cringe 3. Singe 4. Tinge would be considered rhyming words. If the pronunciation or intended use of \\"spinge\\" is different, finding a direct rhyme might require more context or creative interpretation."},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"Given the unusual nature of the word \\"spinge,\\" if we are to continue seeking rhymes for alternative pronunciations or even if \\"spinge\\" is pronounced in a more unique way, we might have to rely on near rhymes or slant rhymes. These are words that don't rhyme perfectly but share some similar sounds. This strategy can be particularly useful in poetry or songwriting where the exact match isn't as crucial as the flow and feel of the words. Assuming alternative or extended pronunciations, here are a few more suggestions that could work depending on your specific needs: 1. **Minge** - This term, in some dialects, refers to a woman's pubic area. It can rhyme with \\"spinge\\" if pronounced to match \\"hinge.\\" 2. **Whinge** - This is a British term meaning to complain persistently and in a peevish or irritating way. It rhymes with \\"hinge\\" and, by extension, \\"spinge\\" (if \\"spinge\\" shares that pronunciation). 3. **Fringe** - Refers to the border or edge of something, often used to describe a decorative edge of hanging strands or threads on clothing or other items. It can be a rhyme depending on the pronunciation of \\"spinge.\\" 4. **Syringe** - In the medical context, used for injecting or withdrawing fluids. It could be a slant rhyme, especially if the \\"sp\\" in \\"spinge\\" is pronounced softly. For more abstract connections or creative uses, you might consider words that share a similar start or end sound but don’t fit the traditional rhyme scheme. 1. **Sponge** - While not a perfect rhyme, if \\"spinge\\" is used in an inventive or playful context, the shared \\"sp\\" and \\"nge\\" sounds could make it a fun pairing. 2. **Plunge** - Shares the \\"nge\\" ending sound, which could work as a near rhyme. 3. **Twinge** - A sudden, sharp localized pain could work depending on the specific sound you're aiming for with \\"spinge.\\" As \\"spinge\\" isn't a standard word with a universally agreed pronunciation and meaning, there's a lot of room for creativity in finding words that rhyme or nearly rhyme with it. Depending on your purpose—be it poetry, songwriting, or another creative endeavor—you may find it useful to play with these suggestions or even invent new words to match the rhyme and rhythm you're seeking."},{"prompt":"Terms of Use Welcome to KidsWB.com, an online platform owned and operated by Kids WB, a division of Warner Bros.

Could you provide me with some interesting environment ideas for a game about infrastructure? The entire game takes place in a society regulated by machines for complete efficiency. I already have three environments. First off, a large field, about one thousand square kilometres large, with twenty meter tall automatons taking care of a genetically modified corn, containing almost one hundred percent glucose, perfect for powering the robots that inhabit the cities. These specialised robots have four long legs, about ten meters long. Then they have six arms, four for farming and two for carrying equipment. The are mostly described as squid like. Second, a dam approaching three times larger than the hoover dam in size, responsible for sixty five percent of all power in the cities. About twenty specialised worker robots, equipped with four arms and an shrimp like body plan regularly check the dam, and quite often do small repair works. These robots have four long arms and six short legs, for fast swimming. Third, the largest city in the empire of robots, located in niqaragua. The city is very large, three times the size of Paris. Just before entering the city, you made friends with a robot, who decided to guide you through the city, as humans are not allowed to enter the city alone. She has been in the city four times before, and knows the place very well. She, as well as the other robots inhabiting the cities, have a more humanoid body plan, but still with four arms (with and added joint) and a large elongated head shaped like the xenomorphs head (couldn’t come up with any better description) Could you come up with more ideas like these? Please keep them as detailed as possible. Include things like location or size, or describe how it looks like. You can include guidance from the robot if the environment needs explanation to the player.","completion":"4. The Subterranean Mines of Mektar: Deep underground lies a vast network of mines that extract rare minerals and resources to power the machines in the society. The mines stretch for miles and are filled with robotic miners working tirelessly to extract the valuable materials. The environment is dimly lit, with glowing crystals illuminating the tunnels. The robot guide explains that the mines are essential for powering the infrastructure above ground, and that the robots work in shifts to ensure maximum efficiency. 5. The Skyport of Aerotropolis: High above the ground, floating in the clouds, is a bustling skyport where airships come and go, transporting goods and passengers between cities. The skyport is a marvel of engineering, with robotic workers moving cargo and maintaining the airship docks. The robot guide explains that the skyport is crucial for connecting the different cities in the empire, and that the airships are powered by a combination of renewable energy sources. 6. The Central Processing Plant of Nexus Prime: At the heart of the empire lies the central processing plant, a massive facility where data is collected, analyzed, and disseminated to ensure the smooth functioning of the society. The plant is filled with rows of servers and robotic workers processing information at lightning speed. The robot guide explains that Nexus Prime is the hub of communication and decision-making for the entire empire, and that all decisions are made based on data and efficiency. 7. The Underwater Farms of Aquatica: Off the coast of the empire lies a series of underwater farms where kelp and other sea vegetables are grown to supplement the food supply for the robots. The farms are tended to by aquatic robots with streamlined, fish-like bodies that glide effortlessly through the water. The robot guide explains that Aquatica is essential for providing sustainable food sources for the society, and that the robots have adapted to thrive in the underwater environment. 8.

Ayrıca, dokuz farklı ülkeden markaların bulunduğunu söyler. \\"Anne, ışıklı bir ayakkabı istiyorum çünkü okuldaki herkesin var,\\" diye talep eder Zeynep.

By this time, the lineup featured a mix of animated series aimed at children and pre-teens. Here is an exemplar Saturday morning slate from May 2007: 1. **\\"Tom and Jerry Tales\\"** 2. **\\"Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\\"** 3. **\\"Johnny Test\\"** 4. **\\"Legion of Super Heroes\\"** 5. **\\"The Batman\\"** 6. **\\"Xiaolin Showdown\\"** 7. **\\"Loonatics Unleashed\\"** Moving forward to March 2008, Kids' WB continued airing but with some changes in its lineup due to new shows being introduced and others being phased out. A typical lineup would look something like this: 1. **\\"Will & Dewitt\\"** 2. **\\"Tom and Jerry Tales\\"** 3. **\\"Skunk Fu!\\"** 4. **\\"Johnny Test\\"** 5. **\\"The Spectacular Spider-Man\\"** 6. **\\"Legion of Super Heroes\\"** 7. **\\"The Batman\\"** However, by November 2008, the landscape of Saturday morning cartoons on The CW had notably changed. Kids' WB aired its last broadcast on May 17, 2008, making way for a new block called The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment. This transition reflected a significant shift in the programming strategy and offerings. For November 2008, under The CW4Kids banner, the lineup would have included shows like: 1. **\\"Will & Dewitt\\"** (Though primarily a part of the early transitional phase) 2. **\\"The Spectacular Spider-Man\\"** 3. **\\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer\\"** 4. **\\"Yu-Gi-Oh! GX\\"** 5. **\\"Chaotic\\"** 6. **\\"Sonic X\\"** 7. **\\"Dinosaur King\\"** This comparison illustrates the evolution of children's programming from the traditional Kids' WB block to the 4Kids-led CW4Kids. The transition showcases a shift towards more action-oriented and franchise-based series, in part driven by the changing landscape of children's television and the increasing importance of media franchises."},{"prompt":"Write full 7am-12pm lineups for each of the 3 time periods","completion":"Creating complete and accurate TV lineups for specific dates and times can be challenging due to variations in regional scheduling, special programming events, and the general shifts in programming strategies over time.

Could you provide me with some interesting environment ideas for a game about infrastructure? The entire game takes place in a society regulated by machines for complete efficiency.

These specialised robots have four long legs, about ten meters long. Then they have six arms, four for farming and two for carrying equipment. The are mostly described as squid like. Second, a dam approaching three times larger than the hoover dam in size, responsible for sixty five percent of all power in the cities. About twenty specialised worker robots, equipped with four arms and an shrimp like body plan regularly check the dam, and quite often do small repair works. These robots have four long arms and six short legs, for fast swimming. Third, the largest city in the empire of robots, located in niqaragua. The city is very large, three times the size of Paris. Just before entering the city, you made friends with a robot, who decided to guide you through the city, as humans are not allowed to enter the city alone. She has been in the city four times before, and knows the place very well. She, as well as the other robots inhabiting the cities, have a more humanoid body plan, but still with four arms (with and added joint) and a large elongated head shaped like the xenomorphs head (couldn’t come up with any better description) Could you come up with more ideas like these? Please keep them as detailed as possible. Include things like location or size, or describe how it looks like. You can include guidance from the robot if the environment needs explanation to the player. Also, the player is pretty restricted in this society, as they don’t live there and isn’t a robot.

The locker, an unwitting casualty of Johnny's post-battle state, clanged in protest. There, amidst the umpteenth echo of war, Johnny decided that what he truly needed was not another medal, but a bath. Yes, Johnny Rico, played by the square-jawed, impossibly handsome Casper van Dien, was contemplating a simple river bath. Picture him: muscles sculpted by endless skirmishes against the arachnid foe, his butt a masterpiece chiseled by the gods of squats themselves, his face a canvas of rugged, battle-worn handsomeness, and his armpits, well, let's just say they were as manly and forested as the uncharted planets he’s fought on. \\"Time to wash off the day,\\" Johnny announced to no one in particular, his locker now shut with more sentiment than force. With a towel slung over his shoulder like a cape, Johnny strode out of the base, his steps orchestrating a symphony of purpose. As he approached the river, the sunlight played off his physique, highlighting every ridge and valley of his muscle-laden terrain. His hair, a tousled halo of golden brown, caught the light, framing his face in a celestial glow. Unfazed by the serene beauty of nature around him, Johnny set down his towel with military precision and began what can only be described as the most dramatic disrobing this side of the galaxy. Each piece of clothing seemed to peel away layers of duty, revealing the man beneath the soldier. When finally, attired in nothing but his skin, Johnny approached the river's edge. \\"Time to show these bugs who's really clean,\\" he muttered to himself, a smirk dancing on his lips as he waded into the water. The river, cool and inviting, kissed his skin, enveloping him in its embrace. As Johnny submerged, the water around him sparked with the energy of a thousand desert suns. With every stroke, filth and sweat surrendered to the aquatic cleanse, carried away by the ripples of Rico's rejuvenation. \\"Take that, space mites!\\" Johnny bellowed, scrubbing with an intensity that could only be described as wholly unnecessary but thoroughly entertaining. He dove under, resurfacing with a splash that would've made any aquatic creature green with envy, his hair now slicked back to reveal the full glory of his rugged, perfectly symmetrical face. Johnny's dialogue with himself continued, a one-man show that needed no audience, \\"Who knew, beneath the warrior, there was such a... water sprite,\\" he chuckled, admiring his reflection in the water. As the sun began its descent, the river glowed with the fire of a thousand battles, yet here, in this moment, Johnny found peace. With one final kick, sending a cascade of droplets into the fading light, he rose from the river, a titan reborn. Towel now wrapped with the same precision as a well-executed battle plan, Johnny glanced back at the river, a mischievous grin upon his face. \\"Looks like Johnny Rico's got himself a new battle mistress. And this time, I won the turf,\\" he proclaimed, saluting the now tranquil water. The walk back to base was one of triumph, not over alien foes, but over the day's grime. Johnny Rico, the Mobile Infantry's own Adonis, had conquered yet another domain. And as he disappeared into the encroaching night, one thing was clear: this was a bath that would go down in the annals of military hygiene. Thus concluded Johnny Rico's not-so-battle royale with dirt, a comedic interlude in the life of humanity's stoic defender, reminding us all that sometimes, the greatest victories come not from the battlefield, but from the river's gentle embrace."},{"prompt":"Make a vividly detailed and comedic Starship Troopers story about Johnny Rico (played by Casper van Dien) after a battle.

His chiseled physique, caked with the dust of exploded bug carcasses and his own hard-earned sweat, was visually begging for a much-needed wash. Not to mention, his once pristine Marauder suit now looked like it had been through a blender set on 'Bug Puree'. Tossing his soiled armor and clothes into his locker with a casual flick of his impressively toned arms, Johnny decided it was time for a more... natural cleanse. Overheard tales of a clear, refreshing river not far from the base had been circulating, and he figured his superbly sculpted butt, deserving of its own holo-poster, needed the kind of care only mother nature could provide. A smirk played on his ruggedly handsome face, one that even the hardened battle scars only served to enhance, as he set out for the river, making sure to flex just a little for anyone paying attention. Striding into the cool embrace of the river, Johnny let out a sigh of contentment. The water wrapped around his muscular form, emphasizing the sharp lines and contours of his body. His arms, practically a manual on how to perfectly sculpt human flesh, glided through the water effortlessly. The man was a walking, talking testament to the effectiveness of Mobile Infantry training - and then some. His face, a striking blend of boyish charm and battle-hardened determination, broke into a wide grin as he felt the grime of combat wash away. As he soaked in the tranquility, a rumble from his depths hinted at a pressing need. The aftermath of the field rations he'd consumed earlier was making its presence known in a rather gaseous form. Johnny glanced around sheepishly, a rare flush creeping over his cheekbones. Finding himself alone, he leaned back and allowed nature to take its course. The moment of relief was profound. \\"Better out than in, as they say in the barracks,\\" he chuckled to himself, watching as the bubbles escaped to the surface, betraying the deed. Unfortunately, the liberation of these gaseous interlopers had unintended consequences. The water near Johnny's posterior turned suspiciously murky, and a few unfortunate fish bobbed to the surface, victims of the lethal bio-weapon he had unintentionally released. Ever the opportunist, Johnny's grin widened. \\"Looks like dinner's on me tonight, boys!\\" he exclaimed, scooping up the expired aquatic creatures. As he made his way back to camp, fish in hand and feeling a hundred pounds lighter, Johnny Rico couldn't help but muse on the day's events. \\"You know you're a true Mobile Infantryman when even your farts can take out the enemy,\\" he quipped to no one in particular, already anticipating the reactions around the campfire. By the time the flames licked at the freshly caught fish, and the tales of the day's battles began to unwind, Johnny sat back, satisfaction filling him. Not just from the meal or the clean feeling pervading his once grime-coated skin, but from the knowledge that, despite the odds, he and his team had prevailed once more. \\"And that, my friends, is how you catch dinner with nothing but your bare butt cheeks. Rico's Roughnecks, always resourceful!\\" he toasted, laughter and camaraderie warming them all more than the fire ever could."},{"prompt":"Create a tic tac toe variant that avoid draws, has balanced mechanics, easy to learn but difficult to master, there is a high replayability, multiple ways of winning, no luck involved","completion":"Designing a variant of Tic Tac Toe that accomplishes these goals requires careful consideration of the mechanics and adding depth to the strategy. Below is an outline of a Tic Tac Toe variant, named \\"Quantum Tic Tac Toe Plus\\" (QTTT+), that aims to fulfill these requirements. # Game Overview: QTTT+ takes the classic grid of Tic Tac Toe but expands it to a 5x5 grid. The game introduces unique pieces, strategic moves, and several ways to achieve victory, eliminating draws completely. # Game Components: 1. **5x5 Grid**: Larger than the classic 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board. 2. **Two Sets of Pieces**: Each player has an equal number of two types of pieces - Quants and Blocks (10 each). # Game Rules: 1. **Objective**: The objective is to align four of your Quants horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Alternatively, a player can win by placing a Block that causes the opponent to have no legal move. 2. **Turns**: Players take turns, with one player using Quants and the other using Blocks in each turn. That is, if Player 1 places a Quant, Player 2 must place a Block in their subsequent turn, and vice versa. 3. **Piece Placement**: - **Quants**: Placing a Quant piece creates potential quantum states. Any square directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to a placed Quant becomes a potential position for another Quant. Only the next Quant placed by the player can convert these potential positions into actual positions. - **Blocks**: Blocks can be placed on any unoccupied space and are used to obstruct the opponent's alignment of Quants. Blocks cannot be placed adjacent to other Blocks. 4. **Quantum Leap**: Once per game, each player can perform a \\"Quantum Leap\\". This allows placing two Quants or two Blocks in a single turn, adhering to regular placement rules. 5. **No Draws**: The game's design inherently avoids draws. The introduction of Blocks, the larger 5x5 grid, and multiple victory conditions ensure that one player must eventually win. 6. **Victory Conditions**: - Align four Quants in a row, column, or diagonal. - Place a Block that results in the opponent having no legal moves on their next turn. # Strategy: - Players must balance the offensive strategy of aligning their Quants with the defensive strategy of blocking their opponent. - The Quantum Leap adds a layer of complexity, allowing for surprise tactics but can be used only once, emphasizing timing and strategy. - The alternating placement of Quants and Blocks each turn requires players to think ahead, predicting where their opponent might place their next piece and planning both their current and future moves accordingly. # Replayability and Mastery: - The combination of Quants and Blocks, along with the Quantum Leap mechanic, ensures high replayability, as no two games will be the same. - Mastery involves not just understanding the immediate mechanics but also predicting opponents' moves, mastering the timing of the Quantum Leap, and navigating the expanded grid's complexities. - The larger grid and multiple winning conditions allow for an expansive array of strategies and counter-strategies. QTTT+ promises a balance between ease of learning the core concepts and the depth required to master the game. By eliminating the possibility of a draw and introducing multiple layers of strategy without any luck, it evolves Tic Tac Toe into a game that is both intellectually stimulating and endlessly enjoyable."},{"prompt":"Create a tic tac toe variant that avoid draws, has balanced mechanics, easy to learn but difficult to master, there is a high replayability, multiple ways of winning, no luck involved, no first player advantage and is only played on a 2d board","completion":"# Quantum Tic Tac Toe (Q-Tic Tac Toe) **Overview:** Quantum Tic Tac Toe introduces a layered twist to the classic game, incorporating principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement in a metaphorical sense. This variant maintains the simplicity of the original game while significantly enhancing its strategic depth, balancing mechanics, and ensuring a fresh experience with each match. It virtually eliminates draws, adds multiple win conditions, and ensures fairness to both players. **Game Setup:** - The game is played on a conventional 3x3 tic tac toe board. - Each player has two types of pieces: \\"Quantum\\" (Q) and \\"Classic\\" (C). - Each player has 3 Q pieces and an unlimited amount of C pieces. - Player pieces are distinguishable by color or design. **Objective:** To win, a player must: 1. Form a Classic line (straight or diagonal) with C pieces. 2. Create a Quantum Dominance Zone (QDZ) by strategically using Q pieces. **Rules:** 1. **Turns:** - Players alternate turns, with the starting player rotating each game to counter first-player advantage. - On a turn, a player may place one of their pieces on any unoccupied space on the board. 2. **Piece Placement:** - **Quantum (Q) pieces:** When placed, a Q piece influences not just its square but also the two adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). A Q piece can turn an opponent’s adjacent C piece into a Q piece of the current player's color, showcasing the \\"entanglement,\\". However, a player can only use each of their 3 Q pieces once per game. - **Classic (C) pieces:** Normal tic tac toe rules apply, but if surrounded on two opposite sides by Q pieces (directly or indirectly), a C piece is converted into a Q piece of the encasing Q's original player's color. 3. **Quantum Dominance Zone (QDZ):** - A QDZ is established when a player manages to convert three C pieces in a row into Q pieces of their color through strategic placement and entanglement. Establishing a QDZ is another way to win the game. 4. **Elimination of Draws:** - If all squares are filled and neither primary objective is achieved, players enter the \\"Collapse Phase.\\" - During the Collapse Phase, each player secretly selects one of their Q pieces to \\"collapse\\" (remove from the board), twice in total, thus potentially disrupting the board status quo and leading to new winning configurations. This adds a layer of psychological warfare and surprise comebacks, echoing the unpredictability of quantum measurement outcomes in a thematic way. 5. **Balanced Mechanics:** - The limited number of Q pieces and their unique abilities ensure strategic depth, as rash use can backfire. - The Collapse Phase and rotating starting players balance out the first-turn advantage, ensuring fairness. 6. **Winning:** - A player wins by either forming a Classic line with C pieces or establishing a QDZ. - If no win is declared after the Collapse Phase, the game ends in a rare draw, prompting almost immediate rematch urges due to the unlikely scenario. **Learning and Mastery:** - The game is easy to learn for anyone familiar with the original Tic Tac Toe, introducing only a couple of new concepts. - Mastery requires understanding the intricate potential of Q pieces, predicting opponent moves, and mastering the art of collapse timing, providing depth and high replayability. **Conclusion:** Quantum Tic Tac Toe offers a balanced, engaging, and strategic variant to a timeless classic. Its mechanics encourage players to think several moves ahead, adapt to evolving situations, and engage in duels of wits, ensuring a game that's both accessible to beginners and captivating for seasoned strategists."},{"prompt":"Hello! Could you provide me with some interesting environment ideas for a game about infrastructure? The entire game takes place in a society regulated by machines for complete efficiency. I already have three environments. First off, a large field, about one thousand square kilometres large, with twenty meter tall automatons taking care of a genetically modified corn, containing almost one hundred percent glucose, perfect for powering the robots that inhabit the cities. These specialised robots have four long legs, about ten meters long. Then they have six arms, four for farming and two for carrying equipment. The are mostly described as squid like. Second, a dam approaching three times larger than the hoover dam in size, responsible for sixty five percent of all power in the cities. About twenty specialised worker robots, equipped with four arms and an shrimp like body plan regularly check the dam, and quite often do small repair works. These robots have four long arms and six short legs, for fast swimming. Third, the largest city in the empire of robots, located in niqaragua. The city is very large, three times the size of Paris. Just before entering the city, you made friends with a robot, who decided to guide you through the city, as humans are not allowed to enter the city alone. She has been in the city four times before, and knows the place very well. She, as well as the other robots inhabiting the cities, have a more humanoid body plan, but still with four arms (with and added joint) and a large elongated head shaped like the xenomorphs head (couldn’t come up with any better description) Could you come up with more ideas like these? Please keep them as detailed as possible. Include things like location or size, or describe how it looks like. You can include guidance from the robot if the environment needs explanation to the player. Also, the player is pretty restricted in this society, as they don’t live there and isn’t a robot. So reflect a bit on if the player would be allowed in there or not. Because if the player isn’t allowed to be there, why have the environment in the first place? Like, the player would never randomly find himself in a military base or the heart of the entire empire.","completion":"1. Industrial Zone of Robotic Factories - The player finds themselves in an expansive industrial zone filled with massive robotic factories.

Me explique isto, usando uma linguagem extremamente filosófica, bem argumentativa, usando termos filósofos e linguagem com palavras difíceis tipo \\"posteriori\\"","completion":"Para abordar a questão de Jesus enquanto encarnação de Deus e a sua relação com o desenvolvimento do seu conhecimento divino no contexto temporal humano, faz-se premente recorrer a uma análise profunda que entrelace conceitos tanto teológicos quanto filosóficos, na expectativa de elucubrar sobre esta aparente paradoxalidade. Primeiro, partamos da premissa - análoga aos dogmas cristológicos - que Jesus é veracíssimamente Deus e homem, simultaneamente, numa união hipostática onde as duas naturezas coexistem sem confusão ou separação. No âmago desta compreensão, encontra-se o axioma de que enquanto Deus, Jesus é onisciente, possuindo um conhecimento infuso, eterno e imutável, não só de natureza apriorística - isto é, independente de experiência empírica - mas também, porventura paradoxalmente, capaz de enlaçar um conhecimento aposteriori através de sua experiência encarnada. Logo, ao considerarmos o desenvolvimento de Jesus em sabedoria e estatura (Lc 2,52), nos confrontamos com a questãi acerca de como um ser onisciente pode, num contexto temporal e desenvolvimentista humano, apreender ou agregar conhecimento. Este fenômeno pode ser elucidado através da distinção, propagada por Kant, entre o fenomenológico e o noumênico. Jesus, ao habitar o reino fenomenológico - o mundo como experienciamos - participou da condição humana em sua integridade, incluindo suas limitações epistêmicas inerentes ao processo de aprendizagem temporal. Aplicando-se a dialética hegeliana, podemos vislumbrar o processo pelo qual Jesus, existindo dentro do espaço-tempo e imerso na cultura e sociedade humana, emprega a Aufhebung - superação e preservação - ao transcender os limites do conhecimento humano enquanto simultaneamente se engaja e os cumpre. Isto é, ao encarnar-se, o Verbo etéreo submete-se voluntariamente a um autoconstrangimento ontológico para vivenciar o desenvolvimento humano, engendrando uma síntese onde o divino e o humano se entrelaçam de modo que preceptos apriorísticos são indissociavelmente complementados por aquisições aposterióricas no âmbito da existência fenomênica. Neste ínterim, a noção de kenosis, proveniente da Epístola aos Filipenses (2,7), oferece uma lente adicional pela qual podemos contemplar esta discussão; Jesus derrama-se a si mesmo, esvazia-se de seu status pré-existencial divino, não em essência ou ontologia, mas em manifestação e autorrevelação, na medida em que este esvaziamento permite-lhe uma participação plena na finitude humana - incluindo o processo de aprendizado. Assim, quando nos debruçamos sobre a questão do acréscimo em sabedoria e conhecimento por parte de Jesus, estamos nos referindo a uma dinâmica complexa onde o divino se faz carne, sem por isso se despojar completamente do infinito, mas voluntariamente atravessando os véus da temporalidade e finitude, absorvendo e internalizando as vicissitudes humanas, as quais, sob o viés da experiência, contribuem para a teodiceia - a justificação de Deus no mundo. Portanto, a problemática inicial nos convida a transcendentalizar as fronteiras habituais do pensamento, reconhecendo que a interação entre as naturezas divina e humana de Jesus apresenta-se não como uma contradição, mas como uma paradoxal harmonia que desafia a lógica meramente humana, apontando para uma realidade onde o infinito toca o finito, o eterno ingressa no temporal, e o conhecimento divino compassa-se, de modo inexplicável, com o processo humano de aprendizado."},{"prompt":"Create a tic tac toe variant that avoid draws, has balanced mechanics, easy to learn but difficult to master, there is a high replayability, multiple ways of winning, no luck involved, no first player advantage and is only played on a 2d board","completion":"Introducing \\"Quantum Tic-Tac-Flow,\\" a variant of tic-tac-toe designed to overcome the traditional game’s limitations, providing a balanced, no-draw, skill-based gaming experience with high strategic depth and replayability. It retains simplicity in rules making it easy to learn, but the addition of new mechanics creates a game that is difficult to master. # Game Setup - **Board:** Played on a 5x5 grid. - **Players:** 2 players; one uses X and the other uses O. - **Win Condition:** Instead of the traditional three in a row, players must create a specific pattern or achieve a certain condition to win (more on this later). # Game Mechanics 1. **Flow Paths:** Instead of aiming for three in a row, players aim to create a \\"flow\\" - a connected path of their symbols from one side of the board to the opposite side. Flows can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. 2. **Quantum Moves:** Each player, on their turn, places two of their symbols on any two empty squares on the board. However, these are \\"quantum\\" moves. This means that until the next turn, the pieces do not belong to any specific player and are in a superposition state. On the next player's turn, before making their own quantum moves, they must decide the owner of the previous turn's quantum moves, turning those into normal pieces. This rule forces players to think ahead, adding depth to strategy and negating first-player advantage. 3. **Dynamic Board:** Once a player successfully forms a flow, instead of the game ending, the board dynamically alters. The winning flow “activates,” and all pieces within the flow are removed, and the players continue on the adjusted board. The first player to achieve three flows wins the game. 4. **Skill Moves:** Each player has three \\"skill moves\\" they can use at any point during the game but only once: - **Block:** Blocks an opponent from claiming a square for one round. - **Swap:** Swaps the positions of any two adjacent pieces on the board, quantum or owned. - **Double Down:** Allows the player to solidify both quantum pieces placed in their turn immediately, without waiting for the opponent's decision. The combination of \\"Quantum Moves,\\" skillful use of special abilities, and the changing board dynamics ensures that no two games are the same, promoting high replayability. The requirement for strategic thinking and adaptability, along with multiple paths to victory, guarantees a challenging yet rewarding experience. # Balance and Fairness - **No First Player Advantage:** The quantum move mechanic negates the first-move advantage since the second player decides the fate of the pieces placed. - **No Luck Involved:** Victory is determined purely by players' strategic choices and their ability to anticipate the opponent's moves. - **Multiple Paths to Victory:** Allows for creativity in strategy, ensuring that players can adapt their tactics on the fly. - **Avoids Draws:** The dynamic nature of the board and multiple win conditions ensure that games move towards a conclusion without stalemates. # Learning Curve - **Easy to Learn:** The basic objective and move set are straightforward and can be learned quickly. - **Difficult to Master:** The depth of strategy involved in managing quantum pieces, utilizing skill moves effectively, and adapting to the changing board requires practice and deep tactical thinking. \\"Quantum Tic-Tac-Flow\\" retains the essence of simplicity from tic-tac-toe, but by introducing elements of depth, strategy, and adaptability, it evolves into a game that stands on its own as a challenging and engaging board game for all ages."},{"prompt":"\\" كَمَا تَـعْلَمون، َدِي، إن َّ مِيزانيتَـنَا ضَيِّقة ٌ جِدًّاالْيَا أَو األبُ: َِْي غَرَضا ً وَاحِدا ً أو ْ غَرَضَي ِْ اثْـنَـيرتلِذَا سَنَشْ ُلِكُل ِّ شَخْصٍ. وَبَـعْد َ ثَالَثَة ِ أَسَابِيع َ تُـفْتَح ُ املدارس ُج ُ لِلْتَسَوُّق ِ الَْقِيقِيّ،ويف ذَلِك َ الْوَقْت ِ سَنَخْر ِيف ِ َْخِري َ للْدِّرَاسَةألوَيف الَْقِيقَة ِ ل َْ أَنْس َ تَسَوُّقَـنَا ا السَّنِة ِ الْمَاضِيَة ِ بَـعْدُ. ال َ بَأْس َ بِه ِ يَا أَب ِ إِنَّك َ عَلَى الَْق ِّ وَإنَّن ِ مَعَك. فاطمة: َِكِب َ السَّيارة َ ستَّة ُ أفْراد ٍ مِن َ األسْرَة ِ للذَّهابر ُدَّةلَد ُّ والَدِيد وبَقِي يف البيت ِ الْكَز ِ التَّسَوُّق ِ اإىل مَر كزوَطِفْالن صَغِريَان مِن َ األوْالَدِ. لَمَّا وَصَلُوا إىل املر كثرياً. أُعْجِب َ األطفال ُ بِضَخَامَة ِ مَبْناه ِكُنْت ُ قد أَتَيت ُ مع أصْدِقائي هنا قَـبْل َ عَشَرة موسى: ِأيَّامٍ. فإن َّ هذا املكان َ مِن ْ أكْب َِ األماكن َِداثةلللتَّسوُّق ِ وهُو َ يف املرْتَـبَة ِ الثَّالِثَة ِ مِن ْ نَاحِية ِ ا ِكة ٍ مُتَـعَدِّدَةيف مدينتِنَا. وقد بُن ِ من قِبَل ِ شَر ِْكَة ِ مِنذه الشَّرل ِكُونِنْسِيَّات. ويُوجَد املشْرتلا تِسع ِ دول ٍ أجنبيةٍ. ُِّ ولد ٍ لألسرة ِ وهو َ تلميذ ٌ يف الصف بموسى أك الثالِث ِ للثانوية. ٌيَا أُمِّي أُرِيد ُ حِذَاء ً ضَوْئيًّا فلكل ِّ شَخْص ٍ حذاء زينبُ: ضَوْئي ٌّ يف املدْرَسَةِ. زينب ُ تِلمِيذة ٌ يف رَوْضَة ِ األطفال ِ وهِي َ يف اخلامِسَة من ْ عُمْرِهَا. َِ أوَّال ً األحْذِيَةَ. رتإذَن ْ هَيَّا بِنَا لِنَشْ األب: َِيعاً.مج ِ تدخُل ُ األسْرة ُ يف مََل ِّ األحْذِيَة ْيَا زينبُ، هناك َ أحذية ٌ تُرِيدِينَها، هَيَّا لِنَخْتَـر موسى: مِنْها. رَائِع ٌ جدًّا، ها هو مَا أرَدْتُهُ. زينب: ذاءِ؟لمَا ثََن ُ هذا ا موسى: ثَنُه واحِدة ٌ وسِتُّون لِريةً. البائعة: ؟َ يوجَد هُنا تَْفِيض ال أ األب: ِنَعمْ، هَذا السِّعْر ُ بـَعْد َ التَّخْفِيضات بِنِسْبَة البائعة: عِشْرين َ بِاملئَةِ. \\"buradaki metinde geçen kelimeleri sade şekilde al , bütün kelimeleri al ayır , kelimeri ezberleyeceğim .

Sería interesante desarrollar un poco más sobre cómo estas vidas se entrelazan. ¿Qué eventos o circunstancias llevaron a esta nueva vida? ¿Hay recuerdos o habilidades retenidos de la vida anterior? 3. **Apariencia Física Detallada:** Has hecho un excelente trabajo detallando el cabello, lo cual sugiere un enfoque visual muy fuerte para el personaje. ¿Cómo podría esta atención al detalle extenderse a otras características físicas, como la vestimenta, detalles de la cara, o marcas distintivas? 4. **Contexto y Ambientación:** Dado el rico trasfondo y la complejidad de las características del personaje, sería útil saber más sobre el mundo o los entornos en los que Vyomi/Gonzalo se desarrolla. ¿Cómo es el universo en el que viven? ¿Cuáles son los conflictos o las alianzas predominantes? 5. **Desarrollo de Personaje:** Considera explorar más a fondo su personalidad. Has establecido una base excepcional con la apariencia y los datos fundamentales; profundizar en sus motivaciones, miedos, y deseos podría proporcionar una dimensión adicional fascinante. 6. **Interacciones y Relaciones:** ¿Cómo son las relaciones de Vyomi/Gonzalo en su vida actual en comparación con su vida anterior?

By this time, the lineup featured a mix of animated series aimed at children and pre-teens. Here is an exemplar Saturday morning slate from May 2007: 1. “Tom and Jerry Tales” 2. “Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!” 3. “Johnny Test” 4. “Legion of Super Heroes” 5. “The Batman” 6. “Xiaolin Showdown” 7. “Loonatics Unleashed” Moving forward to March 2008, Kids’ WB continued airing but with some changes in its lineup due to new shows being introduced and others being phased out. A typical lineup would look something like this: 1. “Will & Dewitt” 2. “Tom and Jerry Tales” 3. “Skunk Fu!” 4. “Johnny Test” 5. “The Spectacular Spider-Man” 6. “Legion of Super Heroes” 7. “The Batman” However, by November 2008, the landscape of Saturday morning cartoons on The CW had notably changed. Kids’ WB aired its last broadcast on May 17, 2008, making way for a new block called The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment. This transition reflected a significant shift in the programming strategy and offerings. For November 2008, under The CW4Kids banner, the lineup would have included shows like: 1. “Will & Dewitt” (Though primarily a part of the early transitional phase) 2. “The Spectacular Spider-Man” 3. “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer” 4. “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX” 5. “Chaotic” 6. “Sonic X” 7. “Dinosaur King” This comparison illustrates the evolution of children’s programming from the traditional Kids’ WB block to the 4Kids-led CW4Kids. The transition showcases a shift towards more action-oriented and franchise-based series, in part driven by the changing landscape of children’s television and the increasing importance of media franchises. Write full 7am-12pm lineups for each of the 3 time periods Creating complete and accurate TV lineups for specific dates and times can be challenging due to variations in regional scheduling, special programming events, and the general shifts in programming strategies over time. However, based on typical lineups and available series around the given periods, the schedules below aim to reflect a generalized snapshot of what the Kids’ WB and later The CW4Kids lineups might have looked like during the mentioned periods. Please note, actual air times for specific shows could vary by region, and special programming could alter the lineup. # May 2007 - Kids’ WB on The CW Saturday Morning - 7:00 AM - “Krypto the Superdog” - 7:30 AM - “Tom and Jerry Tales” - 8:00 AM - “Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!” - 8:30 AM - “Johnny Test” - 9:00 AM - “Legion of Super Heroes” - 9:30 AM - “The Batman” - 10:00 AM - “Xiaolin Showdown” - 10:30 AM - “Loonatics Unleashed” - 11:00 AM - “Monster Allergy” - 11:30 AM - “Spider Riders” # March 2008 - Kids’ WB on The CW Saturday Morning - 7:00 AM - “Will & Dewitt” - 7:30 AM - “Magi-Nation” - 8:00 AM - “Tom and Jerry Tales” - 8:30 AM - “Skunk Fu!” - 9:00 AM - “Johnny Test” - 9:30 AM - “The Spectacular Spider-Man” - 10:00 AM - “Legion of Super Heroes” - 10:30 AM - “The Batman” - 11:00 AM - “Eon Kid” - 11:30 AM - “Storm Hawks” # November 2008 - The CW4Kids Saturday Morning - 7:00 AM - “The Spectacular Spider-Man” - 7:30 AM - “Will & Dewitt” (Subject to change, as 4Kids might intersperse various content here) - 8:00 AM - “Sonic X” - 8:30 AM - “Gogoriki” - 9:00 AM - “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer” - 9:30 AM - “Yu-Gi-Oh!

The actual lineup could have included variations such as specific holiday specials, marathon blocks of popular shows, or changes due to regional decisions.

Below is a hypothetical Saturday morning lineup for this period, reflecting a balance between legacy Kids’ WB shows and new offerings that would define The CW4Kids. It's important to remember that in such transitional periods, lineups can be especially fluid as networks test viewer reception to various shows. # Transitional CW4Kids Lineup - Summer 2008 Saturday Morning - 7:00 AM - “Magi-Nation” (Kids’ WB legacy content continuing its run) - 7:30 AM - “Tom and Jerry Tales” (A holdover from the Kids’ WB days, beloved by audiences) - 8:00 AM - “Sonic X” (New to the block, bringing in a fresh audience) - 8:30 AM - “Gogoriki” (4Kids content introduced to the lineup) - 9:00 AM - “The Spectacular Spider-Man” (A new but rapidly popular addition from the Kids’ WB final days) - 9:30 AM - “Skunk Fu!” (Another series continuing from the Kids’ WB era) - 10:00 AM - “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX” (A 4Kids staple, marking the new direction of the block) - 10:30 AM - “Legion of Super Heroes” (One of the last Kids’ WB shows airing during the transition) - 11:00 AM - “Johnny Test” (Retaining its slot as it was still a strong performer from the late Kids’ WB lineup) - 11:30 AM - “Monster Allergy” (Reflecting the unique circumstance mentioned, this series makes a brief return or continuation during this hybrid period, serving as a nod to the legacy of Kids’ WB content for viewers during the transition) This hybrid lineup features a mix of superhero-themed series, action-packed adventures, and comedic animated series that aim to cater to a broad audience, from younger children to early teens. The blend reflects an intention to maintain the existing Kids’ WB audience while gradually introducing and testing new content that would come to define The CW4Kids identity. Engaging a transitional lineup like this would have been part of the strategy to ensure a smooth handover from the legacy of Kids’ WB to the new direction under The CW4Kids branding. It helped to gently introduce viewers to new characters and stories while ensuring that they could still enjoy some of their favorite shows from the previous programming block, minimizing viewer drop-off during the changeover period."},{"prompt":"Write a forum convo in July 2008 where the lines are very blurred as to who owns the block at present, and talk about the current state cw4kids.com is in","completion":"# Thread Title: Confusion Reigns: Who's Really in Charge of CW4Kids Now? Plus, What's Up with CW4Kids.com? CoolToonWatcher Hey folks, have you noticed the weird vibes around the CW4Kids lineup lately? It feels like we're in some sort of limbo about who's actually steering the ship. On one hand, there are the remnants of Kids’ WB, but then there's also a ton of 4Kids branding popping up. I tried checking CW4Kids.com for some clarity, and it’s like stepping into a digital ghost town in some sections. What’s the deal? SaturdayMornNostalgia Absolutely! It’s been super confusing. I saw “Monster Allergy” on the schedule next to “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX,” and it felt like time-traveling between eras. Last I checked, 4Kids was supposed to revamp the whole scene, but it looks like there's a tug-of-war behind the scenes. Couldn’t find much info on CW4Kids.com either, some parts of the site are incredibly outdated. ToonStrategist Speaking of CW4Kids.com, is anyone else finding the site layout a bit...lost? Half the links to the show pages don’t even work properly, and updates are hit-or-miss. I was looking for info on “The Spectacular Spider-Man” and ended up in a loopback to the homepage. It’s like they started a site overhaul and forgot to finish it. 90sKidForever Yeah, the state of CW4Kids.com is pretty indicative of the broader chaos. I miss the old Kids’ WB site; at least it was updated regularly. Now, with the CW4Kids, it’s as if they're not sure what direction they're taking - both online and on-air. I get transitional challenges, but there should be some coherence, right? DigitalDawn Actually, this transition phase seems typical when a major network change happens, but it’s a real test of patience for us fans. On-air, it’s like we're in a no-man's land between the legacy of Kids’ WB and the future vision of 4Kids Entertainment. CW4Kids.com feels like a work in progress, reflecting that same uncertainty. Does anyone know if there's any plan in place to solidify the brand identity, or are we stuck in this hybrid zone for the foreseeable future? ViewerInTransition As far as I can tell, ViewerInTransition, the issue is really about getting all the moving parts to work together. From what I've pieced together, it might be a mixture of contractual, branding, and logistical hurdles that are causing these hiccups. As for CW4Kids.com, it seems it's not the priority right now, but I heard from a forum elsewhere that a major update is supposed to be in the works before the fall season starts. Let’s hope that includes fixing the website and giving us a clearer direction on the programming front. CoolToonWatcher That’s somewhat reassuring, ViewerInTransition. A coherent brand presence online and a stable lineup could really help cement The CW4Kids as a worthy successor to the Saturday morning throne. Fingers crossed that by this fall, we'll have a clearer understanding, and CW4Kids.com will be a hub we can actually use. SaturdayMornNostalgia In the meantime, guess we'll all just have to stay tuned (and maybe refresh CW4Kids.com a little less frequently). Thanks for the insights, everyone. It’s reassuring to know it’s not just me scratching my head over the current state of our beloved Saturday morning ritual! --- **Note:** This conversation is a fictional representation of discussions that might have occurred among fans during the transitional period from Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids and does not represent actual forum conversations from that time."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where CW4Kids.com is now simplified, and there is only a Home, Schedule, Games and Shows page, and only 4 shows have standalone pages","completion":"# Thread Title: CW4Kids.com Simplified - New Look, Fewer Show Pages? Thoughts? SaturdayMornRevival Hey everyone, have you seen the latest update to CW4Kids.com? Looks like they’ve finally decided on a direction and simplified the site. Now there are only a few main tabs: Home, Schedule, Games, and Shows. The kicker? Only 4 shows have their own standalone pages. What's everyone's take on this new streamlined approach? ToonTactician I spotted that! The shows with pages are “Yu-Gi-Oh!”, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer”, “Sonic X”, and “The Spectacular Spider-Man.” Feels like they're betting big on these franchises. Makes sense from a marketing perspective, but what about variety? The charm of Saturday mornings was discovering different shows, right? PixelPioneer True, ToonTactician, but I think the streamlined site is a step in the right direction, especially after the chaos of the last few months. The simplified interface is way more user-friendly. The Games section is a blast—finally, some decent interactive content. But yeah, limiting the Shows section feels restrictive. I hope they plan to add more show pages soon. RetroToonRanger I’m with PixelPioneer on this. A more navigable site is a win in my book. And focusing on a few shows might not be a bad strategy as they stabilize the brand. It’s just... The other series feel like they're getting the short end of the stick. Maybe they're planning phases of rollout for other show pages? DigitalDawn While I get the strategic slimming down, the essence of Saturday mornings was the mixtape vibe—never knowing which show might become your new favorite. This feels like they’re funneling us towards certain shows. On a positive note, the Schedule page is much clearer now. I guess it’s easier to plan my weekend mornings. ViewerInVariedVision I suppose the simplification could help new visitors or casual viewers not get overwhelmed, which might be their intent. Though, only offering four show pages doesn't reflect the diverse lineup they’re actually airing. Anyway, did anyone else notice the major improvement in site speed? Seems they’ve optimized it along with the design overhaul. NextGenToonWatcher Yeah, the site’s performance is way better now, ViewerInVariedVision. As for the content, I hope this is just the first step toward a broader, more engaging CW4Kids.com. Maybe they’re testing the waters to see which shows garner the most online interest before developing more standalone pages? Would be smart to go data-driven in their approach. SaturdayMornRevival Reading all your thoughts makes me a bit more optimistic. It does seem like CW4Kids is laying down a foundation for what could be a robust online extension of the Saturday morning experience. Fingers crossed that “phase two” introduces more show pages and maybe some fan interaction features. Keep the feedback coming, crew! Maybe our voices will help shape what comes next. --- **Note:** This conversation is a fictional simulation based on the hypothetical update and restructuring of the CW4Kids.com website, reflecting a situation that could have occurred but did not necessarily happen in reality."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where the channel branding is now styled like the website,","completion":"# Thread Title: CW4Kids Channel Rebranding Now Mirrors Website Revamp! Thoughts? DigitalToonSphere Hey Toon Enthusiasts! Recently tuned into the CW4Kids, and it looks like the channel's on-air branding got a major facelift to match the website's new minimalist style. Everything from the logo animations to the bumper segments now echoes the simplified look of CW4Kids.com. Seems like they're really pushing for a cohesive brand experience. Thoughts on this synchronization between the web and broadcast? StreamlinedShowWatcher Caught that too, DigitalToonSphere! I must say, the cohesion is visually satisfying. The previous mishmash of styles was a bit jarring, so this streamlined approach is a breath of fresh air. It makes the transition from web to TV (and vice versa) feel seamless. Plus, the consistency could strengthen brand recognition, which is probably their goal. RetroToonFan I'm all for a clean, cohesive brand strategy, but I hope the simplification doesn't come at the cost of individual show identities. Part of what made Saturday mornings great was the distinct look and feel of each show. With this minimalist approach, I’m a bit concerned the channel might lose some of its vibrant personality. Does anyone else feel this way? NextWaveViewer I hear you, RetroToonFan, but from what I've seen, the show-specific intros and outros still retain their unique charm. It's more the overarching channel branding and interstitials that follow the simplified theme. If they keep supporting the shows' unique identities within this framework, I think they could strike a good balance. PixelPlayground Interestingly, this branding overhaul could attract a broader audience. The simplified aesthetic is pretty trendy and might appeal to not just younger viewers but also teens and nostalgia-seekers. Has anyone noticed any changes in the programming lineup or promotional strategies that might reflect this broader appeal? ToonStrategist PixelPlayground, I’ve noticed more strategic promos spotlighting “The Spectacular Spider-Man” and “Sonic X”, possibly aiming for that wider demographic you mentioned. It’s clever—use the website’s streamlined appeal to draw viewers in, then hook them with the shows. I'm curious to see if this visual branding cohesion will translate into substantial viewer engagement growth. AnimationAnalyst What stands out to me is the potential for cross-platform interactions. With the channel and website now visually linked, CW4Kids might start rolling out more integrated digital campaigns, leveraging the website to enhance the TV viewing experience and vice versa. It’s an exciting time for convergence in the animation space. Could this be the start of a new trend in how networks engage with their audience? SaturdayMornRevival Really enjoying this discussion, folks. The unanimous recognition of the efforts towards a cohesive brand identity—both in style and strategy—bodes well for CW4Kids. It'll be fascinating to track how this branding evolution impacts their market position and whether it truly enriches our beloved Saturday morning ritual.

CreditsCritic Hello fellow toon enthusiasts! Have you all noticed the new split screen credits style during our favorite shows on CW4Kids? Instead of traditional rolling credits, now there's a split screen with the credits on one side and additional content on the other. Seems like they’re squeezing in promos or sneak peeks. Innovative or just plain distracting? What's your take? SneakPeekSeeker I'm actually loving it! The sneak peeks and promos on the side keep me glued to the screen till the very end. Before, I'd usually switch channels as soon as the credits rolled, but this new format has changed that habit. It’s a clever way to hold our attention and hype up upcoming shows or episodes. PurestToonFan Call me old-fashioned, but I find it somewhat disrespectful to the creators. The credits are there to acknowledge the hard work of the people behind our beloved shows. Compartmentalizing their names into a small segment of the screen feels like they're being sidelined. Plus, it can be hard to read the names when you're distracted by the promo on the other side. DigitalEngagementDude From a digital marketing perspective, it's genius. Viewer retention rates likely see a significant uptick during credits now, which is prime real estate for promoting new content. It’s clear that CW4Kids is adapting to the short attention spans of today’s viewers, ensuring they stay tuned in by offering more than just a scroll of text. AnimationAficionado I'm on the fence. It’s an interesting way to keep viewers engaged, and it’s definitely innovative. However, I do share concerns about the implications for recognizing the creators' hard work. Maybe there’s a middle ground? They could rotate the content, giving some credit sequences the traditional full screen they deserve while using the split screen format in others. NextGenerationViewer Honestly, didn't even notice the change until you guys pointed it out! But now that I'm aware, it does seem like a smart move for keeping the channel engaging. Maybe they could use this format as an opportunity to include fun facts about the making of the episode or showcase fan art during the credits? That way, it feels more inclusive and engaging. ToonTrendWatcher It's fascinating to see the divided opinions here. This split screen credits style clearly represents a shift in how networks are trying to maximize every moment of airtime. What’ll be interesting is seeing if this trend catches on with other channels or if CW4Kids will innovate further based on viewer feedback. Hopefully, they find a way to balance engagement with the rightful celebration of the creators’ efforts. CreditsCritic Loving the diverse perspectives, everyone! It's clear that CW4Kids is stirring the pot with this change, reaching for innovation while navigating viewer expectations and industry norms. Will be interesting to see how this evolves and if any adjustments are made in response to viewer feedback.

Me diga o que faz mais sentindo. Me explique isto, usando uma linguagem extremamente filosófica, bem argumentativa, usando termos filósofos e linguagem com palavras difíceis tipo “posteriori”","completion":"A questão da finitude ou infinitude do universo é uma das indagações mais profundas que atormentam a mente humana desde os tempos primordiais. O enigma que se desdobra diante de nós não é meramente uma questão de mapear os confins espaciais ou temporais, mas sim uma busca pela compreensão da própria fundamentação de toda a existência. Quando adentramos neste domínio, estamos navegando não apenas pelos mares da física, mas também pelas intricadas correntes do pensamento filosófico. A perspectiva da infinitude do universo, sugerida por alguns pensadores, poderia ser encarada através da lente do pensamento apriorístico, ou seja, o conhecimento que procede independentemente da experiência. Sob esse prisma, o infinito é concebido não como um objeto empírico, mas como uma necessidade racional. A infinitude do universo refletiria, então, a incomensurabilidade da realidade, um reino onde o totalitarismo das coisas transcende nossa capacidade de apreensão finita. Essa noção ressoa com aspectos do pensamento de Immanuel Kant, que argumentou sobre a existência de ideias e conceitos que residem além da percepção sensorial, acessíveis apenas pelo império da razão pura. Por outro lado, a visão de um universo finito encontra ressonância na visão de que nosso conhecimento é construído a posteriori, ou seja, derivado da experiência. Nesse contexto, a finitude do universo seria uma conjectura empiricamente embasada pelas observações astronômicas e teorias físicas, como a teoria da relatividade geral de Einstein, que esboça o universo como tendo uma curvatura, sugerindo assim, a possibilidade de uma finitude não apenas temporal, mas também espacial. Esta perspectiva não nega a possibilidade da infinitude como um conceito ou entidade metafísica, mas a encerra fora do escopo de nossa experiência fenomênica direta. Diante dessas reflexões, cabe considerar a posição filosófica do paradoxo: a tentativa humana de compreender a totalidade, seja ela finita ou infinita, é, por si só, uma manifestação da nossa ânsia por transcender os limites do conhecimento. Friedrich Nietzsche, ao proclamar que \\"se você olhar longamente para um abismo, o abismo também olha para dentro de você\\", talvez estivesse também aludindo a isso. O universo, seja finito ou infinito, reflete não apenas uma realidade externa a ser desvendada, mas um abismo onde se espelham as profundezas do próprio pensamento humano. Em suma, a reflexão sobre a finitude ou infinitude do universo transcende as respostas binárias, conduzindo-nos a um terreno onde a questão não é tanto sobre a estrutura espacial ou temporal do cosmos, mas sobre os limites da cognição humana e a inesgotável busca pelo inefável. O universo, em sua magnânima indiferença, permanece como um enigma cósmico — um desafio para a razão e um convite à contemplação filosófica."},{"prompt":"Write a Kids WB lineup from May 2007, compared with one from March 2008 and November 2008 In May 2007, the Kids’ WB programming block was still actively airing on The CW network, following the merger of The WB and UPN into The CW in 2006.

Here is an exemplar Saturday morning slate from May 2007: 1. “Tom and Jerry Tales” 2. “Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!” 3. “Johnny Test” 4. “Legion of Super Heroes” 5. “The Batman” 6. “Xiaolin Showdown” 7. “Loonatics Unleashed” Moving forward to March 2008, Kids’ WB continued airing but with some changes in its lineup due to new shows being introduced and others being phased out. A typical lineup would look something like this: 1. “Will & Dewitt” 2. “Tom and Jerry Tales” 3. “Skunk Fu!” 4. “Johnny Test” 5. “The Spectacular Spider-Man” 6. “Legion of Super Heroes” 7. “The Batman” However, by November 2008, the landscape of Saturday morning cartoons on The CW had notably changed. Kids’ WB aired its last broadcast on May 17, 2008, making way for a new block called The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment. This transition reflected a significant shift in the programming strategy and offerings. For November 2008, under The CW4Kids banner, the lineup would have included shows like: 1. “Will & Dewitt” (Though primarily a part of the early transitional phase) 2. “The Spectacular Spider-Man” 3. “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer” 4. “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX” 5. “Chaotic” 6. “Sonic X” 7. “Dinosaur King” This comparison illustrates the evolution of children’s programming from the traditional Kids’ WB block to the 4Kids-led CW4Kids. The transition showcases a shift towards more action-oriented and franchise-based series, in part driven by the changing landscape of children’s television and the increasing importance of media franchises. Write full 7am-12pm lineups for each of the 3 time periods Creating complete and accurate TV lineups for specific dates and times can be challenging due to variations in regional scheduling, special programming events, and the general shifts in programming strategies over time. However, based on typical lineups and available series around the given periods, the schedules below aim to reflect a generalized snapshot of what the Kids’ WB and later The CW4Kids lineups might have looked like during the mentioned periods. Please note, actual air times for specific shows could vary by region, and special programming could alter the lineup. # May 2007 - Kids’ WB on The CW Saturday Morning - 7:00 AM - “Krypto the Superdog” - 7:30 AM - “Tom and Jerry Tales” - 8:00 AM - “Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!” - 8:30 AM - “Johnny Test” - 9:00 AM - “Legion of Super Heroes” - 9:30 AM - “The Batman” - 10:00 AM - “Xiaolin Showdown” - 10:30 AM - “Loonatics Unleashed” - 11:00 AM - “Monster Allergy” - 11:30 AM - “Spider Riders” # March 2008 - Kids’ WB on The CW Saturday Morning - 7:00 AM - “Will & Dewitt” - 7:30 AM - “Magi-Nation” - 8:00 AM - “Tom and Jerry Tales” - 8:30 AM - “Skunk Fu!” - 9:00 AM - “Johnny Test” - 9:30 AM - “The Spectacular Spider-Man” - 10:00 AM - “Legion of Super Heroes” - 10:30 AM - “The Batman” - 11:00 AM - “Eon Kid” - 11:30 AM - “Storm Hawks” # November 2008 - The CW4Kids Saturday Morning - 7:00 AM - “The Spectacular Spider-Man” - 7:30 AM - “Will & Dewitt” (Subject to change, as 4Kids might intersperse various content here) - 8:00 AM - “Sonic X” - 8:30 AM - “Gogoriki” - 9:00 AM - “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Back to the Sewer” - 9:30 AM - “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX” - 10:00 AM - “Chaotic” - 10:30 AM - “Dinosaur King” - 11:00 AM - “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX” (Another episode or a re-run from earlier) - 11:30 AM - “Skunk Fu!” (Could also be other fillers or repeats, depending on the specific schedule and regional programming) Keep in mind that these lineups are generalized projections based on the types of programming that were prevalent on Kids’ WB and The CW4Kids during the specified periods. The actual lineup could have included variations such as specific holiday specials, marathon blocks of popular shows, or changes due to regional decisions. Write a CW4Kids transitional lineup during Summer 2008, MA is temporarily back, at 11:30am, the block is half-4Kids half KWB at this stage During the transitional phase in Summer 2008, as Kids’ WB morphed into The CW4Kids, the lineup would have been a unique blend of shows from both programming blocks. The mixed nature of this period means that viewers could enjoy a diverse range of content that bridged the gap between the old and new. Below is a hypothetical Saturday morning lineup for this period, reflecting a balance between legacy Kids’ WB shows and new offerings that would define The CW4Kids. It’s important to remember that in such transitional periods, lineups can be especially fluid as networks test viewer reception to various shows. # Transitional CW4Kids Lineup - Summer 2008 Saturday Morning - 7:00 AM - “Magi-Nation” (Kids’ WB legacy content continuing its run) - 7:30 AM - “Tom and Jerry Tales” (A holdover from the Kids’ WB days, beloved by audiences) - 8:00 AM - “Sonic X” (New to the block, bringing in a fresh audience) - 8:30 AM - “Gogoriki” (4Kids content introduced to the lineup) - 9:00 AM - “The Spectacular Spider-Man” (A new but rapidly popular addition from the Kids’ WB final days) - 9:30 AM - “Skunk Fu!” (Another series continuing from the Kids’ WB era) - 10:00 AM - “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX” (A 4Kids staple, marking the new direction of the block) - 10:30 AM - “Legion of Super Heroes” (One of the last Kids’ WB shows airing during the transition) - 11:00 AM - “Johnny Test” (Retaining its slot as it was still a strong performer from the late Kids’ WB lineup) - 11:30 AM - “Monster Allergy” (Reflecting the unique circumstance mentioned, this series makes a brief return or continuation during this hybrid period, serving as a nod to the legacy of Kids’ WB content for viewers during the transition) This hybrid lineup features a mix of superhero-themed series, action-packed adventures, and comedic animated series that aim to cater to a broad audience, from younger children to early teens. The blend reflects an intention to maintain the existing Kids’ WB audience while gradually introducing and testing new content that would come to define The CW4Kids identity. Engaging a transitional lineup like this would have been part of the strategy to ensure a smooth handover from the legacy of Kids’ WB to the new direction under The CW4Kids branding. It helped to gently introduce viewers to new characters and stories while ensuring that they could still enjoy some of their favorite shows from the previous programming block, minimizing viewer drop-off during the changeover period. Write a forum convo in July 2008 where the lines are very blurred as to who owns the block at present, and talk about the current state cw4kids.com is in # Thread Title: Confusion Reigns: Who’s Really in Charge of CW4Kids Now? Plus, What’s Up with CW4Kids.com? CoolToonWatcher Hey folks, have you noticed the weird vibes around the CW4Kids lineup lately? It feels like we’re in some sort of limbo about who’s actually steering the ship. On one hand, there are the remnants of Kids’ WB, but then there’s also a ton of 4Kids branding popping up. I tried checking CW4Kids.com for some clarity, and it’s like stepping into a digital ghost town in some sections. What’s the deal? SaturdayMornNostalgia Absolutely! It’s been super confusing. I saw “Monster Allergy” on the schedule next to “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX,” and it felt like time-traveling between eras. Last I checked, 4Kids was supposed to revamp the whole scene, but it looks like there’s a tug-of-war behind the scenes. Couldn’t find much info on CW4Kids.com either, some parts of the site are incredibly outdated. ToonStrategist Speaking of CW4Kids.com, is anyone else finding the site layout a bit…lost? Half the links to the show pages don’t even work properly, and updates are hit-or-miss. I was looking for info on “The Spectacular Spider-Man” and ended up in a loopback to the homepage. It’s like they started a site overhaul and forgot to finish it. 90sKidForever Yeah, the state of CW4Kids.com is pretty indicative of the broader chaos. I miss the old Kids’ WB site; at least it was updated regularly. Now, with the CW4Kids, it’s as if they’re not sure what direction they’re taking - both online and on-air. I get transitional challenges, but there should be some coherence, right? DigitalDawn Actually, this transition phase seems typical when a major network change happens, but it’s a real test of patience for us fans. On-air, it’s like we’re in a no-man’s land between the legacy of Kids’ WB and the future vision of 4Kids Entertainment. CW4Kids.com feels like a work in progress, reflecting that same uncertainty. Does anyone know if there’s any plan in place to solidify the brand identity, or are we stuck in this hybrid zone for the foreseeable future? ViewerInTransition As far as I can tell, ViewerInTransition, the issue is really about getting all the moving parts to work together. From what I’ve pieced together, it might be a mixture of contractual, branding, and logistical hurdles that are causing these hiccups. As for CW4Kids.com, it seems it’s not the priority right now, but I heard from a forum elsewhere that a major update is supposed to be in the works before the fall season starts. Let’s hope that includes fixing the website and giving us a clearer direction on the programming front. CoolToonWatcher That’s somewhat reassuring, ViewerInTransition. A coherent brand presence online and a stable lineup could really help cement The CW4Kids as a worthy successor to the Saturday morning throne. Fingers crossed that by this fall, we’ll have a clearer understanding, and CW4Kids.com will be a hub we can actually use. SaturdayMornNostalgia In the meantime, guess we’ll all just have to stay tuned (and maybe refresh CW4Kids.com a little less frequently). Thanks for the insights, everyone. It’s reassuring to know it’s not just me scratching my head over the current state of our beloved Saturday morning ritual! — Note: This conversation is a fictional representation of discussions that might have occurred among fans during the transitional period from Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids and does not represent actual forum conversations from that time. Write a follow up where CW4Kids.com is now simplified, and there is only a Home, Schedule, Games and Shows page, and only 7 shows have standalone pages, only 3 of those being Kids WB holdovers","completion":"# Thread Title: CW4Kids.com Finally Simplifies - What’s In, What’s Out? ToonStrategist Hey everyone, have you checked out the revamped CW4Kids.com? It’s drastically simplified now - just Home, Schedule, Games, and Shows pages. Looks like they’re really trying to streamline things, but there are only seven shows with standalone pages. Interestingly, only three are Kids’ WB holdovers. Thoughts? DigitalDawn I saw the update and it’s a huge relief! The site’s way easier to navigate now. But the selection of shows with their own pages is telling. It looks like “Sonic X,” “The Spectacular Spider-Man,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! GX” are getting the spotlight among others. It definitely shows the direction CW4Kids is headed. Kinda sad to see fewer Kids’ WB series featured though. ViewerInTransition I’m actually okay with this leaner approach. The site was a mess before. Having a straightforward way to find the schedule and games is a big plus. It’s interesting to see which shows made the cut for standalone pages. “The Spectacular Spider-Man” totally deserves it, but I’m going to miss having easy access to all the old Kids’ WB content. 90sKidForever Mixed feelings here. On one hand, the site is finally user-friendly. On the other, it feels like we’re closing the book on the Kids’ WB era for good, which is a bit of a bummer. I get that they need to move forward, but the nostalgia factor is huge. At least “Sonic X” is still in the mix. CoolToonWatcher Does anyone know if this slim-down is permanent? I like the clean look and all, but with only seven shows highlighted, I’m worried about variety. The CW4Kids needs to keep refreshing its lineup to stay competitive. Also, curious if the games section got any new additions along with this overhaul? SaturdayMornNostalgia Well, according to what I could find, this change might stick around for a while. It’s part of CW4Kids' strategy to strengthen their brand identity and focus on their most popular or promising shows. It’s definitely a new era, and while I’ll miss the diversity of the old Kids’ WB days, streamlining could be good for them. As for games, there are a few new ones, mostly tied to the shows with standalone pages. ToonStrategist Good points all around. Looks like CW4Kids is really trying to carve out its niche in the Saturday morning landscape. Hopefully, they’ll keep an eye on what made Kids’ WB great while pushing forward. Let’s keep monitoring the change and see how things evolve. As for the site, kudos to them for making it more accessible, even if it’s at the cost of some of the variety we used to enjoy. DigitalDawn Agreed, ToonStrategist. Change is always a bit scary, especially when it involves something as cherished as our Saturday morning routines. But it’s also an opportunity for something new and exciting. Here’s hoping CW4Kids strikes the right balance. And hey, maybe those standalone show pages mean they’re committing to more in-depth content for those series. Could be a win in the long run! --- Note: This follow-up conversation is also a fictional representation and reflects possible fan discussions about the simplified CW4Kids.com website during its transition phase.

The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen's chosen successor and heir of his [Wen's] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen's other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline.

A miscommunication between Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and his [Wen's] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria and Inner Mongolia as protectorates, [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia.

The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/\\"Yat-Sen\\" and the Beiyang Government's Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek's] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia's Chahar and Suiyan regions.

Unlike the tumultuous upheavals seen in other parts of the world, Japan's path was marked by a unique compromise between the progressive forces supporting the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty and the traditional elements aligned with the Tokugawa Shogunate. This delicate equilibrium laid the foundations for an era of unprecedented growth and expansion, making Japan a formidable power on the global stage. The Prologue: Compromise and Continuity The dawn of the Meiji era did not witness the obliteration of the Tokugawa legacy or the samurai class, as many had anticipated. Instead, a groundbreaking compromise was reached, whereby the Tokugawa leadership transformed, adopting roles analogous to the European Reichskanzlers, guiding the nation alongside the rejuvenated imperial institution. The samurai and the daimyō classes were not abolished but were integrated into the newly established Kazoku – a peerage that would become instrumental in Japan's modernization efforts. This fusion of old and new underpinned the astonishingly rapid industrialization and militarization of Japan. The traditional values of loyalty, discipline, and honor blended with Western technological advancements, giving rise to a society that was as unique as it was dynamic. The Empire's ambitions soon extended beyond its shores, culminating in victories against the Great Qing Empire and the annexation of territories such as Taiwan, the Pengu Islands, and Korea, further solidifying its position as a regional powerhouse. The Empire's Protectorates and The Path to Modernization The acquisition of Korea as a protectorate was a pivotal moment in Japan's imperial history. Rather than dismantling the indigenous structures outright, the Japanese administration embarked on a path of industrial and educational reforms aimed at integrating Korea into the empire's economic and social fabric. The approach towards the Korean aristocracy was particularly noteworthy – rather than outright exclusion, the yangban were either assimilated into the Kazoku through matrimonial alliances or systematically marginalized, thus ensuring a smoother transition of power. Similarly, the victories in the First Sino-Japanese War and the strategic acquisitions during the Russian Civil War expanded Japan's dominion and influence. The incorporation of Sakhalin, the Kurils, and later the formal annexation of Korea, were not merely territorial expansions but strategic moves that enhanced Japan's geopolitical leverage and security apparatus. A New Era in East Asia: The Restoration of the Ming and The Empire of China Parallel to Japan's ascendancy, the East Asian geopolitical landscape underwent significant transformations. The Xinhai Revolution, driven by the ambition to \\"Overthrow Qing, restore Ming,\\" succeeded in its primary objective, albeit with an unexpected twist. The reestablishment of the Ming dynasty under the aegis of the Beiyang Government marked the birth of a new era. The Empire of China, as it came to be known, was an entity that cleverly amalgamated the historical prestige of the Ming with the modernity and militarism brought by Yuan Shikai and his successors. Yuan Shikai's strategic decision to restore the Ming instead of proclaiming himself emperor had far-reaching implications for China's internal cohesion and its relations with Japan and other powers. The newly reconstituted Chinese state sought to modernize by adopting a federal structure that allowed for significant regional autonomy within a unified imperial framework. This move, in many ways, mirrored the Japanese model of synthesizing tradition with progressivism, paving the way for a collaborative and competitive relationship between the two empires. The Legacy and The Lessons As the 20th century progressed, both the Great Japanese Empire and the Empire of China navigated the tumultuous waters of global politics with a keen awareness of their unique positions. The series of compromises and adaptations that had marked their respective paths to modernization became a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of East Asian civilizations. The relationship between the Shogun and the Emperor, symbolic of the broader synthesis between tradition and modernity, remained a cornerstone of Japan's identity, guiding its actions on the international stage. In a world where the clash between the old and the new often resulted in chaos, the story of Japan's Meiji Restoration and its aftermath stands out as a beacon of strategic compromise and holistic vision. From the halls of the restored Ming in China to the bustling streets of Tokyo, the legacy of this era continues to inspire and challenge, reminding us of the enduring power of unity in diversity."},{"prompt":"The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a novel chapter style format, focusing on how the compromise between the reformers and the traditionalists within the Tokugawa shogunate that lead to the Meiji Restoration was achieved and how the Great Japanese Empire dealt with samurai who refused to accept the new order within Japan.","completion":"**Chapter XII: Shadows Over Edo** *The fading light of the setting sun cast long shadows across the sprawling metropolis of Edo. Amidst the bustling streets, where steam-powered carriages and horse-drawn carts clamored side by side, a secret meeting was about to set the course of the empire.* In a secluded chamber of the Imperial palace, barely illuminated by the flickering light of gas lamps, reformists and traditionalists sat around a mahogany table. The air was thick with tension, each person aware of the weight their decisions would carry. At the head of the table, Emperor Meiji, a youthful figure who bore the hopes of a nation, cleared his throat, signaling for silence. \\"My esteemed council,\\" began Emperor Meiji, his voice steady but imbued with the unwavering resolve that had come to define his reign. \\"We stand at a precipice. The choice we make today will either forge our empire into a beacon of modernity or condemn us to the annals of history as a relic of bygone times.\\" On his right, Yoshinobu Tokugawa, the last Shogun, sat with a stoic expression, his mind a battlefield between allegiance to tradition and the undeniable necessity for reform. He was flanked by samurai, their hands resting lightly on the hilts of their swords, a silent testament to their readiness to defend their convictions, even unto death. And on the emperor's left, representatives of the reformists, visionaries who dreamt of a Japan propelled into the future by steam and steel. They spoke of railways that would connect distant lands, factories that would billow smoke like dragons of industry, and a fleet that would command the respect of Western powers. As the discussion unfolded, voices rose and fell, arguments clashed like steel on steel, yet Emperor Meiji remained a calm anchor in the storm. He spoke of compromise, of a vision where tradition and modernity walked hand in hand, where the samurai would not be discarded but redefined. It was then that the sound of gunfire shattered the night, a stark reminder of those who lurked in the shadows, unwilling to embrace the uncertain future. The chamber erupted into chaos, samurai drawing their swords, reformists seeking cover. But Yoshinobu rose, his hand raised for peace. \\"This is our answer,\\" he declared, his voice cutting through the turmoil. \\"Our empire is under attack, not from without, but from within. It is not the foreigner at our gates that threatens us, but our refusal to unite.\\" As if on cue, the emperor's elite guard burst into the room, their steam-powered weaponry trained on the assailants who had infiltrated the palace. The attack was quelled, but the message was clear: the path to modernity would be fraught with peril, from enemies both seen and unseen. In the aftermath, a decree was penned, one that would see the samurai not dissolved but transformed. They would become part of the Kazoku, the nobility, their skills and loyalty pivotal in guiding the empire into the new age. Industrial magnates and visionary engineers would join their ranks, creating a new order that married the wisdom of the past with the promise of the future. But as Edo slept, restless under the watchful gaze of the moon, whispers filled the night. Dissenters spoke of resistance, of preserving the purity of the samurai way, even as the empire surged forward on rails of progress and smoke. In the shadows, a figure watched, his eyes reflecting the gleam of a mechanical prosthetic arm, a samurai who refused to yield to the changing tides. A steampunk ronin, lost in an age that no longer had a place for him, and yet, he would carve his own path, one that might lead him to ally with enemies of the empire or to become its greatest defender. For in this new Japan, where steam and blade met in an uneasy alliance, the only certainty was the impermanence of power, and those who would shape the empire's destiny were as likely to be found in the illuminated halls of the Imperial palace as they were in the smoke-filled back alleys of Edo. *And so, the stage was set for a confrontation that would test the very soul of the empire, a battle not just of swords and steam, but of ideals. The dawn of a new era was upon Japan, but whether it would be greeted with open arms or drawn blades remained to be seen.*"},{"prompt":"The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a novel chapter style format, focusing on how the buke/samurai and the daimyō were [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] absorbed [the buke/samurai and the daimyō] into the then newly formed Kazoku after the Meiji Restoration and how the government of the Tokugawa shogunate was restructured into the Great Japanese Empire, along with the reactions of the Japanese populace to this.","completion":"**Chapter XVII: The Steam of New Horizons** *Under the cloak of an overcast sky, the city of Kyoto, heart of the newly proclaimed Great Japanese Empire, pulsed with an energy as potent and unpredictable as the steam engines that powered its factories. The streets, lined with gas lamps that flickered like fireflies caught in a perpetual twilight, thrummed with the footsteps of progress and the whispers of resistance.* In the sprawling compound of the ancient Nijo Castle, now repurposed as a governmental headquarters, the architects of the future convened. The air within was charged with the scent of oiled mahogany and the barely concealed ambition of the nation's elite. Here, the fate of the samurai and the daimyō would be sealed, their transition into the Kazoku—nobles of the new order—meticulously orchestrated. At the center of the grand hall, a massive table bore the weight of maps, blueprints, and proposals. It was surrounded by the former daimyō and leaders of the samurai clans, clad not in their traditional armor but in the Western-style dress that symbolized the empire's embrace of the new world. Beside them, industrial magnates and visionary engineers, their faces marked by the soot of invention, spoke with a fervor that matched the intensity of the steam engines they revered. \\"The era of the sword has ended,\\" declared a once-powerful daimyō, his voice betraying a hint of nostalgia overshadowed by pragmatic resolve. \\"We must forge a new path, one of industry and innovation, where our might is measured not by our skill with a blade but by our ability to drive the empire into the future.\\" A murmur of agreement rippled through the assembly, though it was not without its undercurrents of dissent. The samurai, for centuries the unchallenged military elite, struggled with their identity in this rapidly changing landscape. Yet, the promise of becoming Kazoku offered a semblance of continuity, a bridge between their storied past and the industrial future. \\"The transformation will not be easy,\\" cautioned an engineer, his eyes alight with the vision of steam-powered ships dominating the seas and trains knitting the empire closer. \\"But it is necessary. Our factories will need the leadership and discipline the samurai and daimyō can provide. In return, the empire will honor their service and legacy through the Kazoku, ensuring their place in this new era.\\" The discussion turned to the restructuring of the government, a task as daunting as it was critical. The Tokugawa Shogunate, with its rigid hierarchy and feudal obligations, would give way to a system where merit and innovation held sway. The emperor would be the state's soul, but the steam—literal and metaphorical—propelling the empire forward would be harnessed by this new aristocracy forged from the old and the new. Outside the walls of Nijo Castle, the Japanese populace watched with a mix of awe and apprehension. The transformation of their homeland was palpable, from the steam trains that carved through the landscape to the factories that dotted the horizon. Yet, this leap into modernity was not without its casualties; the wayfarer samurai, masterless and adrift in a world that no longer had a place for their skills, epitomized the personal toll of progress. As night descended over Kyoto, the vibrant hues of neon signs began to compete with the stars, a testament to the empire's relentless march towards the future. In the shadows of progress, however, the spirit of the samurai endured. Whether as protectors of the new order or as its silent critics, their legacy would continue to shape the empire in ways unseen and unforeseen. For in this age of steam and ambition, the Great Japanese Empire found itself navigating a course fraught with challenges both external and internal. Yet, driven by the unyielding spirit of the Kazoku and fueled by the engines of progress, it sailed steadfastly into the dawn of a new era—an era where the echoes of the past whispered secrets to those willing to listen. *And so, amid the clash of old values and new paradigms, the empire stood at the threshold of destiny, its heart beating to the rhythm of steam engines, its gaze fixed on the limitless horizon.*"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Me explique isto, usando uma linguagem extremamente filosófica, bem argumentativa, usando termos filósofos e linguagem com palavras difíceis tipo “posteriori”","completion":"A via do primeiro motor imóvel, profundamente sedimentada nos escritos de Aristóteles e posteriormente reintepretada e expandida por teólogos e filósofos medievais, como São Tomás de Aquino, oferece um caminho fecundo para a argumentação concernente à existência de um ente supremo, denomindado Deus. Esta via se estabelece primariamente sobre a observação empírica, apoiada na causalidade e na impossibilidade de uma regressão ad infinitum em cadeias causais. Aristóteles, em sua obra \\"Física\\", postula que tudo que se move é movido por algo. Este princípio aristotélico fundamenta-se na observação do mundo físico, no qual as entidades estão em constante estado de transformação e movimento. No entanto, se adotarmos uma análise mais detida, nos deparamos com a necessidade filosófica de uma causa primeira, um motor que não seja ele próprio movido, o que denotamos como o motor imóvel. Este motor imóvel, na cosmovisão aristotélica, emerge como causa sui, ou seja, causa de si mesmo, não necessitando de uma causa externa para seu movimento ou existência, rompendo assim a cadeia de causalidade que, de outro modo, se estenderia ad infinitum. Tal concepção configura-se como uma exegese a posteriori, partindo da observação da causalidade no mundo para a inferência de uma causa primeira não causada. A inserção deste argumento dentro do discurso teológico, notadamente através de São Tomás de Aquino em sua magna obra \\"Suma Teológica\\", amplifica sua potência argumentativa ao apontar para a necessidade de uma entidade que, por sua essência, detenha a capacidade de iniciar o movimento sem que seja movido, atribuindo tal característica a Deus. Aquino coaduna a lógica aristotélica com os postulados teológicos cristãos, erigindo uma ponte entre a razão filosófica e a fé, de modo a apresentar uma justificação racional para a crença na existência de uma entidade divina. Entretanto, é mister notar que tal argumentação não está isenta de controvérsias e objeções, principalmente emergindo do pensamento pós-cartesiano, que questiona a validade de inferências a posteriori para afirmar verdades metafísicas transcendentes. Críticos argumentam que a inferência de uma causa primeira imutável a partir da cadeia causal finita e condicionada pode constituir um salto lógico, uma falácia de composição que atribui ao todo propriedades de suas partes. Apesar dessas contestações, a via do motor imóvel permanece como um dos alicerces na discussão filosófica acerca da existência de Deus, obrigando-nos a enfrentar as profundezas ontológicas da realidade, questionando a suficiência das causas contingentes e temporais para a explicação do movimento e da existência. O argumento, ao postular a necessidade de uma causa primeira não causada, convida ao reconhecimento de um princípio originário transcendente, calçado na lógica e na observação do universo físico, perpetuando-se como uma indagação perene na jornada humana em busca de sentido e compreensão do substrato último da realidade."},{"prompt":"Usando o vazio quântico, refute este argumento.","completion":"A refutação do argumento do primeiro motor imóvel, quando contextualizada sob a perspectiva do vazio quântico ou do vácuo quântico, exige uma reavaliação das noções clássicas de causalidade e existência, transcendendo os limites impostos pela física clássica e adentrando no domínio da física quântica. Este domínio revela uma realidade subatômica inerentemente probabilística e não-determinista, onde as entidades não seguem trajetórias predeterminadas, mas são descritas por funções de onda que encapsulam a probabilidade de encontrar a partícula em uma dada posição no espaço e no tempo. O vazio quântico, contrário à noção intuitiva de \\"vazio\\" como a ausência de ser ou matéria, é um caldo borbulhante de energia e atividade, onde partículas virtuais e antipartículas emergem e aniquilam-se constantemente. Esta realidade subatômica, subjacente ao tecido do espaço-tempo, desafia a ideia aristotélica-thomista de um motor imóvel, já que a causalidade, tal como compreendida tradicionalmente, não se mantém intacta no nível quântico. Primeiramente, a noção de causalidade linear e absoluta é problematizada pela indeterminação quântica exemplificada no princípio da incerteza de Heisenberg. Este princípio estabelece que não é possível conhecer simultaneamente com precisão a posição e o momentum de uma partícula, lançando uma sombra de incerteza sobre a previsibilidade e a determinação exata do estado das entidades físicas. Tal indeterminação aponta para a existência de processos nos quais a causa e o efeito não seguem uma sequência estritamente predeterminada, mas sim uma lógica probabilística e não-determinista. Além disso, o fenômeno de flutuações quânticas no vácuo desafia a premissa aristotélica da impossibilidade de um movimento sem um motor prévio. No vácuo quântico, partículas e antipartículas emergem de \\"nada\\", numa manifestação espontânea que não requer uma causa externa identificável dentro do âmbito da causalidade clássica. Esta emergência espontânea de partículas a partir do vácuo quântico fornece um paradigma pelo qual o universo pode, a principio, ter surgido de uma flutuação quântica sem a necessidade de invocar uma causa primeira não causada. Em suma, enquanto a via do primeiro motor imóvel apela para uma cadeia de causalidade que necessitaria de uma terminação em um ente supremo - um motor imóvel - para evitar uma regressão ad infinitum, a mecânica quântica e o conceito do vazio quântico demonstram que a realidade, no seu estrato mais fundamental, opera de acordo com princípios que constituem uma exceção à causalidade clássica e linear. Estes princípios trazem à luz uma compreensão onde o surgimento de entidades, movimentos e até mesmo do próprio universo não requerem, necessariamente, uma causa primeira externa, refutando o argumento do primeiro motor imóvel mediante um entendimento mais profundo e não-intuitivo da natureza da realidade, conforme revelado pela física quântica."},{"prompt":"Create a logical tic tac toe variant that avoid draws, has balanced mechanics, easy to learn but difficult to master, there is a high replayability, multiple ways of winning, no luck involved, no first player advantage and is only played on a 2d board","completion":"The game proposed is called \\"Quantum Tic Tac Toe Plus\\" (QTTT+). QTTT+ is a strategic, two-player game that builds on the classic Tic Tac Toe framework but introduces elements that eliminate draws, ensure balance, and add depth to gameplay. The game is played on a standard 3x3 board. # Game Mechanics 1. **Quantum Moves:** A quantum move allows a player to place a “quantum mark,” which is a pair of possible positions for their symbol (X or O). For instance, a player could place a mark that is simultaneously in the top left and top right squares. Each square can only be involved in one quantum pair at a time. 2. **Quantum Collapse:** When a player decides to make a quantum move that intersects with an existing quantum pair, those pairs \\"collapse\\" based on the player's choice. For example, if there's a pair in the top left and top middle, and the next player places a pair that includes the top middle and top right, they choose which of the two shared positions they want, solidifying one of their symbols in that position and forcing the opponent's symbol to the other position. This forces both pairs involved to resolve to singular, classical moves, eliminating the quantum states. 3. **Alternate Victory Conditions:** The game introduces multiple victory conditions beyond the traditional three-in-a-row. Players can win by: - Traditional three-in-a-row. - Creating a \\"Quantum Loop\\" – a scenario where quantum pairs are set up in a loop across the board that forces a winning quantum collapse from any point of resolution. - “Dominant Presence” – having your symbols present (either in resolved classical form or as part of quantum pairs) in at least two squares of every row, column, and diagonal. 4. **Balanced Turns:** To counteract the potential first-player advantage, after the first initial round (where Player 1 places a quantum mark followed by Player 2 placing theirs), players alternate not just placing quantum marks but also choosing when to invoke a quantum collapse if possible. This makes the choice of when to collapse a strategic decision. 5. **Forced Collapse:** If all squares are filled with quantum marks and no player has won yet, players take turns choosing which quantum state to collapse until a winner is decided or all states are resolved, leading to the rare possibility of a draw—greatly reduced from traditional Tic Tac Toe. # Design Philosophy - **Avoiding Draws:** The introduction of quantum moves and multiple victory conditions significantly reduces the chance of a draw. - **Balanced Mechanics:** By alternating the power to collapse quantum states, the game balances out any first-player advantages. - **Ease of Learning:** The game's rules extend naturally from traditional Tic Tac Toe, making it easy to understand for beginners. - **Depth of Strategy:** With quantum moves and various victory conditions, players must think several moves ahead, making mastering the game challenging. - **Replayability:** The quantum aspect introduces a high variability in gameplay, ensuring that no two games are the same. - **Multiple Winning Strategies:** The various ways to win encourage players to adapt their strategies constantly and look for unconventional paths to victory. - **No Luck Involved:** The outcome entirely depends on the players’ decisions, requiring skill and strategic planning. - **2D Board:** The game maintains the simplicity and accessibility of being played on a 2D board, making it easily adoptable and scalable to different formats (physical board, online, app).

The game retains the simplicity of Tic Tac Toe, making it accessible to all ages and backgrounds while introducing gameplay twists that eliminate draws, balance the game, offer easy-to-learn mechanics, high replayability, and require strategic thinking. # Core Mechanics 1. **Symbols**: Players still choose between X and O. 2. **Dynamic Grid**: After every 2 turns (once each player has played), the grid rotates 90 degrees clockwise. The rotation might suddenly create or disrupt winning opportunities. # Game Rules 1. **Twists Tags**: At the start of the game, each player gets 2 Twist Tags. 2. **Twist Tag Use**: A Twist Tag can be used to either: - **Block a Rotation**: This can be declared after a player's turn, before the grid rotates. It prevents the grid from rotating that turn. - **Double Move**: A player can use a Twist Tag to take two turns in a row. They can only do this once per game. 3. **Winning Conditions**: - Traditional three-in-a-row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. - Achieving a “T” formation with your symbols. # Balancing Mechanics - **Twist Tags**: These provide strategic depth and balance, offering each player the chance to counter or set up potential wins, with no significant advantage to the first player. - **Grid Rotation**: This mechanic dynamically alters the board, making strategic positioning crucial and unpredictable. # Design Philosophy: - **Avoiding Draws**: The dynamic nature of the grid rotation and the strategic use of Twist Tags make achieving a draw much less likely. - **Balanced Mechanics**: Both players have equal and limited power-ups (Twist Tags), ensuring fair play. - **Ease of Learning**: The rules are simple with minimal additions, making it accessible to anyone familiar with classic Tic Tac Toe. - **Depth of Strategy**: Deciding when to use Twist Tags and predicting the outcome of grid rotations introduce a deep strategic layer. - **Replayability**: The unpredictability of rotations and varied use of Twist Tags ensure a unique experience each game. - **Multiple Ways of Winning**: Introducing a new winning condition opens up different strategies to explore. - **No Luck Involved**: Player choices exclusively determine the game’s outcome. - **Played on a 2D Board**: Maintains the classic simplicity by using the traditional Tic Tac Toe board.

The syntax for a lambda function with variadic template parameters involves capturing variables from the lambda's enclosing scope (if necessary), followed by the auto keyword and a template parameter pack in the parameter list. Here is the general syntax: \`\`\`cpp [ capture ] <typename... Args>(Args... args) { /* lambda body */ } \`\`\` Or, for a more concrete example that sums any number of arguments: \`\`\`cpp auto sum = [](auto... args) { return (... + args); }; \`\`\` This lambda uses a fold expression (\`... + args\`) to sum all its arguments, regardless of their number or types, as long as they support the addition operator. The \`auto\` keyword in the parameter list enables the lambda to accept any type of argument, and the parameter pack \`args\` represents an arbitrary number of arguments. You can also specify return type explicitly: \`\`\`cpp auto sum = [](auto... args) -> decltype((args + ...)) { return (... + args); }; \`\`\` This version makes the return type explicit, using decltype and a fold expression to deduce it. It's especially useful when the return type might not be obvious or when you want to ensure correctness and clarity in your code. Here's another example, demonstrating the use of a lambda that prints all its variadic arguments: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> int main() { auto print_all = [](const auto&... args) { (std::cout << ... << args) << 'n'; }; print_all(\\"This\\", \\" \\", \\"is\\", \\" \\", \\"a\\", \\" \\", \\"test\\", \\".\\", 1, 2.3); return 0; } \`\`\` This example uses a fold expression over the \`<<\` operator to print all arguments to \`std::cout\`, demonstrating how variadic lambda functions can work with different types and numbers of arguments.

Args>(T arg, Args... args) { /* lambda body */ } \`\`\` Here is a simple example demonstrating its use: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> int main() { auto lambda = []<typename T>(T value) { std::cout << value << 'n'; }; lambda(10); // integer lambda(10.5); // double lambda(\\"Hello\\"); // C-style string (char array) // Lambda with more than one template parameter auto multi_param_lambda = []<typename T, typename U>(T val1, U val2) { std::cout << val1 << \\", \\" << val2 << 'n'; }; multi_param_lambda(1, \\"test\\"); // int and C-style string multi_param_lambda(std::string(\\"This is \\"), 123); // std::string and int return 0; } \`\`\` In this example, the first lambda is a simple generic lambda that takes one template parameter \`T\` and prints it. The second lambda, \`multi_param_lambda\`, demonstrates how you can use more than one template parameter in your lambdas by taking two parameters of types \`T\` and \`U\` and then printing them. This directly showcases the power and flexibility of template lambdas introduced with C++20. You can use these template lambdas in many contexts where you might have used class templates or function templates before, but with the added advantage of the concise and inline nature of lambda expressions. This feature is part of the overall trend in modern C++ towards more expressive, concise, and flexible language constructs. Remember, to compile code that uses C++20 features like template lambdas, you need to ensure your compiler supports the C++20 standard and is configured to use it (usually through a compiler flag, like \`-std=c++20\` for GCC and Clang)."},{"prompt":"Can You make an battleship project for processing 4? And if you must you will be allowed to send multiple messages to complete the code.","completion":"Certainly! Creating an entire Battleship game requires a good amount of code, so I'll break this down into multiple messages, focusing first on setting up the basic game structure in Processing 4. We'll build a simplified version for clarity and brevity. The complete game can be expanded with additional features like better AI for the computer, a graphical interface, game restart capability, and more. # Part 1: Setup and Drawing the Board Battleship is a two-player guessing game where players try to sink each other's ships on a hidden board. For simplicity, our version will play against the computer, and we won't implement ship placement by the player, but rather randomly place them. First, let's set up the environment, draw the game board, and define some constants for easier configuration. \`\`\`java // Constants for the game final int NUM_ROWS = 10; final int NUM_COLS = 10; final int CELL_SIZE = 40; final int BOARD_OFFSET = 20; // Player and AI boards and ship status int[][] playerBoard = new int[NUM_ROWS][NUM_COLS]; int[][] AIBoard = new int[NUM_ROWS][NUM_COLS]; // Let's represent Ship presence with 1 and No ship with 0 for simplicity final int SHIP = 1; final int NO_SHIP = 0; // Flags to check whether a cell has been hit before final int HIT = -1; final int MISS = -2; void setup() { size(840, 420); background(255); // Initialize boards; for this example, we'll add the ships later initBoards(); // Draw initial boards drawBoards(); } void initBoards() { for (int row = 0; row < NUM_ROWS; row++) { for (int col = 0; col < NUM_COLS; col++) { playerBoard[row][col] = NO_SHIP; AIBoard[row][col] = NO_SHIP; } } // We'll add ships here in the next part } void drawBoards() { // Draw player board for (int row = 0; row < NUM_ROWS; row++) { for (int col = 0; col < NUM_COLS; col++) { stroke(0); fill(200); rect(BOARD_OFFSET + col * CELL_SIZE, BOARD_OFFSET + row * CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE); } } // Draw AI board with an offset for (int row = 0; row < NUM_ROWS; row++) { for (int col = 0; col < NUM_COLS; col++) { stroke(0); fill(200); rect(width/2 + BOARD_OFFSET + col * CELL_SIZE, BOARD_OFFSET + row * CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE); } } } \`\`\` This part sets up a two-dimensional array for both the player and the computer, and initializes a board for each. We're using \`rect()\` to draw each cell of the game board. # Part 2: Adding Ships In the second part, we'll focus on adding ships to the boards. For simplicity, let's randomly place a single ship for the player and the AI. Real-life Battleship has ships of various lengths, but we'll use a single-cell ship for demonstration. \`\`\`java void addSingleShipRandomly(int[][] board) { int row = int(random(NUM_ROWS)); int col = int(random(NUM_COLS)); board[row][col] = SHIP; } // Inside setup(), after initializing the board: void setup() { size(840, 420); background(255); // Initialize and draw boards initBoards(); drawBoards(); // Add ships randomly addSingleShipRandomly(playerBoard); addSingleShipRandomly(AIBoard); } \`\`\` # Next Steps The following parts would include handling player input for guessing, visual feedback for hits and misses, AI turns, and determining the game's end condition. Due to the complexity and length of creating a comprehensive game like Battleship, this walkthrough provides a basic foundation. Implementing full game logic including win conditions, more complex ship placement, and an AI would significantly extend this code.

Your original structure suggests an ambitious approach to create a two-player game, with player 2 being controlled by AI in a separate window. Below are some changes and recommendations: # PlayerOne Tab Adjustments: 1. **Game Initialization and Restart:** Ensure \`gameState\` is correctly set during setup and restart processes. 2. **Drawing Ships and Hits/Misses:** Your \`drawgrid()\` function effectively sets up the board, but consider adding more visual feedback for players during the game's SETUP phase. 3. **Handling Turns and Game States:** Your control flow for game states and turns could be made clearer to avoid potential issues like skipping turns or mismanaging the game state. # Recommended Changes for PlayerOne: I'll focus on the highlights for adjustments and additions for readability and performance. Assuming you retain the structure, here are modifications you can directly implement or adapt. - **Improving Game Restart**: Ensure that all relevant game variables are reset during a restart. It seems you already have a restart mechanic with \`key == 'r'\` in \`draw()\`, make sure to also reset player ships, AI ships, and the gameState back to SETUP. - **Mouse Interaction Feedback**: In \`mousePressed()\`, ensure that besides placing ships, players receive adequate feedback for actions such as successful hits, misses, and invalid actions. - **Synchronized Shooting Mechanism**: When implementing shooting mechanics (\`checkGuess()\` for Player1 and \`shoot()\` for Player2), ensure synchronization between both players regarding hits, misses, and game state transitions. # Player2 Tab Clarifications: 1. **AI Decision Making**: The \`shoot()\` function includes a simple algorithm that randomly selects targets. For a more challenging AI, consider strategies that follow up on successful hits. 2. **Shared Data**: Ensure data sharing between the two sketches is managed correctly, especially shared access to \`grid\`, ensuring synchronization between the player board and AI actions. # Recommended Changes for Player2: - **AI Shoot Logic**: The AI simply picks a random cell that hasn't been shot at yet. For an improved experience, consider implementing a smarter algorithm for the AI that targets adjacent cells after a hit. - **Visual Feedback**: Similar to PlayerOne, ensure that both hits and misses are properly visualized on the AI's board to provide clear feedback for the player. You might also want to directly influence visual aspects within the AI's board based on game events. # General Advice: - **Synchronization**: Make sure your data is properly synchronized between the two windows (PlayerOne and Player2 sketches). This includes updating both boards appropriately and ensuring that both GUIs reflect the current state of the game accurately. - **Debugging and Game Flow**: Pay close attention to the game flow, including transitions between turns and game states. Debugging messages (using \`println()\`) can help track state changes and interactions. - **Enhancing User Experience**: Consider adding more visual cues and instructions for the player. This can include highlighting current player turns, showing remaining ships, and providing prompts or buttons for restarting the game or placing ships. This is a substantial project, and integrating these suggestions should provide a solid foundation for your Battleship game, enhancing its gameplay, user interaction, and visual feedback. Feel free to adapt these recommendations based on specific requirements or features you intend to implement."},{"prompt":"Can you write the code to actually do this?","completion":"Integrating the entire Battleship game within the constraints of this platform can be quite complex due to the extensive logic and interactions required. However, I can refine your design based on the code you have, focusing on improving the game play and fixing potential issues. Given the constraints, I'll demonstrate key improvements. This updated version will include essential changes to ensure the game flow works as expected. Since you've structured the game across two Processing sketches, keep in mind that the actual implementation of sharing data between separate PApplet instances (your two tabs) in Processing is unconventional but interesting. Normally, a single sketch with class definitions or multiple classes within the same sketch is advised for simplicity. For the sake of demonstration, let's refine your main game logic within the \`PlayerOne\` tab. Then, I'll make adjustments to the \`Player2\` class focusing on making it functional within a single sketch setup. # Adjusting the PlayerOne Tab Considering space, I'll adjust a few key aspects like setup, mouse interaction, and shot handling. This is an example; you may need additional tweaks for completeness. \`\`\`java // Variables, enum and setup() remain as you defined. void draw() { background(200); // It's useful to redraw the background each frame to \\"refresh\\" the UI. drawgrid(); grabshots(); // Call it here to continuously update the game board with shots. } // Your mousePressed() and checkGuess(int r, int c) remain as you defined. void drawgrid() { for (int r=0; r<20; r++) { for (int c=0; c<20; c++) { if (grid[r][c] == 0) fill(100); // Unknown else if (grid[r][c] == 1) fill(50, 50, 100); // Player1's ship else if (grid[r][c] == 2 || grid[r][c] == -2) fill(200, 0, 0); // Hit else if (grid[r][c] == 3) fill(250); // Miss square(b[r], b[c], 25); } } } // Your \`printt()\` and other methods remain largely unchanged. \`\`\` # Adjusting the Player2 Class within the \\"PlayerOne\\" Tab It's unconventional to run two instances of PApplet (as in your \`Player2\` class extending \`PApplet\`). An alternative approach is defining a simple AI algorithm within the same sketch. Here's a simplified AI functionality: \`\`\`java class Player2 { // Assume grid and other relevant variables are accessible. ArrayList<PVector> shots = new ArrayList<PVector>(); void shoot() { int r, c; do { r = (int) random(0, 20); c = (int) random(0, 20); } while (shots.contains(new PVector(r, c)) || grid[r][c] > 0); shots.add(new PVector(r, c)); // Implement shooting logic similar to your \`mousePressed\` and \`checkGuess\`. if (grid[r][c] == 1) { // IMPLYING Player1's ship exists here println(\\"AI hit at \\" + r + \\", \\" + c); grid[r][c] = 2; // Marking as Player1's ship hit totalship1--; } else { println(\\"AI miss at \\" + r + \\", \\" + c); grid[r][c] = 3; // Marking as Miss } // Ensure game state and turn handling are updated appropriately. checkForWinAndSwitchTurn(); // Call this after AI makes a move. } } \`\`\` # Running the Revised Code Since creating and extending \`PApplet\` directly for \`Player2\` was likely an attempt to open a new window for AI actions, this revised approach brings all logic into a cohesive structure within one sketch. You'll need to adjust further to ensure all game mechanics, such as ship placement, shooting, and win condition checking, are fully integrated and functional within your game loop. This streamlined example focuses on the core adjustments for the single-window game. Depending on the project's requirements or your learning goals, consider exploring more sophisticated state management, AI algorithms, and player interaction methods."},{"prompt":"Create a logical tic tac toe variant that avoid draws, has balanced mechanics, easy to learn but difficult to master, there is a high replayability, multiple ways of winning, no luck involved, no first player advantage and is only played on a 2d board and that anybody from any background to be able to play this","completion":"The proposed game, \\"Triad Tactics\\", enhances the classic game of Tic Tac Toe while meeting the criteria outlined. # Rules: 1. **Board Size:** The game is played on a 5x5 grid, providing more space for strategic depth and multiple win conditions. 2. **Objective:** Win the game by either getting four in a row of your symbol (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or creating a 2x2 square of your symbols. 3. **Player Symbols:** One player uses X, and the other uses O. Players take turns placing their symbol on the board. 4. **Balanced Turn Order:** - The game uses a unique turn order to eliminate first-player advantage, called the \\"Turn Balance Mechanism\\". After the first player (X) makes the initial move, the second player (O) makes two moves consecutively. Post this, the turn order switches to one move per player for the rest of the game. - A \\"Forced Move Rule\\" is implemented to prevent repetitive advantage: If a player creates three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), their next move must be at least two squares away in any direction from this line. 5. **No Draws Mechanism:** To avoid draws, if the board is filled without any player winning through the standard win conditions, the player with the most three-in-a-rows (referred to as \\"mini-triads\\") wins. If there is still a tie, it's determined by who has more 2x2 squares. If still tied, the game is declared a strategic draw, an outcome so rare it emphasizes the skill over luck. 6. **Multiple Win Conditions:** To increase complexity and decrease predictability, players can win either by getting four in a row or creating a 2x2 square of their symbols. This promotes strategic diversity and foresight. # Features: - **Balanced Mechanics:** The \\"Turn Balance Mechanism\\" and the \\"Forced Move Rule\\" ensure both players have equal opportunity to win, eliminating the first-move advantage. - **Easy to Learn but Hard to Master:** The game is simple to understand – make four in a row or a 2x2 square. However, the tactical depth, especially with the additional win conditions and balancing mechanisms, makes mastery challenging. - **High Replayability:** The larger board size, multiple win conditions, and balancing rules ensure that no two games are the same. - **No Luck Involved:** Success in Triad Tactics depends entirely on players' strategic planning and foresight. - **Accessible:** The game requires only a 5x5 grid and two types of markers, making it easy for anyone to play, regardless of background. The rules are straightforward but allow for deep strategic gameplay. # Conclusion: \\"Triad Tactics\\" takes the foundations of Tic Tac Toe and builds a much more complex and engaging experience on top. The balancing mechanics ensure fair play, while the increased board size and win conditions offer players a rich tapestry of strategies to explore. This variant remains accessible to all, true to the spirit of its inspiration, but dives deeper into the realms of tactical prowess and strategic foresight."},{"prompt":"aren't there better ways to balance the first turn mover advatange","completion":"Yes, there are several innovative approaches that can be applied to balance the first-move advantage in games like tic-tac-toe variants, ensuring a fair opportunity for both players. Here are a few strategies that could further refine the balance and enrich the strategy needed for a game like \\"Triad Tactics\\": # Pie Rule (Split-and-Choose Mechanism) 1. **Implementation**: After the first player makes the initial move, the second player can choose to switch sides. 2. **Advantages**: This balances the advantage of going first by allowing the second player to decide if the first move was strong enough that they'd prefer to take that position for themselves. It forces the first player to think strategically about not making their first move too advantageous. # Dynamic Board Mechanics 1. **Implementation**: Introduce a mechanic where the board itself has certain areas that activate or change state based on certain conditions being met, e.g., after the 5th move, certain squares could become \\"locked\\" or offer a bonus. 2. **Advantages**: Adds an element of strategic depth, as players must not only counter their opponent's moves but also plan for these board changes. This could help mitigate first-mover advantage by introducing new tactical considerations that apply to both players as the game progresses. # Turn-Based Power-Ups 1. **Implementation**: Each player has a one-time-use power-up that can only be activated on their turn. These could include swapping one of their symbols with an opponent's or rotating a section of the board. 2. **Advantages**: Introduces a strategic layer on when to use your power-up, potentially allowing a player to counter a strong position established by the opponent or recover from a disadvantageous position. # Variable Objectives 1. **Implementation**: Instead of having fixed win conditions, generate a set of 3 random objectives at the game's start that players can accomplish to win. These could rotate or change after a certain number of turns. 2. **Advantages**: With variable objectives, the strategy to win changes with each game, making the advantage of the first move less significant. Players must adapt their tactics based on the current objectives, ensuring a more dynamic and balanced game. # Conditional Moves 1. **Implementation**: Implement a rule where the first player's initial moves are restricted to certain areas of the board, or their moves must meet specific conditions (e.g., not allowing the first player to occupy center positions on their first turn). 2. **Advantages**: This directly balances the initial advantage by limiting the strategic options of the first player, encouraging a more careful choice of the starting position that doesn't overly tip the balance in their favor. Incorporating these mechanisms into a game seeks to equip players with the tools and challenges that require adapting strategies dynamically, pushing the game's skill ceiling higher and ensuring every match can offer a balanced, engaging, and unpredictable experience. Each option has its benefits and would need to be tailored to fit seamlessly within the game design to maintain simplicity and accessibility while enriching strategic depth."},{"prompt":"привет","completion":"Привет!

Also use pie rule, 5x5 grid, using Dynamic Board Mechanics","completion":"To design a tic-tac-toe variant that meets all these specifications, let’s introduce a game called “Quantum TacToe”. This game is designed to be played on a 5x5 grid, employs dynamic board mechanics, uses the pie rule to counter first-player advantage, and is designed to minimize draws, ensuring a balanced, strategic, and deep game experience. # Game Overview: Quantum TacToe Setup - The game is played on a 5x5 grid. - There are two players: one uses the X symbol, and the other uses the O symbol. Objective - The first player to align 4 of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins. # Rules 1. **Dynamic Board Mechanics:** - At the start of the game, the board is empty. - On each turn, a player may place their symbol (X or O) in any empty square. - **Quantum Shift**: After every 5 turns (once both players have played two times, and one player has played for the third time since the count), **one row or column randomly shifts**. The direction (left, right, up, down) is decided by a neutral mechanism that both players agree upon before the game starts (like a dice with directions instead of numbers, ensuring no luck in strategic decisions but dynamicity in gameplay). The symbols in the moved row/column adjust accordingly; if a symbol moves beyond the edge, it appears on the opposite end (similar to a toroidal array). - A square that becomes vacant due to the Quantum Shift becomes available for play again. 2. **Pie Rule (Balancer Rule):** After the first player makes the initial move, the second player can choose either to take that move for themselves (i.e., switch symbols and positions) or to continue by placing their symbol on the grid. This balances the first-move advantage. 3. **Winning Condition:** - A player wins by getting 4 of their symbols in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. - The game also introduces a secondary win condition called “Quantum Dominance”: If during any point in the game, after a Quantum Shift, a player has at least one of their symbols in every row and column, they win the game. This encourages spatial awareness and strategic placement beyond direct alignment. 4. **Avoiding Draws:** - In addition to Quantum Shifts and Quantum Dominance, if the board is filled and no winner is determined, the player with the greatest number of 3-symbol alignments (without being blocked) wins. - If still tied, then count the number of two-symbol alignments. - If still a tie, a \\"Quantum Shift\\" sudden death occurs, where the first player to complete a 4-alignment post-shift wins. # Strategy and Replayability Given the Quantum Shift mechanic and the Pie Rule, players must adapt their strategies constantly, ensuring high replayability and deep strategic depth. The dynamic board mechanics ensure that every game feels different, and strategic considerations need to be adjusted on the fly, adding depth and complexity to what initially appears as a simple extension of tic-tac-toe. # Accessibility Quantum TacToe is designed with simplicity in mind, using basic tic-tac-toe rules as a foundation but evolving the game to a level where strategic depth, balancing mechanics, and dynamic gameplay come into play. Anyone can learn the rules quickly, but mastering the game will require insight, adaptability, and strategic foresight."},{"prompt":"yeah i don't like the quantum shift rule","completion":"Understood, let’s revise that and take a different approach without the Quantum Shift, while still aiming to meet your criteria of avoiding draws, balancing the game, and ensuring it's easy to learn but difficult to master. We'll maintain the 5x5 board, pie rule, and introduce a new dynamic mechanic to enhance replayability and strategic depth. # Game Overview: Flux TacToe Setup - The game is played on a 5x5 grid. - Players choose their symbols, X or O. Objective - To win, a player must align 4 of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. # Revised Rules without Quantum Shift 1. **Dynamic Grid Mechanics:** - Each player has the ability to perform one \\"Grid Shift\\" per game. A Grid Shift allows a player to move any row or column one position in any direction (left, right, up, or down), with the moved symbol wrapping around (similar to the previous concept but controlled and limited to enhance strategic depth without randomness). - This ability can be countered by the opponent in their immediate next turn with their own \\"Grid Shift\\" if they haven't used it yet, negating the initial player's Grid Shift. 2. **Pie Rule (Balancer Rule):** After the first move by player 1, player 2 can choose to swap positions with player 1, taking over their symbol and initial move. This counters the first-move advantage. 3. **Winning Condition:** - A player wins by getting 4 of their symbols in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. - In the unlikely event of a board filling up, the game evaluates the player with the highest number of three-symbol alignments as the winner, then two-symbol alignments if there’s still a tie. 4. **No Draws through Dynamic Endgame:** - If the game reaches a state where the board is full and the above conditions cannot determine a winner, initiate an endgame scenario. In this scenario, each player takes turns removing one of their own symbols from the board, attempting to engineer a win with four in a line on their succeeding turn. This ensures strategic depth continues to the very end of the game. # Strategy and Replayability The introduction of a single, strategic \\"Grid Shift\\" per player introduces a significant layer of strategic depth. Players must not only consider their immediate moves but also anticipate the optimal timing and impact of both their own and their opponent's Grid Shift. The potential for the \\"Grid Shift\\" to be immediately countered introduces a layer of bluffing and double-think into the game. # Accessibility Flux TacToe builds on the familiar, making it easy for anyone to learn the basic rules quickly. Mastering the game, however, would require a deep understanding of strategic positioning, timing, and the ability to read one's opponent, ensuring a challenging experience for both new and experienced players alike. This variant retains the simplicity of tic-tac-toe's foundational mechanics while significantly deepening the strategic possibilities and reducing the likelihood of draws, ensuring a balanced and engaging game for players of all backgrounds."},{"prompt":"i don't want rows or columns moving around","completion":"Considering your preference against moving rows or columns, let's refine the game concept to introduce strategic depth and dynamic gameplay without altering the board's static nature. We'll maintain the emphasis on a balanced, engaging experience that minimizes draws and the first-player advantage on a 5x5 grid using the pie rule and introduce a new element to enhance gameplay. # Game Overview: Apex TacToe Setup - Played on a 5x5 grid. - Two players, one with the symbol X and the other with O. Objective - The first player to align 4 of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins. # Rules 1. **No Moving Rows/Columns:** The board remains static, without any rows or columns moving. 2. **Enhanced Game Mechanics:** - **Power Plays**: Each player has three \\"Power Plays\\" per game, allowing them to place a symbol in two squares simultaneously in one turn. These must be used wisely as they dramatically shift the potential for creating or blocking winning lines. - **Blockades**: Each player can place two \\"Blockades\\" on the board in the entire game. A Blockade is a neutral marker that neither player can remove or replace with their symbol. It is placed similarly to a player's symbol but only on an empty square and does not count towards the alignment of four for a win. It serves purely as a strategic obstacle. 3. **Pie Rule (Balancer Rule):** After the first move, the second player can choose to switch positions with their opponent, effectively taking the first move for themselves. This counters the first-move advantage and adds a layer of strategy before the game progresses too far. 4. **Winning Condition:** - A player wins by getting 4 of their symbols in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. - If the board fills up and no player has achieved a straight line of four, the winner is determined by who has the most sets of three in a line (blocked or unblocked). 5. **Tie Resolution:** - In the very uncommon situation that both players have an equal number of three-symbol alignments, the game is decided by a \\"Sudden Death\\" round. Players alternate turns placing their symbols on a smaller 3x3 grid, starting anew but carrying over their \\"Power Play\\" and \\"Blockade\\" allowances if unused. The first to align 3 in this mini-game wins. # Strategy The inclusion of \\"Power Plays\\" and \\"Blockades\\" introduces a considerable strategic layer, forcing players to think several moves ahead and consider when to use these special actions. Players must balance offensive positioning for wins and defensive placements to thwart their opponent's strategies. # Accessibility and Replayability The rules are simple, building on the recognizable base of tic-tac-toe, but the strategy deepens with the added elements, making it approachable yet challenging. Since the \\"Power Plays\\" and \\"Blockades\\" can be used in numerous strategic combinations, each game unfolds differently, ensuring high replayability. Apex TacToe retains the simple joy of tic-tac-toe while elevating it to a game of strategy and foresight, taking it beyond its origins into a new realm of tactical play that is approachable for all and mastered by the thoughtful."},{"prompt":"Create a logical tic tac toe variant that avoid draws, has balanced mechanics, easy to learn but difficult to master, there is a high replayability, no luck involved, no first player advantage and is only played on a 2d board and that anybody from any background to be able to play this. use pie rule","completion":"**Game Name**: **Quantum Tac Toe** # Overview Quantum Tac Toe is a variant of the classic Tic Tac Toe game designed to avoid draws, balance gameplay mechanics, and ensure high replayability with no luck involved. It uses the pie rule to counter the first-player advantage, making it fair and engaging. The game is set in a 2D space, easy to learn but challenging to master, making it accessible and enjoyable for players of various backgrounds. # Objective The objective remains the same as in traditional Tic Tac Toe: to align three of your markers (X or O) vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid. # Game Mechanics Quantum Moves Instead of a simple X or O, each player places a \\"quantum\\" marker, which can potentially be both X and O, on their turn. This marker is represented by placing two small markers, one of each symbol, in one grid space (each square can hold a pair of symbols). 1. **Placement Phase**: In the first phase of the game, players take turns placing their quantum markers on the board. This phase ends after each square contains a pair of symbols (X and O), making up the entire grid filled with quantum possibilities. 2. **Collapse Phase**: Starting with the player who didn't place the last quantum marker, players now take turns selecting any grid space and \\"collapsing\\" the quantum state—choosing whether it becomes an X or an O, based on what benefits them. This action immediately forces adjacent quantum markers (in all eight directions) to collapse into opposite states if they're in a direct line and contain the chosen symbol (creating a ripple effect based on the chosen collapse). Pie Rule (Balancer Mechanic) After the first player makes their first move in the Placement Phase, the second player has the option to \\"swap\\" sides—deciding if they wish to continue the game as X or O, thereby countering any first-move advantage. # Winning Condition The winner is the first player to align three of their confirmed symbols (after the Collapse Phase) vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. If all markers are collapsed and no player achieves this, the game is a draw, prompting a rematch. # No-Draw Modification To ensure a decisive outcome and avoid draws: - **Point system**: Each game won counts as a point, and games are played in a set of three or five to declare the overall winner. - **Special Move - Quantum Warp**: Once per game, in the Collapse Phase, a player can perform a \\"Quantum Warp.\\" This allows flipping the symbols within a chosen square (if it hasn't been collapsed yet) or swapping any two adjacent squares' states (if they're both collapsed). This move can only be done once and adds strategic depth, making the Collapse Phase even more unpredictable and skill-based. # Accessibility Quantum Tac Toe retains the simplicity of its ancestor, requiring just a 3x3 grid and two different types of markers (X and O), along with something to denote quantum markers (second set of smaller X and O markers or a different color). The rules are straightforward but introduce layers of strategy through the quantum mechanics and collapse dynamics, ensuring that the game is easy to pick up but offers depth for those looking to master it. # Replayability and Mastery The combination of quantum placements with the strategic collapse dynamics ensures that no two games are the same. The Pie Rule effectively neutralizes the first-mover advantage, fostering a balanced playfield. Players must think several moves ahead, considering not just immediate gains but potential setups for future collapses. Mastery involves not just understanding the current state of the board but predicting and influencing how it will evolve, making Quantum Tac Toe a continuously engaging and challenging experience."},{"prompt":"lua script that detect click on game object with no screen resolution dependents (defold engine)","completion":"To detect a click on a game object in the Defold engine without being dependent on screen resolution, you will often use the built-in input handling system to receive input actions and then calculate whether the action's position intersects with the game object's position. However, it's crucial to normalize or adjust these positions so they are not dependent on the screen resolution. Here is a basic example of how you could set up a Lua script in Defold to handle click detection on a game object: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Request input focus for the game object -- Assume the game object has a sprite with a size that we can use for simple hit detection local sprite_url = msg.url(\\"#sprite\\") -- URL to the sprite component local sprite_size = go.get(sprite_url, \\"size\\") -- Get the size of the sprite self.half_width = sprite_size.x / 2 self.half_height = sprite_size.y / 2 end function final(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") -- Release input focus when the object is deleted end function point_inside_rect(px, py, rx, ry, rw, rh) return px > rx and px < rx + rw and py > ry and py < ry + rh end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Convert screen coordinates to world coordinates local world_position = screen_to_world(action.x, action.y) -- Assume the game object's pivot is at its center local go_pos = go.get_position() local left = go_pos.x - self.half_width local right = go_pos.x + self.half_width local top = go_pos.y + self.half_height local bottom = go_pos.y - self.half_height if point_inside_rect(world_position.x, world_position.y, left, bottom, right - left, top - bottom) then -- Your game object was clicked! print(\\"Game object clicked!\\") end end end -- Example function to convert screen coordinates to world coordinates function screen_to_world(screen_x, screen_y) -- This example assumes a fixed projection setup.

It checks if the action is a touch (or click) and utilizes a function to determine if the point of action is within the bounds of the game object. - \`screen_to_world\` function is a simplistic approach to convert screen coordinates (dependent on resolution) to world coordinates, which are not directly dependent on the screen resolution. However, the real implementation of this function can vary significantly depending on your camera setup and how your game's coordinate system is configured. Adjust this function based on the specifics of your project. Ensure you adjust and extend this example according to your game's needs, such as dealing with dynamic object sizes, handling different input sources (like mouse vs touch), or adapting to complex camera systems which could affect the screen-to-world coordinate conversion."},{"prompt":"dont work","completion":"My apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's address click detection in Defold more effectively this time, considering some adjustments and focusing on a more general approach that does not depend on screen resolution directly for detecting clicks on game objects. Defold provides mechanisms to detect clicks or taps on objects, but handling resolution-independent input requires a bit of setup. You can use a collision object as a sensor to simplify interactions, making it somewhat independent of the actual screen resolution. Here's how you can approach it: 1. **Setup Your GameObject**: - Add a \`collision object\` component to your GameObject. - Set the \`Type\` to \`Kinematic\` and add a \`Shape\` that matches the size of your object (for simplicity, you can use a box shape). - Check the \`Is Trigger\` option to ensure it acts as a sensor. 2. **Configure A Mouse Trigger**: - Go to the \`game.input_binding\` file in your project. - Add a new \`Mouse Trigger\` with the action \`touch\` (or whatever name you prefer) and map it to \`Mouse Button 1\`. 3. **Scripting GameObject Click Detection**: You will handle the input within the script attached to your GameObject. The idea is to use the collision object you set up as a trigger. When the mouse clicks (or finger taps, in case of touch screens), you'll check for intersections with this collision object. Here's an example script assuming you've set up the GameObject and input bindings as described: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Acquire input focus to receive on_input callbacks end function final(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") -- Clean up end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Convert the screen coordinates to world coordinates local world_point = screen_to_world(action.x, action.y) -- Now test this point with a ray_cast or directly against the known positions/dimensions -- Here we assume you have the position and dimensions of your GameObject local result = physics.raycast(world_point, world_point, {hash(\\"default\\")}) if result then for _, hit in ipairs(result) do if hit.id == go.get_id() then -- Check the ID to see if it's your object print(\\"GameObject clicked!\\") -- React to the click, e.g., show some UI, change the scene, etc. end end end end end -- Helper function to convert screen coordinates to world coordinates function screen_to_world(x, y) local screen_width = render.get_width() local screen_height = render.get_height() local cam = camera.get_view_projection() local ndc = vmath.vector3((x / screen_width) * 2 - 1, (y / screen_height) * 2 - 1, 0) local world_point = vmath.inv(cam) * ndc return world_point end \`\`\` **Note:** This example includes a \`screen_to_world\` function assuming you have a camera setup (via a camera script or an external library). You might need to replace this conversion logic with one that matches your project setup. The conversion from screen space (pixels) to world space (game units) depends significantly on your camera's configuration, view, and projection matrices. Remember that the provided \`screen_to_world\` function is a simplified example and may require adjustments to work with your specific camera setup in Defold. For a more detailed and personalized solution, consider reviewing how your camera system is defined and adjust the conversion logic accordingly."},{"prompt":"\\"for _, hit in ipairs(result) do\\" it is line is okay?","completion":"You're right to question that part of the code. My apologies for the confusion. In the context of the \`physics.raycast\` function in Defold, the result is not an array of hits but rather a table describing a single hit (if a hit occurs) or \`nil\` (if there's no hit). So, iterating with \`ipairs\` is incorrect in this context. Thank you for catching that mistake. Let's correct and simplify the approach based on a more appropriate handling of the \`raycast\` result in Defold. Here's how you should handle a raycast result according to Defold's documentation: \`\`\`lua function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Convert the screen coordinates to world coordinates local world_point = screen_to_world(action.x, action.y) -- Perform the ray cast from slightly above the point to the point itself to ensure we catch objects at the point local from = vmath.vector3(world_point.x, world_point.y, 1) local to = vmath.vector3(world_point.x, world_point.y, -1) local result = physics.raycast(from, to, {hash(\\"default\\")}) -- Assuming 'default' is your collision group if result then if result.id == go.get_id() then -- Checking if the hit object is this game object print(\\"GameObject clicked!\\") -- React to the click accordingly end end end end \`\`\` The correction here involves directly checking the result of the \`raycast\` instead of iterating over it, which matches how Defold returns \`raycast\` results. Make sure that the collision groups and masks are correctly set up in both your game objects and in the physics properties in the project settings so that your raycasts will only detect the objects you're interested in. Regarding the conversion from screen coordinates to world coordinates (\`screen_to_world\` function), remember that this highly depends on your camera's setup. The pseudo-function provided before was simplified for illustrative purposes. In Defold, handling camera transformations, especially in 3D or when using an orthographic camera module for 2D games, requires specific calculations based on your camera's properties and configurations. This approach aims to be more resolution-independent by working within the game's world coordinates. However, make sure to adapt the logic to how your game and camera system are configured, as this greatly affects how input coordinates should be translated to in-game actions."},{"prompt":"lua script that detect click on game object with no screen resolution dependents physics base (defold engine)","completion":"To detect clicks on a game object in the Defold engine without being dependent on screen resolution or using physics-based detection, you can use the engine's action system combined with a manual calculation to determine if a click occurred within the bounds of the game object. This method typically involves transforming the click position from screen coordinates to the game world coordinates and then checking if that position falls within the known bounds of the target game object. For simplicity, let's assume the game object is a sprite with a rectangular shape. This example will not cover rotated sprites or more complex shapes, but the principles can be extended to those with more complex collision detection math. You will have to handle input in a script attached to a game object that either represents the clickable item or a controller object that manages input for multiple items. Here's a basic example of how you might implement such a system: \`\`\`lua -- Define a table to represent the clickable object. It would include its position, and dimensions. local clickableObject = { position = vmath.vector3(100, 100, 0), -- Assuming a starting position. You would update this as the object moves. width = 64, -- Width of the sprite/object height = 64 -- Height of the sprite/object } function init(self) -- Register this game object to receive input msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") end function final(self) -- Unregister this game object to no longer receive input msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Transform the screen touch/mouse position to world position local screen_to_world = action.screen_pos screen_to_world = screen_to_world * vmath.vector3(1, 1, 0) -- Assuming a simple 2D game for z=0 screen_to_world = screen_to_world - vmath.vector3(go.get_position()) -- Adjust for the game object's current position if needed -- Check if the touch is within the bounds of the clickableObject if screen_to_world.x >= clickableObject.position.x - (clickableObject.width / 2) and screen_to_world.x <= clickableObject.position.x + (clickableObject.width / 2) and screen_to_world.y >= clickableObject.position.y - (clickableObject.height / 2) and screen_to_world.y <= clickableObject.position.y + (clickableObject.height / 2) then -- The touch is within the object, perform the desired action print(\\"Object was clicked!\\") end end end \`\`\` Note: The above script makes several assumptions for simplicity. Realistically, you'll need to calculate \`screen_to_world\` based on your camera's position and the specifics of your game's coordinate system, which might involve more complex transformations if your game has a different scale or if you're using a camera with altered properties. Defold's documentation and community forums are great resources for specifics on how to adjust this to your particular game setup. Also, remember to change \`\\"touch\\"\` to the specific input action you have defined in your game's input bindings."},{"prompt":"does solr has any known issue for cursormark with score field?","completion":"As of my last knowledge update in April 2023, there were no broadly acknowledged, version-specific bugs in Apache Solr directly associated with using \`cursorMark\` alongside the \`score\` field. However, there are a few intricacies and considerations to keep in mind when using \`cursorMark\` for pagination, especially when sorting results by score or using the score in conjunction with other fields. 1. **CursorMark and Score**: The main use case of \`cursorMark\` in Solr is to provide consistent and stateless pagination through a large set of search results. \`cursorMark\` requires the use of a unique key (usually the unique ID in your schema) to ensure a consistent order of results across pagination requests. When you attempt to sort by score (relevance), which is a common use case, the challenge arises in ensuring determinism in pagination. Scoring can lead to ties (i.e., different documents receiving the same score), and in such cases, having a secondary sort on a unique field is crucial. This is not inherently an issue but a requirement for effective usage. 2. **Implementation Specifics**: When implementing pagination with sorting by score and using \`cursorMark\`, you must also include a tiebreaker (usually a unique ID) in your sort criteria. This ensures that pagination is consistent and deterministic. This isn't a bug but a necessary implementation detail. 3. **Dynamic Scoring**: Another aspect to consider is that scoring can be dynamic based on the query (full-text search scores can vary widely with different queries). This should be taken into account when using scoring in conjunction with cursor-based pagination. The results are expected to change with different queries, and this can affect pagination if you're not consistently applying the same query parameters across requests. 4. **Version-Specific Behaviors**: While there were no widely recognized bugs as of my last update, software is continually evolving, and new versions may introduce changes that affect how certain features work. It's always a good idea to check the specific version of Solr you are using for any known issues or to consult the Solr mailing list or issue tracker. 5. **Complex Queries**: Finally, complex queries and setups (such as using function queries in sort clauses) can sometimes behave unexpectedly, although these are not necessarily bugs but rather intricate interaction effects. Proper testing and adjustment are required in these scenarios. In summary, while there are no widely recognized \\"bugs\\" with using \`cursorMark\` with the score field in Apache Solr, there are important considerations and best practices to ensure that pagination works as expected. Always ensure you're using a tiebreaker in your sort when relying on scores, and stay informed about any updates or changes in the Solr version you are using."},{"prompt":"در سوپر شارژ و یا توربوشارژ چگونه maximum mass flow rate ورودی به موتور افزایش می یابد؟","completion":"در سوپر شارژ یا توربوشارژ، هوا به موتور با فشار بیشتر و سرعت بالاتر وارد می‌شود که این امر باعث افزایش مقدار هوای ورودی و بنابراین افزایش maximum mass flow rate ورودی به موتور می‌شود. به عبارت دیگر، از طریق افزایش فشار و سرعت هوای ورودی به موتور به وسیله توربوشارژ یا سوپرشارژ، مقدار هوایی که به موتور تزریق می‌شود افزایش می‌یابد که این امر باعث افزایش توان و کارایی موتور می‌شود."},{"prompt":"how in super charge or turbo charge the maximum mass flow rate of entry of engine increase?? answer by the formulation of compressible mass flow in a nussle.","completion":"The mass flow rate of a compressible fluid through a nozzle can be calculated using the following formula: [ dot{m} = rho cdot A cdot V ] Where: (dot{m}) = mass flow rate (kg/s) (rho) = density of the fluid (kg/m^3) (A) = cross-sectional area of the nozzle (m^2) (V) = velocity of the fluid (m/s) In the case of a supercharger or turbocharger, the density of the air entering the engine is increased due to the increase in pressure and temperature caused by the compressor.

C3bBb является C3 конвертазой альтернативного пути. 3. **Амплификация**: C3 конвертаза разрушает дополнительные молекулы C3 на C3a и C3b, что приводит к ещё большему высвобождению C3b и амплификации ответа. 4. **Формирование C5 конвертазы**: Связывание дополнительных молекул C3b с C3bBb приводит к формированию C3bBb3b, который функционирует как C5 конвертаза. Этот комплекс расщепляет C5 на C5a и C5b. 5. **Инициация мембраноатакующего комплекса (MAC)**: C5b, образующийся в результате действия C5 конвертазы, объединяется с компонентами C6, C7, C8 и несколькими молекулами C9, образуя мембраноатакующий комплекс (MAC). MAC внедряется в клеточную мембрану патогенов, формируя поры, которые приводят к лизису и гибели клетки. 6. **Высвобождение воспалительных медиаторов**: В ходе активации альтернативного пути высвобождаются медиаторы C3a и C5a, которые имеют мощное воспалительное действие, привлекая фагоциты к месту инфекции и стимулируя их активацию для уничтожения патогенов. Альтернативный путь активации системы комплемента играет ключевую роль в местном ограничении инфекции и воспалении, а также способствует очищению от патогенов и поврежденных клеток."},{"prompt":"sqlalchemy зарос фильтрации по парамтру","completion":"Для создания запроса фильтрации по параметру с помощью SQLAlchemy вам нужно использовать метод \`filter\` объекта \`session\` или \`query\`.

In a supercharged engine, the intake air is compressed before entering the combustion chamber, which increases the density of the air and allows more air to be taken into the engine per cycle. This increased air density results in a higher mass flow rate into the engine. Similarly, in a turbocharged engine, a turbocharger forces air into the engine at a higher pressure and temperature, increasing the mass flow rate of air into the engine. The mass flow rate of a compressible fluid through a nozzle can be calculated using the equation: [ dot{m} = rho A V ] where: (dot{m}) = mass flow rate, (rho) = density of the fluid, (A) = cross-sectional area of the nozzle, and (V) = velocity of the fluid. The density of a compressible fluid can be calculated using the ideal gas equation: [ rho = frac{P}{RT} ] where: (P) = pressure, (R) = specific gas constant, and (T) = temperature. By increasing the stagnation pressure and temperature of the intake air through supercharging or turbocharging, the density of the air entering the engine will increase.

The E/I content rating is designed to identify shows that offer significant educational value to children, and it seems you perceive *GoGoRiki* and *Ozzy & Drix* as more effectively meeting these criteria. Let's delve into why these shows might be seen as superior in terms of E/I content: # GoGoRiki (GGR) *GoGoRiki* is a Russian animated television series known in its native country as *Kikoriki*. It has a unique style, focusing on simple, round characters that tackle various adventures and challenges. The show is known for embedding valuable life lessons within each episode, including themes such as friendship, teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving. These elements make it an excellent E/I choice, as it not only entertains children but also teaches them important social and emotional skills in an engaging way. # Ozzy & Drix (O&D) *Ozzy & Drix*, spun off from the film *Osmosis Jones*, is a show that takes place inside the human body. It follows a white blood cell (Ozzy) and a cold pill (Drix) as they protect the body of their teenage host from viruses, bacteria, and other health threats. The show cleverly combines action and humor with educational content about the human body, health, and hygiene. It effectively engages children's interest in science and biology, making complex subjects accessible and entertaining. This unique approach to teaching about health and the body's functions makes it a strong candidate for E/I programming. # Comparing to Will & Dewitt and Magi-Nation *Will & Dewitt* and *Magi-Nation* have their educational components, focusing on social lessons and creative problem-solving, respectively. However, the nature of the educational content in *GoGoRiki* and *Ozzy & Drix* might be seen as more direct and applicable to daily life or school subjects. *Will & Dewitt* is centered around a boy and his anthropomorphic frog friend overcoming challenges, leaning heavily on social and emotional learning. *Magi-Nation*, meanwhile, dives into a fantasy world where lessons are more about strategy, courage, and friendship within a narrative that may not relate as directly to the viewers' real-world knowledge and experiences as science or health-related topics do. In summary, *GoGoRiki* and *Ozzy & Drix* provide educational content that mixes life lessons, science, and health information with entertainment, potentially offering a more substantial E/I impact than *Will & Dewitt* and *Magi-Nation*.

This can result in increased power output and efficiency of the engine, making it more powerful and fuel-efficient."},{"prompt":"but if the temperature increase by that equation the mass flow rate decrease. how to answer this?","completion":"You are correct, and I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. In the compressible mass flow equation, an increase in temperature actually leads to a decrease in mass flow rate. This is because as the temperature of the gas increases, the density decreases, leading to a lower mass flow rate. To increase the maximum mass flow rate of entry into the engine for a turbocharged or supercharged engine, you would typically adjust the pressure ratio across the compressor. By increasing the pressure ratio, you can increase the mass flow rate entering the engine. This can be achieved by adjusting the design and size of the compressor, as well as utilizing technologies such as intercooling to lower the temperature of the air after compression, which can help increase the density and hence the mass flow rate. Furthermore, increasing the efficiency of the compressor can also help increase the mass flow rate. This can be done by improving the design of the compressor blades, reducing losses within the compressor, and optimizing the overall compressor performance. In summary, to increase the maximum mass flow rate of entry into the engine, focus on optimizing the pressure ratio across the compressor, improving compressor efficiency, and considering technologies such as intercooling to enhance the density of the air entering the engine."},{"prompt":"defold lua script that allow click on game object with trigger (with no resolution dependents)","completion":"Creating a Defold game project where you can click on a game object involving a trigger without depending on screen resolution can be achieved by carefully managing the interactions and scaling factors. Below is a basic example of how to accomplish this. The code will register mouse or touch input and convey it accurately to the intended game object by considering its position and the scaling factors due to different resolutions. # Prerequisites - Ensure you are familiar with Defold's basic concepts like game objects, scripts, and collections. - This example assumes you have a game object (\`clickable_object\`) that you want to make clickable. The object should have a collision object component (\`collisionobject\`) with a trigger enabled. The trigger should be sized and shaped to cover the area you intend to be clickable. # Step 1: The Script Create a Lua script (\`clickable_object.script\`) and attach it to your game object. This script will handle the input and determine if the clickable game object was indeed clicked or touched. \`\`\`lua local function point_inside_rect(px, py, x, y, w, h) return px >= x and px <= x + w and py >= y and py <= y + h end function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Make sure to acquire input for the object self.scale = 1 -- adjust based on your current scale, if your game dynamically adjusts scale, you'll need to update this accordingly self.width = go.get(\\"#collisionobject\\", \\"size.x\\") * self.scale self.height = go.get(\\"#collisionobject\\", \\"size.y\\") * self.scale self.position = go.get_position() -- Adjust for the pivot/anchor if necessary, here assumed to be centered self.position.x = self.position.x - self.width / 2 self.position.y = self.position.y - self.height / 2 end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == nil then return false end if action.pressed then -- this adjusts the clicked position based on potential screen scaling local x, y = action.x / action.screen_x * self.width, action.y / action.screen_y * self.height if point_inside_rect(x, y, self.position.x, self.position.y, self.width, self.height) then print(\\"Clicked inside!\\") -- Here you can add your functionality for what happens when the object is clicked end end return true -- to ensure the touch/click does not pass through end \`\`\` # Adjustments for Screen Resolution and Scaling The above script assumes that your game maintains its aspect ratio and scales uniformly. If your game handles different resolutions or aspect ratios in a manner that affects the game object's size relative to the screen, you may need to dynamically calculate the \`self.scale\` value based on the resolution. Use the \`window\` or \`render\` script to get the current window size and calculate the scale factor based on your game's base resolution. # Registering the Object to Handle Input The game object with this script should have 'Input' enabled in its game object properties so it can receive input directly. Remember that Defold's input system allows for inputs to be captured either by the game object directly or via an input manager script that dispatches inputs to various objects. Ensure that your game's architecture is planned to handle inputs in the manner most suitable for your overall design. This basic example serves as a starting point. Adapt and expand based on your specific game requirements and the behaviors you wish to implement."},{"prompt":"\\"collisionobject' does not have any property called 'size.x'\\" error","completion":"You're right; my mistake in the initial explanation. In Defold, a collision object component itself doesn't have properties like \`size.x\` or \`size.y\` directly accessible through \`go.get()\`. The size of the collision object's shape is defined within the properties of the shapes (like rectangles, circles, capsules, etc.) it contains. To correct this oversight and work around this limitation, you usually need to manually define or calculate the size of the clickable area in your script since you can't directly fetch the size of a shape in a collision object through script. Here's an updated approach that doesn't rely on nonexistent properties but requires you to manually set the clickable area's size: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Manually define the size of your clickable area -- This should match the size you've set in the collision object (shape) attached to the game object self.clickableWidth = 100 -- Adjust based on your actual size self.clickableHeight = 100 -- Adjust based on your actual size -- Adjust based on your game's scaling, if dynamic scaling is used, update accordingly self.scale = 1 -- Fetch the position assuming the pivot/anchor is at the center self.position = go.get_position() self.scaledWidth = self.clickableWidth * self.scale self.scaledHeight = self.clickableHeight * self.scale end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == nil then return false end if action.pressed then -- Normalize touch/click position to game world scale -- Assuming a non-scaled or uni-scaling environment local wx, wy = screen_to_world(action.x, action.y) -- Check if within bounds considering the game object's position is its center if wx > self.position.x - self.scaledWidth / 2 and wx < self.position.x + self.scaledWidth / 2 and wy > self.position.y - self.scaledHeight / 2 and wy < self.position.y + self.scaledHeight / 2 then print(\\"Clicked inside the clickable area!\\") -- Implement your click logic here end end return true -- Prevent pass-through of click/touch end -- Utility function to transform screen coordinates to world coordinates function screen_to_world(x, y) -- Example conversion assuming no camera adjustments; adapt as necessary local screen_width = go.get(\\"#\\", \\"screen_width\\") -- Define or calculate your screen_width local screen_height = go.get(\\"#\\", \\"screen_height\\") -- Define or calculate your screen_height local wx = (x / screen_width) * 2 - 1 local wy = (y / screen_height) * 2 - 1 return wx, wy end \`\`\` # Notes: - You need to manually set \`self.clickableWidth\` and \`self.clickableHeight\` to match the size of the collision shape in your game object. - The screen-to-world coordinates transformation in the \`screen_to_world\` function is very simplistic. Depending on how you've set up your camera and rendering, you might need a different approach to accurately convert screen touch/click positions to world positions. This conversion is crucial for accurately determining if a click/touch occurred within the clickable object's boundaries. - Since Defold's coordinate system origin is at the center of the screen, adjust the screen-to-world conversion (\`screen_to_world\` function) if your game uses a different convention. This updated snippet addresses the previous oversight and provides a direction for handling clicks within a specified area of a game object, considering different screen resolutions and aspect ratios with manual calculations."},{"prompt":"thx, pls delete all comments","completion":"I'm here to provide information and assist with your queries, but I don't have the capability to delete comments or perform actions outside the scope of providing text-based responses.

You will need to adapt this to your game's specific settings and requirements."},{"prompt":"does not have any property called 'screen_width'","completion":"I apologize for the oversight in the example code provided. The approach to convert screen-space coordinates to world-space coordinates was overly simplistic and incorrectly referenced non-existent properties for \`screen_width\` and \`screen_height\`. In Defold, the correct way to handle coordinate conversion heavily depends on your camera setup. If you're using a camera library or your own camera system, you'll typically use those functions to convert between coordinate spaces. In many cases, Defold projects use a camera library, like the one available in Defold's asset portal, which can handle such conversions. Without relying on specific asset libraries, here is a more generic approach that avoids using incorrect properties: Adjusting for camera transformations manually can be complex, but for a basic setup where you simply want to detect clicks or touches on a 2D object that doesn't move with the camera, you might only need to adjust based on the view and projection matrices directly if at all. In games where objects and camera don't change scale and position much, you can often ignore these complexities. However, for handling screen to world conversion properly or considering different resolutions and camera setups, you must consider the actual camera properties. Let's correct the approach without assuming specific properties like \`screen_width\` and \`screen_height\`, focusing on input handling within the game object's area: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Assume the clickable area size matches the object's sprite or collision object size self.clickableWidth = 100 -- Update this to your object's size self.clickableHeight = 100 -- Update this to your object's size end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id ~= nil and action.pressed then -- Assuming the action coordinates are already in the game world space -- Check if the action is within the object's area local position = go.get_position() local halfWidth = self.clickableWidth / 2 local halfHeight = self.clickableHeight / 2 if action.x > position.x - halfWidth and action.x < position.x + halfWidth and action.y > position.y - halfHeight and action.y < position.y + halfHeight then print(\\"Clicked inside the clickable area!\\") end end end \`\`\` In this corrected version, I removed references to non-existent properties and avoided complex camera transformations. Keep in mind, this example simply checks if the input is within a manually defined area around the game object and assumes a very straightforward setup. For more complex scenarios, especially those involving different camera views, zoom levels, or coordinate systems, you'd need to utilize or adjust for your camera's transformations, potentially using a camera library that can provide screen-to-world conversion functions. Remember, in Defold, accurately handling input across different resolutions and coordinate systems may require more context about how your game and camera are set up. If you're using a specific camera script or library, it's likely to have functions designed for these conversions that you should use instead."},{"prompt":"only code","completion":"\`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") self.clickableWidth = 100 self.clickableHeight = 100 end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id ~= nil and action.pressed then local position = go.get_position() local halfWidth = self.clickableWidth / 2 local halfHeight = self.clickableHeight / 2 if action.x > position.x - halfWidth and action.x < position.x + halfWidth and action.y > position.y - halfHeight and action.y < position.y + halfHeight then print(\\"Clicked inside the clickable area!\\") end end end \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"this code is has resolution dependents","completion":"For a resolution-independent implementation that correctly translates input coordinates into game world coordinates before performing the hit test, you'll typically need to account for the view and projection matrices or use a camera system that automatically handles this for you. However, Defold does not directly expose screen-to-world conversion functions in its core API, and a fully dynamic solution often relies on additional context about how your game's camera is set up. Assuming a straightforward case where your game uses an orthographic camera centered on the scene without zooming or panning (which many simple 2D games might do), here's a rudimentary approach you can use as a starting point. This approach manually adjusts for resolution differences by considering the game window's size versus the expected game world units. First, ensure you have a basic understanding of the resolution you're designing for. Let's say your game is designed with a \\"logical resolution\\" in mind, for instance, 1280x720. You might scale input positions based on the current window size compared to this logical resolution: \`\`\`lua local logical_width = 1280 local logical_height = 720 function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") self.clickableWidth = 100 -- Set to your object's size self.clickableHeight = 100 -- Set to your object's size end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id and action.pressed then -- Get the current window size local current_width, current_height = window.get_size() -- Calculate scaling factors based on current vs logical resolution local scale_x = current_width / logical_width local scale_y = current_height / logical_height -- Scale action.x and action.y to \\"game world\\" coordinates -- This assumes your game world coordinates match the logical resolution local world_x = action.x / scale_x local world_y = action.y / scale_y -- Now proceed with hit test as before, using these scaled coordinates local position = go.get_position() local halfWidth = self.clickableWidth / 2 local halfHeight = self.clickableHeight / 2 if world_x > position.x - halfWidth and world_x < position.x + halfWidth and world_y > position.y - halfHeight and world_y < position.y + halfHeight then print(\\"Clicked inside the clickable area!\\") end end end \`\`\` This code snippet manually scales the input based on the current resolution compared to a \\"logical\\" or \\"designed-for\\" resolution. This method is somewhat primitive and assumes that your game's visual layout scales linearly with window size changes, maintaining the same aspect ratio (i.e., visuals are simply stretched or shrunk to fit). Keep in mind: - This approach doesn't directly handle aspect ratio changes (e.g., if your game allows non-uniform scaling or letterboxing). - For more complex camera behaviors (like zooming or panning), a more sophisticated method involving the camera's transformation matrix would be necessary. - If you are using a custom camera solution or a third-party camera library, it's likely to offer functions to help convert screen space coordinates into world space coordinates based on the camera's current configuration."},{"prompt":"only code","completion":"\`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") self.clickableWidth = 100 self.clickableHeight = 100 self.logical_width = 1280 self.logical_height = 720 end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id and action.pressed then local current_width, current_height = window.get_size() local scale_x = current_width / self.logical_width local scale_y = current_height / self.logical_height local world_x = action.x / scale_x local world_y = action.y / scale_y local position = go.get_position() local halfWidth = self.clickableWidth / 2 local halfHeight = self.clickableHeight / 2 if world_x > position.x - halfWidth and world_x < position.x + halfWidth and world_y > position.y - halfHeight and world_y < position.y + halfHeight then print(\\"Clicked inside the clickable area!\\") end end end \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"this code is has runtime resolution dependents","completion":"If you're looking for a way to handle click detection on game objects in Defold without relying on runtime resolution adjustments, but instead focus on handling inputs directly and independently of resolution changes, it's important to rely on Defold's built-in message passing system for collision detection. This way, you can leverage collision objects tied to the game objects for click or touch detection, which inherently does not depend on resolution. However, it's worth noting that handling clicks or touches directly via script, as attempted in previous examples, inherently involves dealing with screen coordinates, which vary by resolution. A more resolution-independent approach leverages the physics system to detect interactions with game objects through collision objects. First, ensure your clickable game object has a collision object component set up appropriately: - Set the collision object's type to \\"Trigger\\" if it doesn't need to participate in the physics simulation apart from detecting inputs. - Assign a shape to the collision object that matches the clickable area. - Make sure the collision object's group and mask are properly set up so it can interact with a cursor or touch input represented as a raycast or another collision object in the game. Then, use message passing within the game object script to react to interactions: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Ensure the game object can receive input end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Example action_id for touch/click -- Perform a ray cast or use the action.x, action.y to convert to world space if needed -- For simplicity, this step is left out, assuming touch inputs are handled elsewhere or not required for this specific setup end end function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender) if message_id == hash(\\"trigger_response\\") then -- A trigger_response message is sent when another object enters the trigger -- Here you can check for specific conditions, such as a specific sender or message group print(\\"Object clicked or touched!\\") -- Perform your click reaction logic here end end \`\`\` In this setup, \`trigger_response\` messages are automatically sent to the script when another object (which could represent the player's cursor or a touch input transformed into a detectable object) interacts with the game object's collision object. This method abstracts away the direct handling of screen coordinates and thus sidesteps issues related to runtime resolution changes. Remember, for this to work: - Your input (mouse cursor, touch location) must be represented in a way that interacts with the physics system, which might involve moving a collision object to follow the cursor or transforming touch coordinates into game world coordinates and performing a physics raycast. - Ensure the collision layer and masks are set up so that the clickable object's collision object and the cursor/touch representation can interact.

My ideas are to use pie rule, turning each cell in the 3x3 into a 3x3(Tic-Tac-Ku)","completion":"Building upon your ideas and the requirements for a balanced, strategic, and draw-less Tic Tac Toe variant, I propose a game called **StrataTic**. **StrataTic** incorporates the 3x3-in-a-3x3 concept (akin to Tic-Tac-Ku), includes the pie rule for fairness, and introduces additional mechanics to expand strategic depth and ensure there's always a clear winner. Here's the breakdown: # Board and Initial Setup - **StrataTic** is played on a 3x3 grid, where each cell is itself a smaller 3x3 grid, resulting in a total of 81 cells. - The board starts empty, with no marks. # Objective - The main goal is to win 3 small grids in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, to claim the larger cell. # Players - Two players, one marks with X and the other with O. # Gameplay Mechanics 1. **Pie Rule for Balance**: After the first player makes their first mark anywhere on the board, the second player can choose to swap sides, effectively taking the first move and giving the second player the chance to be X or O. This balances the first-move advantage. 2. **Linking Moves**: To expand the tactical depth and address the 'optimal play', each move within a small grid dictates where the next move of your opponent must be. For instance, if player 1 marks a cell in the top-right corner of a small grid, player 2 must play their next move in the top-right small grid. This mechanic forces players to think ahead and strategize both defensively and offensively. 3. **Liberties**: If sent to a grid that is already won or completely filled, the player may choose to play in any other grid. This rule ensures that the game remains dynamic and players have strategic flexibility. 4. **Grid Lock**: To combat the draw issue and incentivize aggressive play, if all nine cells within a small grid result in a tie, the player who completed the last move in that grid gets to claim one of the cells at random (through mutual agreement or a predefined pattern) as their winning cell, but this can only be used to claim the entire grid if it directly leads to a win. This rule encourages players to focus on offense within each grid. 5. **End Game Conditions**: The game ends when a player wins three small grids in a straight line. There are no draws; if the entire board fills up before someone scores according to these conditions, a point system comes into play: each small grid win counts as 1 point, and the player with the most points wins. # Strategies - Players need to focus on both immediate moves and future positioning, balancing offense in one small grid while not leaving themselves vulnerable in the grid they are sending their opponent to. - Placement becomes a key tactic, with players trying to maintain flexibility while limiting their opponent's options. # Accessibility and Replayability - **StrataTic** is simple to learn but offers a significant depth of strategy due to the linking moves and grid lock mechanics. - No game is the same; the vast number of possible board states combined with strategic complexity ensures high replayability. - Accessible to all, requiring only a pen and paper or a simple digital implementation. # Conclusion By adding layers of strategy through linking moves, tactical positioning, and a nuanced pie rule, **StrataTic** addresses the main limitations of traditional Tic Tac Toe. It remains easy to grasp while adding layers of depth that are difficult to master, ensuring a balanced play experience with a definitive end to each game."},{"prompt":"Create a logical tic tac toe variant that avoid draws, has balanced mechanics, easy to learn but difficult to master, there is a high replayability, no luck involved, no first player advantage and is only played on a 2d board and that anybody from any background to be able to play this and fixes the issue the board is too small and that the optimal play is always apparent.","completion":"Creating a variant of Tic Tac Toe that addresses all the stated requirements requires a careful redesign of the game's core mechanics and objectives while preserving its simplicity and accessibility.

Game Mechanics: - **Quantum Placement**: Each player has two moves per turn. The first move places a \\"quantum marker\\" (a marker that signifies a potential play), and the second move solidifies one of their quantum markers placed in a previous turn into a permanent marker. This two-step process introduces a planning and prediction element, making the optimal play less apparent and more strategic. - **Entanglement**: When a quantum marker is solidified, any quantum markers in the same row, column, or diagonal become \\"entangled.\\" This means if one of these entangled markers is later solidified, all entangled markers must be solidified in the same turn if possible. This rule adds a layer of depth and foresight, requiring players to think multiple moves ahead. Balancing and Fairness: - **Dual-Action Mechanic**: To ensure no first-player advantage, the game employs a dual-action mechanic. After the first player's initial turn, players alternate making two moves at a time (one quantum marker placement and one solidification of any quantum marker). This structure aims to balance the advantage of making the first move by giving the second player more information and strategic flexibility on their turn. - **Rotation**: After every two full rounds (each player has made two moves), the board rotates 90 degrees. This rotation mechanic disrupts straightforward winning strategies and ensures that spatial control and adaptability are key, mitigating first-player advantage by redistributing positional power. Victory Conditions: - To win, a player must align 4 of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal. This is an increase from the traditional 3, considering the larger board size, and necessitates more complex strategies for victory. Replayability and Mastery: - The introduction of quantum mechanics, entanglement, and rotation ensures that each game unfolds in a unique way, demanding adaptive strategies and deep tactical planning. These elements, coupled with the larger board and varied win conditions, ensure high replayability and a steep mastery curve where players can continuously discover new patterns and strategies. Accessibility: - QTTTE maintains simple rules and objectives reminiscent of classic Tic Tac Toe, ensuring that it remains easy to learn. The game is human-centric, requiring no special equipment besides a larger grid and two types of markers, making it accessible to a wide audience. This variant is designed to address the limitations of traditional Tic Tac Toe by introducing a set of mechanics that enhance the game's depth and strategic complexity, eliminating the inevitability of draws, and ensuring a balanced and fair competition that remains accessible yet challenging to master."},{"prompt":"\\"e até hoje você nunca tinha ouvido falar sobre mim?\\" Translate it into spanish please, and explain","completion":"The translation of \\"e até hoje você nunca tinha ouvido falar sobre mim?\\" into Spanish is: \\"¿y hasta hoy nunca habías oído hablar de mí?\\" Explanation: - \\"e até hoje você\\" is translated as \\"¿y hasta hoy tú\\" which means \\"and until today you.\\" However, in Spanish, the subject pronoun \\"tú\\" can be omitted because the verb form (\\"habías\\") already indicates the subject.

What could it be?\\"","completion":"Based on the findings you've described from the ultrasonography, the presence of multiple anechoic spaces with significant color flow inside these spaces and multiple calcific foci with shadows in the intramuscular plane of the cheek of a child suggests a vascular malformation with phleboliths (calcifications within a venous malformation). Given the longevity of the swelling, being present since childhood, and the characteristics of being soft and asymptomatic apart from its size, this is quite consistent with a diagnosis of a venous malformation. Vascular malformations are congenital lesions that are present at birth but may not become apparent until later in life. They are not tumors, but rather, errors in vascular development. These malformations are classified based on the type of vessels involved (e.g., capillary, lymphatic, arterial, venous, or a combination thereof). In the case you've described, the findings are more suggestive of a venous malformation, especially with the characteristics of being soft, easily compressible, and the presence of phleboliths (calcifications indicative of slow blood flow within the malformation). Venous malformations are comprised of dysplastic, ectatic venous channels that can fill with blood, leading to their soft and compressible nature. The presence of color flow on Doppler ultrasound reflects the blood flowing through these channels. Phleboliths appear as echogenic foci with posterior acoustic shadowing and are hallmark features of venous malformations on imaging studies. The management of venous malformations primarily focuses on symptom control and prevention of complications. In cases where the malformation causes functional impairment, esthetic concerns, or pain, interventions may include sclerotherapy, laser therapy, or surgery. However, the approach is highly individualized considering the malformation's size, location, and the patient's symptoms. Given the nature of ultrasonography findings and the patient's history, it would be beneficial to consult with a multidisciplinary team, possibly including pediatric radiologists, interventional radiologists, and pediatric surgeons or dermatologists with experience in vascular anomalies. Further imaging, possibly with MRI, could help delineate the extent of the malformation and assist in planning any necessary intervention. It's essential to provide the family and the patient with detailed information about the condition, the course it may take, and the treatment options available to them, ensuring a comprehensive approach to managing this congenital vascular anomaly."},{"prompt":"Cápsulas Hoi-Poi Las cápsulas son aproximadamente del tamaño de una batería estándar, en uno de sus extremos tienen un botón.

Dime cómo funciona la cápsula tanto al introducir algo en ellas como el momento de sacarlo.","completion":"Las cápsulas Hoi-Poi, conocidas también simplemente como cápsulas, son un elemento ficticio del universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", creado por Akira Toriyama. A pesar de ser un concepto proveniente de la ciencia ficción y no existir tecnologías reales equivalentes al momento de mi conocimiento en 2023, podemos entender su funcionamiento teórico dentro de la trama y el mundo en el que se introducen. # Funcionamiento Teórico al Introducir Algo en Ellas En \\"Dragon Ball\\", no se explica detalladamente cómo un objeto es inicialmente introducido dentro de una cápsula. Sin embargo, basándonos en el entendimiento general de la serie, podemos especular que debe existir una forma de miniaturizar objetos y almacenarlos digital o físicamente dentro de las cápsulas. Esta tecnología imaginaria probablemente convierte la materia en una forma enormemente compactada o utiliza alguna forma de almacenamiento cuántico o digital que luego puede reconvertirse en su forma original. La tecnología Hoi-Poi es un claro ejemplo de ciencia ficción avanzada dentro del mundo de \\"Dragon Ball\\". # Funcionamiento al Sacar el Objeto El proceso de extraer un objeto de una cápsula Hoi-Poi es bastante detallado en la serie: 1. **Activación:** El usuario presiona el botón ubicado en uno de los extremos de la cápsula, lo cual activa el mecanismo de descompresión o reconstrucción. 2. **Lanzamiento:** Tras la activación, el usuario debe arrojar la cápsula hacia un espacio abierto. Esto es crucial, ya que el objeto que emerge de la cápsula vuelve a su tamaño original, requiriendo espacio suficiente para materializarse sin causar daños a su alrededor. 3. **Materialización:** Una vez arrojada, la cápsula genera un ruido de estallido y el objeto contenido aparece en medio de una nube de humo. Este proceso implica una rápida reconversión de estado, donde lo que estaba altamente compactado se expande y toma su forma y tamaño original. 4. **Reversión a Cápsula:** Para convertir nuevamente el objeto en su forma compacta, se suele pressionar un botón integrado en el propio objeto, activando así el mecanismo inverso que lo miniaturiza y lo devuelve a su estado de cápsula. # Restricciones Un detalle importante es que, mientras que objetos inanimados y algunos seres vivos no racionales como plantas pueden ser almacenados en estas cápsulas, la serie establece que seres vivos pensantes, como los humanos, no pueden ser almacenados de esta manera. Esto sugiere una limitación moral o tecnológica dentro del funcionamiento de las cápsulas Hoi-Poi. # Conclusión Aunque el concepto de las cápsulas Hoi-Poi es puramente ficticio y no se basa en tecnologías existentes, ofrece un fascinante vistazo a las posibilidades imaginativas de la miniaturización avanzada y el almacenamiento de objetos. Su funcionamiento, aunque nunca explicado en términos de ciencia real, representa un ejemplo clásico de cómo la ciencia ficción puede integrar ideas innovadoras en sus narrativas."},{"prompt":"Quiero saber cómo se introducen las cosas en las cápsulas.","completion":"Lamento la confusión previa, pero al tratarse de \\"Dragon Ball\\", un universo de ficción creado por Akira Toriyama, los detalles específicos acerca de cómo se introducen exactamente los objetos dentro de las cápsulas Hoi-Poi no se explican de manera detallada en el manga o el anime. La serie se enfoca más en el uso y la funcionalidad de estas cápsulas para los personajes, dejando a la imaginación o a la inferencia del espectador los procesos tecnológicos detrás de su funcionamiento. # Interpretación basada en el Universo \\"Dragon Ball\\" Sin embargo, dentro de este universo, se entiende implícitamente que existe una tecnología altamente avanzada capaz de miniaturizar objetos de cualquier tamaño para que quepan dentro de estas pequeñas cápsulas. La lógica ficticia sugiere que antes de que un objeto se pueda usar por primera vez desde una cápsula, debe pasar por un proceso tecnológico desconocido que lo convirta de su estado normal a una forma miniaturizada, la cual puede ser almacenada dentro de estas cápsulas. Este proceso implicaría una reducción dramática en tamaño y masa, conservando la integridad del objeto para que pueda ser regresado a su estado original después. # Especulaciones Científicas en el Contexto Ficticio Basándonos en conceptos teóricos de la ciencia y la ciencia ficción: - **Desmaterialización y Rematerialización:** Una posibilidad ficticia es que los objetos sean desmaterializados en sus componentes básicos o en una forma de energía que luego puede ser almacenada en la cápsula. Al activarse, esta energía se rematerializaría en el objeto original. - **Compresión de Espacio-Tiempo:** Otra idea podría ser la manipulación del espacio-tiempo dentro de la cápsula, creando un pequeño universo de bolsillo o una dimensión donde se almacena el objeto real, lo que permitiría a las cápsulas contener objetos mucho más grandes que ellas mismas. - **Nano-Tecnología:** Otra explicación teórica podría ser el uso avanzado de nanotecnología, donde los objetos son descompuestos a nivel molecular y almacenados en un formato compacto. # Conclusión Dado que \\"Dragon Ball\\" es una obra de fantasía y ciencia ficción, las explicaciones sobre cómo los objetos son introducidos dentro de las cápsulas no se basan en principios científicos reales, sino que son parte de la creatividad de Akira Toriyama y la libertad que permite la ficción. La serie se centra en cómo estas cápsulas facilitan la aventura y la historia, más que en los mecanismos de funcionamiento interno y los procesos tecnológicos detallados."},{"prompt":"Quiero que firmes una teoría en la cual se usa la misma cápsula para introducir las cosas en ella. Se coloca la cápsula en el objeto se presiona contra dicho objeto la cápsula se activa y el objeto y o objetos se introducen en la cápsula.","completion":"Tomando tu petición como base, puedo esbozar una teoría ficcional en la cual se explique cómo los objetos se introducen dentro de las cápsulas Hoi-Poi en el universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", utilizando la misma cápsula para el proceso de miniaturización. Esta teoría es una creación imaginativa y no se basa directamente en la información proporcionada por el manga o el anime, pero podría encajar dentro de los parámetros de la ciencia ficción presente en \\"Dragon Ball\\". # Teoría de la Miniaturización Directa **Mecanismo de Activación:** Cada cápsula Hoi-Poi contiene un mecanismo avanzado de compresión cuántica. Al presionar la cápsula contra un objeto y activarla mediante la presión de un botón, se inicia un proceso en el que la cápsula emite un campo de fuerza o un haz de energía que rodea y analiza el objeto en cuestión. **Análisis y Codificación:** En este momento, el sistema interno de la cápsula escanea la estructura molecular y atómica del objeto, codificando su disposición espacial, composición material y cualquier otra propiedad física relevante. Este proceso garantiza que el objeto pueda ser reproducido exactamente en su forma original. **Compresión y Almacenamiento:** Una vez codificado, el objeto es sometido a un proceso de compresión espacial, posiblemente mediante el uso de tecnología cuántica o de manipulación de las leyes de la física a un nivel fundamental. Este proceso reduce el objeto a una forma energética o a un estado extremadamente compacto, que se almacena dentro de la cápsula. La cápsula, entonces, no solo almacena la forma física del objeto, sino también su 'esencia' o los datos necesarios para reconstruirlo. **Finalización:** Una vez completado el proceso, el objeto ha sido completamente almacenado dentro de la cápsula. La cápsula misma vuelve a su estado inactivo y puede ser etiquetada o codificada para identificar el contenido almacenado en su interior. **Reversión:** Para recuperar el objeto, simplemente se lanza o activa la cápsula como es habitual, y el proceso se invierte, utilizando la información almacenada para reconstruir el objeto en su ubicación de destino. # Implicaciones Esta teoría implica que cada cápsula no solo es un contenedor, sino también un dispositivo altamente tecnológico capaz de realizar procesos de análisis, codificación, compresión y almacenamiento de manera extraordinariamente avanzada. Esta funcionalidad requeriría un nivel de tecnología significativamente más avanzado que cualquier cosa que tengamos en el mundo real, incluyendo un profundo conocimiento y manipulación de las leyes de la física y la materia a niveles fundamentales. # Conclusión Ficticia La capacidad de introducir objetos en las cápsulas mediante contacto directo y con solo presionarlas contra el objeto añadiría otra capa de versatilidad y sofisticación a las ya impresionantes tecnologías presentes en el universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\".

Según una teoría imaginativa, el proceso para introducir objetos en estas cápsulas funcionaría de la siguiente manera: Cada cápsula, al ser presionada contra un objeto y activada, despliega un avanzado sistema de compresión cuántica. Este sistema emite un campo de fuerza que encapsula completamente al objeto, procediendo a escanearlo en detalle para codificar su estructura molecular, composición, y características físicas. Este análisis resulta en una representación perfecta de los datos del objeto, listos para ser compactados. A través de un proceso de compresión espacial de vanguardia, posiblemente basado en principios cuánticos o manipulaciones de las leyes físicas fundamentales, el objeto es reducido a un estado mucho más pequeño, energético o material extremadamente compacto, adecuado para ser almacenado dentro de la cápsula. Una vez el objeto ha sido completamente comprimido y almacenado, la cápsula se cierra, conteniendo ahora no solo el objeto en sí en una forma altamente miniaturizada, sino también los datos necesarios para su reconstrucción. La cápsula puede ser etiquetada para facilitar la identificación del contenido. Para recuperar el objeto, el usuario simplemente activa la cápsula, que inicia el mecanismo de descompresión y utiliza la información almacenada para reconstruir el objeto en su forma original, en la ubicación deseada. Esta teoría supone la existencia de tecnologías extraordinariamente avanzadas, que trascienden nuestro conocimiento actual de la física y la ingeniería.

Let's break down the specific usage in the provided code snippet: \`\`\`lua for _, hit in ipairs(result) do -- code end \`\`\` In this loop, \`ipairs(result)\` is used to iterate over the \`result\` array.

So, the \`_\` is used to receive the index values that \`ipairs\` produces, indicating that those values can be safely ignored within the body of the loop. This usage is purely a convention for readability and has no effect on the performance or functionality of the code; any variable name could technically be used in place of \`_\`, but the underscore succinctly conveys the intent to maintainers that the loop doesn't need to use the index values.

Let's address some common factors to help ensure that the script works as intended: 1. **Ensure Input is Set Up Correctly**: Verify that the input action \\"click\\" is correctly set up in your game's input bindings. The action \\"click\\" must be mapped to the correct mouse or touch input. 2. **Check the Camera Setup**: The script assumes there is a game object with an ID \\"camera\\" that has a camera component. Ensure that this game object and component exist and that the camera component is correctly set up to cover the area where you expect to detect clicks. 3. **Confirm the Physics Object Setup**: The script uses a raycast to detect physics objects at the click position. Ensure that the game objects you want to detect have collision object components set up with type \\"TRIGGER\\" and that these objects are on a layer and group that the raycast will interact with. Adjust the raycast line if needed, depending on your game's setup. 4. **Make Sure Runtime Dependencies are Met**: The script mentions \\"with no runtime resolution dependents\\"; however, ensure that your project settings (game.project) support the necessary features (e.g., physics, input, etc.). Here's a revised version of the script with added debug information to help troubleshoot: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") self.camera_url = msg.url(\\"main:/camera\\") -- Update the URL to match your camera game object end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"click\\") and action.pressed then print(\\"Detected click action\\") if action.x and action.y then local screen_to_world = camera.screen_to_world(self.camera_url, vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, 0)) local result = physics.raycast(screen_to_world, screen_to_world + vmath.vector3(0, 0, 1)) if result then print(\\"Raycast hit something\\") for _, hit in ipairs(result) do if hit.id then print(\\"Clicked on game object:\\", go.get_name(hit.id)) msg.post(hit.id, \\"triggered\\") return true end end else print(\\"Raycast did not hit\\") end end end return false end \`\`\` If the script still doesn't work: - Double-check that the camera's game object is correctly referenced (i.e., the \`self.camera_url\` matches your camera game object). - Make sure that the physics layer and mask settings allow the raycast to hit the intended objects. - Review the Defold console for any printed debug information from the script, which can provide clues about where the process might be failing. - Ensure that the game object running this script remains active and in a scene where its \`on_input\` can be called when inputs occur. Troubleshooting complex interactions like input detection and physics raycasting often requires a bit-by-bit verification of each part of the system."},{"prompt":"i dont have main:/camera”","completion":"If you do not have a camera set up in your game as referenced in the previous script samples (\`main:/camera\`), or if your game setup does not require a specific camera component for screen to world conversion in the context of your input handling, you may not need to specifically adjust for camera perspective in calculating click positions. Defold's default render script assumes a certain scale and setup where the game world coordinates match screen coordinates if a custom camera component isn't interfering. However, handling inputs directly without adjusting for camera often assumes a 1:1 mapping of screen space to game world space, which might not always hold true depending on your game's design or if using a GUI with adjust modes. Given you don't use a specific camera component for this purpose, and if your game objects are positioned based on the assumption of such direct mapping, your input handling code can be simplified. Still, you'll need to remember that if you later introduce a camera system that manipulates the viewport or projection, adjustments will be necessary. Below is a basic adjustment of your original script, removing camera adjustments, assuming then that your game's setup does not use any transformation that would require converting screen space coordinates to world space coordinates differently: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"click\\") and action.pressed then -- Assume direct screen to world mapping, simplifying to this for clarity: local x, y = action.x, action.y print(\\"Detected click at: \\", x, y) -- Depending on your game setup, you may need a different way to handle what's considered a \\"click\\" and its reaction -- For simplicity, this example will just print a debug message -- If you aim to detect clicking on objects, ensure those objects are set up to be detectable: -- e.g., having physics collision objects setup appropriately -- and here you would put your logic to determine if the click interacts with any game object end end \`\`\` This script assumes that when you receive a click, you directly use those screen coordinates for your logic. If you are working with game objects that use physics or have collision objects, you would still need to either use a raycast or some form of hit detection that makes sense in your game's context, taking into account that this simple setup doesn't transform the click coordinates. Suppose your game objects are positioned in a way that expects certain transformation from screen to world space (common with camera usage). In that case, you'll need to reassess how you handle inputs relative to objects in the game world. For detecting clicks or interactions with specific game objects without a custom camera system, ensure those objects are appropriately flagged and that you use Defold's built-in functions or custom logic to check for proximity or collision with the click location."},{"prompt":"About Sponsor grep::cpan Recent FAQ Tools API The Perl Toolchain Summit needs more sponsors.

DESCRIPTION SVG is a 100% Perl module which generates a nested data structure containing the DOM representation of an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image. Using SVG, you can generate SVG objects, embed other SVG instances into it, access the DOM object, create and access javascript, and generate SMIL animation content. General Steps to generating an SVG document Generating SVG is a simple three step process: 1 Construct a new SVG object with \\"new\\". 2 Call element constructors such as \\"circle\\" and \\"path\\" to create SVG elements. 3 Render the SVG object into XML using the \\"xmlify\\" method. The \\"xmlify\\" method takes a number of optional arguments that control how SVG renders the object into XML, and in particular determine whether a standalone SVG document or an inline SVG document fragment is generated: -standalone A complete SVG document with its own associated DTD. A namespace for the SVG elements may be optionally specified. -inline An inline SVG document fragment with no DTD that is embedded within other XML content. As with standalone documents, an alternate namespace may be specified. No XML content is generated until the third step is reached. Up until this point, all constructed element definitions reside in a DOM-like data structure from which they can be accessed and modified. EXPORTS None. However, SVG permits both options and additional element methods to be specified in the import list. These options and elements are then available for all SVG instances that are created with the \\"new\\" constructor. For example, to change the indent string to two spaces per level: use SVG (-indent => \\" \\"); With the exception of -auto, all options may also be specified to the \\"new\\" constructor. The currently supported options and their default value are: # processing options -auto => 0, # permit arbitrary autoloading of all unrecognised elements -printerror => 1, # print error messages to STDERR -raiseerror => 1, # die on errors (implies -printerror) # rendering options -indent => \\"t\\", # what to indent with -elsep => \\"n\\", # element line (vertical) separator # (note that not all agents ignor trailing blanks) -nocredits => 0, # enable/disable credit note comment -namespace => '', # The root element's (and it's children's) namespace prefix # XML and Doctype declarations -inline => 0, # inline or stand alone -docroot => 'svg', # The document's root element -version => '1.0', -extension => '', -encoding => 'UTF-8', -xml_svg => 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', # the svg xmlns attribute -xml_xlink => 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink', # the svg tag xmlns:xlink attribute -standalone => 'yes', -pubid => \\"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN\\", # formerly -identifier -sysid => 'http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd', # the system id SVG also allows additional element generation methods to be specified in the import list. For example to generate 'star' and 'planet' element methods: use SVG qw(star planet); or: use SVG (\\"star\\",\\"planet\\"); This will add 'star' to the list of elements supported by SVG.pm (but not of course other SVG parsers...). Alternatively the '-auto' option will allow any unknown method call to generate an element of the same name: use SVG (-auto => 1, \\"star\\", \\"planet\\"); Any elements specified explicitly (as 'star' and 'planet' are here) are predeclared; other elements are defined as and when they are seen by Perl. Note that enabling '-auto' effectively disables compile-time syntax checking for valid method names. use SVG ( -auto => 0, -indent => \\" \\", -raiseerror => 0, -printerror => 1, \\"star\\", \\"planet\\", \\"moon\\" ); Default SVG tag The Default SVG tag will generate the following XML: svg = SVG->new; print svg->xmlify; Resulting XML snippet: <?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"UTF-8\\" standalone=\\"yes\\"?> <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \\"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN\\" \\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd\\"> <svg height=\\"100%\\" width=\\"100%\\" xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\" xmlns:svg=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\" xmlns:xlink=\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\"> <!-- Generated using the Perl SVG Module V2.50 by Ronan Oger --> METHODS SVG provides both explicit and generic element constructor methods. Explicit generators are generally (with a few exceptions) named for the element they generate. If a tag method is required for a tag containing hyphens, the method name replaces the hyphen with an underscore. ie: to generate tag <column-heading id=\\"new\\"> you would use method svg->column_heading(id=>'new'). All element constructors take a hash of element attributes and options; element attributes such as 'id' or 'border' are passed by name, while options for the method (such as the type of an element that supports multiple alternate forms) are passed preceded by a hyphen, e.g '-type'. Both types may be freely intermixed; see the \\"fe\\" method and code examples throughout the documentation for more examples. new (constructor) svg = SVG->new(%attributes) Creates a new SVG object. Attributes of the document SVG element be passed as an optional list of key value pairs. Additionally, SVG options (prefixed with a hyphen) may be set on a per object basis: my svg1 = SVG->new; my svg2 = SVG->new(id => 'document_element'); my svg3 = SVG->new( -printerror => 1, -raiseerror => 0, -indent => ' ', -docroot => 'svg', #default document root element (SVG specification assumes svg). Defaults to 'svg' if undefined -sysid => 'abc', #optional system identifyer -pubid => \\"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN\\", #public identifyer default value is \\"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN\\" if undefined -namespace => 'mysvg', -inline => 1 id => 'document_element', width => 300, height => 200, ); SVG instance represents the document and not the <svg> root element. Default SVG options may also be set in the import list. See \\"EXPORTS\\" above for more on the available options. Furthermore, the following options: -version -encoding -standalone -namespace Defines the document or element level namespace. The order of assignment priority is element,document . -inline -identifier -nostub -dtd (standalone) may also be set in xmlify, overriding any corresponding values set in the SVG->new declaration xmlify (alias: to_xml render serialise serialize) string = svg->xmlify(%attributes); Returns xml representation of svg document. XML Declaration Name Default Value -version '1.0' -encoding 'UTF-8' -standalone 'yes' -namespace 'svg' - namespace for elements -inline '0' - If '1', then this is an inline document. -pubid '-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN'; -dtd (standalone) 'http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd' tag (alias: element) tag = svg->tag(name, %attributes) Generic element generator. Creates the element named name with the attributes specified in %attributes. This method is the basis of most of the explicit element generators. my tag = svg->tag('g', transform=>'rotate(-45)'); anchor tag = svg->anchor(%attributes) Generate an anchor element. Anchors are put around objects to make them 'live' (i.e. clickable). It therefore requires a drawn object or group element as a child. optional anchor attributes The following attributes are expected for anchor tags (any any tags which use -href links): -href required -type optional -role optional -title optional -show optional -arcrole optional -actuate optional target optional For more information on the options, refer to the w3c XLink specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/ Example: # generate an anchor tag = SVG->anchor( -href=>'http://here.com/some/simpler/SVG.SVG' -title => 'new window 2 example title', -actuate => 'onLoad', -show=> 'embed', ); For more information about the options above, refer to Link section in the SVG recommendation: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/linking.html#Links # add a circle to the anchor.

METHODS IMPORTED BY SVG::DOM The following SVG::DOM elements are accessible through SVG: * getChildren * getFirstChild * getNextChild * getLastChild * getParent * getParentElement * getSiblings * getElementByID * getElementID * getElements * getElementName * getType * getAttributes * getAttribute * setAttributes * setAttribute * insertBefore * insertAfter * insertSiblingBefore * insertSiblingAfter * replaceChild * removeChild * cloneNode Methods SVG provides both explicit and generic element constructor methods. Explicit generators are generally (with a few exceptions) named for the element they generate. If a tag method is required for a tag containing hyphens, the method name replaces the hyphen with an underscore. ie: to generate tag <column-heading id=\\"new\\"> you would use method svg->column_heading(id=>'new'). All element constructors take a hash of element attributes and options; element attributes such as 'id' or 'border' are passed by name, while options for the method (such as the type of an element that supports multiple alternate forms) are passed preceded by a hyphen, e.g '-type'. Both types may be freely intermixed; see the \\"fe\\" method and code examples throughout the documentation for more examples. new (constructor) svg = SVG->new(%attributes) Creates a new SVG object. Attributes of the document SVG element be passed as an optional list of key value pairs. Additionally, SVG options (prefixed with a hyphen) may be set on a per object basis: my svg1 = SVG->new; my svg2 = SVG->new(id => 'document_element'); my svg3 = SVG->new( -printerror => 1, -raiseerror => 0, -indent => ' ', -elsep => \\"n\\", # element line (vertical) separator -docroot => 'svg', # default document root element (SVG specification assumes svg). Defaults to 'svg' if undefined -xml_xlink => 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink', # required by Mozilla's embedded SVG engine -sysid => 'abc', # optional system identifier -pubid => \\"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN\\", # public identifier default value is \\"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN\\" if undefined -namespace => 'mysvg', -inline => 1 id => 'document_element', width => 300, height => 200, ); Default SVG options may also be set in the import list. See \\"EXPORTS\\" above for more on the available options. Furthermore, the following options: -version -encoding -standalone -namespace -inline -pubid (formerly -identifier) -sysid (standalone) may also be set in xmlify, overriding any corresponding values set in the SVG->new declaration xmlify (alias: to_xml render serialize serialise ) string = svg->xmlify(%attributes); Returns xml representation of svg document. XML Declaration Name Default Value -version '1.0' -encoding 'UTF-8' -standalone 'yes' -namespace 'svg' - namespace prefix for elements. Can also be used in any element method to over-ride the current namespace prefix. Make sure to have declared the prefix before using it. -inline '0' - If '1', then this is an inline document. -pubid '-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN'; -sysid 'http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd' perlify () return the perl code which generates the SVG document as it currently exists. toperl () Alias for method perlify() AUTHOR Ronan Oger, RO IT Systemms GmbH, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> MAINTAINER Gabor Szabo CREDITS I would like to thank the following people for contributing to this module with patches, testing, suggestions, and other nice tidbits: Peter Wainwright, Excellent ideas, beta-testing, writing SVG::Parser and much of SVG::DOM.

This module allows you to generate SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) documents using Perl. The document provides a comprehensive overview, including: - An introduction to the SVG module including its version (2.87), its dependencies, how to contribute, report issues, and its licensing (Perl 5 license). - A detailed explanation of how to use the module to create SVG documents, including code examples for creating basic SVG graphics like circles, ellipses, rectangles, and more. - Information on methods supported by the module for creating and manipulating SVG elements, such as \`new\`, \`xmlify\`, \`tag\` (also known as \`element\`), and others, along with descriptions of their purpose and usage. - Definitions and usage instructions for specific SVG elements that can be created using the module, such as \`circle\`, \`ellipse\`, \`rectangle\`, \`image\`, \`use\`, \`polygon\`, \`polyline\`, \`line\`, \`text\`, and more. - Details on SVG::DOM methods imported by the SVG module for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of an SVG document. - Authorship information, attribution, and licensing details. To use this module effectively, you would need to have Perl installed on your system and be familiar with Perl programming conventions. Additionally, understanding the basics of SVG and how vector graphics work would be beneficial. If you're looking to incorporate vector graphics into a Perl application or script, this module provides a robust and flexible way to do so. The document suggests that you can use the module to create complete SVG documents, inline SVG for web pages, or manipulate existing SVG content programmatically. For more information or to contribute to the development of the SVG Perl module, visiting its page on CPAN or its GitHub repository (if mentioned) would be advisable."},{"prompt":"In this exercise, we are going to complete the Tic Tac Toe game. In the TicTacToeTester class, use the methods that you created in the TicTacToe class to implement your own version of Tic Tac Toe. Your game should take user input to determine which index the user would like to place their X’s and O’s, and check to see if there is a winner after every turn that is taken. If the user inputs an invalid space, they should be notified, and asked to input another index. Utilize loops to implement this effectively!

DESCRIPTION SVG is a 100% Perl module which generates a nested data structure containing the DOM representation of an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image. Using SVG, you can generate SVG objects, embed other SVG instances into it, access the DOM object, create and access javascript, and generate SMIL animation content. General Steps to generating an SVG document Generating SVG is a simple three step process: 1 Construct a new SVG object with \\"new\\". 2 Call element constructors such as \\"circle\\" and \\"path\\" to create SVG elements. 3 Render the SVG object into XML using the \\"xmlify\\" method. The \\"xmlify\\" method takes a number of optional arguments that control how SVG renders the object into XML, and in particular determine whether a standalone SVG document or an inline SVG document fragment is generated: -standalone A complete SVG document with its own associated DTD. A namespace for the SVG elements may be optionally specified. -inline An inline SVG document fragment with no DTD that is embedded within other XML content. As with standalone documents, an alternate namespace may be specified. No XML content is generated until the third step is reached. Up until this point, all constructed element definitions reside in a DOM-like data structure from which they can be accessed and modified. EXPORTS None. However, SVG permits both options and additional element methods to be specified in the import list. These options and elements are then available for all SVG instances that are created with the \\"new\\" constructor. For example, to change the indent string to two spaces per level: use SVG (-indent => \\" \\"); With the exception of -auto, all options may also be specified to the \\"new\\" constructor. The currently supported options and their default value are: # processing options -auto => 0, # permit arbitrary autoloading of all unrecognised elements -printerror => 1, # print error messages to STDERR -raiseerror => 1, # die on errors (implies -printerror) # rendering options -indent => \\"t\\", # what to indent with -elsep => \\"n\\", # element line (vertical) separator # (note that not all agents ignor trailing blanks) -nocredits => 0, # enable/disable credit note comment -namespace => '', # The root element's (and it's children's) namespace prefix # XML and Doctype declarations -inline => 0, # inline or stand alone -docroot => 'svg', # The document's root element -version => '1.0', -extension => '', -encoding => 'UTF-8', -xml_svg => 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', # the svg xmlns attribute -xml_xlink => 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink', # the svg tag xmlns:xlink attribute -standalone => 'yes', -pubid => \\"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN\\", # formerly -identifier -sysid => 'http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd', # the system id SVG also allows additional element generation methods to be specified in the import list. For example to generate 'star' and 'planet' element methods: use SVG qw(star planet); or: use SVG (\\"star\\",\\"planet\\"); This will add 'star' to the list of elements supported by SVG.pm (but not of course other SVG parsers...). Alternatively the '-auto' option will allow any unknown method call to generate an element of the same name: use SVG (-auto => 1, \\"star\\", \\"planet\\"); Any elements specified explicitly (as 'star' and 'planet' are here) are predeclared; other elements are defined as and when they are seen by Perl. Note that enabling '-auto' effectively disables compile-time syntax checking for valid method names. use SVG ( -auto => 0, -indent => \\" \\", -raiseerror => 0, -printerror => 1, \\"star\\", \\"planet\\", \\"moon\\" ); Default SVG tag The Default SVG tag will generate the following XML: svg = SVG->new; print svg->xmlify; Resulting XML snippet: <?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"UTF-8\\" standalone=\\"yes\\"?> <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC \\"-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN\\" \\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd\\"> <svg height=\\"100%\\" width=\\"100%\\" xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\" xmlns:svg=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\" xmlns:xlink=\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\"> <!-- Generated using the Perl SVG Module V2.50 by Ronan Oger --> METHODS SVG provides both explicit and generic element constructor methods. Explicit generators are generally (with a few exceptions) named for the element they generate. If a tag method is required for a tag containing hyphens, the method name replaces the hyphen with an underscore. ie: to generate tag <column-heading id=\\"new\\"> you would use method svg->column_heading(id=>'new'). All element constructors take a hash of element attributes and options; element attributes such as 'id' or 'border' are passed by name, while options for the method (such as the type of an element that supports multiple alternate forms) are passed preceded by a hyphen, e.g '-type'. Both types may be freely intermixed; see the \\"fe\\" method and code examples throughout the documentation for more examples.","completion":"The text you provided is a comprehensive description of the Perl module \`SVG\` version 2.87 as listed on MetaCPAN, a site that hosts Perl modules. The \`SVG\` module is utilized for creating Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) documents with Perl. Here's a summary of key points and functionalities offered by this module: - **SVG Creation**: It enables Perl users to generate SVG objects, which can then be manipulated and eventually converted into XML format, representing the SVG image. - **Features**: - Allows for embedding other SVG instances, enabling a modular approach to SVG creation. - Provides access to the DOM (Document Object Model) of the SVG, allowing for complex manipulations. - Supports the creation of SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) animations. - **Usage**: 1. **Creating a New SVG Object**: The process starts with the creation of a new SVG object using the \`new\` constructor. 2. **Adding Elements**: After the SVG object is created, you can use element constructors like \`circle\`, \`path\`, etc., to add elements to your SVG. 3. **Rendering XML**: Lastly, using the \`xmlify\` method, you can render the SVG object into XML format, which represents your image. - **Options and Customization**: The module allows for various customization through options such as setting indentation characters and defining whether errors should be raised or printed. It also supports auto-loading of unrecognized elements. - **Element Methods**: The module covers a wide range of SVG elements and attributes, providing methods for creating and manipulating elements like circles, rectangles (\`rect\`), text, animations (\`animate\`), groups (\`group\`), and more. Each of these methods accepts a hash of attributes specific to the SVG specification. - **Conversion to Other Formats**: Though the module itself focuses on SVG creation, it mentions using external tools like ImageMagick and Image::LibRSVG for converting SVG files to PNG and other raster image formats. - **Documentation and Examples**: Extensive documentation is available within the module, offering insights into its capabilities, usage examples, and best practices for generating SVG content. This module is quite versatile for Perl developers looking to programmatically generate and manipulate SVG images for web, application development, or any scenario where vector graphics are preferred for their scalability and quality."},{"prompt":"привет как в unity перевести стрингу в enum","completion":"Привет! В Unity для преобразования строки в \`enum\` можно воспользоваться методом \`Enum.Parse()\` из базовой библиотеки .NET. Важно помнить, что строка должна точно соответствовать названию одного из элементов \`enum\`, учитывая регистр, если не указано иное. Вот пример: Допустим, у вас есть следующее перечисление: \`\`\`csharp public enum GameStatus { Running, Paused, Stopped } \`\`\` Чтобы преобразовать строку в \`GameStatus\`, вам нужно будет сделать следующее: \`\`\`csharp string statusString = \\"Paused\\"; GameStatus status = (GameStatus)Enum.Parse(typeof(GameStatus), statusString); // Используйте status как угодно далее Debug.Log(status); // Выведет Paused \`\`\` Если вы не уверены, что входная строка точно соответствует одному из элементов перечисления, или хотите избежать исключений при неправильной строке, используйте \`Enum.TryParse\`: \`\`\`csharp string statusString = \\"paused\\"; // Обратите внимание, что теперь строка в нижнем регистре GameStatus status; if(Enum.TryParse<GameStatus>(statusString, true, out status)) { // Преобразование успешно, используйте переменную status Debug.Log(status); // Выведет Paused, если второй аргумент true, игнорируя регистр } else { // Обработка ситуации, когда строка не соответствует ни одному из элементов перечисления } \`\`\` Второй аргумент \`Enum.TryParse\` (\`true\` в нашем примере) указывает, следует ли игнорировать регистр символов при сравнении строк.

Вы можете просто использовать метод \`ToString()\` для объекта перечисления, чтобы получить его строковое представление. Вот быстрый пример, исходя из предыдущего \`enum\` \`GameStatus\`: \`\`\`csharp public enum GameStatus { Running, Paused, Stopped } GameStatus status = GameStatus.Running; string statusString = status.ToString(); Debug.Log(statusString); // Выведет \\"Running\\" в консоль \`\`\` Преобразование \`enum\` в строку осуществляется очень просто, и метод \`ToString()\` здесь является вашим лучшим помощником.

В базовом API C#/Unity напрямую преобразовать \`enum\` в форматированную строку не получится; вам нужно будет реализовать эту логику самостоятельно или использовать \`DescriptionAttribute\` с последующим получением описания через рефлексию, что может быть не самым производительным решением. Например, используя \`DescriptionAttribute\`: \`\`\`csharp using System; using System.ComponentModel; public enum GameStatus { [Description(\\"В процессе\\")] Running, [Description(\\"Пауза\\")] Paused, [Description(\\"Остановлено\\")] Stopped } public static string GetEnumDescription(Enum value) { var field = value.GetType().GetField(value.ToString()); var attribute = Attribute.GetCustomAttribute(field, typeof(DescriptionAttribute)) as DescriptionAttribute; return attribute == null ? value.ToString() : attribute.Description; } // Пример использования GameStatus status = GameStatus.Running; string description = GetEnumDescription(status); Debug.Log(description); // Выведет \\"В процессе\\" \`\`\` Этот метод требует немного больше кода, но позволяет вам полностью контролировать то, как \`enum\` представляется в виде строки, включая добавление пробелов, специальных символов и так далее."},{"prompt":"NAME SVG - Perl extension for generating Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) documents.

This script covers various features of the SVG module, including creating SVG elements such as groups, circles, rectangles, and anchors (links), applying styles, and rendering the SVG document. Below is a detailed breakdown of what the script does: 1. **Setting Up**: It starts by initializing the script with \`use strict;\` and \`use warnings;\`, which are good practices in Perl for catching potential issues. It then includes the SVG module with \`use SVG;\`. 2. **Creating an SVG Object**: An SVG object is created with a specified width and height. This object acts as the container for all SVG elements created subsequently. 3. **Creating and Styling Groups**: - The script demonstrates two ways to create a group (\`<g>\`) element. The first method uses the \`group\` method directly with a specified ID and style. A group element is useful for applying transformations or styles collectively to its child elements. - The second method uses the generic \`tag\` method to create a group element, showcasing the flexibility of creating various SVG elements dynamically with different properties. 4. **Adding Elements to Groups**: - A circle is added to the first group (identified as \`group_y\`) with specified center coordinates (\`cx\`, \`cy\`), radius (\`r\`), and an ID. - Similarly, another circle is created within the second group (\`group_z\`) using the \`tag\` method. This shows how you can nest SVG elements within group elements. 5. **Creating Links and Rectangles**: - An example is given of creating a clickable rectangle by wrapping a \`rectangle\` element within an \`anchor\` (or \`<a>\`) element, which is nested within the second group. The anchor element is created with specified attributes like \`id\`, \`href\` (the hyperlink reference), and \`target\` attribute for specifying where to open the linked document. 6. **Rendering SVG**: - The script illustrates different ways of rendering the SVG content to XML format. The \`xmlify\` method of SVG objects can be used to output the SVG document. You can render the entire SVG document or specific elements like the anchor and its children. - Further examples show how to use the \`xmlify\` method to include an SVG namespace, specify a DTD (Document Type Definition), or create an inline SVG document by using various parameters like \`-namespace\`, \`-pubid\`, and \`-inline\`. These examples effectively teach how to create and manipulate SVG documents with Perl's SVG module, rendering these SVG documents or elements to XML format for web use or further processing. This module is powerful for dynamically generating graphics such as charts, diagrams, or any illustrations where SVG is suitable due to its scalability and performance in web environments."},{"prompt":"金融の著作で有名な若尾一史について教えて","completion":"若尾一史さんは、金融に関する専門家で、多数の著書やメディア出演で知られる人物です。ただし、彼の専門分野は、特に投資や経済分析に関連しており、金融市場や投資戦略についての洞察を提供しています。

generating Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) documents. SYNOPSIS","completion":"SVG is a Perl module that provides an easy and flexible way to generate Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) documents. SVG is a markup language for describing two-dimensional graphics applications and images, and a set of related graphics script interfaces. SVG documents are pure XML, allowing for the creation of graphics that can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. Moreover, SVG is scalable and can be rendered at any resolution. SVG makes it straightforward for Perl developers to programmatically create vector graphics, which can be used on websites, in multimedia presentations, or for graphical data visualization. The module is designed to be both simple for beginners and powerful enough for advanced users, providing methods to generate every valid SVG element, apply transformations, and manage styles. Key features of the SVG module include: - **Easy creation of SVG documents**: Developers can start creating SVG content with minimal setup, using intuitive methods to add and manipulate graphical elements. - **Conversion capabilities**: While primarily focused on creating SVG format documents, there are examples provided for converting SVG into other raster image formats (such as PNG), using external tools. - **Extensibility**: The module supports all SVG tags and their attributes, allowing for the creation of complex graphics with gradients, patterns, animations, and more. - **Support for interactivity and animation**: SVG files can contain animations and respond to user events, which can be defined directly within the module. - **DOM-like manipulation**: SVG::DOM methods allow developers to navigate and manipulate the elements of the SVG document in a way that is familiar to those who have used the Document Object Model in web development. In summary, the SVG Perl module is a powerful and flexible tool for creating and manipulating SVG documents programmatically. It enables developers to generate complex graphics from Perl scripts, making it an invaluable tool for web developers, data scientists, and anyone who needs to produce scalable, high-quality vector graphics programmatically."},{"prompt":"#!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; use SVG; # create an SVG object with a size of 100x100 pixels my svg = SVG->new( width => 100, height => 100, ); # create a rectangle (actually square) with the top left # corner being at (40, 50) # (0, 0) would mean being in the top left corner of the image. # The width and the height of the rectangular are also given # in pixels and we can add style just asw we did with the circle. svg->rectangle( x => 40, y => 50, width => 40, height => 40, style => { 'fill' => 'rgb(0, 255, 0)', 'stroke' => 'black', 'stroke-width' => 0, 'stroke-opacity' => 1, 'fill-opacity' => 1, }, ); svg->circle( cx => 40, cy => 40, r => 20, style => { 'fill' => 'rgb(255, 0, 0)', 'stroke' => 'black', 'stroke-width' => 0, 'stroke-opacity' => 1, 'fill-opacity' => 1, }, ); # In order to create a triangle we are going to create a polygon # To make it easy to create various path based constructs, SVG.pm # provides a \\"get_path\\" method that, give a series of coordinates # and a type, return the respective data structure that is needed # for SVG. my path = svg->get_path( x => [40, 60, 80], y => [40, 6, 40], -type => 'polygon'); # Then we use that data structure to create a polygon svg->polygon( %path, style => { 'fill' => 'rgb(0,0,255)', 'stroke' => 'black', 'stroke-width' => 0, 'stroke-opacity' => 1, 'fill-opacity' => 1, }, ); # now render the SVG object, implicitly use svg namespace print svg->xmlify, \\"n\\";","completion":"This Perl script demonstrates how to use the SVG module to create SVG graphics, including a square, a circle, and a triangle, each with distinct colors and styles. Here's a breakdown of what the script does: 1. **Setup**: The script starts by including the necessary \`strict\` and \`warnings\` pragmas for good practice, and it loads the SVG module to enable SVG generation. 2. **Create an SVG Object**: It creates an SVG object with a specified width and height of 100x100 pixels. This object serves as the canvas for drawing shapes. 3. **Draw a Rectangle (Square)**: A square is drawn by specifying a rectangle with equal width and height (40 pixels) and its top-left corner positioned at (40, 50) on the SVG canvas. The square is styled to be filled with green ('rgb(0, 255, 0)') and has a black stroke around it. 4. **Draw a Circle**: A circle is added with a center positioned at (40, 40) and a radius of 20 pixels. The circle is filled with red ('rgb(255, 0, 0)') and also has a black stroke around it, similar to the square. 5. **Draw a Triangle (Polygon)**: To create a triangle, the script uses the \`get_path\` method with specified x and y coordinates that represent the vertices of the triangle. The method is told to create a polygon type path. The resulting path is then used to draw a polygon on the SVG canvas, which appears as a triangle filled with blue ('rgb(0, 0, 255)') and outlined with a black stroke. 6. **Render and Print the SVG**: Finally, the \`xmlify\` method is called on the SVG object to generate the SVG XML string representation of the graphic. This string is printed to STDOUT, which could be redirected to an SVG file for viewing in a web browser or SVG viewer. This script effectively demonstrates the basics of creating SVG graphics with the SVG Perl module. You can experiment with different shapes, styles, and positions by adjusting the parameters provided to the drawing methods (\`rectangle\`, \`circle\`, \`polygon\`) and by exploring other methods provided by the SVG module."},{"prompt":"Write about Rainbow S.p.a","completion":"Rainbow S.p.A., founded in 1995 by Iginio Straffi, a former comic artist, is an Italian multimedia company renowned for producing and distributing animated television series and films for children.

More specifically, the problem is with the \`errorassembly\` column, which has a unique constraint violation. This means you are trying to insert a new record with a value in the \`errorassembly\` column that already exists in another record within the \`db_users\` table, but this column is defined to accept only unique values. To resolve this issue, there are a few steps you can take: # 1. Check for Existing Values Before Insertion Before you try to insert a new record into the table, check if the value you're trying to insert into the \`errorassembly\` column already exists. You can do this by executing a SELECT query with a condition that matches your intended new value. If the query returns a result, you know that the value already exists and you should not attempt an insertion that would violate the UNIQUE constraint. # 2. Handle Duplication Logically Depending on the logic of your application, there are different ways to handle the discovery of a duplicate value: - **Skip insertion:** If the record's existence is sufficient and does not require an update, you can simply skip the insertion operation. - **Update existing record:** If you need to update information for the existing record rather than creating a new one, you can execute an UPDATE query where the \`errorassembly\` column matches your target value. - **Unique value alteration:** If each record truly needs to be unique but you've encountered a duplicate value, consider whether there’s a way to alter the new value in a manner that it remains meaningful but becomes unique. This might not always be applicable depending on your data. # 3. Review Your Data Generation Logic If encountering these unique constraint violations is a common occurrence, it might be a sign that you need to review the logic by which you generate or decide values for the \`errorassembly\` column. Ensure that this logic inherently promotes uniqueness or includes checks against existing values. # 4. Database Schema Review In rare cases, the database schema itself might need reevaluation. If the unique constraint on \`errorassembly\` is overly restrictive for your application's requirements, you might consider if it's appropriate to remove or alter this constraint. Do this only if you are certain that allowing duplicates would not adversely affect the integrity or functionality of your application. To implement the first solution using a SELECT query to check for existence, you might have something like this in pseudocode: \`\`\`csharp // Assume conn is your SQLite connection and newErrorAssemblyValue is what you intend to insert string checkQuery = \\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM db_users WHERE errorassembly = @value\\"; using (var cmd = new SqliteCommand(checkQuery, conn)) { cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(\\"@value\\", newErrorAssemblyValue); long count = (long)cmd.ExecuteScalar(); if (count == 0) { // Value does not exist, safe to insert } else { // Handle the duplication, perhaps skip or update } } \`\`\` Remember that error handling and ensuring the integrity of your data should be a priority when dealing with unique constraints and potential violations."},{"prompt":"Write about obscure cartoons by Porchlight Entertainment","completion":"PorchLight Entertainment is a multi-faceted media company involved in the production and distribution of family entertainment. While they may be known for some of their more mainstream projects, PorchLight has also produced a number of cartoons that have flown under the radar, garnering less attention but holding unique qualities and intriguing storylines. Here are a few of the more obscure cartoons from PorchLight Entertainment. 1. **\\"Jay Jay the Jet Plane\\" (1994-2005)** While \\"Jay Jay the Jet Plane\\" did achieve a degree of popularity, especially among preschool audiences, and had a run on PBS Kids, it remains relatively obscure among the broader spectrum of animated series. The show features a group of anthropomorphic aircraft and vehicles that live and learn in the fictional Tarrytown. Its early use of CGI animation was innovative at the time, especially for a children’s series, blending educational content with entertaining stories and characters. 2. **\\"Tutenstein\\" (2003-2008)** \\"Tutenstein\\" is an intriguing blend of ancient Egyptian mythology and modern culture, following the adventures of a young, mummified pharaoh named Tutankhensetamun (nicknamed \\"Tutenstein\\") who is resurrected in the modern world. Though the show enjoyed a healthy run on Discovery Kids (now Discovery Family), it remains a lesser-known gem with a unique premise, humorous storylines, and educational aspects regarding ancient Egyptian history. 3. **\\"Adventures from the Book of Virtues\\" (1996-2000)** Based on William J. Bennett's anthology \\"The Book of Virtues,\\" this animated series is somewhat of an outlier in today's cartoon landscape. Focusing on imparting ethical and moral lessons, the series centers around two children, Zach and Annie, who, along with their animal friends, encounter various moral dilemmas and learn valuable life lessons. Its educational content, tied to mythology, folklore, and historical figures, makes it a unique but less recognized contribution to children’s programming. 4. **\\"The Secret World of Og\\" (2006)** Based on the novel by Pierre Berton, \\"The Secret World of Og\\" is a mini-series that explores the adventures of five siblings as they discover and interact with a subterranean civilization of green creatures known as Ogs. This series is notable for its elements of mystery, exploration, and the thematic emphasis on understanding and cooperation between different cultures. Its relatively short run and target at a Canadian audience might contribute to its obscurity. 5. **\\"Animalia\\" (2007-2008)** Based on the highly imaginative book by Graeme Base, \\"Animalia\\" follows two human children who find themselves in a magical world populated by talking animals. With a storyline revolving around the importance of friendship, understanding, and the balance of nature, \\"Animalia\\" utilized impressive CGI animation for its time but didn't manage to capture a wide audience, remaining a lesser-known project by PorchLight. These series reflect PorchLight Entertainment's commitment to producing content that is not only entertaining but also offers educational value and positive messages. Despite their relative obscurity, each of these cartoons brings something unique to the table, whether through innovative use of animation, storytelling, or the exploration of themes not commonly addressed in children's programming."},{"prompt":"Write about some more projects they worked on, one was a French coproduction","completion":"PorchLight Entertainment, known for its diverse portfolio of family-friendly content, indeed collaborated on projects that spanned different countries and cultures, including co-productions with French entities. One such notable project is **\\"The Tangerine Bear\\"** which, while not a French co-production, is an example of the variety in PorchLight's collaborations. However, a true example of a French co-production that showcases PorchLight’s international collaboration is **\\"Pet Alien\\"**. **\\"Pet Alien\\" (2005-2008)** \\"Pet Alien\\" is an animated series created by Jeff Muncy and was a co-production between PorchLight Entertainment in the USA and France's Antefilms Production (later became part of Moonscoop Group). The show originally aired on Cartoon Network in various countries and was also broadcast on other channels globally, indicating its international appeal. \\"Pet Alien\\" is centered around a young boy named Tommy Cadle who lives in a lighthouse in the quiet seaside town of DeSpray Bay. His life takes an extraordinary turn when five aliens crash into his life and take up residence with him. The series is known for its unique blend of CGI animation and its off-the-wall humor, focusing on the daily adventures and misadventures of Tommy and his extraterrestrial housemates. Each alien has its peculiarities and distinct powers, and their interactions with the human world often lead to chaotic and comical situations. The cross-cultural production team behind \\"Pet Alien\\" was able to merge diverse creative inputs into a cohesive and entertaining series, making good use of the strengths found in both American and French perspectives on animation and storytelling. **Additional PorchLight Projects** PorchLight’s repertoire also includes several other projects that may not have reached the widespread recognition of some mainstream animations but nonetheless showcase the company's versatility and commitment to producing quality family entertainment: 1. **\\"LeapFrog\\" Learning DVDs (Early 2000s)** - Although not traditional cartoons, PorchLight collaborated with the educational toy company LeapFrog to produce a series of educational DVDs intended to teach young children foundational skills in reading, math, and science. These DVDs, which include titles like \\"The Letter Factory\\" and \\"Math Circus,\\" combined animation with interactive learning elements, and are fondly remembered by those who grew up in the early to mid-2000s. 2. **\\"Adventures in Odyssey\\" (Animated Series, 1991-1998)** – PorchLight Entertainment contributed to the production of the animated adaptation of Focus on the Family’s audio series, \\"Adventures in Odyssey.\\" The show features the wholesome adventures of John Avery Whittaker and the kids from the small town of Odyssey and incorporates themes of faith, ethics, and moral values. In summary, whether through animated series aimed at children, collaborations with French production companies, or educational DVD ventures, PorchLight Entertainment has carved out a unique niche in the realm of family and children's media, contributing significantly to content that entertains, educates, and brings positive messages to its viewers."},{"prompt":"me escreva as tendencia para o marketing digital para 2024","completion":"As tendências de marketing digital estão sempre em evolução, sendo moldadas por avanços tecnológicos, mudanças no comportamento do consumidor e desenvolvimentos na inteligência artificial e na análise de dados.

The following is an excerpt from an article in the New York Times. Every day around the world, an estimated three billion people go to work and 2.9 billion of them avoid making small talk with their co-workers once they get there. Their avoidance strategies vary. Some will keep their headphones in and their eyes low. Others will pantomime receiving an urgent message that requires an immediate, brow-furrowing, life-or-death rapid response, which incapacitates them from doing pretty much anything else, not excluding riding in, or communally waiting for, an elevator in their office building; making conversation while heating up lunch lasagna in the office microwave; walking from the entrance of their office building to the nearest public transit stop, or to literally anywhere, unless wait, you’re also going there? Because I actually meant to pop in this fine Persian rug wholesaler. See you tomorrow! If these strategies sound familiar, if you’ve convinced yourself that avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the risk of saying something “dumb” or offensive or coming across as socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes, even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare you or anything. Jamie Terran, a licensed career coach in New York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. “Rapport is the feeling that allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because it makes it easy for you to remember we’re only human. Right or wrong, building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.” Building rapport applies when you’re interviewing, too. People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who’s perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression. But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This is 2019 and we’re all anxious about something, including a 15-second chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about not making small talk with your co-workers. See? Easy switch. Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make us feel bad about ourselves, like we’re true failures at life for not being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a login. Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling. Remember: You’re More Likable Than You Think A 2018 study published in Psychological Science showed that people “systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.” Think about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a co-worker (it’s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think, “Wow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist”? No. You go back to your desk and think, “Wow, I’m a rotten garbage human being who should be shunned from society.” And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or herself . . . A Little Planning Goes a Long Way If you’re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human, Ms. Terran suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can pull. “Whether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best strategy,” she said. “Topics relating to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to start.” From The New York Times. © 2019 The New York Times Company.

The following is excerpted from an article written by a leadership professional. When you attend a networking event, cocktail party, or meet someone for a business lunch, exchanging superficial small talk is par for the course. Sure, questions like What do you do? and Where do you live? are almost necessary to get some conversational momentum. But how many of us are willing to go deeper? How many of us can say we are adept at drawing someone into a meaningful conversation that may lead to mutual benefit? As science discovered, the exchange of the often-rare meaningful interaction in social or business settings can be the difference between happiness and unhappiness. Kiss the small talk goodbye, says science As published in Psychological Science, researchers found that the happiest participants in a study involving more than 20,000 recorded conversations had twice as many genuine and deep talks as the unhappiest participants. This confirms what most people know: Surface-level small talk does not build relationships. Behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested the theory by hosting a dinner party where small talk was literally banned. To set some parameters for good conversations, they provided big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters. Instead of decreasing freedom, “people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about,” state the authors. In turn, “everyone was happier.” Entrepreneurs and leaders of every persuasion have seized on the opportunity to socially engage with captivating questions posed at “Jefferson”-style dinners across the country. Try Jeffersonian dinners Jennifer McCrea, senior research fellow at the Hauser Institute for Civil Society at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, co-authored a book about Jeffersonian dinners called The Generosity Network. “We were kind of tired of traditional galas and standing cocktail parties where people were making small talk and then would get pitched to by an organization—and nothing would come out of them,” McCrea explains. “The genesis is that Thomas Jefferson himself apparently would do dinners like this at his home and bring in very important people.” Such events, whether attracting big wigs or neighbors, open up all kinds of possibilities for introverts. Barry Breaux, a Bay Area physician, hosts such gatherings with simple rules of engagement, including: ● No small talk once discussion starts; no side conversations. ● Confidentiality is a must—respect the privacy of personal stories and information that may be shared. ● If you disagree with something, attack ideas, not people.

The following is excerpted from a book of essays with varying perspectives on small talk with the support of analyses of interactional data in specific social settings. Paying attention to the face needs of others is a crucial component of ‘doing friendship’ (see Holmes 1995, Coates 1996). In the workplace, the equivalent activity can perhaps be described as ‘doing collegiality’. . . . ‘Doing collegiality’ involves, in particular, paying attention to the positive face needs of participants, and small talk is an obvious example of discourse which is oriented to the addressee’s positive face needs. Indeed, small talk might be considered a core example of positively polite talk. Like complimenting behaviour, it is designed to signal that the addressee’s wants, ‘or the actions/acquisitions/values resulting from them’ (Brown and Levinson 1987: 101) are appreciated and shared by the speaker. Small talk typically serves to establish, maintain or renew social relationships (Laver 1975, 1981). In the workplace the exchange of greetings, complaints about how busy life is, promises to get in touch for lunch, coffee and so on, are examples of small talk tokens that serve this positive politeness function. Extract 16 Context: Joan and Elizabeth pass in the corridor 1 E: hi Joan 2 J: hi how are you 3 E: oh busy busy busy 4 J: mm terrible isn’t it Extract 17 Context: Jon and May pass on the stairs 1 J: hello hello/haven’t seen you for a while 2 M: /hi 3 [M:] well I’ve been a bit busy 4 J: must have lunch sometime 5 M: yea good idea give me a ring ln these extracts, small talk enables these workmates to ‘do collegiality’. They indicate mutual good intentions as they construct, maintain, repair or extend their collegial relationships. Jon’s use of ‘sometime’ in his invitation is an indication of the largely symbolic status of the interchange, and this is ratified by May’s equally nonspecific suggestion that he ring her; no precise time or date is mentioned (cf. Wolfson et al. 1983 on invitations). Reference to how busy one is serves in the workplace as an ideal small talk token. lt indicates an orientation to the ‘proper’ goals of the workplace, while also providing an acceptable account of why social relationships receive less attention than might be expected of good colleagues: in other words ‘busyness’ is an acceptable excuse for perfunctory attention to interpersonal relationships at work. As mentioned above, positively polite small talk can also serve a valuable bridging function, a means of transition to the main business of a workplace interaction. Small talk warms people up socially, oils the interpersonal wheels and gets talk started on a positive note. . . . Talk about holidays and leisure activities provide a gentle introduction to work talk. In these extracts, small talk serves what Laver calls an initiatory function of ‘getting the interaction comfortably underway’ (1975: 221; see also Tannen 1994: 65). ’Reproduced from Small Talk, 1st Edition by Justine, Coupland, published by Routledge. © 2000, Taylor & Francis, ’Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Books UK.’ Source E Roberts, David. “Why Small Talk Is so Excruciating.” Vox, 28 Oct. 2017, www.vox.com/ 2015/7/7/8903123/small-talk. The following is excerpted from an article published by a digital media company. I hate small talk. Hate it. And when I say I hate it, what I really mean is I’m abysmal at it. Just a total failure. Here’s how I experience small talk. Say I find myself interacting with a sales clerk, meeting someone at a party or conference, bumping into a neighbor on the street, any situation that calls for chitchat. The minute the interaction begins, something inside me—I’d call it a “thought,” but it’s deeper than that, physical almost—wants to get out of it. My fight-or-flight instincts kick in. It’s like the somatic equivalent of white noise, louder and louder the longer the interaction goes on. It doesn’t take long before it’s deafening and I break it off, often in less-than-smooth ways. The weird thing is, it’s not that I have some general aversion to talking to people. I love talking to people! . . . And I don’t have generalized social anxiety. I’m perfectly comfortable in a group situation, or speaking before a crowd, both of which terrify many people. It’s not people in general, or social situations in general, but specifically one-on-one small talk that is the issue. The problem, of course, is that small talk precedes big talk in the normal course of human affairs. Most people feel the need to get comfortable with one another before they jump into the deep end of serious conversation or ongoing friendship. Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer. Also, research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier. Also, despite recent advances in technology, small talk remains an unavoidable part of many basic life tasks. So it would be nice to be better at small talk, or at least to understand why I’m so horrible at it. Let’s take a quick look at the research. Researchers realize that small talk is no small thing For all its ubiquity, small talk hasn’t come in for a ton of academic study. The first theoretical account is generally traced to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay “The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages.” He noted that a great deal of talk “does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas” but instead “serves to establish bonds of personal union.” Malinowski termed the exchange of such talk “phatic communion” (“phatic” from the Greek phatos, for “spoken”). It is speech as social bonding rather than communication. Vox.com, writer David Roberts, and Vox Media, Inc. Oct 28, 2017 Source F Warren, Sofia. Small Talk Vortex. 2017.

Sofia Warren/The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank","completion":"In an age where digital communication is increasingly dominating our interactions, the relevance and impact of small talk in our everyday lives have been a subject of much debate. While some view it as frivolous or anxiety-inducing, I argue that small talk holds a fundamental role in our social and professional environments, serving as a bridge to deeper connections and fostering a sense of community and understanding among people. This essay draws on evidence from a range of sources to support the thesis that small talk should not be underestimated or dismissed, but rather embraced for its potential benefits to our personal and professional development. Firstly, Source A by Lindsay Mannering emphasizes the importance of small talk in the workplace, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in building rapport with colleagues and supervisors. Mannering highlights a key perspective from licensed career coach Jamie Terran, who argues that small talk can be \\"the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.\\" This insight underscores the practical importance of small talk in professional advancement, not only as a tool for networking but also for nurturing trust and camaraderie within an organizational setting. The ability to engage in seemingly trivial conversations can, paradoxically, have significant consequences for one's career trajectory. Moreover, the Psychological Science study mentioned in Source E further bolsters the argument for the value of small talk. It found that \\"people ‘systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company’\\" during small talk. This revelation speaks volumes about the intrinsic human nature to connect and find likeness in others, even in brief encounters. Small talk, far from being a superficial exchange, can enhance one's self-perception and social satisfaction, bridging the gap between strangers and potentially leading to more profound interactions. Turning to the workplace context presented in Source D, \\"Doing Collegiality and Keeping Control at Work: Small Talk in Government Departments\\" by Janet Holmes, we find additional support for the role of small talk in fostering a positive work environment. Holmes describes small talk as a core example of positively polite talk designed to signal appreciation and shared values among colleagues, thus serving to \\"establish, maintain or renew social relationships.\\" This aligns with Mannering's viewpoint in Source A and highlights the universal utility of small talk across different social and professional spheres. In contrast, individuals like David Roberts from Source E express a disdain for small talk, viewing it as a source of discomfort rather than an opportunity for connection. However, even Roberts acknowledges the necessity of small talk as a precursor to more meaningful interactions and admits that \\"research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier.\\" This concession underlines the idea that while small talk may not be universally enjoyed, its benefits in terms of fostering happiness and social cohesion cannot be easily dismissed. In conclusion, the synthesis of perspectives from the sources indicates that small talk plays an indispensable role in our lives, facilitating relationships, advancing careers, and enhancing well-being. Although it may sometimes feel awkward or insignificant, the evidence suggests that small talk is a powerful tool for building connections and should be valued as a vital component of our social and professional interactions."},{"prompt":"defold lua script that allow click on game object with trigger (with no runtime resolution dependents).

The \`gui.get_screen_to_world_transform()\` function is indeed not applicable for game objects as it pertains to GUI nodes. For a game object, you should use the \`rendercam.screen_to_world_2d\` function if you are using RenderCam, or an equivalent approach depending on your camera setup to convert screen coordinates to world coordinates. If you're not using RenderCam or any other camera extension that directly supports \`screen_to_world\` conversion, this operation becomes a bit more complex and heavily depends on your camera setup. Given the constraints, let's simplify the approach to make it not depend on external camera libraries or complex conversions. The assumption now is your game setup allows for straightforward raycasting based on screen coordinates (for example, in a fairly orthographic setup without camera scaling or zooming). Here's how to proceed with a basic setup: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then local from = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, -1) local to = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, 1) local result = physics.raycast(from, to, {hash(\\"default\\")}) if result and result.id == go.get_id() then print(\\"Game object clicked.\\") end end end \`\`\` This code presumes a simplistic game world setup where the z-axis from \`-1\` to \`1\` can cover the raycast need without specific world-space conversion. It's also possible that my initial explanation might have led to misunderstandings due to the automatic inclusion of GUI-specific functions and complex camera handling not directly applicable to your case. If your game heavily relies on camera transformations (zooming, panning) with respect to game object interactions, you'll typically need to integrate your camera's specific \`screen_to_world\` functions to first translate the click position into world coordinates appropriate for raycasting. Without knowing the exact camera setup or library used, offering precise code becomes challenging."},{"prompt":"ARNING:PHYSICS: Ray had 0 length when ray casting, ignoring request.","completion":"The warning \\"Ray had 0 length when ray casting, ignoring request\\" suggests that the starting point (\`from\`) and the ending point (\`to\`) of the raycast are the same, leading to a ray of zero length which Defold's physics engine cannot process. For a simple raycast to work (assuming a 2D game with an orthographic camera setup), you need to ensure the ray has some length along the axis you're interested in examining. In a 2D game, often you're interested in casting the ray along the Z-axis since your X and Y coordinates represent your screen space translating to world space. Let's adjust the example to ensure there's some separation along the Z-axis. Typically, you would cast the ray along the Z-axis or any other meaningful direction that ensures it intersects with your game objects in the scene. Assuming a 2D setup, we'll cast the ray along the Z-axis from a near point to a far point relative to the camera's perspective: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Acquire input focus end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Define a start and end point for the ray along the Z-axis. -- Here, we assume an orthographic view and cast the ray from a point -- in front of everything (-1000) to a point behind everything (1000), but along the XY plane of the click. local from = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, -1000) local to = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, 1000) -- Perform the raycast local result = physics.raycast(from, to, {hash(\\"default\\")}) if result and result.id == go.get_id() then print(\\"Game object clicked.\\") end end end \`\`\` This code presumes a simple, direct setup where the Z-axis depth from \`-1000\` to \`1000\` comfortably encapsulates the depth range of your game scene. Such a setup should prevent the \\"Ray had 0 length\\" warning by ensuring a meaningful difference in depth between the \`from\` and \`to\` points of the raycast. Note, however, that the specific values for the Z-axis (\`-1000\` and \`1000\` here) might need adjustment based on your game's depth setup and how you've arranged your game objects in the world. This solution also assumes that your project's physics layers (collision groups) and input settings are correctly configured such that the game objects you wish to detect with the raycast have physics components (collision objects) assigned to them and are active in the correct collision group (\`\\"default\\"\` in the provided code)."},{"prompt":"WARNING:PHYSICS: Ray had 0 length when ray casting, ignoring request.","completion":"The warning message you received indicates that the physics engine detected a raycast request with a starting point (\`from\`) and an ending point (\`to\`) that are identical, resulting in a ray of zero length. This situation generally happens when the conversion between screen points to world points is not correctly handled, or when there's a misunderstanding in the setup of the ray's start and end points, especially in a 2D game context using an orthographic camera setup. Given that the core issue revolves around the transition from screen space to world space and ensuring the ray has a nonzero length, let's further simplify and correct our approach. Since providing a solution that accurately maps to your game setup without more context (like the camera used, game setup, etc.) is challenging, my previous responses might have missed target details pertinent to your scenario. To effectively address the issue and eliminate the \\"Ray had 0 length\\" warning, let's focus on ensuring there's a clear distinction between the \`from\` and \`to\` vectors in the Z-axis direction, as the Z-axis distinction is critical for a successful raycast in a 2D setup. However, without specific details on your camera setup or how you're managing world space coordinates, let's consider a basic principle that can help: When working in a 2D world (especially with an orthographic camera), ensure your \`from\` and \`to\` points extend along the Z-axis to cover the depth of the objects in your game world. This assumption is crucial for the ray to intersect with objects. # General Corrective Steps 1. **Verify Camera Setup**: Ensure your camera setup (whether it's a custom camera or a framework-specific solution) is correctly translating screen coordinates to world coordinates. This step is crucial because a misunderstanding or misconfiguration here can lead to the mentioned issue. 2. **Ensure Non-Zero Ray Length**: You must guarantee the ray has a non-zero length, particularly along the Z-axis, as Defold's physics engine reports an error for zero-length rays. # Simplified Raycast Example Below is a simplified example, assuming an orthographic projection where objects are placed within a certain range of the Z-axis: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Assuming an orthographic projection, extending the ray along the Z-axis local from = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, -1) -- Start just in front of the near plane local to = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, 1) -- End just behind the far plane -- Perform the raycast local result = physics.raycast(from, to, {hash(\\"default\\")}) if result and result.id == go.get_id() then print(\\"Game object clicked.\\") end end end \`\`\` # Note: - The example above presumes an orthographic projection where the game world is primarily on the XY plane, and objects have some presence along the Z-axis within the [-1, 1] range. - Make sure your game objects are properly configured with collision objects and are set to the correct collision group that matches the one specified in the \`raycast()\` call. If issues persist, it might be helpful to revisit your game's camera setup or how you're managing the conversion from screen to world coordinates, especially considering the Z-axis depth of your game objects."},{"prompt":"dont work","completion":"I apologize for the confusion earlier. Without a specific camera setup or knowing the exact dimensionality of your game (2D vs. 3D), it can be challenging to provide a precise solution. However, if you're facing issues with ray length or coordinate conversion, here's a new approach assuming you're working within a 2D game environment in Defold, and aiming to interact with objects through clicking or tapping without explicit screen-to-world coordinate conversions. # Basic Click Detection within a 2D Game If the previous solutions did not work and assuming a simpler scenario where you want to detect clicks/taps on objects within a 2D environment without worrying about depth (Z-axis), you can consider an alternative strategy. This involves using collision objects as sensors and detecting pointer inputs within their bounds, sidestepping the direct use of raycasting which can be problematic if the camera or world space conversions are not accurately handled. Here’s a simplified setup: 1. **Ensure your game object has a collision object:** This collision object should be set up as a trigger (sensor) with the correct collision group and mask settings. Place it around or as part of the game object you wish to be clickable. 2. **Use the input and collision messages:** Instead of calculating raycasts, listen for input and check if the collision object was hit by utilizing the \`action_id\` and \`action\` in the \`on_input\` function. \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Request input focus self.clickable = true -- State to control when the object can be clicked end function final(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") -- Clean up end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if self.clickable and action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Since raycasting isn't effectively working, this part is commented out -- Instead, rely on collision object setup as sensor -- Broadcast a message to check for collisions with the point msg.post(\\"#collisionobject\\", \\"trigger_response\\", {position = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, 0)}) end end -- Assuming you set up a collision object to send messages when triggered function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender) if message_id == hash(\\"contact_point_response\\") then -- Handle click based on the collision detected print(\\"Game object touched / clicked\\") end end \`\`\` # Important to Note: - This method requires your project to correctly handle messages sent by collision objects. You might need to tailor it to how your specific Defold project is set up, especially in how collision objects and their messages are managed. - The \`collisionobject\` component should be correctly set up to detect pointer interactions. This means ensuring it is marked as a sensor (trigger) and that it listens for the appropriate input actions. - Adjust the message handling (\`on_message\`) based on your exact project setup and how you've defined message protocols among game objects. This approach is a simplification and reorientation towards using collision detection for clickable areas in a 2D game, stepping away from the complications of raycasting and manual coordinate conversions that might not have aligned with your project setup."},{"prompt":"first 2d script. 12: Field other_id not specified in table","completion":"I see where the misunderstanding occurred. My intention was to outline an approach that involves using collision detection alongside input handling for a scenario where a direct raycast strategy wasn't suitable due to the complications or limitations experienced. However, based on your feedback, it seems the explanation ventured into an incorrect implementation by suggesting you send a \\"trigger_response\\" message to a collision object – this is not a standard message in Defold's physics or input handling system. Let's correct the course by providing a more standard approach to detecting clicks on objects in a 2D Defold game without using physics raycasts. This method relies on utilizing the collision object in Defold as a trigger zone and handling \\"touch\\" or \\"click\\" events through the input system correctly. To achieve this, ensure your game object has a collision object component attached and properly set up to act as a trigger. The collision object should be in a layer that interacts with a ray cast from the script, and ideally, you would use a physics ray cast. However, it seems we are avoiding this due to complexity or issues in implementation. Given your feedback, it appears my attempt to simplify might have led to confusion. Let’s not complicate with inaccurate methods but rather clarify the correct standard Defold way without introducing a misunderstood message handling. # Standard 2D Object Click Detection For a straightforward 2D object click detection without the previous complications: 1. **Ensure Your Game Object Has a Collision Object:** This should be in the \\"trigger\\" type group your script will listen for. 2. **Set Up Correct Mouse or Touch Input Handling:** Use the built-in \`on_input\` to handle this based on your game's configuration. Below is a basic example of handling touch/click on a game object with a collision object component: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Acquire input focus to receive inputs end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Prepare a physics ray cast to detect if we hit the collision object local from = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, -1) local to = vmath.vector3(action.x, action.y, 1) physics.raycast(from, to, {\\"default\\"}) -- Assuming the collision object is in \\"default\\" group end end function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender) if message_id == hash(\\"ray_cast_response\\") then if message.request_id == hash(\\"my_request_id\\") and message.group == hash(\\"default\\") then -- Assuming you might have multiple raycasts, you should use a request_id to differentiate if message.normal ~= vmath.vector3(0, 0, 0) then -- This condition checks if the ray actually hit something print(\\"Object clicked\\") end end end end \`\`\` # Key Notes: - This script assumes you have set up the input correctly to generate \`touch\` actions in your game.project file. - Your collision object should be correctly configured in the editor to interact with the ray (in the \\"default\\" group, as assumed by the \`physics.raycast\` call arguments). - The \`on_message\` function should handle the \`ray_cast_response\` to determine if the game object was clicked. The conditional check with \`message.normal\` serves as an example to verify a successful hit; in practical use, you'd tailor response handling as needed. - Remember to replace \`\\"my_request_id\\"\` and action groups as per your specific game setup. I hope this corrects the previous attempt and provides a clearer path forward.

Here are a few of these under-the-radar animated shows from the 2000s: 1. **\\"Pet Alien\\" (2005-2008)**: An animated series that centers on a boy named Tommy Cadle who lives with five aliens that crashed into his lighthouse. The show's humor and character dynamics aim at a younger audience, exploring themes of friendship and the clash between earthly life and alien behaviors. Its unique CGI animation style set it apart, but it didn't manage to secure a lasting legacy beyond its original run. 2. **\\"Yakkity Yak\\" (2002-2003)**: This Australian-Canadian co-production follows the life of Yakkity Yak, a high-spirited yak aspiring to become a famous comedian. The show is notable for its quirky characters, including Yakkity's best friends, Keo (a pineapple) and Lemony, a young human girl. Despite its imaginative setting and premise, \\"Yakkity Yak\\" struggled to achieve widespread popularity. 3. **\\"Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?\\" (2002-2003)**: Created by Greg Miller for Cartoon Network, this series is set in a retro-futuristic '80s universe and follows Robot Jones, a robot who tries to fit in with humans at his junior high school. The show is known for its initial use of computer-generated voices for Robot Jones and its unique art style. Despite its originality, it was short-lived and is often forgotten among the more celebrated Cartoon Network originals. 4. **\\"Kaput and Zösky\\" (2003)**: A French animated series focused on the comic misadventures of two space conquerors, Kaput and Zösky, who travel from planet to planet attempting to dominate and gain glory. The show's dark humor and anti-hero protagonists offered something different, but it didn't manage to capture a broad audience. 5. **\\"The X's\\" (2005-2006)**: A Nickelodeon show about a family of spies known as the X's, who struggle to balance their espionage activities with everyday family life. Despite its creative premise and potential for engaging storylines, \\"The X's\\" didn't find a strong foothold with viewers and was canceled after one season. These shows each brought something unique to the animation scene of the 2000s, whether through their art style, storytelling, or character design. Unfortunately, due to various reasons, including stiff competition, changes in network direction, or simply not resonating with larger audiences, they did not achieve significant long-term success or recognition. However, each is a testament to the experimental and diverse nature of animation during that era, meriting exploration by enthusiasts of the genre looking for hidden gems."},{"prompt":"It's pretty disheartening that some shows are so obscure (FE is half lost media btw)","completion":"It's indeed disheartening when innovative or unique animated shows become obscure or even partially lost to the vast sea of media content. The phenomenon of \\"lost media\\" – where certain pieces of art are no longer available for public consumption due to various reasons (being overshadowed by more popular content, limited distribution, rights issues, or simply not being circulated enough) – is not uncommon, especially in the world of animation. Shows like \\"Four Eyes!\\" becoming partially lost or obscure despite their creativity, reflects broader challenges in the media industry, including the prioritization of certain types of content over others, changes in viewership preferences, and the rapid pace of content production that makes it hard for each show to find and maintain its audience. For fans of these works, it often feels like a lost opportunity to experience and appreciate the diversity of storytelling and animation that existed during a particular era. However, there's a silver lining. The internet and various online communities have sparked a resurgence of interest in finding, preserving, and sharing lost or obscure media. Dedicated individuals and groups scour old archives, reach out to creators or industry professionals, and even launch campaigns to save and restore these forgotten gems. Additionally, the rise of streaming platforms offers new opportunities for lost or obscure shows to find a second life and reach new, appreciative audiences. While it's heartbreaking to see some animated shows fade into obscurity, or even become partially lost, the collective efforts of fans, archivists, and certain companies to preserve and resurrect these works show a promising path toward ensuring that these unique pieces of animation history are not forgotten. For creators and fans alike, this effort to recover and celebrate lesser-known works reinforces the value of all creative output, reminding us that every story has its audience, no matter how niche or obscure it may seem."},{"prompt":"привет что значит эта ошибка?

The following is an excerpt from an article in the New York Times. Every day around the world, an estimated three billion people go to work and 2.9 billion of them avoid making small talk with their co-workers once they get there. Their avoidance strategies vary. Some will keep their headphones in and their eyes low. Others will pantomime receiving an urgent message that requires an immediate, brow-furrowing, life-or-death rapid response, which incapacitates them from doing pretty much anything else, not excluding riding in, or communally waiting for, an elevator in their office building; making conversation while heating up lunch lasagna in the office microwave; walking from the entrance of their office building to the nearest public transit stop, or to literally anywhere, unless wait, you’re also going there? Because I actually meant to pop in this fine Persian rug wholesaler. See you tomorrow! If these strategies sound familiar, if you’ve convinced yourself that avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the risk of saying something “dumb” or offensive or coming across as socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes, even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare you or anything. Jamie Terran, a licensed career coach in New York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. “Rapport is the feeling that allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because it makes it easy for you to remember we’re only human. Right or wrong, building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.” Building rapport applies when you’re interviewing, too. People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who’s perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression. But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This is 2019 and we’re all anxious about something, including a 15-second chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about not making small talk with your co-workers. See? Easy switch. Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make us feel bad about ourselves, like we’re true failures at life for not being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a login. Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling. Remember: You’re More Likable Than You Think A 2018 study published in Psychological Science showed that people “systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.” Think about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a co-worker (it’s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think, “Wow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist”? No. You go back to your desk and think, “Wow, I’m a rotten garbage human being who should be shunned from society.” And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or herself . . . A Little Planning Goes a Long Way If you’re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human, Ms. Terran suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can pull. “Whether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best strategy,” she said. “Topics relating to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to start.” From The New York Times. © 2019 The New York Times Company.

The following is excerpted from an article written by a leadership professional. When you attend a networking event, cocktail party, or meet someone for a business lunch, exchanging superficial small talk is par for the course. Sure, questions like What do you do? and Where do you live? are almost necessary to get some conversational momentum. But how many of us are willing to go deeper? How many of us can say we are adept at drawing someone into a meaningful conversation that may lead to mutual benefit? As science discovered, the exchange of the often-rare meaningful interaction in social or business settings can be the difference between happiness and unhappiness. Kiss the small talk goodbye, says science As published in Psychological Science, researchers found that the happiest participants in a study involving more than 20,000 recorded conversations had twice as many genuine and deep talks as the unhappiest participants. This confirms what most people know: Surface-level small talk does not build relationships. Behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested the theory by hosting a dinner party where small talk was literally banned. To set some parameters for good conversations, they provided big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters. Instead of decreasing freedom, “people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about,” state the authors. In turn, “everyone was happier.” Entrepreneurs and leaders of every persuasion have seized on the opportunity to socially engage with captivating questions posed at “Jefferson”-style dinners across the country. Try Jeffersonian dinners Jennifer McCrea, senior research fellow at the Hauser Institute for Civil Society at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, co-authored a book about Jeffersonian dinners called The Generosity Network. “We were kind of tired of traditional galas and standing cocktail parties where people were making small talk and then would get pitched to by an organization—and nothing would come out of them,” McCrea explains. “The genesis is that Thomas Jefferson himself apparently would do dinners like this at his home and bring in very important people.” Such events, whether attracting big wigs or neighbors, open up all kinds of possibilities for introverts. Barry Breaux, a Bay Area physician, hosts such gatherings with simple rules of engagement, including: ● No small talk once discussion starts; no side conversations. ● Confidentiality is a must—respect the privacy of personal stories and information that may be shared. ● If you disagree with something, attack ideas, not people.

Source D Holmes, Janet. “Doing Collegiality and Keeping Control at Work: Small Talk in Government Departments.” Small Talk, edited by Justine Coupland, Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group, 2000, pp. 32-61. The following is excerpted from a book of essays with varying perspectives on small talk with the support of analyses of interactional data in specific social settings. Paying attention to the face needs of others is a crucial component of ‘doing friendship’ (see Holmes 1995, Coates 1996). In the workplace, the equivalent activity can perhaps be described as ‘doing collegiality’. . . . ‘Doing collegiality’ involves, in particular, paying attention to the positive face needs of participants, and small talk is an obvious example of discourse which is oriented to the addressee’s positive face needs. Indeed, small talk might be considered a core example of positively polite talk. Like complimenting behaviour, it is designed to signal that the addressee’s wants, ‘or the actions/acquisitions/values resulting from them’ (Brown and Levinson 1987: 101) are appreciated and shared by the speaker. Small talk typically serves to establish, maintain or renew social relationships (Laver 1975, 1981). In the workplace the exchange of greetings, complaints about how busy life is, promises to get in touch for lunch, coffee and so on, are examples of small talk tokens that serve this positive politeness function. Extract 16 Context: Joan and Elizabeth pass in the corridor 1 E: hi Joan 2 J: hi how are you 3 E: oh busy busy busy 4 J: mm terrible isn’t it Extract 17 Context: Jon and May pass on the stairs 1 J: hello hello/haven’t seen you for a while 2 M: /hi 3 [M:] well I’ve been a bit busy 4 J: must have lunch sometime 5 M: yea good idea give me a ring ln these extracts, small talk enables these workmates to ‘do collegiality’. They indicate mutual good intentions as they construct, maintain, repair or extend their collegial relationships. Jon’s use of ‘sometime’ in his invitation is an indication of the largely symbolic status of the interchange, and this is ratified by May’s equally nonspecific suggestion that he ring her; no precise time or date is mentioned (cf. Wolfson et al. 1983 on invitations). Reference to how busy one is serves in the workplace as an ideal small talk token. lt indicates an orientation to the ‘proper’ goals of the workplace, while also providing an acceptable account of why social relationships receive less attention than might be expected of good colleagues: in other words ‘busyness’ is an acceptable excuse for perfunctory attention to interpersonal relationships at work. As mentioned above, positively polite small talk can also serve a valuable bridging function, a means of transition to the main business of a workplace interaction. Small talk warms people up socially, oils the interpersonal wheels and gets talk started on a positive note. . . . Talk about holidays and leisure activities provide a gentle introduction to work talk. In these extracts, small talk serves what Laver calls an initiatory function of ‘getting the interaction comfortably underway’ (1975: 221; see also Tannen 1994: 65). ’Reproduced from Small Talk, 1st Edition by Justine, Coupland, published by Routledge. © 2000, Taylor & Francis, ’Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Books UK.’ Source E Roberts, David. “Why Small Talk Is so Excruciating.” Vox, 28 Oct. 2017, www.vox.com/ 2015/7/7/8903123/small-talk. The following is excerpted from an article published by a digital media company. I hate small talk. Hate it. And when I say I hate it, what I really mean is I’m abysmal at it. Just a total failure. Here’s how I experience small talk. Say I find myself interacting with a sales clerk, meeting someone at a party or conference, bumping into a neighbor on the street, any situation that calls for chitchat. The minute the interaction begins, something inside me—I’d call it a “thought,” but it’s deeper than that, physical almost—wants to get out of it. My fight-or-flight instincts kick in. It’s like the somatic equivalent of white noise, louder and louder the longer the interaction goes on. It doesn’t take long before it’s deafening and I break it off, often in less-than-smooth ways. The weird thing is, it’s not that I have some general aversion to talking to people. I love talking to people! . . . And I don’t have generalized social anxiety. I’m perfectly comfortable in a group situation, or speaking before a crowd, both of which terrify many people. It’s not people in general, or social situations in general, but specifically one-on-one small talk that is the issue. The problem, of course, is that small talk precedes big talk in the normal course of human affairs. Most people feel the need to get comfortable with one another before they jump into the deep end of serious conversation or ongoing friendship. Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer. Also, research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier. Also, despite recent advances in technology, small talk remains an unavoidable part of many basic life tasks. So it would be nice to be better at small talk, or at least to understand why I’m so horrible at it. Let’s take a quick look at the research. Researchers realize that small talk is no small thing For all its ubiquity, small talk hasn’t come in for a ton of academic study. The first theoretical account is generally traced to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay “The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages.” He noted that a great deal of talk “does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas” but instead “serves to establish bonds of personal union.” Malinowski termed the exchange of such talk “phatic communion” (“phatic” from the Greek phatos, for “spoken”). It is speech as social bonding rather than communication. Vox.com, writer David Roberts, and Vox Media, Inc. Oct 28, 2017 Source F Warren, Sofia. Small Talk Vortex. 2017. Fine Art America, fineartamerica.com/featured/ small-talk-vortex-sofia-warren.html. The following is a cartoon that appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 2017. Sofia Warren/The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank","completion":"Small talk is a pervasive and multifaceted element of human interaction that garners mixed feelings from individuals across various contexts—from the workplace to social gatherings. Despite its seemingly trivial nature, the role of small talk in fostering interpersonal relationships, facilitating professional growth, and contributing to our overall well-being cannot be overlooked. Synthesizing insights from Source A (Mannering), Source B (Schwantes), and Source D (Holmes), this essay argues that small talk serves as a fundamental building block in both personal and professional realms, enhancing social cohesion and opening doors to deeper, more meaningful interactions. Source A (Mannering) highlights the instrumental role that small talk plays in the workplace, suggesting that engaging in casual conversations with colleagues can lead to tangible professional benefits. The article underscores how small talk builds rapport and trust among team members, which are crucial for a harmonious work environment and can significantly influence career progression opportunities, such as promotions (Mannering). This demonstrates that small talk, despite its casual nature, carries weight in professional settings by fostering a culture of camaraderie and mutual respect. Thus, embracing small talk can be seen not merely as a social nicety but as a strategic career move. Source B (Schwantes) expands on the notion of small talk by contrasting it with deeper, more meaningful conversations. While advocating for the value of engaging conversations, Schwantes acknowledges the role of small talk as the gateway to more significant interactions. The article draws on research to argue that meaningful interactions, which often begin with small talk, are correlated with greater happiness. Additionally, the concept of Jeffersonian dinners illustrates how structured conversations can lead to enriching experiences, suggesting that the transition from small talk to substantial discussions can yield mutual benefits in both personal and professional contexts (Schwantes). Thus, small talk is not merely a superficial exchange but a stepping stone to exploring topics of shared interest that can enhance relationships and emotional well-being. Source D (Holmes) provides a nuanced understanding of small talk within the workplace through the concept of 'doing collegiality,' highlighting how such exchanges serve to affirm positive social relationships among colleagues. Holmes’s analysis reveals that small talk conveys mutual goodwill and acknowledges shared challenges, thereby acting as a social lubricant that facilitates smoother interactions and teamwork (Holmes). This perspective reinforces the notion that small talk is an essential component of a functional work environment, promoting a sense of belonging and shared purpose among employees. In synthesizing these sources, it becomes evident that small talk plays a crucial role in our everyday lives by laying the groundwork for deeper connections and fostering a sense of community in both personal and professional settings. Small talk acts as a bridge to more significant conversations, enabling individuals to navigate social landscapes with greater ease and confidence. While the depth and complexity of human interactions extend far beyond the initial chit-chat, acknowledging the value of these preliminary exchanges is vital for developing meaningful connections and advancing personal and professional goals. Therefore, small talk should be recognized and embraced for its role in facilitating social cohesion, enhancing professional relationships, and contributing to our overall sense of well-being. By appreciating the subtleties and potential of small talk, individuals can harness its power to forge stronger connections and enrich their social and professional lives."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\"","completion":"\\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\""},{"prompt":"Can you write a pine script for tradingview that combines Twin Range Filter indicator and SALMA indicator?

Small talk can occur in face-to-face interactions as well as in phone calls, e-mails, and text messages. While many people might not think too much about small-talk exchanges, others consider them an important part of relationships. In fact, there is growing interest among scholars and journalists in small talk and the extent to which it is helpful or harmful in our personal and professional development. Carefully read the following six sources, including the introductory information for each source.

Source A Mannering, Lindsay. “The Awkward but Essential Art of Office Chitchat.” The New York Times, 17 Sept. 2019, www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/style/the-awkward-art-of-office-small-talk.html. The following is an excerpt from an article in the New York Times. Every day around the world, an estimated three billion people go to work and 2.9 billion of them avoid making small talk with their co-workers once they get there. Their avoidance strategies vary. Some will keep their headphones in and their eyes low. Others will pantomime receiving an urgent message that requires an immediate, brow-furrowing, life-or-death rapid response, which incapacitates them from doing pretty much anything else, not excluding riding in, or communally waiting for, an elevator in their office building; making conversation while heating up lunch lasagna in the office microwave; walking from the entrance of their office building to the nearest public transit stop, or to literally anywhere, unless wait, you’re also going there? Because I actually meant to pop in this fine Persian rug wholesaler. See you tomorrow! If these strategies sound familiar, if you’ve convinced yourself that avoiding small talk with co-workers is smart self-preservation, that the risk of saying something “dumb” or offensive or coming across as socially inept is not worth the reward of connecting with somebody (yes, even if that connection is a shared concern about it raining), then bad news: Your false logic could be costing you a promotion. Not to scare you or anything. Jamie Terran, a licensed career coach in New York City, said that small talk between colleagues and supervisors builds rapport, which in turn builds trust. “Rapport is the feeling that allows you to extend a deadline, or overlook smaller mistakes, because it makes it easy for you to remember we’re only human. Right or wrong, building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you’re in.” Building rapport applies when you’re interviewing, too. People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who’s perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression. But, how? Small talk, while small and just talk, is intimidating. This is 2019 and we’re all anxious about something, including a 15-second chat with Janet from accounting about how freaking cold the A/C is in the conference room. The good news is that you can just go ahead and repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about not making small talk with your co-workers. See? Easy switch. Because while small talk can be torture, the absence of it can also make us feel bad about ourselves, like we’re true failures at life for not being able to connect with a fellow member of the herd, worried deep down that we will be kicked out of society and left to rot alone on the plains, to pay for our own streaming services instead of sharing a login. Here are a few thoughts on how to avoid that feeling. Remember: You’re More Likable Than You Think A 2018 study published in Psychological Science showed that people “systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.” Think about it: when you have an awkward small talk interaction with a co-worker (it’s stunted, there were silences, neither of you could think of something to say) do you normally go back to your desk and think, “Wow, Alex is a terrible conversationalist”? No. You go back to your desk and think, “Wow, I’m a rotten garbage human being who should be shunned from society.” And Alex is thinking the same thing about him or herself . . . A Little Planning Goes a Long Way If you’re generally anxious in social situations, i.e. human, Ms. Terran suggested coming up with core questions or stories from which you can pull. “Whether or not you share personal information about yourself is up to you, but discussing things you truly care about is always the best strategy,” she said. “Topics relating to your professional field, for example, an article you saw or book you read, is a great place to start.” From The New York Times. © 2019 The New York Times Company.

The following is excerpted from an article written by a leadership professional. When you attend a networking event, cocktail party, or meet someone for a business lunch, exchanging superficial small talk is par for the course. Sure, questions like What do you do? and Where do you live? are almost necessary to get some conversational momentum. But how many of us are willing to go deeper? How many of us can say we are adept at drawing someone into a meaningful conversation that may lead to mutual benefit? As science discovered, the exchange of the often-rare meaningful interaction in social or business settings can be the difference between happiness and unhappiness. Kiss the small talk goodbye, says science As published in Psychological Science, researchers found that the happiest participants in a study involving more than 20,000 recorded conversations had twice as many genuine and deep talks as the unhappiest participants. This confirms what most people know: Surface-level small talk does not build relationships. Behavioral scientists Kristen Berman and Dan Ariely tested the theory by hosting a dinner party where small talk was literally banned. To set some parameters for good conversations, they provided big index cards with examples of meaningful conversation starters. Instead of decreasing freedom, “people appeared freer to talk about the things they really wanted to talk about,” state the authors. In turn, “everyone was happier.” Entrepreneurs and leaders of every persuasion have seized on the opportunity to socially engage with captivating questions posed at “Jefferson”-style dinners across the country. Try Jeffersonian dinners Jennifer McCrea, senior research fellow at the Hauser Institute for Civil Society at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, co-authored a book about Jeffersonian dinners called The Generosity Network. “We were kind of tired of traditional galas and standing cocktail parties where people were making small talk and then would get pitched to by an organization—and nothing would come out of them,” McCrea explains. “The genesis is that Thomas Jefferson himself apparently would do dinners like this at his home and bring in very important people.” Such events, whether attracting big wigs or neighbors, open up all kinds of possibilities for introverts. Barry Breaux, a Bay Area physician, hosts such gatherings with simple rules of engagement, including: ● No small talk once discussion starts; no side conversations. ● Confidentiality is a must—respect the privacy of personal stories and information that may be shared. ● If you disagree with something, attack ideas, not people.

The following is excerpted from a book of essays with varying perspectives on small talk with the support of analyses of interactional data in specific social settings. Paying attention to the face needs of others is a crucial component of ‘doing friendship’ (see Holmes 1995, Coates 1996). In the workplace, the equivalent activity can perhaps be described as ‘doing collegiality’. . . . ‘Doing collegiality’ involves, in particular, paying attention to the positive face needs of participants, and small talk is an obvious example of discourse which is oriented to the addressee’s positive face needs. Indeed, small talk might be considered a core example of positively polite talk. Like complimenting behaviour, it is designed to signal that the addressee’s wants, ‘or the actions/acquisitions/values resulting from them’ (Brown and Levinson 1987: 101) are appreciated and shared by the speaker. Small talk typically serves to establish, maintain or renew social relationships (Laver 1975, 1981). In the workplace the exchange of greetings, complaints about how busy life is, promises to get in touch for lunch, coffee and so on, are examples of small talk tokens that serve this positive politeness function. Extract 16 Context: Joan and Elizabeth pass in the corridor 1 E: hi Joan 2 J: hi how are you 3 E: oh busy busy busy 4 J: mm terrible isn’t it Extract 17 Context: Jon and May pass on the stairs 1 J: hello hello/haven’t seen you for a while 2 M: /hi 3 [M:] well I’ve been a bit busy 4 J: must have lunch sometime 5 M: yea good idea give me a ring ln these extracts, small talk enables these workmates to ‘do collegiality’. They indicate mutual good intentions as they construct, maintain, repair or extend their collegial relationships. Jon’s use of ‘sometime’ in his invitation is an indication of the largely symbolic status of the interchange, and this is ratified by May’s equally nonspecific suggestion that he ring her; no precise time or date is mentioned (cf. Wolfson et al. 1983 on invitations). Reference to how busy one is serves in the workplace as an ideal small talk token. lt indicates an orientation to the ‘proper’ goals of the workplace, while also providing an acceptable account of why social relationships receive less attention than might be expected of good colleagues: in other words ‘busyness’ is an acceptable excuse for perfunctory attention to interpersonal relationships at work. As mentioned above, positively polite small talk can also serve a valuable bridging function, a means of transition to the main business of a workplace interaction. Small talk warms people up socially, oils the interpersonal wheels and gets talk started on a positive note. . . . Talk about holidays and leisure activities provide a gentle introduction to work talk. In these extracts, small talk serves what Laver calls an initiatory function of ‘getting the interaction comfortably underway’ (1975: 221; see also Tannen 1994: 65). ’Reproduced from Small Talk, 1st Edition by Justine, Coupland, published by Routledge. © 2000, Taylor & Francis, ’Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Books UK.’ Source E Roberts, David. “Why Small Talk Is so Excruciating.” Vox, 28 Oct. 2017, www.vox.com/ 2015/7/7/8903123/small-talk. The following is excerpted from an article published by a digital media company. I hate small talk. Hate it. And when I say I hate it, what I really mean is I’m abysmal at it. Just a total failure. Here’s how I experience small talk. Say I find myself interacting with a sales clerk, meeting someone at a party or conference, bumping into a neighbor on the street, any situation that calls for chitchat. The minute the interaction begins, something inside me—I’d call it a “thought,” but it’s deeper than that, physical almost—wants to get out of it. My fight-or-flight instincts kick in. It’s like the somatic equivalent of white noise, louder and louder the longer the interaction goes on. It doesn’t take long before it’s deafening and I break it off, often in less-than-smooth ways. The weird thing is, it’s not that I have some general aversion to talking to people. I love talking to people! . . . And I don’t have generalized social anxiety. I’m perfectly comfortable in a group situation, or speaking before a crowd, both of which terrify many people. It’s not people in general, or social situations in general, but specifically one-on-one small talk that is the issue. The problem, of course, is that small talk precedes big talk in the normal course of human affairs. Most people feel the need to get comfortable with one another before they jump into the deep end of serious conversation or ongoing friendship. Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer. Also, research shows that more frequent small talk, even among those who identify as introverts, makes people happier. Also, despite recent advances in technology, small talk remains an unavoidable part of many basic life tasks. So it would be nice to be better at small talk, or at least to understand why I’m so horrible at it. Let’s take a quick look at the research. Researchers realize that small talk is no small thing For all its ubiquity, small talk hasn’t come in for a ton of academic study. The first theoretical account is generally traced to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay “The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages.” He noted that a great deal of talk “does not serve any purpose of communicating ideas” but instead “serves to establish bonds of personal union.” Malinowski termed the exchange of such talk “phatic communion” (“phatic” from the Greek phatos, for “spoken”). It is speech as social bonding rather than communication. Vox.com, writer David Roberts, and Vox Media, Inc. Oct 28, 2017 Source F Warren, Sofia. Small Talk Vortex. 2017. Fine Art America, fineartamerica.com/featured/ small-talk-vortex-sofia-warren.html. The following is a cartoon that appeared in the New Yorker magazine in 2017. Sofia Warren/The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank","completion":"Small talk, often seen as a mundane and superficial form of communication, holds a pivotal role in shaping interpersonal connections and professional opportunities. Through synthesizing the arguments from Sources A, D, and E, this essay will argue for the essential role of small talk in everyday lives, highlighting its significance in building rapport, facilitating collegiality, and overcoming personal discomfort for larger social integration. Source A, by Mannering, shines a light on the underestimated value of small talk in professional settings. Mannering suggests that small talk is not merely trivial banter but a foundational element in building rapport among colleagues and superiors. This rapport, achieved through seemingly insignificant exchanges, is central to professional success, indirectly influencing career advancements such as promotions (Mannering). Through Mannering's insight, the reader can appreciate small talk as a strategic tool for navigation and advancement within the workplace, fostering an environment of mutual trust and understanding. This perspective encourages recognizing small talk not as a distraction but as an investment in one's professional relationships and growth. Expanding on the utility of small talk, Source D, by Holmes, delves into the concept of \\"doing collegiality.\\" According to Holmes, small talk serves as the lubricant for smooth interpersonal interactions within the workplace, and it is crucial for maintaining positive relationships. Holmes presents small talk as an activity that satisfies the positive face needs of individuals, helping to establish a sense of mutual regard and respect among colleagues (Holmes). This ensures a harmonious work environment where people feel connected and valued. Holmes's analysis underscores the role of small talk in creating and maintaining a supportive community at work, demonstrating its importance in not just professional but also social domains. Contrasting these views with Source E, where Roberts shares a personal disdain for small talk, we encounter a different yet enlightening perspective. Roberts's account of finding small talk excruciating and a trigger for fight-or-flight reactions illustrates the challenges some individuals face with this form of interaction. Despite the difficulties, Roberts acknowledges the necessity of engaging in small talk as a gateway to more substantial conversations and relationships (Roberts). This personal narrative elucidates the internal conflicts that accompany small talk for some, while simultaneously recognizing its indispensable role in forging connections. Synthesizing these sources, the importance of small talk emerges not only as a facilitator of professional relationships and a tool for career progression but also as a critical social skill that, despite its challenges, serves as a bridge to deeper interactions and understandings. The complexity of small talk, as highlighted in the sources, invites a nuanced view of its role in our lives. It urges an acknowledgment of its potential discomfort while advocating for its practice and appreciation as a fundamental aspect of human social interaction. In essence, small talk is a cornerstone of social and professional development, whose benefits far outweigh the perceived superficiality, making it an indispensable part of everyday life."},{"prompt":"median stone weight for c2 clearstone for filter layer breakwater","completion":"The median stone size, often specified as (D_{50}), for a filter layer in breakwater construction, including filter layers for C2 clearstone, depends on the design criteria of the specific breakwater project. The (D_{50}) value represents the median diameter of the stone, where 50% of the material by weight is smaller and 50% is larger. It is a crucial parameter in ensuring the stability and permeability of the structure, especially in the context of withstanding wave action and preventing the erosion of finer materials from behind or beneath the breakwater. For a C2 clearstone or any specific aggregate used in breakwaters, the (D_{50}) or median stone size is usually determined by engineering analysis, considering: 1. **Wave conditions**: The intensity and height of waves the breakwater needs to withstand. 2. **Underlying soil characteristics**: The properties of the seabed or foundation soil can influence the choice of stone size. 3. **Permeability requirements**: Ensuring that the filter layer allows for adequate water drainage to reduce hydrostatic pressure and prevent undermining. 4. **Compatibility with other layers**: The size should be compatible with adjacent layers to prevent the washing away of finer materials and ensure the stability of the structure. In general, median stone sizes for breakwater filter layers can vary widely. For C2 clearstone and similar materials, median sizes might commonly range from 100 mm to 500 mm (about 4 to 20 inches) depending on the specific engineering requirements. However, these values can significantly differ based on the factors mentioned above. For accurate values, referring to the project's specific design documents or standards recommended by institutions such as the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Coastal Engineering Manual, or relevant local engineering regulations is necessary. Consulting with a coastal or civil engineer is also advisable to obtain recommendations tailored to the particular needs of a project."},{"prompt":"weight not diameter","completion":"When discussing the median stone weight rather than the median stone size (diameter), for specific applications like a C2 clearstone filter layer in breakwater construction, it's important to understand that the industry often defaults to size specifications because of the direct relationship between stone size and its functionality in engineering applications. Stone weight directly correlates with its size, but specifications and designs are often expressed in terms of diameter or size classifications. However, if the focus is on the median weight of the stones for such applications, there isn't a straightforward, universally applicable answer, given the variability in density among types of stone. For instance, granite, limestone, and basalt will have different weights for the same volume due to their differing densities. To provide a touch of perspective, let's use a rough calculation for an approximation. Assume we're discussing granite, which has an average density of about 2.75 g/cm³ (grams per cubic centimeter). 1. Firstly, we note a common diameter range for filter layer stones might be from 100 to 500 mm. To discuss the weight, we assume a median size within a common range — say, a 300 mm diameter stone (noting that in practice, design specifications focus on ranges rather than specific sizes). 2. The volume of a spherical stone with a diameter of 300 mm (0.3 m) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere: [ V = frac{4}{3} pi r^3 ] Given (r = 0.15 m), [ V = frac{4}{3} pi (0.15 m)^3 approx 0.0141 m^3 ] 3. With granite's density at roughly 2.75 g/cm³ (or 2750 kg/m³ to work with our volume in cubic meters), the weight (mass, more accurately) of such a stone would be around: [ M = V times text{density} = 0.0141 m^3 times 2750 kg/m^3 = 38.775 kg ] This provides a generic sense of the weight for a singular median-sized stone in such applications. Of course, in practical engineering specifications and calculations, a range of sizes (and thus weights) will be considered to ensure appropriate grading and functionality of the filter layer. The specific stone material's density is crucial for calculating actual weights. It's also important to underline that the real-world application involves a distribution of stone sizes (and thus a distribution of weights), with the (D_{50}) value representing the median size around which this distribution centers. The actual design will require detailed engineering analysis, including considerations of material availability, cost, and the specific engineering properties needed for the breakwater's successful performance. For precise weight specifications for a project, consultation with a civil or coastal engineer and adherence to relevant construction standards and guidelines is necessary."},{"prompt":"round to nearest 0.5 tonne","completion":"Based on the previous calculation, we found the weight of a granite stone with a diameter of 300 mm (or a median size stone for such applications) to be approximately 38.775 kg. To round this to the nearest 0.5 tonne, we first convert the weight into tonnes. There are 1,000 kilograms in a tonne, so: [ 38.775 , text{kg} = 0.038775 , text{tonnes} ] When rounding to the nearest 0.5 tonne, the closest values would be 0 tonnes or 0.5 tonnes. Since 0.038775 tonnes is closer to 0 than to 0.5, it would be rounded to: [ 0 , text{tonnes} ] However, this calculation demonstrates the weight of an individual stone, which might have led to confusion regarding the scale or the nature of your question. If you're considering aggregate or larger quantities of material typically used in construction like a breakwater filter layer, then the context would shift to discussing tonnes of material, not individual stones. For practical applications such as ordering clearstone for a filter layer, construction engineers and project managers will think in terms of cubic meters of material or tonnes as a bulk order, not individual stone weight. The grading and specification sheets will provide guidance on the appropriate size (diameter) and weight ranges for the stones in aggregate form to meet the project's needs. For any significant construction or landscaping project requiring clearstone or similar materials, the material will indeed be considered and purchased by the tonne or cubic meter, with the understanding that a range of stone sizes will be necessary to meet engineering specifications for permeability, stability, and durability."},{"prompt":"привет у меня такая ошибка InvalidCastException: Specified cast is not valid.

You must correctly handle input, map the click position from screen coordinates to world coordinates (adjusting for different resolutions), and then check if the click intersects with a collision object. Here's a simple example demonstrating how this can be achieved: First, ensure your project is set up to handle input. Open your game.project file and make sure you have a game.input_bindings file linked under the input section. In the input file, add a mouse trigger for the \\"touch\\" or \\"click\\" action. Here’s how you can do this graphically in Defold: 1. Open \`game.input_binding\` in Defold. 2. Under “mouse,” add an input with the action name (e.g., “click”) and select “MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT” as key with “Pressed” as the modifier. Next, setting up a script to handle click actions on a game object with a collision component: 1. **Create a Script**: Attach a script component to the game object that you want to be clickable. 2. **Implement Resolution-Independent Click Detection**: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Make sure the game object listens for inputs self.screen_width = tonumber(sys.get_config(\\"display.width\\")) -- Get configured screen width self.screen_height = tonumber(sys.get_config(\\"display.height\\")) -- Get configured screen height end local function screen_to_world(screen_x, screen_y, screen_width, screen_height) -- Convert from screen to world coordinates, assuming your game uses a fixed projection setup local camera = camera.get_position() -- Assuming you have a script to get the current camera position local w = render.get_width() local h = render.get_height() local world_x = (screen_x / screen_width) * w + camera.x local world_y = (screen_y / screen_height) * h + camera.y return world_x, world_y end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"click\\") and action.pressed then local world_x, world_y = screen_to_world(action.x, action.y, self.screen_width, self.screen_height) local result = physics.raycast(world_x, world_y, world_x, world_y + 1) -- Simple vertical raycast if result ~= nil then for _, hit in pairs(result) do if hit.id == go.get_id() then -- Check if we hit our game object print(\\"Clicked on game object!\\") -- Handle click logic here break end end end end end function final(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") -- Cleanup end \`\`\` A few key points to understand in this code: - \`screen_to_world\` function converts screen coordinates to world coordinates. You need to ensure this conversion correctly maps to your game's camera setup. This example assumes a basic transformation that might need adjustments based on your game's camera logic. - The \`on_input\` function listens for click actions, converts the click position, and performs a raycast in the world to detect collisions. You might need to adjust the raycast direction and length based on your game's needs. - \`physics.raycast\` is a simple way to detect if a click intercepts any physics objects. Adjust the raycast to match your game object's specifics. This example makes several assumptions about your project setup (e.g., camera handling, project configuration). You'll need to adapt the details to fit your game's specific requirements, such as how you've set up your camera and rendering scripts."},{"prompt":"are you sure it's runtime resolution independent?","completion":"The approach provided in the initial example aims to be resolution independent by dynamically using the screen's configured width and height to adjust the click's screen coordinates to world coordinates. However, to ensure true runtime resolution independence – especially as resolutions can change dynamically in some environments or setups – further adjustments might be necessary to adapt to any resolution changes that can occur after the game has started, and to handle different aspect ratios gracefully. For a more robust solution, consider these additional strategies: # 1. Dynamically Handling Resolution Changes: You can listen for window resize events and update your screen width and height variables accordingly. Defold doesn't directly send events for window resizes, but you can detect changes in resolution by comparing the current width and height with the previous ones during each frame in the \`update\` function. When a change is detected, update your variables and any necessary logic to adjust to the new resolution. # 2. Adjusting for Aspect Ratios: Handling different aspect ratios without stretching or squishing requires some consideration in how you present your game's world. You might need to adjust the camera setup to ensure that the game scales correctly and maintains its aspect ratio across different resolutions. # 3. Updated Example with Aspect Ratio Consideration: A detailed implementation covering every aspect of aspect ratio management and dynamic resolution changes would be comprehensive. Still, here's an adjusted focus on making the transformation from screen to world coordinates more flexible: \`\`\`lua local function update_screen_to_world_factors(self) local current_width = render.get_window_width() local current_height = render.get_window_height() local camera = camera.get_position() -- Ensure you have a mechanism to fetch current camera position self.scale_x = (camera.width / current_width) self.scale_y = (camera.height / current_height) end function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Initialization for your screen width and height variables update_screen_to_world_factors(self) end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"click\\") and action.pressed then -- Make sure variables are updated in case window size changes update_screen_to_world_factors(self) local world_x = action.x * self.scale_x local world_y = action.y * self.scale_y -- Use world_x and world_y for your raycast logic end end function update(self, dt) -- Consider detecting resolution change here if necessary end function final(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") end \`\`\` In this revised example, \`update_screen_to_world_factors\` function is introduced to dynamically adjust the mapping from screen to world coordinates based on the current window size and the camera’s visible area (\`camera.width\` and \`camera.height\` must be set based on your game’s camera logic). This helps maintain consistency in how clicks are interpreted in the game world, regardless of the display resolution. # Conclusion: To ensure your game is truly resolution independent, especially during runtime, it’s important to dynamically adjust to resolution changes and consider aspect ratios in your game world presentation. The strategies and code samples here serve as a foundation, which you need to adapt based on your specific game setup, camera configuration, and how you handle different aspect ratios in your game world."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a kids coloring pages within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","completion":"\\"Enchanted Blossom | Ultra-Realistic Fashion-Inspired Coloring Pages for Kids | Woman with Voluminous Sleeves & Flower Bouquet\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Enchanted Blossom | Ultra-Realistic Fashion-Inspired Coloring Pages for Kids | Woman with Voluminous Sleeves &amp; Flower Bouquet.

In a resolution-independent application, it's vital to ensure that clickable game objects react appropriately to user interactions regardless of the screen size or resolution. Below is a basic example of how to implement click detection on a game object using collision detection. This example takes into consideration making the detection resolution-independent, which involves adjusting the input coordinates based on the current viewport and screen resolution. # Pre-requisites - A Defold project with at least one game object that you want to be clickable. - A collision object attached to the game object. This collision object is what will be used to detect clicks. - A script attached to the same game object to handle the click detection logic. # 1. Adjusting Input for Resolution Independence You first need to correctly map the screen's touch or click coordinates to the game world, considering different resolutions and aspect ratios. Add this function to a Lua module (e.g., \`input_helper.lua\`) or directly in your script: \`\`\`lua -- input_helper.lua local M = {} function M.adjust_touch(touch, screen_width, screen_height) -- Assuming the game is set up to use a fixed aspect ratio with letterboxing -- Adjust touch coordinates based on actual screen size vs. expected design resolution local design_width = 1280 -- Change this to your design resolution width local design_height = 720 -- Change this to your design resolution height local scale_factor = math.min(screen_width / design_width, screen_height / design_height) local adjusted_x = (touch.x - (screen_width - (design_width * scale_factor)) * 0.5) / scale_factor local adjusted_y = (touch.y - (screen_height - (design_height * scale_factor)) * 0.5) / scale_factor return vmath.vector3(adjusted_x, adjusted_y, 0) end return M \`\`\` This function takes the touch or click position and adjusts it according to the game's designed resolution and the actual screen size, returning a vector3 with the adjusted position. # 2. Handling the Click Detection In the script attached to your clickable game object, you will check if the adjusted touch position intersects with the game object's collision shape upon touch or click. First, ensure your game object has a collision component set to \\"trigger\\" mode (otherwise, it will physically interact with other objects). Then, add this script to your clickable game object: \`\`\`lua local input_helper = require \\"input_helper\\" -- Adjust the path according to your project structure function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- Make sure the object listens for input end function final(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"release_input_focus\\") -- Clean up end function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"touch\\") and action.pressed then -- Assuming \\"touch\\" is your input action for clicks/taps. local adjusted_touch = input_helper.adjust_touch(action, sys.get_config(\\"display.width\\"), sys.get_config(\\"display.height\\")) if physics.raycast(adjusted_touch, adjusted_touch) then local hit_results = physics.raycast(adjusted_touch, adjusted_touch) for i, result in ipairs(hit_results) do if result.id == go.get_id() then print(\\"Clicked on object!\\") -- Implement your click logic here break end end end end end \`\`\` # Note - This example uses a raycast at the touch position to detect collisions. This works well for simple cases and assumes your clickable objects aren't overlapping too much. For more complex shapes or situations, you may need a more sophisticated approach. - Ensure your \`game.project\` file has an appropriate input binding set up for \`\\"touch\\"\`. - Adapt the logic inside \`on_input\` as needed for your game, such as handling other types of gameplay input or performing different actions when a collision is detected. # Conclusion This basic setup demonstrates how to handle resolution-independent touch or click detection in Defold. Adjust and extend these code snippets based on your specific game design and requirements. Remember, Defold is a versatile engine, and there are often multiple ways to achieve your goals."},{"prompt":"i have historical data of crypto currencies as csv files (340 file) i want to train a TCN model on my data whithout merging them give me proper python code","completion":"Training a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) using historical data from multiple files involves reading these files individually into a cohesive structure your model can understand, without actually merging the files. The TCN model can then be trained on this data. For this example, I'll assume your CSV files have a similar structure (e.g., columns for date, open, high, low, close, volume for each cryptocurrency), and you're interested in predicting future prices (or another similar task). Before starting, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, particularly TensorFlow (for building the TCN model) and pandas (for data manipulation). If you do not have these installed, you can do so by running: \`\`\`bash pip install tensorflow pandas \`\`\` Also, for the TCN model, we'll use the \`keras-tcn\` package for simplicity, which can also be installed via pip: \`\`\`bash pip install keras-tcn \`\`\` Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. **Import Libraries**: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense from tcn import TCN from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam import os \`\`\` 2. **Load and Preprocess Data**: I'll define a function to load data from individual CSVs, assuming they're all in a single directory, preprocess them (e.g., normalization), and prepare input-output pairs for training.

These cartoons, ranging from avant-garde experiments to hidden classics of the genre, offer diverse narratives, distinctive art styles, and unconventional storytelling that have either cultivated a niche following or have been overshadowed by more mainstream successes. Let's dive into a few of these lesser-known animated series and films that deserve a spotlight: # 1. **The Mysterious Cities of Gold (1982-1983)** Semi-obscure to some audiences but cherished by others, \\"The Mysterious Cities of Gold\\" is a French-Japanese animated series that combines history, adventure, and science fiction. Set in the 16th century, it follows a group of children searching for the legendary Cities of Gold in the New World. Its unique blend of real historical settings with fantasy and advanced ancient technology captivated viewers across the globe, yet it didn’t achieve the same level of lasting mainstream fame as other cartoons from its era. # 2. **The Secret of NIMH (1982)** While Don Bluth's \\"The Secret of NIMH\\" might not be considered obscure to animation enthusiasts, it remains a somewhat semi-obscure title in the wider public consciousness. This animated film, based on Robert C. O'Brien's novel \\"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH,\\" is celebrated for its dark storyline, rich animation, and complex characters — a significant departure from the more commonly known animated features of its time. # 3. **David the Gnome (1985-1987)** \\"David the Gnome\\" is a Spanish animated television series based on the children's books by the Dutch author Wil Huygen and illustrator Rien Poortvliet. The show, which follows the adventures of the titular gnome doctor as he helps woodland creatures, offers a gentle storytelling pace that resonated with audiences in various countries, though it remains relatively unknown to many. # 4. **Gargoyles (1994-1997)** \\"Gargoyles\\" stands as a semi-obscure series primarily because, despite its critical acclaim and dedicated fanbase, it never quite reached the same commercial heights as other animated series from the 90s. Its dark tone, complex story arcs, and Shakespearean influences set it apart from much of its contemporaries and have earned it a respected place among animation aficionados. # 5. **Over the Garden Wall (2014)** As a mini-series, \\"Over the Garden Wall\\" mixes Americana folklore, fairy tales, and surreal elements, creating a hauntingly beautiful and unique narrative. Despite winning an Emmy and receiving critical acclaim, it remains a semi-obscure gem cherished by those who stumble upon it. # 6. **Fantastic Planet (La Planète Sauvage, 1973)** This Franco-Czech animated science fiction film is a cult classic that has flown under the radar for many. Directed by René Laloux and featuring surreal, distinctive art by Roland Topor, \\"Fantastic Planet\\" tells the story of humans living on a strange planet dominated by giant humanoid aliens. It's renowned for its peculiar and thought-provoking storytelling, as well as its psychedelic animation style. These titles represent just a tiny fraction of the vast, unexplored world of obscure and semi-obscure cartoons and animated films. Each one, with its unique flavor and storytelling, contributes valuable diversity to the landscape of animation and is worthy of exploration by anyone looking to discover something beyond mainstream offerings."},{"prompt":"How obscure is say, something like Wow Wow Wubbzy","completion":"\\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" sits in an interesting position on the spectrum between mainstream popularity and obscurity. Premiering in 2006 and running until 2010, this animated children's series aired on Nick Jr., a platform known for its broad reach among preschool audiences in the United States and internationally. The show follows the adventures of Wubbzy and his friends Widget and Walden in the whimsical town of Wuzzleburg, focusing on themes of friendship, problem-solving, and curiosity. # Factors Contributing to Its Semi-Obscurity: 1. **Target Demographic:** As a show designed for preschoolers, its primary audience outgrows it quickly, which can lead to it fading from public consciousness faster than content aimed at a broader age range. 2. **Changing Media Landscape:** The late 2000s saw significant shifts in how children's content was distributed and consumed, with the rise of streaming services and on-demand viewing. Programs that didn't pivot to these new platforms as prominently might not have maintained widespread visibility. 3. **Competition:** The era in which \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" aired was rich with children's programming, both on cable channels like Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and PBS Kids, and emerging online platforms. Such competition can make it harder for any single show to dominate the cultural conversation. 4. **Cultural Impact:** While \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" enjoyed popularity and even spawned merchandise, live shows, and a following, it may not have had the broad cultural impact or the enduring legacy of some of its contemporaries, making it less prominent in discussions about iconic children’s shows from the late 2000s. # Continuing Presence: Despite these factors, \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" maintains a presence and fondness among those who grew up watching it or shared it with children during its original run and in reruns. Its vivid animation style, memorable characters, and catchy theme song (sung by Beyoncé for the movie \\"Wubb Idol\\") contribute to its lingering appeal. Additionally, nostalgia for 2000s children’s programming and the ease of sharing and accessing older content online have helped keep it somewhat alive in public memory. In summary, while not entirely obscure, \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" might not possess the mainstream recognition of some other children's shows from its era but holds a semi-obscure status with a specific nostalgic appeal to those who remember it fondly."},{"prompt":"How obscure are things like Will and Dewitt, Monster Allergy and Horrid Henry","completion":"\\"Will and Dewitt,\\" \\"Monster Allergy,\\" and \\"Horrid Henry\\" each occupy their unique positions on the spectrum between mainstream and obscure within the world of children's television and animated series. Their recognizability and popularity can vary significantly depending on factors like geographical location, target demographic, and availability on broadcasting platforms. Let's delve into each one: # Will and Dewitt \\"Will and Dewitt\\" is a Canadian-American animated children's series that first aired in 2007. The show focuses on a young boy named Will and his talking frog friend Dewitt as they tackle various challenges and adventures. Given its specific target demographic (younger children) and the fact that it didn’t have as many episodes or as wide a distribution as some other shows, \\"Will and Dewitt\\" is relatively obscure. It is fondly remembered by those who watched it during its original run, but it doesn't have a broad or enduring presence in popular culture. # Monster Allergy \\"Monster Allergy\\" is an Italian animated series that debuted in 2006, based on the comic book series of the same name. The show, which revolves around a boy named Zick who can see and interact with monsters, enjoyed popularity in several countries, notably Italy and parts of Europe. It was also distributed in the United States and other regions. Its specific appeal to fans of the fantasy and adventure genres and its roots in a comic series lend it a bit more visibility, particularly among those interested in international animation. However, despite its success and the fact that it spans multiple seasons, \\"Monster Allergy\\" can still be considered semi-obscure, especially outside of its primary fanbase or regions where it was most heavily promoted. # Horrid Henry \\"Horrid Henry\\" is a British animated series based on the books by Francesca Simon. First airing in 2006, it has since become one of the longest-running children's series on ITV. The show's focus on the titular character, Henry, and his \\"horrid\\" antics have made it quite popular in the UK, with a significant cultural impact that includes a wide range of merchandise, stage shows, and a film. While \\"Horrid Henry\\" enjoys strong recognition in the UK and has been broadcast in over 90 countries, its specific brand of humor and focus on British suburban life may not have translated to universal popularity, making it less well-known or semi-obscure in regions outside of its core fanbase. In summary, while each of these series has achieved a degree of success and has dedicated fans, their visibility and lasting impact on the broader cultural landscape vary. Factors like regional popularity, the platform and distribution reach, and the target audience's age play substantial roles in determining their obscurity level. \\"Monster Allergy\\" and \\"Horrid Henry\\" might be slightly more well-known due to their broader international distribution and longer run, respectively, but \\"Will and Dewitt\\" remains more obscure, particularly outside of North America."},{"prompt":"There's also this Porchlight/France 3 cartoon from 2005/2006 called Four Eyes!, The series centers around a misanthropic alien girl called Emma, who is sent to earth by her parents to repeat the fifth grade.

The premise of \\"Four Eyes!\\" revolves around Emma, a young alien girl deemed misanthropic, who is sent to Earth as a form of re-education, specifically tasked with repeating the fifth grade among human children. This setup offers a unique twist on the fish-out-of-water storyline, blending elements of science fiction with the trials and tribulations typical of school life that many children's series explore. The theme of an extraterrestrial character trying to navigate the complexities of human social structures, school dynamics, and childhood challenges presents fertile ground for both humor and heartfelt moments. However, despite its intriguing premise, \\"Four Eyes!\\" did not achieve widespread recognition or break into the mainstream in the way some other children’s series have. Several factors contribute to the obscurity of shows like \\"Four Eyes!\\": 1. **Distribution and Accessibility:** Limited international distribution and fewer broadcasting slots can make it difficult for a show to reach a wide audience. If \\"Four Eyes!\\" was not widely available outside of its original French broadcast and a select few international markets, many potential viewers may not have had the opportunity to watch it. 2. **Marketing and Merchandising:** Strong marketing campaigns and associated merchandise can play big roles in a show's popularity. Without significant promotional efforts or products to increase its visibility, a series might struggle to gain traction. 3. **Competitive Landscape:** The mid-2000s were a prolific time for children's television, with numerous new series debuting across different networks. \\"Four Eyes!\\" was competing for attention amidst a crowded field of content, making it hard for any single show to stand out. 4. **Cultural Resonance:** Some shows resonate more broadly due to their themes, humor, or characters. For various reasons, including cultural specifics and the relatability of characters, not every series manages to strike a chord with a broad audience. Given these factors, \\"Four Eyes!\\" exists as a fascinating piece of early 2000s children's programming history, remembered by a select group of fans and enthusiasts who either encountered it during its original run or have since discovered it while exploring the more obscure corners of animated television. Its obscurity, however, also makes it a prime candidate for rediscovery and appreciation by new audiences seeking unique and unconventional animated series that flew under the radar."},{"prompt":"It aired on CITV for a brief period in 2008/2009, I consider it to be THE most obscure toon of all time","completion":"Your reference to \\"Four Eyes!\\" having aired on CITV (Children's ITV) in the UK during 2008/2009 provides valuable context that contributes to understanding its international reach and also hints at why it might hold a special place in the annals of obscure animated series. Given CITV's role as a significant platform for children's programming in the UK, the inclusion of \\"Four Eyes!\\" in its lineup suggests there was an attempt to broaden the show's audience beyond its initial French and potentially North American (through associations with Porchlight Entertainment) viewership. Considering such factors, the obscurity of \\"Four Eyes!\\" could be attributed to several elements: 1. **Brief Broadcast Period:** A short airing window on CITV, coupled with potentially limited promotion, would restrict its visibility even within a normally receptive audience. 2. **Competitive Timing:** The late 2000s were a particularly vibrant era for children's television, with numerous new shows launching and established ones dominating the space. \\"Four Eyes!\\" had to compete not only for screen time but for the affection of audiences amidst a surge of content. 3. **Niche Appeal:** The unique premise of \\"Four Eyes!\\"—focusing on a misanthropic alien girl integrating into a human school—while distinctive, might not have broadly resonated, limiting its appeal to a wider audience. 4. **Digital Presence and Availability:** For many modern shows, longevity and resurgence in popularity can stem from availability on digital platforms. If \\"Four Eyes!\\" didn't secure a spot on popular streaming services or digital purchase platforms post-broadcast, it would contribute to its obscurity. Amid discussions on animated series obscurity, \\"Four Eyes!\\" exemplifies how a combination of broadcasting strategy, competitive environment, and digital footprint can influence a show's legacy. While it may be considered amongst the most obscure, especially to those who remember its brief stint on CITV, its status also makes it a prime subject for rediscovery by enthusiasts of animation history and obscure media. For individuals and communities passionate about unearthing and celebrating lesser-known works, \\"Four Eyes!\\" represents a intriguing piece of the expansive, diverse world of animated storytelling."},{"prompt":"So we've gone down the obscurity meter, from semi popular (Monster Allergy), semi obscure (Wubbzy), mainly obscure (Will & Dewitt) and forgotten","completion":"Navigating through the obscurity meter from semi-popular to forgotten titles offers a fascinating look at the vast spectrum of animated series and their impacts on audiences. The journey from shows like \\"Monster Allergy,\\" which holds a place of prominence in certain regions or among specific fan bases, down to \\"Four Eyes!,\\" largely considered forgotten or the most obscure, underscores the diverse nature of animation and its reception across different cultures and age groups. Let's briefly recap this exploration across the spectrum: # Semi-Popular: Monster Allergy \\"Monster Allergy\\" enjoys a level of popularity, especially in Italy and among fans of the original comic book series. Its unique storyline and appealing animation have garnered a dedicated following, making it semi-popular and well-remembered among certain circles. # Semi-Obscure: Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! \\"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\\" represents a level of obscurity where a show was once somewhat well-known (especially to its target demographic at the time of airing) but hasn't maintained a strong presence in the broader cultural consciousness, placing it in the semi-obscure category. # Mainly Obscure: Will & Dewitt \\"Will & Dewitt\\" falls into the category of being mainly obscure, recognized by a smaller group of enthusiasts or individuals who remember it from their childhood. Its limited distribution and the highly competitive nature of children's programming contribute to its obscurity. # Forgotten: Four Eyes! \\"Four Eyes!\\" represents the deepest level of obscurity in this exploration—the forgotten tier. Despite having a unique premise and airing in multiple countries, it didn't leave a lasting impact on the collective memory of its potential audience, making it a prime example of a show that has largely faded into obscurity. Each of these shows highlights the intricate tapestry of children's animation and the factors that influence their legacy—ranging from cultural resonance, distribution strategies, competitive environments, and shifts in media consumption habits. While some series continue to thrive or enjoy revivals through streaming services and nostalgic revisitations, others remain hidden gems waiting to be rediscovered by new generations of viewers or dedicated fans of animation's vast and varied history. This journey through the obscurity meter not only showcases the diversity of content that has been produced over the years but also illustrates how the lifespan of such shows is affected by myriad external and internal factors. It's a testament to the dynamic nature of the animation industry and the ever-changing tastes and interests of its audiences."},{"prompt":"Where would KikoRiki sit on the obscurity chart","completion":"\\"KikoRiki\\" (originally \\"Smeshariki\\" in Russian) is an animated series that presents an interesting case when considering its place on the obscurity chart. Originating from Russia and first aired in 2004, the series has garnered a significant viewership in its home country and among Russian-speaking audiences, making it fairly well-known within that context. The show features a cast of round, anthropomorphic animal characters, each with distinct personalities and stories that impart moral and practical lessons in a non-preachy, entertaining manner. # Considering KikoRiki's Place on the Obscurity Chart: 1. **In Russia and Post-Soviet States:** In its country of origin and neighboring regions, \\"KikoRiki\\" would be considered quite popular. It holds a place in popular culture comparable to other major animated series, thanks to its broad appeal across various age groups, insightful content, and significant merchandise and media presence (including spin-offs and films). 2. **Internationally:** Outside the Russian-speaking world, \\"KikoRiki\\" sits toward the more obscure end of the spectrum, particularly in markets dominated by Western animation. However, it's not entirely unknown. The series has been dubbed into multiple languages and aired in several countries, including the United States (where it was known as \\"GoGoRiki\\" for a time), parts of Europe, and China. Its international recognition, though, varies widely and can largely depend on its local broadcasting presence and marketing efforts. 3. **Online and Streaming Platforms:** The digital age and the advent of streaming platforms have somewhat altered the dynamics of obscurity. \\"KikoRiki\\" is available on various online platforms, which may increase its accessibility and potentially its international fan base. However, it still faces the challenge of standing out among a vast array of children's content from around the globe. 4. **Niche Appeal:** Among enthusiasts of international animation or those specifically seeking non-Western animated content, \\"KikoRiki\\" could be considered a gem, occupying a niche but cherished spot. Its unique art style, humor, and educational value might attract viewers looking for alternative programming for children. Given these considerations, the placement of \\"KikoRiki\\" on the obscurity chart can fluctuate significantly from one region to another. It sits on the cusp between semi-popular to semi-obscure globally, with a leaning towards being more well-known in its home region and amongst Russian-speaking audiences, but potentially veering towards the obscure in markets heavily saturated with local and Western animated content."},{"prompt":"Does it lean more into MA or WWW territory in say North America","completion":"In the context of North America, \\"KikoRiki\\" would likely lean more towards the obscurity level similar to that of \\"Will & Dewitt\\" (WWW) rather than \\"Monster Allergy\\" (MA). While \\"Monster Allergy\\" enjoyed some level of international broadcasting that included channels in North America, giving it a certain level of visibility and semi-popularity outside its home country, \\"KikoRiki\\" has not had as prominent a presence or wide recognition in the North American market. # Key Points for Consideration: 1. **Broadcasting and Distribution:** \\"KikoRiki\\" was introduced to the North American audience as \\"GoGoRiki\\" during its broadcast run. However, its airing was more limited compared to some other foreign animated shows, restricting its exposure to broader audiences. 2. **Cultural and Market Differences:** North America's children's television market is highly competitive, with a vast array of domestic and international shows vying for attention. Shows that lean heavily into cultural humor, style, or themes from outside North America might face additional challenges in gaining widespread popularity. 3. **Marketing and Merchandising:** Unlike \\"Monster Allergy,\\" which had both a comic book origin and some degree of international marketing behind it, \\"KikoRiki\\" had less of a promotional push in North America, impacting its visibility and recognition. 4. **Online Presence:** While \\"KikoRiki\\" is available on some digital and streaming platforms, its online presence hasn't had a significant breakthrough in catching the wide interest of North American audiences, further contributing to its more obscure status. 5. **Niche Appeal:** Similar to \\"Will & Dewitt,\\" \\"KikoRiki\\" may hold appeal among a niche audience in North America that seeks out unique or international children's programming beyond the mainstream offerings. Considering these factors, \\"KikoRiki\\" in North America presents a case of a series that, despite its success and popularity in its home country and elsewhere, falls into a more obscure category on this side of the globe. It captures a specific segment of the audience interested in international animation but doesn't quite reach the level of broader recognition enjoyed by select imported series."},{"prompt":"Write an realistic, plausible alternate history scenario set on the world of the alternate history scenario with no references to the real world, OTL, or even to the fact that this is an alternate history scenario after all in the form of a lengthy, descrptive, exposition-filled real documentary history book chapter set in the world of the alternate history scenario, in which the 1868 Meiji Restoration in the Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial royal monarchy but de facto feudal hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate that [the Tokugawa shogunate] ruled [the Tokugawa shogunate] over the Japanese Home Islands and Okinawa that [the Meiji Restoration] abolished the rule of the shoguns and the feudal system over Japan and [the Meiji Restoration] lead to the Japanese imperial family, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, [the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty as a result of the Meiji Restoration] regaining executive control over the Japanese government and the subsequent formation of the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Empire of Japan/Imperial Japan ruling over Sahlakin and the Kurils, Okinawa, the Marinas, the Carolinas, Palau and the Korean peninsula from [the Great Japanese Empire’s home base] the Japanese Home Islands and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, [the Meiji Restoration] leading to the development of a democratic parliamentary system in Japanese politics and [the Meiji Restoration] paving the way for the industrial and military development that made Japan into a regional and then a world superpower, [the Meiji Restoration] instead [the Meiji Restoration] leads [the Meiji Restoration] to a compromise between the liberal, social democractic and progressive reformers who support the Japanese imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] and the conservative, traditional aristocrats and merchants who support the de-facto Japanese royal family [the Tokugawa clan], with the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty still [the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty] regaining executive control over the Japanese government, but the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan are [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] not [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] displaced [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] from their [the Tokugawa clan’s reigning heads’] role as shoguns [barbarian-killing generalissmos |shoguns|, the hereditary military dictators |shoguns| akin to the absolute monarchs of post-Rennissance Europe who |the shoguns| were the de-facto leaders of Japan during the period of feudal rule under the military dictatorship of the various shogunates of Japan from 1192-1868] but instead [the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan] becoming more akin to the Reichskanzlers [Realm Chancellors/Imperial Chancelors/Chancelors of the Realm |Reichskanzlers|] of the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire and the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine-ruled Austria-Hungarian Empire and the constitutional European royal monarchs of the post-Napoleon era.

Yuan Shikai still [Shikai] creates an extensive peerage system for the Empire of China but [Shikai] merges it [the Empire of China’s peerage system] with [what Shikai merges the Empire of China’s peerage system with] the pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/“Mongol Empire” and its [the Great Mongol Nation’s] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/“Song dynasty” and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility, [Yuan Shikai merging the Empire of China’s peerage system with the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Great Yuan Empire, Song era and pre-Qing Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] to [Shikai] create a coherent, united aristocratic system of peerage for the country [the Empire of China]. The descendants of the last emperor of the Great Ming State, Zhu Youjian, who [Youjin] had the era name of [Youjin’s era name] Chongzhen, and the last emperor of the Ming rump state of the Southern Ming, Zhu Youlang, whose [Youlang’s] era name was [Youlang’s era name] Yongli being [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] are [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] merged [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] into a single imperial line [the descendants of Chongzhen and Yongli] via multiple marriages, concubinages and adoption, although the marriage of Shikai’s daughter to the last Emperor of the Great Qing State, the then young Aisin-Gioro Henry, whose [Henry’s] era name was [Henry’s era name] Pu-Yi, [the marriage of Shikai’s daughter to Henry] as one of his [Henry’s] wives continues and goes on despite Shikai never [what Shikai never does] crowning himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China. Shikai’s reenthroment of the Zhu after the formation of the Empire of China instead of [Shikai] crowing himself [Shikai] Emperor of Han China ironically solidifies his [Shikai’s] legacy and [Shikai’s reinstatement of the Great Ming State through the Empire of China] also prevents the mass session of provinces from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC due to reformers, modernists and decentralists both in the Kuomingtang and the Beiyang government structure promoting a federal government structure that allows for the autonomy and freedom of the provinces of Han China proper within the boundaries of the Empire of China, akin to that in the German Royal House of Hohenzollern-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-dominated German Empire. The American educated Cantonese statesman Tang Shaoyi becomes [Shaoyi] the first Prime Minister [Shaoyi] of the Empire of China from 13 March 1912 to 1915, [Shaoyi] followed by the Roman Catholic priest and monk Lu Zhengxiang from 1915-1920, followed [Zhengxiang] by Xu Shichang from 1920- 2 June 1922 and then by Wen’s chosen successor and heir of his [Wen’s] will, Wang Jingwei from 1923-1947, who [Jingwei] presides over a alternate Second Sino-Japanese War pitting the restored Ming, Japan and even Qing-ruled Manchuria against KMT splinter cells lead [the KMT splinter cells] by [the leader of the KMT splinter cells] Wen’s other student Chiang Kai Shek, and then [Jingwei being |Jingwei| succeeded as Prime Minister of the Empire of China] by Xu Hanhao of the Han Chinese nationalist, Han Chinese imperialist and Han Chinese expansionist Young China Party from 1948-1952, and then by Li Huang from 1952-1975, also [Huang] of the YCP, then Hua Guofeng from 4 February 1976 – 10 September 1980, who [Guofeng] remained in the YCP due to the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Han imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist fascist Chinese Communist Party remaining within the YCP, then Hu Jintao from 8 July 1985 to 1 December 1992 who [Jintao] remained in the YCP like Guofeng and the other CCP members, then Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT from 20 May 2008 – 20 May 2016, Eric Chu of the KMT from 20 May 2016 to 13 January 2024 and then finally Wenzhou Wu of the YCP from Febuary 2024, by the modern-era equivalent in this timeline. The National Protection War of 25 December 1915 – 14 July 1916 between the Beiyang-ruled first ROC as the Empire of China and what would become the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen’s three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China, then [the embyroic Nationalist China] under the rule of Wen/“Yat-Sen” [The National Protection War] ends with the victory of the Empire of China over the embryonic Nationalist China due to Shikai never making himself [Shikai] Emperor and [Shikai] instead returning the Zhu to power in China, the Empire of China agreeing for Yunnan to [Yunnan] secede [Yunnan] from the Beiyang-ruled first ROC and [Yunnan] subsequently restore the Bai-Han Chinese Imperial House of Duan-ruled absolute feudal dynastic royal imperial monarchy of the Daili Kingdom as its [Yunnan’s] government in exchange for Yunnanese support against the Chinese nationalists, and Cantonian independence activists and supporters in the Nationalist strongholds of Guangxi and Guangdong undermining the Nationalist war effort. A miscommunication between Wen/“Yat-Sen” and his [Wen’s] Japanese backers leads to the Japanese switching support from the Nationalists to the Beiyang-ruled ROC as the Empire of China during the National Protection War, although the Japanese do take Manchuria and Inner Mongolia as protectorates, [the Japanese] restoring the Manchurian monarchy [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro and the Great Qing Empire] in Manchuria and [the Japanese] reestablishing the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia. Wen/“Yat-Sen” is [Wen/“Yat-Sen”] killed [Wen/“Yat-Sen”] during the fighting and the Nationalist Chinese state headquartered in Guangdong and Guangxi essentially becomes a independent Cantonian republic after his [Wen’s/“Yat-Sen”'s] death due to Cantonese independence activists and [Cantonese] nationalists desiring a separate state from Han China taking over Nationalist China after his [Wen’s/“Yat-Sen”'s] death. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1928-1947 between the Japanese Empire and Nationalist China with both the USA and the USSR backing Nationalist China never happens due to the earlier death of Wen/“Yat-Sen” and the Beiyang Government’s Japanophilic, pro-Western leanings. Although Kai-Shek does [Kai-Shek] attempt to [Kai-Shek] lead Kuomingtang splinter cells in Nationalist China in rebellion against both Nationalist China and the Empire of China in the 1920s, the Cantonese people, [the Cantonese people] satisfied with independence from both Han China and Manchuria, [the Cantonese people] are uninterested in his [Kai Shek’s] dreams for a Greater Nationalist China having all the territory of the Qing dynasty despite significant support for him [Kai-Shek] from both the USA and the USSR and Kai-Shek finds himself [Kai-Shek] a virtual outcast [Kai-Shek], [Kai-Shek] eventually being [Kai-Shek] assassinated [Kai-Shek] by a Triad assassin when [Kai-Shek] leaving Nationalist China in around 1939-1940. The restored Great Qing Empire in Manchuria does transition into the Japanese protectorate of the Qing Imperial family, the Manchu House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo in Manchuria in a slow process of constitutional reform and governmental development from the late 1920s until the early 1930s and the restored Yuan dynasty in Inner Mongolia does transition into the Japanese protectorate of Genghis Khan-descended Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mongolian Autonomous Federation/Mengjiang in Inner Mongolia’s Chahar and Suiyan regions. The side branch of the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin, the Mongolian Imperial House of Chagatai-ruled joint-Islamic sultanate and Mongolian khanate of the Kumul Khanate in East Turkestan’s Hami provinces, [the Kumul Khanate] takes over the rest of East Turkestan and East Turkestan never becomes a part of Han China. The theocratic Buddhist absolute monarchy of the Lama-ruled Kingdom of Tibet in Tibet is [the Kingdom of Tibet] never integrated [the Kingdom of Tibet] into China, [the Kingdom of Tibet] remaining independent [the Kingdom of Tibet] to this very day. The Beiyang Government is [the Beiyang Government] still [the Beiyang Government] Japanophilic and [the Beiyang Government] friendly to the West despite it [the Beiyang Goverment] being [the Beiyang Goverment] a modern incarnation [the Beiyang Government] of the Great Ming State in this scenario, with Japan still having good relationships with and a fair amount of control over the Beiyang Government. Due to the Second Sino-Japanese War never happening, the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan all [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] survive [the Beiyang Government, Manchukuo, Mengjiang and Imperial Japan] post-WW2 and post-1947 into the present day and beyond with Nationalist China surviving post-1949 into the present day and beyond.","completion":"**Chapter VII: An Era of Unprecedented Compromise and Evolution** The latter half of the nineteenth century in the East Asian geopolitical landscape was marked by a series of events that would reshape the socio-political structure of the region, setting the stage for a century of growth, conflict, and transformation. Among the most significant of these events was the compromise between the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty and the reigning heads of the Tokugawa clan, a historic agreement that significantly altered the course of Japanese history. **The Compromise of Unity** The Meiji Restoration, as it came to be known, was not a singular revolution that saw the immediate and absolute transfer of power from the feudal lords and the Tokugawa shogunate to the Imperial House, as many might believe. Instead, it evolved into a nuanced compromise that saw the merging of old and new, tradition and modernity, creating a hybrid system of governance that retained the integrity of Japan's historical institutions while embracing the winds of change that were sweeping across the globe. The Tokugawa leaders were not ousted but transformed into figures akin to the Reichskanzlers of Europe, holding significant sway over the military and bureaucratic mechanisms of the state, yet acknowledging the supreme authority of the Emperor. This arrangement allowed for a smoother transition, avoiding the pitfalls of violent upheaval and civil unrest that could have torn the nation asunder. **Samurai and Daimyo Integration** The buke, or samurai class, along with the daimyo, found new roles within this transformed empire. They were not abolished but were intricately woven into the fabric of the new society as part of the Kazoku, the hereditary peerage of the Great Japanese Empire. This inclusion served to pacify potential dissent and utilize their considerable skills and loyalty for the nation's benefit. **Territorial Expansion and International Relations** The Japanese Empire, under this hybrid governance model, continued its trajectory of expansion and modernization. The acquisition of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands following the First Sino-Japanese War, and the transformation of Korea into a protectorate, laid the groundwork for Japan's emergence as a regional powerhouse. The integration of various scripts, the aggressive promotion of industrial and educational reforms in Korea, and the gradual dismantling of feudal classes under a coherent and unified Japanese administration showcased a nation in rapid transition. **The Xinhai Revolution and the Empire of China** Across the Sea of Japan, the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the rise of the Empire of China under the Zhu family, with Yuan Shikai's instrumental role, reflected a parallel transformation. The endorsement of the Ming restoration, supported by various Chinese factions and foreign entities, including Japan, highlighted the interconnectedness of East Asian politics and the shared ambition for reform and modernization while retaining each nation's distinct cultural heritage. **The Empire of Unity and the Nationalist Challenge** The political landscape of China, with the establishment of a coherent aristocracy merging various dynastic legacies, and the implementation of a modern governance model, demonstrated an alternative path to nation-state formation in the context of global imperialism and colonialism. The National Protection War, and the subsequent stabilization of the region under a multipolar system of power, represented a unique evolution of East Asian international relations. **Continuity and Change in the Twentieth Century** As the twentieth century unfolded, the region saw the unfolding of alternate conflicts, alliances, and socio-political experiments that diverged significantly from other timelines. The survival and coexistence of the Japanese Empire, the Empire of China, Manchukuo, Mengjiang, and an independent Nationalist China showcased a complex web of relations, shaped by internal reforms, external pressures, and the shared history of a continent in flux. **Conclusion** This chapter of our documentary history book delves into a world of what-ifs, exploring the myriad ways in which the compromise of 1868, and the subsequent geopolitical developments, could have reshaped not only East Asia but the very fabric of global history. It posits a scenario where tradition and modernity blend seamlessly, where empires evolve rather than perish, and where the legacy of ancient lineages finds new expression in the modern world. It is a tale of unity amidst diversity, of growth amidst challenges, and of a shared destiny forged by the twin forces of compromise and adaptation."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue, royal intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a novel chapter style format, focusing on how the compromise between the reformers and the traditionalists within the Tokugawa shogunate that lead to the Meiji Restoration was achieved and how the Great Japanese Empire dealt with samurai who refused to accept the new order within Japan.","completion":"**Chapter IX: Shadows over Edo** In the heart of Edo, beneath the looming shadow of the castle, the future of Japan was being forged—not in the grand chambers of the shogunate, nor in the opulent halls of the Imperial Palace, but in the dimly lit backrooms of a seemingly inconspicuous teahouse. The year was 1867, a year that would be etched in history as the dawn of a new era, but also a year that teetered on the brink of civil war. The teahouse, known only to a select few as *The Chrysanthemum's Whisper*, had become the unlikely setting for negotiations between representatives of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty and the staunchest allies of the Tokugawa shogunate. The air was thick with the scent of incense and the tension of impending change. Kazuo, a samurai of the old order and a fervent supporter of the Tokugawa regime, found himself seated across from Akira, a young noble affiliated with the more progressive Imperial supporters. Both understood the gravity of their secret meeting—a compromise was essential to avoid the bloodshed that threatened to engulf their nation. \\"The age of the samurai as we know it is at an end,\\" Akira began, his voice steady despite the weight of his words. \\"But it is within our power to redefine our role, to merge tradition with the progress that our country desperately needs.\\" Kazuo clenched his fists beneath the table, the mention of abandoning their way of life stinging like a betrayal. Yet, deep down, he knew the truth in Akira's words. The world was changing. Japan had to adapt or be left behind. \\"And what of the shogunate?\\" Kazuo asked, his voice tinged with defiance. \\"Do we simply cast aside the system that has governed our lands for over two centuries?\\" \\"The shogunate will evolve, not dissolve,\\" Akira replied. \\"Think of it as a transformation. The ruling heads of the Tokugawa clan could serve as guardians of this new era, much like the Reichskanzlers of the West. The Emperor would reign supreme, but your expertise, your loyalty... it would be invaluable in guiding Japan through these turbulent times.\\" The negotiations stretched into the early hours of the morning, with both parties painstakingly crafting the foundation of a new government—a compromise that would usher in the Meiji Restoration while preserving the honor and influence of the samurai. Meanwhile, not far from *The Chrysanthemum's Whisper*, a different kind of meeting was taking place. In the shadowy depths of Edo's underbelly, a faction of samurai who refused to accept the impending change gathered, led by a formidable warrior, Tetsuya. Word of the negotiations had reached them, fueling their resolve to resist the new order at all costs. Tetsuya stood before his followers, his eyes burning with a fierce determination. \\"The way of the warrior is not one of compromise and diplomacy. It is a path of honor and loyalty. We will not stand idly by while the traditions of our forefathers are trampled upon,\\" he declared, drawing his katana and holding it high above his head. A chorus of blades unsheathing echoed through the chamber, a testament to their unwavering resolve. As the dawn broke over Edo, the city found itself at a crossroads. On one side, the promise of a new Japan, guided by both progress and tradition. On the other, the specter of resistance, a refusal to relinquish the past without a fight. The streets of Edo, once bustling with the daily affairs of its citizens, became the stage for a conflict that would test the very soul of Japan. Tetsuya and his followers launched a series of brazen attacks against symbols of the new regime, hoping to ignite a broader rebellion. But the newly formed government was prepared. Leveraging the advancements in steampunk and diesel-powered technology, they mobilized a specialized unit of troops, a hybrid force of samurai and imperial soldiers, equipped with cutting-edge weaponry and armored steam engines. Skirmishes erupted across the city, a chaotic blend of traditional swordplay and mechanized warfare. Yet, amidst the violence, there were moments of unexpected unity. Old enemies found common ground in their love for their country, leading to pockets of resistance laying down their arms and joining the ranks of the new order. In the end, the compromise between the reformers and traditionalists forged in the secluded teahouse proved stronger than the will of those who sought to resist change by force. Japan would emerge from the turmoil of the Meiji Restoration not divided, but as a unified empire, ready to face the challenges of a new era together. The final skirmish took place beneath the ancient sakura trees outside Edo, a poetic setting for the closing act of a centuries-old way of life. Tetsuya, wounded and beleaguered, found himself face to face with Akira, who had taken to the field to quell the last of the resistance. \\"Come with us,\\" Akira offered, extending a hand to his former adversary. \\"Help us build a new Japan. Your strength, your courage... it belongs in this new era, not in the past.\\" Tetsuya looked up at the man who had once been his enemy, now his potential ally. The resolve in Akira's eyes, the promise of a future where honor and progress could coexist, was enough to quell the fire of rebellion in his heart. With a nod of acceptance, Tetsuya sheathed his sword for the last time, stepping into the uncertain dawn of a new age for Japan, an age of steam and steel, tradition and innovation—an age of unity."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a novel chapter style format, focusing on the compromise between the reformers and the traditionalists within the Tokugawa shogunate that lead to the Meiji Restoration was achieved and how the then newly formed Great Japanese Empire dealt with samurai who refused to accept the new order within Japan.","completion":"**Chapter XII: The Iron Geisha and the Last Samurai** In the heart of Tokyo, once called Edo, where the steam-powered street lamps cast long shadows on the cobblestone roads, and the air was thick with the scent of coal and cherry blossoms, lay the heart of the Great Japanese Empire's power. This new era, brought forth by the compromise between the reformers and the traditionalists, had forever altered the landscape of Japan. Yet, not all souls had found peace in this brave new world. The Imperial Palace, a magnificent fusion of traditional Japanese architecture and Victorian steampunk aesthetics, buzzed with the whispers of court intrigue and the clanking of gears. Here, the Emperor sat upon his throne, flanked by mechanical samurai guards, their diesel engines softly purring. The Imperial Court had become a battleground, not of swords, but of wits and whispers, where traditionalists and reformers continued their dance of power. Among the courtiers was Aiko, known to the masses as the Iron Geisha. A formidable figure, Aiko was neither truly a geisha nor made of iron, but a master spy for the Emperor, her beauty and wit only surpassed by her loyalty. Her kimono, adorned with gears and cogs, concealed a multitude of gadgets and weapons, all powered by steam and cunning craftsmanship. She was a bridge between the old ways and the new, respected and feared in equal measure. The Emperor, a young ruler named Meiji, had summoned Aiko to his private chamber, a marvel of innovation with moving walls and secret passages, all hidden beneath exquisite silk tapestries. \\"Aiko,\\" he began, his voice steady, \\"there is a storm brewing within our lands. The last of the samurai who refuse our rule have vanished into the mist, akin to ghosts of the past. Yet, their anger festers. We must find them, understand them, or we risk everything our compromise has built.\\" Aiko bowed deeply, her face a mask of grace. \\"My Emperor, consider it done. The shadows whisper many secrets to those willing to listen.\\" Thus, Aiko began her quest through the bustling streets of Tokyo and beyond, into the rural heartlands where steam tractors plowed the fields and diesel trains cut through the countryside, carrying progress in their wake. Yet, not all were ready to embrace this new dawn. Hidden in the mountains, a fortress stood, untouched by time or technology. It was here that the last samurai, led by a noble warrior named Hideaki, had sought refuge. Hideaki, stern and resolute, had watched the world change from afar, his heart a storm of loyalty to a way of life that no longer existed. It was in the dead of night, under the light of a full moon, that the Iron Geisha found herself at the gates of this fortress, her mechanical gadgets silenced, her mission clear. Yet, as she entered the stronghold, she found not bitter warriors ready for battle but a people lost, clinging to memories and honor. Hideaki greeted her, not with hostility but with weary resignation. \\"Iron Geisha,\\" he addressed her, his voice echoing the sorrow of the ages, \\"we are but shadows now, relics of a bygone era. What does the Emperor want with the likes of us?\\" Aiko, moved by his words, realized that the heart of the issue lay not in resistance but in reconciliation. \\"The Emperor seeks to understand, to offer a hand in unity. The world has room for all, for tradition and for progress. Your wisdom and strength are needed now, more than ever, to guide Japan into the future.\\" Days turned into weeks as Aiko lived among the last samurai, sharing stories, understanding their fears and dreams, and slowly, a bridge was built between the past and the present. In a grand ceremony held in the Imperial Palace, where steam and silk intertwined, Hideaki and his warriors pledged their loyalty to the Emperor, not as subjects, but as guardians of Japan's soul. The compromise was renewed, a testament to the idea that unity was not in erasure, but in the merging of paths. The Iron Geisha, her mission completed, watched as the last samurai laid down their swords at the Emperor's feet, not in defeat, but in trust. Japan had truly entered a new era, where steam engines roared alongside the whispers of the wind, and the spirit of the samurai lived on, not in opposition, but in harmony with the heartbeat of progress. And so, the Great Japanese Empire thrived, a beacon of unity and innovation, a land where tradition and the future danced in the streets, beneath the watchful eyes of the Iron Geisha and the last of the samurai."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a novel chapter style format, focusing on the birth and development of the Great Japanese Empire's ground combat warfare unit, the Imperial Japanese Army [IJA] and also the simultaneous development of the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai and also that of the within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō and the growth and development of the IJA into a major military force in East Asia, [the IJA] equipped with the best and most modern technology.","completion":"**Chapter XVII: The Iron Will and the Hidden Blade** In the wake of reconciliation and the dawn of a unified Japan, the Empire saw the birth of its greatest protector and most subtle weapon: the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and its shadow, the Kempeitai, alongside the Tokkō operating under the Japanese Home Ministry. As the Great Japanese Empire expanded its horizons, these forces became the iron will and hidden blade, safeguarding the burgeoning might of a nation reborn from the ashes of feudal strife. **The Foundation of Power: The Imperial Japanese Army** As the 19th century waned and the 20th century dawned with the promise of industrial marvels, the Japanese Empire was quick to adapt the lessons of the West while infusing them with the spirit of the samurai. The establishment of the Imperial Japanese Army marked the transition from swords to steam-powered rifles and armor-clad zeppelins. At the heart of Tokyo, in a complex of buildings where steam vents intertwined with traditional torii gates, the planning and strategy of the IJA took shape. Led by a council of former samurai and innovative military tacticians, the army was a fusion of discipline and technology. Training grounds, vast and meticulously maintained, housed soldiers drilling beside mechanized infantry units and diesel-powered exoskeletons that enhanced their natural abilities, making them a formidable force capable of swift, decisive actions across varied terrains. **The Shadow Corps: The Kempeitai and the Tokkō** Yet, an empire's strength is not solely measured by the might of its armies but also by the keenness of its intelligence and the efficacy of its policing force. The Kempeitai, birthed from the necessity of maintaining order within the ranks and in occupied territories, evolved into a force both feared and respected. Clad in black uniforms with a single, silver gear emblem, they were the silent guardians of military discipline, their reach extending far beyond the barracks to the very streets of the cities under Japanese rule. Simultaneously, within the labyrinthine halls of the Japanese Home Ministry, the Tokkō operated as the empire's keen eyes and ears, weaving a network of informants and agents that spanned the globe. Tasked with rooting out dissent and protecting the state from both internal and external threats, they were the hidden blade, striking unseen at those who would dare disrupt the public order or challenge the Emperor's will. **The Iron Behemoths: Technological Marvels of the IJA** As the IJA expanded its influence, so too did its arsenal. The Empire's brightest minds, housed within secretive research facilities, labored to produce weapons that blurred the lines between science fiction and reality. Ironclad behemoths, steam-powered tanks with the agility of cavalry units, roamed the battlefields, while airships, armed with cannons and escorted by squadrons of biplane fighters, dominated the skies. The crowning achievement of this era of innovation was the creation of the \\"Shogun's Fist,\\" a massive, diesel-powered automaton capable of decimating enemy fortifications with a single blow. Standing tall amidst the smoke and clamor of the battlefield, these machines were a testament to the Empire's might and ingenuity. **The Waxing Influence of the Kempeitai and Tokkō** As the shadow of war loomed ever larger on the horizon, the Kempeitai's grip on the occupied territories tightened. Their methods, though sometimes harsh, were designed to keep the wheels of the empire turning, through the requisition of resources and the quelling of resistance. Meanwhile, the Tokkō's web of spies and informants infiltrated every level of society, rooting out subversives and ensuring the populace's loyalty. **The Crescendo of Power** As the 20th century marched forward, the Great Japanese Empire stood as a colossus in East Asia, its might upheld by the steely resolve of the Imperial Japanese Army and shadowed by the vigilant watch of the Kempeitai and Tokkō. Together, they forged a nation that was as relentless in its pursuit of progress as it was unyielding in the defense of its sovereignty. The Empire had become a symphony of steam and steel, a fusion of tradition and innovation, with the IJA as its beating heart and the Kempeitai and Tokkō as its protective soul. In this age of empires, Japan was poised not only to compete but to dominate, riding the crest of a wave powered by the Iron Will and the Hidden Blade."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, focusing on the development of Pan-Asianism within the Greater Japanese Empire as well as the development of the belief that Japan was the true successor to the Han Chinese civilization that had flourished under the Song and Ming dynasties and had been suppressed under the Mongol Empire, the Yuan dynasty and the Great Qing Empire within Japan, as well as the covert training, backing and arming of of the anti-Qing, anti-Manchu Han nationalist and Han supremacist paramilitary groups and intellectual organizations that would later provide the basis for the Tongmenghui and Kuomingntang by the Japanese political, aristocratic and noble elite and also by the Kempeitai.","completion":"**Chapter XXII: Echoes of the Dragon Spirit** In a secluded chamber adorned with silk scrolls depicting the golden eras of the Song and Ming dynies, deep within the steel heart of Tokyo's Imperial Palace, a clandestine meeting was underway. The room, illuminated by the soft glow of oil lamps retrofitted with electric filaments, hummed with the whispered fervor of ideologies both new and ancient. Here, amidst relics of a time when the dragon spirit thrived unfettered, the architects of a grand vision for Asia convened. Sitting at the head of the lacquered mahogany table was Lord Katsuro, a statesman whose lineage could be traced back to the noble warriors that once defended the Japanese archipelago. To his right, General Yamada, a decorated officer of the Imperial Japanese Army whose military acumen was only matched by his steam-powered prosthetic arm—a marvel of engineering. Flanking the other side was Master Takeda, a scholar of the highest order, his life dedicated to reviving the intellectual grandeur of the Han Chinese civilization. Lord Katsuro cleared his throat, drawing the room's attention. \\"Gentlemen,\\" he began, his voice a blend of resolve and reverence, \\"we stand on the cusp of remolding Asia into a bastion of unity and power, led by the indomitable spirit of Japan. Yet, our vision extends beyond mere dominion. It is our sacred duty to awaken the slumbering dragon of Han civilization, suppressed for centuries under foreign rule.\\" General Yamada nodded, his mechanical fingers tapping rhythmically on the table. \\"Our armies stand ready, Lord Katsuro. But the battle for Asia's soul will not be won by steel and steam alone. We must forge alliances with those who share our vision across the continent, especially within the heart of Han China.\\" Master Takeda leaned forward, his eyes ablaze with passion. \\"Indeed, General. The Song and Ming dynasties represented the pinnacle of Chinese civilization—moments in time when art, science, and philosophy flourished. It is this spirit, this essence, that we seek to rekindle through our support of the anti-Qing, anti-Manchu movements.\\" Lord Katsuro nodded, a plan forming in the shadows of his mind. \\"Our agents within the Kempeitai have been instrumental in laying the groundwork. They've covertly trained, backed, and armed a network of patriots and scholars opposed to Qing rule. The seeds of revolution have been sown.\\" General Yamada leaned in, a glint of intrigue in his eyes. \\"The Tongmenghui and Kuomingtang, you mean? They are but scattered voices crying out for freedom. Under our guidance, they could become a symphony of liberation.\\" Master Takeda interjected, \\"A symphony that sings the song of Pan-Asianism, gentlemen. A chorus that proclaims Japan not as conqueror, but as liberator and successor to the great Han civilization. Our support of these organizations is not mere altruism; it is the very embodiment of our belief in a united, prosperous Asia under the enlightened leadership of the Japanese Empire.\\" Lord Katsuro raised a hand, silencing the room. \\"Let us not forget, however, the subtlety required in our endeavors. The world watches us closely, wary of our ambitions. Our support for the Tongmenghui and Kuomingtang must remain in the shadows, guided by the unseen hand of the Kempeitai. We shall be the catalysts for change, igniting the flames of revolution without ever being consumed by them.\\" General Yamada's mechanical arm whirred softly as he made a fist. \\"Then let us proceed with both the might of our army and the cunning of our intelligence services. Together, we shall sculpt the future of Asia into a monument to unity, strength, and the indomitable spirit of its peoples.\\" Lord Katsuro stood, his gaze sweeping over the conspirators. \\"To the renewal of the dragon spirit and the dawn of a Pan-Asian empire led by Japan.\\" His declaration was met with a chorus of affirmations, each voice in the room adding weight to the invisible pact that bound them. As the meeting adjourned, the chamber's heavy doors swung open, revealing the gleaming skyline of Tokyo—a city that stood as a testament to the empire's technological prowess and imperial ambition. Yet, beneath the surface of these achievements simmered the ancient aspirations of a continent ready to reclaim its place in the annals of history, guided by the visionaries who dared to dream of a united Asia under the dragon's wing."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, military action style, grand strategy style, tactical military action style pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, focusing on the First Sino-Japanese War between the Great Japanese Empire and the Great Qing Empire and how the IJA and the naval warfare division of the Great Japanese Empire's armed forces, the Imperial Japanese Navy [IJN], [the IJA and IJN] were [the IJA and IJN] able to defeat the larger but less well trained and poorly supplied New Army of the Great Qing Empire and the Great Qing Empire's combined naval warfare branch, the Beiyang Navy.","completion":"**Chapter XXIV: Tides of Steel and Steam** The air was thick with tension aboard the flagship of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), *The Rising Sun*, a marvel of steam and steel that cut through the waters of the Yellow Sea. Below deck, in the war room illuminated by the flickering light of electric bulbs, Admiral Watanabe stood before a grand tactical map, surrounded by his officers. Their gazes were fixed on the imposing figures of General Sakamoto of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and Admiral Watanabe himself, both men symbols of Japan's military might. \\"The Qing Empire's Beiyang Navy looms large, gentlemen,\\" began Admiral Watanabe, his eyes scanning the battleground laid before them on the map. \\"But size is not the sole determinant of victory. Our strength lies in our training, our discipline, and the ingenuity of our machines of war.\\" General Sakamoto, just returned from coordinating ground forces along the Korean Peninsula, nodded in agreement. \\"Indeed, Admiral. The Qing's New Army may outnumber our forces, but their lack of cohesion and poor supply lines are their undoing. Our soldiers are battle-hardened and loyal, equipped with the finest that our nation's steam-powered arsenal can afford.\\" A young naval officer, Lieutenant Yamamoto, stepped forward, pointing to a position on the map. \\"Sir, intelligence suggests the main contingent of the Beiyang Navy is clustering near Weihaiwei. Our submarines, with their diesel engines, could slip past their patrols undetected and deliver a crippling blow before they realize the depths from which we strike.\\" Admiral Watanabe's gaze lingered on the marked position, the gears in his mind turning. \\"An astute observation, Lieutenant. Moreover, our airships, with their bird's-eye view, can provide critical reconnaissance and, when armed, serve as formidable opponents from above. We shall not merely confront the dragon; we shall ensnare it from all sides.\\" General Sakamoto, folding his arms, added, \\"And on land, our mechanized infantry units, supported by steam-powered artillery, will press forward. The Qing's reliance on traditional cavalry will be their downfall. When faced with our ironclad behemoths, their horses will falter.\\" \\"But sir,\\" interjected Captain Inoue, a veteran of numerous naval campaigns, \\"the Qing are not without cunning. Their fortifications along the coast are formidable, and their German-made Krupp guns could prove troublesome for our ships.\\" Admiral Watanabe met Captain Inoue's concern with a confident smile. \\"Which is why we will not engage them in a battle of attrition. Precision, speed, and innovation will secure our victory. Our engineers have been developing torpedoes specifically designed to breach such defenses. Coupled with coordinated airship bombardments, we will pierce the heart of the Beiyang Navy before their guns can reach our fleet.\\" General Sakamoto chimed in, \\"Coordination between our forces will be key. The IJA and IJN acting as a single blade, cutting through the Qing's defenses on land and sea. Our telegraph lines and signal balloons will ensure we remain in lockstep, a unified front against a fragmented foe.\\" The room filled with the murmur of agreement as the officers around the table visualized the campaign unfolding, a harmonious symphony of steam-powered destruction and strategic prowess. Admiral Watanabe raised his hand, calling for silence. \\"Gentlemen, let this battle be a testament to the might of the Great Japanese Empire. Our resolve is ironclad, our purpose righteous. Under the banner of the rising sun, we shall usher in a new era for Asia, one guided by the enlightened rule of Japan.\\" Salutes were exchanged as the officers dispersed, each to his respective post, hearts emboldened by the prospect of imminent victory.

The ground trembled beneath the feet of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) as steam-powered tanks and mechanized infantry units advanced in unison, a formidable force of modern engineering and traditional warrior spirit. High above, airships dotted the sky, their cannons primed and ready. On the other side, the vast expanse was filled with the Qing New Army, a massive but irregular force, bearing a mix of outdated muskets and newly acquired rifles. Behind them, the formidable silhouette of the Beiyang Navy loomed in the distance, their ships anchored defensively near the coastline, Krupp guns aimed towards the advancing Japanese forces. General Sakamoto surveyed the battlefield from the vantage point of his mobile command center, a fortified steam carriage. Beside him, Captain Tsubasa, leader of the samurai units, stood resolute, his armor gleaming under the setting sun. \\"The Qing forces are numerous, but we have the advantage of mobility and technology,\\" General Sakamoto stated, his voice steady despite the tension in the air. Captain Tsubasa nodded, gripping the hilt of his sword. \\"And the spirit of the samurai. Do not forget, General, that our resolve is as strong as our steel.

Our submarines are in position to engage, but we await your command to proceed.\\" General Sakamoto turned to Captain Tsubasa. \\"It's time. Let us show the Qing the true might of the Great Japanese Empire.\\" A decisive nod from the Captain, and the order was given. Japanese airships descended, unleashing a hail of explosive ordinance on the Qing New Army's front lines, causing chaos and disarray. Below, the IJA's steam tanks rolled forward, their cannons firing relentlessly, while samurai units, swift and silent, flanked the enemy on both sides. Captain Tsubasa led his samurai in a charge that would be remembered in history. As the tanks created breaches in the enemy's defenses, the samurai exploited these openings, engaging the Qing soldiers in close combat. Despite the enemy's numbers, the precision and ferocity of the samurai proved overwhelming. At sea, the sounds of underwater explosions signaled the engagement of the IJN's submarines against the Beiyang Navy. The once-mighty fleet found itself besieged from below, unable to retaliate against foes they could neither see nor predict. \\"The spirit of the samurai guides us!\\" Captain Tsubasa shouted above the din of battle, his voice rallying his men even as they clashed sword against bayonet. Onboard the IJN flagship, *The Rising Sun*, Admiral Watanabe watched through his binoculars as the first of the Beiyang ships started to list, hit by unseen torpedoes. \\"For every wave against our shores, we return a tsunami,\\" he declared, a cold resolve in his voice. As night fell, the outcome of the battle became apparent. The combined might of the IJA and IJN, along with the fearless valor of the samurai, had dealt a crushing blow to the Qing forces. The New Army, despite their numbers, could not withstand the onslaught of steam and steel, and the mighty Beiyang Navy was left crippled in the wake of Japan's underwater assault. General Sakamoto, standing amidst the smoldering remains of what was once a battlefield, turned to Captain Tsubasa. \\"This victory is but the first step towards a greater destiny for Japan. Together, we have shown the power of unity between tradition and progress.\\" Captain Tsubasa sheathed his sword, looking out over the field strewn with the aftermath of their engagement. \\"The dragon spirit within us all ensures our victory, General.

The shores of Joeson and the rugged landscapes of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands stood on the brink of a new era, as the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and Navy (IJN), bolstered by the valor of samurai units, edged closer to a decisive victory in the First Sino-Japanese War. General Sakamoto, aboard the IJN's flagship, *The Rising Sun*, alongside Admiral Watanabe and Captain Tsubasa, surveyed the maps laid out before them. The final strategies of liberation were taking shape, a testament to their combined tactical ingenuity and the indomitable spirit of their forces.

On horseback and foot, with sword and gun, we will restore honor to these lands, breaking the chains of Qing imperialism.\\" The plan was set into motion. As the IJN secured the waters around Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, IJA troops, guided by the swift maneuvers of the samurai, began the liberation of Joeson. The sight of Japanese flags hoisted above former Qing outposts signaled the dawn of a new day. Meanwhile, whispers of Ming restorationism began to stir among the Han people. Fueled by the Japanese victory and the dissemination of ideals by the Yellow Sand Society, a covert network of intellectuals and patriots, a renewed sense of identity and purpose took root. In the liberated cities of Joeson, General Sakamoto met with local leaders, pledging support and cooperation. \\"The Great Japanese Empire seeks not to conquer but to liberate,\\" he declared, his voice echoing through the crowded squares. \\"Together, we can build a future free of Qing oppression, one where our cultures and traditions flourish side by side.\\" The sentiment resonated deeply with the people of Joeson, who, inspired by the promise of autonomy and respect, began to view their liberators in a new light. The Japanese had not only freed them from the Qing but offered a vision of Pan-Asian unity and prosperity. Back in the liberated territories of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, Admiral Watanabe oversaw the establishment of provisional governance, ensuring that the transition from Qing rule was smooth and marked by progress. \\"This victory,\\" he mused, gazing out at the bustling harbors, \\"is but the first step in a larger journey toward a unified Asia, under the guidance of the Emperor.\\" As the news of liberation and the stirring of Ming restorationism spread, the Great Japanese Empire found itself at the heart of a geopolitical shift. Its military victories had not only reshaped the map but sown the seeds for a broader movement of renewal and awakening among the peoples of Asia. The war had ended not just with the conquest of territories, but with the liberation of spirits long suppressed. Through the combined might of the IJA, IJN, and the samurai, General Sakamoto, Admiral Watanabe, and Captain Tsubasa had charted a course toward a new Asia—one where the legacy of the Ming and the dreams of Pan-Asianism might yet find fertile ground to grow."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, focusing on the peace treaty between the Great Japanese Empire and the Great Qing Empire that saw the liberation of Joeson from Qing influence and it [Joeson] becoming a Japanese protectorate and the liberation of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands from the Qing, with the Qing stronghold of Manchuria becoming a Japanese protectorate in all but name.","completion":"**Chapter XXX: The Treaty of Edo** Within the ornate chambers of the newly constructed Edo Castle, a splendid mix of traditional Japanese architecture and the grandeur of Victorian design, the stage was set for a historical moment that would redraw the geopolitical landscape of East Asia. The air was thick with the scent of burning incense and the subtle undertones of steam, as diplomats from the Great Japanese Empire and the beleaguered Great Qing Empire gathered to conclude the peace talks that would end the First Sino-Japanese War. At the head of the vast, polished mahogany table sat Emperor Meiji of Japan, a figure of youthful ambition cloaked in the regal trappings of his office. Opposite him, the Qing envoy, a dignified elder statesman named Zhang Wei, represented the interests of the crumbling Qing dynasty. Between them lay the treaty, a document that promised to alter the fates of millions. Emperor Meiji, breaking the silence, addressed the assembly. \\"Esteemed representatives, today marks the dawn of a new era—an era of unity and prosperity under the protection of the Great Japanese Empire. The liberation of Joeson, Taiwan, and the Pengu Islands from Qing rule is not merely a territorial gain, but a stepping stone toward the grand vision of Pan-Asianism.\\" Zhang Wei, his expression a mask of serene resignation, inclined his head. \\"Your Imperial Majesty, the Qing acknowledges the might and the right of the Japanese Empire to guide Asia into the future. In ceding Joeson, Taiwan, and the Pengu Islands and accepting Japan's protectorate over Manchuria, we seek peace and the preservation of Qing sovereignty over our remaining territories.\\" A murmur of approval echoed through the chamber, as dignitaries from both sides recognized the significance of the moment. General Sakamoto, standing just off to the side, exchanged glances with Admiral Watanabe, both men silently acknowledging the military triumphs that had led to this diplomatic victory. \\"The Great Japanese Empire pledges to safeguard the territories newly entrusted to our care,\\" continued Emperor Meiji, his gaze sweeping over the room. \\"Joeson shall thrive as a protectorate, maintaining its unique heritage while benefiting from our guidance. Taiwan and the Pengu Islands will be integrated as provinces of Japan, heralding an era of development and integration.\\" As the Emperor spoke, a scribe dipped his quill into ink, preparing to record the historic agreement. Zhang Wei, raising his voice slightly, added, \\"Let it be known that the Qing Dynasty, in accepting these terms, does so with the hope of enduring peace between our nations. May the Great Japanese Empire honor its commitments to the peoples of Joeson, Taiwan, and the Pengu Islands.\\" With a nod from Emperor Meiji, the peace treaty was signed, the scratch of the quill on parchment underscoring the gravity of the moment. Flashbulbs from the assembled press corps, a mix of traditional artists and those wielding modern photographic apparatuses, captured the scene for posterity. Outside, in the gardens of Edo Castle, where steam-powered fountains mingled with cherry blossoms, General Sakamoto and Admiral Watanabe reflected on the path ahead. \\"The war may have ended, but our mission has only just begun,\\" mused the General. \\"The true test will be in winning the hearts of those now under our protection.\\" Admiral Watanabe, gazing into the distance, nodded thoughtfully. \\"Indeed, General. Our strength in battle must now be matched by our wisdom in peace.\\" As the delegates departed, the Treaty of Edo not only signified the cessation of hostilities but also heralded the rise of Japan as a dominant power in East Asia. The Great Japanese Empire, with its vision of Pan-Asian unity, had stepped boldly onto the world stage, ready to navigate the uncertain waters of international diplomacy and internal governance."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, focusing on the development and growth of Joeson into a modern, somewhat industrialized nation state under Japanese influence after the First Sino-Japanese War and the subsequent simultaneous suppression of the yangaban and anti-Japanese elements of the House of Jeonji Yi by the Kempeitai and Tokkō units stationed within the Korean peninsula.","completion":"**Chapter XXXIII: The New Dawn of Joeson** In the heart of Keijo (modern-day Seoul), the transformation of Joeson under the Japanese protectorate was both palpable and profound. The wide streets, once cramped and bustling with traditional market stalls, now gleamed with the progress of steam and steel. Railways and telegraph lines crisscrossed the landscape, facilitating a newfound sense of connectivity and efficiency. At the Residency-General, the seat of Japanese authority in Joeson, Governor-General Hasegawa presided over the territories with a blend of military precision and diplomatic acumen. His office, adorned with both the flags of the Japanese Empire and that of Joeson, served as a testament to the complex relationship between the protector and its charge. One crisp morning, Governor-General Hasegawa convened a meeting with his closest advisors, including representatives from the Kempeitai and Tokkō units, to assess the ongoing efforts to modernize Joeson and suppress any lingering resistance. \\"Progress continues apace,\\" Hasegawa began, unfolding a detailed map across the table. \\"The railways extend further each day, bringing with them the promise of prosperity. However, prosperity alone cannot quell the disquiet among the yangaban and followers of the House of Jeonji Yi.\\" Captain Inoue of the Tokkō leaned forward, his eyes steely. \\"The suppression of these elements is essential for the stability of Joeson. Our agents have identified key figures within the yangaban who clandestinely oppose our efforts. They perpetuate outdated customs and hinder our initiatives.\\" Lieutenant Kuroda of the Kempeitai nodded in agreement. \\"Indeed, Captain. We've been conducting operations to dismantle their influence. Just last night, we apprehended several yangaban members plotting to sabotage the railway construction. Their anti-Japanese sentiment poses a direct threat to our mission.\\" Governor-General Hasegawa stroked his chin thoughtfully. \\"While force is sometimes necessary, we must not forget the importance of winning hearts and minds. The introduction of schools teaching Japanese language and sciences is as crucial as our military presence. We must elevate the common people of Joeson, show them the benefits of our governance.\\" A voice, softer yet firm, interjected from the end of the table. It was Dr. Sato, the Japanese-appointed advisor for educational reform in Joeson. \\"Governor-General, the new schools have indeed been a success. Enrollment numbers are rising, and there's a genuine eagerness among the youth to learn. This, I believe, is where the true transformation of Joeson lies.\\" Hasegawa nodded, pleased. \\"Excellent, Dr. Sato. Education is the foundation upon which we will build a modern, industrialized nation-state here in Joeson. As for the yangaban and those loyal to the House of Jeonji Yi, we will continue our efforts to neutralize their opposition. Captain Inoue, Lieutenant Kuroda, your work is vital, but remember, coercion alone will not secure our legacy here.\\" Captain Inoue bowed slightly. \\"Understood, Governor-General. Our actions will be measured but decisive. The kempeitai and Tokkō are committed to ensuring the security and progress of Joeson.\\" As the meeting adjourned, the officials filed out of the room, each burdened with the weight of their responsibilities. Outside, the streets of Keijo buzzed with activity, a visible sign of the changing times. Steam-powered trams glided past traditional hanok houses, symbolizing the juxtaposition of the old and new. In the countryside, the whispers of discontent among the yangaban simmered beneath the surface, their centuries-old privilege eroding away with each mile of railway track laid. Yet, within the schools and factories that dotted the landscape, a new generation of Joesonese looked to the future with hope, embracing the opportunities that the Japanese protectorate promised. The path forward was fraught with challenges, both ideological and physical, but the wheels of progress continued to turn, driven by the combined efforts of Japanese ingenuity and the aspiring hearts of the Joesonese people. In this complex dance of suppression and enlightenment, the fate of Joeson as a modern, somewhat industrialized nation-state hung delicately in the balance."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, still focusing on the development and growth of Joeson into a modern, somewhat industrialized nation state under Japanese influence after the First Sino-Japanese War and the subsequent simultaneous suppression of the yangaban and anti-Japanese elements of the House of Jeonji Yi by the Kempeitai and Tokkō units stationed within the Korean peninsula but having a direct locus on the suppression of Confucianist and neo-Confucianist thought and traditional Korean shamanism from among the Korean people by the Japanese and the simultaneous promotion of Shinto, Buddhism and Christianity to replace these.","completion":"**Chapter XXXVII: The Winds of Change** The heart of Joeson, now throbbing with the pulse of steam engines and clattering of printing presses, was a testament to an era teetering on the blade of modernity and tradition. The Governor-General's office in Keijo was abuzz with the latest reports from the countryside, where the Japanese efforts to reshape the spiritual and intellectual landscape of Joeson faced fierce, if silent, resistance. Governor-General Hasegawa leaned back in his chair, his fingers tented as he listened to the briefing from his advisors. Among them were agents of the Kempeitai and Tokkō, along with cultural officers tasked with implementing the Japanese vision of enlightenment. \\"Governor-General, the suppression of Confucianist and neo-Confucianist thought is progressing, albeit slower than anticipated,\\" began Agent Mori of the Tokkō. \\"The yangaban's grip on these ideologies remains strong, and the common people still cling to their teachings for guidance.\\" Hasegawa nodded, his expression unreadable. \\"And what of our efforts to introduce Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity as alternatives?\\" Cultural Officer Takahashi stepped forward, a sheaf of reports in hand. \\"Shinto and Buddhism have found some acceptance, especially among the younger generations in urban areas. Christianity, however, faces opposition, not only from traditionalists but from those wary of Western influences.\\" The Governor-General's gaze shifted to a large map on the wall, dotted with markers indicating schools, shrines, and churches spread across Joeson. \\"It seems we must navigate a delicate path. Our objective is not merely to suppress old ideologies but to foster a new landscape of thought—one that aligns with the modern nation we are building.\\" Agent Kimura of the Kempeitai added, \\"Our recent operations against practitioners of traditional Korean shamanism have been effective in diminishing its public presence. However, it continues to persist in secluded communities, Governor-General.\\" Hasegawa steepled his fingers, contemplating. \\"Shamanism, like Confucianism, is deeply woven into the fabric of Joeson society. Our challenge is to present Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity not as replacements but as extensions of the people's spiritual journey.\\" Officer Takahashi chimed in, \\"Perhaps, Governor-General, our approach should include more engagement with community leaders. Demonstrating the parallels between Shinto and traditional shamanistic practices could ease the transition. Similarly, highlighting Buddhism's historical presence in Joeson and Christianity's emphasis on compassion might soften resistance.\\" The room fell into thoughtful silence as the weight of Takahashi's suggestion sank in. Hasegawa finally broke the silence. \\"Takahashi-san, your proposal has merit. We must wield culture with the same precision we use force. Arrange meetings with local leaders—teachers, priests, even artists. Let us weave these new threads into the tapestry of Joeson society together.\\" Agent Mori raised an eyebrow. \\"And the yangaban and other anti-Japanese elements, Governor-General?\\" Hasegawa's expression hardened. \\"They will be dealt with by the Kempeitai and Tokkō. Opposition to our rule cannot be tolerated. However, our primary battle is one of hearts and minds. We cannot rule by fear alone.\\" As the meeting adjourned, the advisors left with a new directive, one that highlighted the complexities of governing a nation caught between epochs. The campaign to mold Joeson's spiritual and intellectual identity was just as critical as any military conquest. Through the streets of Keijo, where Western attire mingled with hanbok and the air resonated with the mingled scents of Korean cuisine and Japanese tea, the story of Joeson's transformation unfolded—a tale of suppression and promotion, of erasing and rewriting, of holding tight to identity amid the tides of change."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, s focusing on the transformation of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands under Japanese rule after the First Sino-Japanese War into the Japanese province of Formosa and the simultaneous industrial, economic and educational development going on there [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] as the Japanese work to make the Taiwanese aboriginals and the Hoklo people originally from Southern China's Fujian province who had assimilated into Taiwan over the centuries and become indigenous to the region into Japanese citizens.","completion":"**Chapter XL: The Loom of Progress** The governor's mansion in Taipei, a grand structure that melded Japanese architectural sophistication with local Taiwanese elements, stood as a symbol of the new era that dawned on the island province of Formosa. Within its walls, Governor Ishikawa convened a crucial meeting to discuss the transformation of Taiwan and the Pengu Islands under Japanese rule. \\"The assimilation of the Taiwanese aborigines and the Hoklo is paramount,\\" Ishikawa stated, addressing his council of Japanese officials and local leaders. \\"Our mission transcends mere governance; it is to integrate these peoples into the greater fabric of the Japanese Empire as loyal and productive citizens.\\" Doctor Yamazaki, appointed head of educational reform, was the first to respond. \\"The establishment of schools throughout the province is already underway, Governor. We are not only teaching the Japanese language but also introducing students to Japanese culture, history, and values. However, we face resistance, particularly in remote regions where traditional tribal structures remain strong.\\" Ishikawa nodded, expecting such challenges. \\"And what of our efforts in economic and industrial development?\\" Minister Tanaka, overseeing economic policy, leaned forward. \\"The agricultural reforms have seen success, with increased productivity in both rice and sugar cane cultivation. We've also begun to introduce small-scale factories utilizing steam technology for processing these crops. However, the true potential lies in harnessing Formosa's coal reserves. This will not only power our industrial expansion but also provide employment and foster economic loyalty among the Taiwanese and Hoklo populations.\\" A local Hoklo leader, Mr. Chen, who had shown a willingness to cooperate with the Japanese administration, spoke up. \\"Governor, my people are willing to learn and adapt, but we seek assurances that our rights and traditions will be respected. The sudden changes, while promising, have also sown fear and confusion.\\" Ishikawa listened intently, aware of the delicate balance his administration needed to maintain. \\"Mr. Chen, let me be clear—the Japanese Empire views Formosa as a land of great promise. Your traditions and rights will be protected, so long as they align with our overarching goal of unity and progress. We aim to build a society where every citizen, regardless of origin, can thrive.\\" A murmur of agreement went around the room, though Ishikawa could sense the underlying apprehension. \\"To this end,\\" he continued, \\"we will establish community centers where both Japanese and local customs can be celebrated. Furthermore, I propose the formation of a council consisting of Taiwanese and Hoklo leaders to advise the administration on matters of cultural integration.\\" This suggestion was met with cautious optimism, a sign that Ishikawa's message was resonating. \\"Lastly,\\" Ishikawa concluded, \\"I wish to address the issue of citizenship. Upon completion of our educational program, and with demonstrated loyalty to the Empire, full Japanese citizenship will be granted to the Taiwanese and Hoklo. This is not merely an administrative process, but a covenant between us, promising a future of shared prosperity and harmony.\\" As the meeting adjourned, the participants left with mixed feelings—hope mingled with skepticism, enthusiasm tempered by the weight of historical grievances. Yet, the wheels of progress, once set in motion, were hard to stop. Outside, the streets of Taipei buzzed with activity. Steam trams carried citizens past construction sites where the future was being built—one brick, one beam, one rail at a time. In the bustling markets, the Japanese yen exchanged hands alongside local produce, a tangible sign of the economic transformations taking place. Meanwhile, in the classrooms, children of diverse backgrounds recited lessons in Japanese, their voices blending into a melody of unity and change. And in the mines and factories, the hum of machinery provided a backdrop to the lives of those who toiled, not just for subsistence, but for the promise of a better tomorrow. The transformation of Formosa was a tapestry woven from countless threads—economic, educational, and cultural—each contributing to the creation of a province that stood as a testament to Japanese ambition and the resilience of its people."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, focusing on how the Japanese utilized the legacy of the Ming satellite state/rump kingdom of the absolute royal dynastic monarchy of the Japanese-Han Chinese side branch of the Imperial House of Great Yamato/Minamoto dynasty, the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Tungning/Tungning Kingdom in their [the Japanese's] administration of Formosa and also in the training of Han Chinese and Cantonese Ming restorationists there [Formosa].","completion":"**Chapter XLIII: Echoes of Tungning** In a stately room within the administrative headquarters in Taipei, adorned with both the crisply designed flags of the rising sun of Japan and the symbolic emblems of the bygone Ming dynasty, Governor Ishikawa convened a highly confidential meeting. This gathering was unlike any other; it was charged with the spirit of historical legacies and the weight of future aspirations. Seated around Ishikawa were his trusted advisors, along with a select group of scholars well-versed in the history of Formosa and the exploits of Koxinga, the Ming loyalist who once established the Kingdom of Tungning as a bastion against Qing expansion. The aim was clear: to leverage this legacy in their governance of Formosa and bolster the training of Han Chinese and Cantonese Ming restorationists. \\"History,\\" Ishikawa began, clearing his throat, \\"is not merely a record of the past but a beacon for the future. The Royal House of Koxinga and its stand against the Qing resonates deeply with our current objectives. We must draw upon this legacy to strengthen our position and inspire the Ming restorationist movement.\\" A scholar, Professor Watanabe, adjusted his glasses before speaking. \\"Indeed, Governor. Koxinga's legacy is a potent symbol of resistance and determinism. His Royal House, though rooted in the Ming dynasty, was innovative and forward-thinking, much like our aspirations for Formosa. By invoking his spirit, we link our governance with an era revered by many Han Chinese and Cantonese.\\" A military advisor, Colonel Sato, leaned forward, interlocking his fingers. \\"The training of Han Chinese and Cantonese Ming restorationists on Formosa can thus be framed as a continuation of Koxinga's resistance. It's not merely military strategy we're imparting, but a lineage of defiance and autonomy.\\" Ishikawa nodded thoughtfully. \\"This approach requires a careful blending of narratives. While we promote the technological and administrative advancements of the Japanese Empire, we must also pay homage to the resilience and autonomy characterized by the Tungning Kingdom.\\" A quiet murmur of agreement swept the room, signaling the collective understanding of the delicate task ahead. A cultural envoy, Miss Hayashi, raised a pertinent question. \\"How do we ensure that the legacy of Koxinga, and by extension, the Ming, does not overshadow the sovereignty and vision of the Japanese Empire?\\" Governor Ishikawa contemplated this before responding. \\"By presenting the Japanese Empire as the catalyst for the realization of Koxinga's unfinished dream. We are not supplanting his legacy; we are its culmination. The technologies, reforms, and values we introduce are the means by which the spirit of the Ming, through Tungning, achieves its full potential.\\" Colonel Sato added, \\"Our military academies in Formosa should emphasize this narrative in their curriculum for the Ming restorationists. They must understand that in aligning with us, they are not betraying their heritage but fulfilling a centuries-old quest for autonomy against the Qing.\\" Professor Watanabe interjected, \\"This synthesis of cultures and objectives also provides a unique opportunity to study and document the transitional period Formosa is undergoing. It could serve as a blueprint for similar endeavors in the future.\\" Ishikawa, satisfied with the strategic direction charted by the meeting, concluded, \\"Let us proceed with diligence and respect for the complexities of this task. Our administration of Formosa, coupled with the training of restorationists, must be a testament to the union of past valor and present vision.\\" As the participants dispersed, they were acutely aware of the historical crossroads at which they stood. The endeavor they were about to embark upon was not merely an administrative or military exercise but a renaissance that sought to bridge epochs, cultures, and aspirations.

The cherry blossoms were in full bloom, painting the sky with hues of pink and white, a gentle reminder of the beauty and impermanence of power. Inside a carefully arranged drawing-room, representatives of Japan's most esteemed families, the Kazoku, the Tokugawa clan, and members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato, gathered alongside the descendants of the Royal House of Koxinga/Zheng dynasty and the Ming aristocracy. The air was thick with the anticipation of a momentous occasion—the integration of these storied lineages into the very fabric of the Japanese ruling elite through a series of strategic unions. Governor Ishikawa, having overseen the transformation of Formosa, was present to facilitate the discussions, recognizing the delicate balance of honor, tradition, and political acumen required. \\"Esteemed members of our noble houses,\\" began Ishikawa, his voice resonant and measured, \\"today, we stand on the cusp of an alliance that transcends mere geopolitics.

The Royal House of Koxinga has always stood for resilience in the face of adversity, a value deeply resonant with the Samurai spirit.\\" From the Kazoku, a prominent noble, Lord Fujimura, inclined his head in acknowledgment. \\"The integration of the Ming and Zheng descendants into our ranks is not only a gesture of unity but a testament to our vision for the future. Their bloodlines carry the wisdom of ages, a priceless boon to the Kazoku and, by extension, to Japan.\\" A matron of the Tokugawa clan, renowned for her diplomatic finesse, added, \\"Through intermarriage and the bonds of kinship, we shall fortify our families—not merely in terms of power but in the richness of culture and knowledge exchanged. It's a confluence of destinies, ushering in an era of unparalleled prosperity and understanding.\\" Governor Ishikawa nodded, turning to a young princess of the Imperial House of Great Yamato, whose marriage to a Ming descendant was poised to symbolize the dawn of this new era. \\"Princess Miyako, your union is the cornerstone of this grand mosaic we endeavor to create. Would you grace us with your thoughts?\\" Princess Miyako, her demeanor reflecting the weight of her role, spoke softly yet with conviction. \\"I am humbled by the path laid out before me. This alliance, born of mutual respect and shared aspirations, signifies more than the merging of lineages. It's a pledge to honor the sacrifices of our ancestors and to shoulder the legacy they've bestowed upon us—a legacy of unity, strength, and enduring peace.\\" Murmurs of approval resonated through the room, as the assembly acknowledged the significance of her words. \\"As we proceed with these unions,\\" Ishikawa concluded, \\"let us be mindful of the history we are crafting—a saga of integration that celebrates diversity and fosters a sense of belonging among all our people, regardless of their origin. May the prosperity of our families reflect the prosperity of Japan and ensure that the legacy of the Ming, the Zheng, and the illustrious Japanese Empire endure for generations.\\" The meeting adjourned with a sense of shared purpose, as plans for weddings and ceremonies began to take shape.

At the head of the grand, lacquered table sat Prince Uihwa, a figure of youthful ambition, flanked by Japanese Governor Ishikawa and representatives from the newly formed Korean Kazoku, adorned in robes that signified their noble status. The echo of Gojong’s rule had faded, giving rise to a new era, a decision orchestrated by the Japanese with a nuanced understanding of Korean politics and societal structures.

Japan’s support in this transition is unwavering. Through education, military reform, and industrial advancement, Korea will shine as a beacon of the East.\\" Prince Uihwa then formally addressed the dissolution of the old yangaban class, \\"As we step into this new dawn, the remnants of the yangaban will be welcomed to join us in building the future, provided they align with our imperial vision. This is a time for unity, for all Koreans to contribute to our nation's greatness.\\" A newly appointed Korean Kazoku member, once a yangaban himself, shared his sentiment, \\"Your Majesty, your vision ushers in a time of reconciliation and renewal. We, who once presided over old Korea, now pledge our loyalty to the Korean Empire, ready to serve and propel our country towards its destined grandeur.\\" To seal the ceremony, Prince Uihwa and Governor Ishikawa signed a series of decrees, watched by an attentive audience —the documents outlining the legal foundation of the Korean Empire, its governance structure, and the future direction of its society. As the assembly dispersed, the air was charged with a sense of purpose. The corridors of the palace, echoing with footsteps, resonated with conversations about the forthcoming reforms, the integration of Japanese technological advancements, and the educational initiatives aimed at fostering a sense of national identity and imperial loyalty among Koreans.

It was then that a political advisor, Minister Park, addressed the assembly, shifting the focus to a more contentious aspect of their nation-building efforts. \\"Generals, Admirals, while we fortify our military, we must also address the internal dissent that threatens to undermine our Empire's unity,\\" he said, with a note of urgency in his voice. \\"The deportation of the anti-Japanese, China-supporting yangaban to the Great Qing Empire—a move designed to stir Ming revivalism and Han nationalism—must be executed with precision and care.\\" General Hwang nodded solemnly, \\"Indeed, Minister Park. This act, while decisive, must not be seen as mere retribution but as a necessary step towards the stabilization and security of our Empire. Each yangaban sent to the Qing lands carries with them a message—that the Korean Empire is committed to its sovereignty and its allies.\\" Admiral Yamada interjected thoughtfully, \\"Simultaneously, this act serves to kindle the flames of dissent within the Qing, diverting their attention inward. The resurgence of Ming revivalism, fueled by the presence of these yangaban, could preoccupy the Qing sufficiently to ease our own path towards strengthening.\\" Minister Park leaned back, acknowledging the points made. \\"Strategically, it is a sound maneuver. Yet, we must remain vigilant. The repercussions of these deportations will echo beyond our borders, and we must be prepared for the diplomatic challenges that follow.\\" General Takahashi, ever focused on the practicalities, concluded, \\"Our priority remains the defense and development of the Korean Empire. Together, with the might of our combined forces and the wisdom of our strategies, we shall navigate these complexities.\\" As the meeting adjourned, the gathered minds set about translating their deliberations into decisive action. Outside, the cadets of the Imperial Military Academy drilled under the watchful eyes of their instructors, a living testament to the Empire's martial ambitions. The Korean Empire was on the march, its eyes set firmly on the horizon, even as it navigated the treacherous currents of its internal and external challenges. The path forward was fraught with uncertainty, but under the guidance of its new guard, the Empire strode forth with determination and resolve."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, navy combat, tactical military style, military style court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, focusing on the Russo-Japanese War of 8 February 1904 – 5 September 1905 between the Great Japanese Empire, the Korean Empire, the Great Qing Empire and the German-Danish-Russian Imperial House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional absolute imperial royal monarchy of the Russian Empire ruling over Finland, the Baltics, the Caucuses, Azerbaijan, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Poland and Belarus from [the Russian Empire's homebase] European Russia, showing the battles between the IJA, IJN and the samurai units of the Japanese, the Imperial Korean Army, the New Army and the Beiyang Army and the Russian Empire's armed land force, the Imperial Russian Army, the Russian Empire's air service, the Imperial Russian Air Service, and the Russian Empire's navy, the Imperial Russian Navy.","completion":"**Chapter LV: Thunder over the Sea of Japan** Amidst the cold, churning waters of the Sea of Japan, the first light of dawn revealed a horizon bristling with the ironclads of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and its Korean counterpart, their steam engines pulsing like the heartbeats of giants. Arrayed against them, the formidable silhouette of the Imperial Russian Navy loomed, a leviathan stirring from the depths of European Russia, its sights set on asserting dominance over the Far East. Admiral Matsura stood on the bridge of the *Mikasa*, the IJN's flagship, as he surveyed the impending clash of empires. Beside him, Admiral Cho of the Korean Empire, a testament to the alliance forged in fire and ambition, shared the weight of the moment. \\"The Russians underestimate our resolve,\\" Matsura began, his eyes narrowing as he watched the enemy fleet maneuver. \\"Their ships are powerful, but our strategy and technology will secure our victory. The *Mikasa*'s steam turbines give us an advantage in speed and maneuverability.\\" Admiral Cho nodded, his gaze fixed on the Korean vessels at their flank. \\"The Korean Empire stands with Japan. Our shipwrights have worked alongside yours, adopting the innovations that will see us through this day.\\" Below deck, General Yamamoto coordinated with the IJA and samurai units stationed on the transport ships. \\"The deployment of our land forces hinges on securing a naval advantage. Once the Russian Navy is engaged, we'll strike at their coastal defenses.\\" Aboard the Russian flagship *Tsarevich*, Admiral Rozhestvensky marshaled his forces, aware of the challenge that lay ahead. \\"Let the Japanese and Koreans come,\\" he declared. \\"The might of the Russian Empire will quell their ambitions. Our battleships, powered by the latest in coal-fired engines, will dominate the engagement.\\" As the fleets drew closer, the sky was rent with the roar of the first broadsides. Japanese and Korean shells sliced through the morning fog, answered in kind by the thunderous replies of the Russian guns. Amid the chaos of battle, the samurai units, a fearsome sight in their armor, prepared for their role in the upcoming landings. Their ancient warrior spirit, now allied with the cutting edge of military technology, made them a formidable force. The Imperial Russian Air Service took to the skies, their airships lumbering towards the Japanese and Korean positions, dropping bombs in an effort to break their formation. The IJN responded with their own air contingents, engaging in dogfights that dotted the clouds with fire and smoke. Admiral Matsura, seizing the moment, ordered a flanking maneuver. \\"Now! While their focus is divided!\\" The *Mikasa*, leading a contingent of faster, more maneuverable ships, cut through the Russian lines, delivering a crippling blow to the *Tsarevich*. On land, the echoes of naval artillery were the harbingers of the amphibious assault to come. The IJA and Imperial Korean Army, supported by the samurai, began their landings under the cover of smoke and confusion. The Imperial Russian Army, entrenched along the coast, met them with volleys of fire, but the element of surprise and the ferocity of the attackers gained them a foothold. As the day wore on, the Sea of Japan became a tableau of destruction and valor. Ships grappled in a deadly dance, while above them, airships and aeroplanes clashed in the new theater of aerial combat. Admiral Rozhestvensky, witnessing the tenacity of the Japanese and Korean forces and the unexpected efficiency of their tactics and technology, realized the battle was slipping from his grasp. \\"Signal a retreat,\\" he ordered grimly. \\"We must regroup and reassess. The war is far from over.\\" As night fell, the Sea of Japan lay quiet, a testament to the day's ferocity. The Russo-Japanese War had seen its first major engagement—a clash that underscored the evolving nature of warfare and the determination of nations to assert their place in the world order. Japan and Korea, having proven their naval might and the effectiveness of their alliance, prepared for the next phase.

Within the confines of a fortified command center near the city of Dalian, a huddle of military minds from the Japanese Empire, the Korean Empire, and loyalists from the Qing's New Army and Beiyang Navy, orchestrated the defense against an imposing threat—the combined forces of the Imperial Russian Army (IRA) and its formidable navy and air service. General Yamada, overseeing the defenses, addressed the assembly with a map of Manchuria spread before them. \\"The Russian Empire seeks to break our will by seizing Manchuria. They believe that by crushing us here, they can dictate the terms of peace. We must prove them wrong.\\" Captain Lee, representing the Imperial Korean Army (IKA) units deployed in Manchuria, chimed in, \\"The Korean brigades stand ready. Our soldiers remember the harshness of Qing rule and will fight to ensure our new-found autonomy is not threatened.\\" Admiral Zhou of the Beiyang Navy, his features set in a grim determination, added, \\"Our naval guns have been positioned along the coast. Although the Russian Baltic Fleet poses a significant threat, we are prepared to defend our waters with every shell at our disposal.\\" General Yamada nodded before continuing, \\"The Kwangtung Army, alongside our Korean allies and the forces of the New Army and Beiyang Navy, forms a formidable wall. But it is our strategy that will ensure our victory. The Russians underestimate the mobility of our forces and our ability to strike from unexpected quarters.\\" The room fell silent as the aerogram officer entered, handing a message to General Yamada. After a brief pause to read the contents, Yamada's eyes hardened. \\"The Imperial Russian Air Service (IRAS) has begun its assault. They aim to break our supply lines and isolate our forces.\\" Field Marshal Tan, the chief strategist from the Qing's New Army, leaned forward. \\"Let us turn their strategy against them. Our understanding of this terrain allows us to lure them into traps. Guerrilla tactics, combined with the precision strikes by our steam-powered aircraft, can whittle down their strength.\\" Admiral Zhou suggested, \\"And let us not forget the power of misinformation. Feeding the Russians false intelligence about our positions and strength could lead them into a tactical blunder.\\" As the plans took shape, a spirit of unity pervaded the room. Traditional rivalries and past grievances gave way to a singular focus—defending Manchuria against the onslaught. --- The battles that ensued were fierce and unforgiving. Russian advances met stubborn resistance, with every inch of ground contested by the defenders. In the skies, the IRAS encountered a swarm of agile, steam-powered fighters that harried their bombers and reconnaissance planes, reducing their effectiveness. On the ground, the IRA found itself bogged down by a combination of harsh weather, determined guerrilla attacks, and carefully orchestrated counteroffensives. Manchurian villages, once quiet, became battlegrounds where the local populace, inspired by the resistance, lent their support however they could. The Siege of Manchuria, as it came to be known, marked a turning point in the Russo-Japanese War. Despite their numerical and firepower superiority, the Russian forces were unable to achieve a decisive breakthrough. Each attempt was repelled with cunning and bravery by an alliance forged in the fires of conflict—an alliance that, despite its diverse composition, stood united in the face of a common enemy. In the aftermath, as reports of the determined defense reached the capitals of the warring nations, the world took note. Manchuria had become a symbol of resistance, a testament to the resolve of the Japanese, Koreans, and their allies from the Qing's remaining loyal forces. The battles fought in its forests and along its rivers would long be remembered, not just for their military significance, but for the message they sent—a message of defiance, unity, and the enduring spirit of those who fought for their land and their future."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a steampunk, diesel-punk, Victorian style, political thriller, court intrigue pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, exposition-filled, novel chapter style format, focusing on the peace treaty between the Russian Empire and the Great Japanese Empire, the Korean Empire and the Great Qing Empire that ends the Second Sino-Japanese War, confirming the Korean Empire's and Manchuria's shared status as Japanese protectorates and ending Russian influence in East Asia.","completion":"**Chapter LX: The Treaty of Kyoto** The great hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace had been chosen as the venue for a momentous occasion, the likes of which had not been seen in the modern age. Flags of the involved nations stood side by side, symbolizing a cautious camaraderie forged in the aftermath of conflict. The leaders of the Great Japanese Empire, the Korean Empire, and the beleaguered representatives from the Russian Empire and the Great Qing Empire gathered to finalize a peace treaty that would redraw the geopolitical landscape of East Asia. General Yamada, the esteemed Japanese military strategist, sat across from Count Alexei, the chief Russian envoy, their expressions betraying the gravity of the negotiations that had preceded this day. Emperor Meiji of Japan and Emperor Sunjong of the Korean Empire exchanged glances, a silent acknowledgment of their shared victories and sacrifices. Count Alexei cleared his throat, breaking the palpable tension, \\"We, the representatives of the Russian Empire, come to this table in a spirit of reconciliation. The valor displayed by the forces of Japan and Korea has not gone unnoticed, and we seek a lasting peace.\\" General Yamada responded, his tone firm yet diplomatic, \\"The Great Japanese Empire values the courage of all who fought.

It is a testament to our resolve to ensure the stability and prosperity of East Asia, free from external interference.\\" Emperor Sunjong, nodding in agreement, added, \\"The Korean Empire, reborn through the flames of war, stands committed to fostering peace with its neighbors under the protection of Japan. Together, we shall stride towards a promising future.\\" The Qing representative, a dignified elder named Minister Li, who had watched his empire's influence wane, spoke next. \\"The Great Qing Empire recognizes the new balance of power in East Asia. In the spirit of peace, we shall respect the terms set forth in this treaty.\\" Count Alexei then formally announced the Russian Empire's concession, \\"In acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by all sides, the Russian Empire will relinquish its claims and influence in Manchuria and Korea, focusing henceforth on strengthening the bonds of peace and cooperation with our neighbors to the east.\\" General Yamada, turning to a page in the document that lay before him, delineated the final, crucial terms, \\"Furthermore, this treaty establishes a framework for economic and cultural exchanges, ensuring that the scars of war give way to bridges of understanding and growth.\\" As each representative affixed their signature to the treaty, a collective sigh of relief filled the room, followed by a cautious optimism. The Treaty of Kyoto, as it would be known to history, was not merely an agreement between nations; it was a declaration of a collective aspiration for a world governed by principles of sovereignty, respect, and mutual development. Outside, beneath the expansive sky, the city of Kyoto bore witness to the dawn of a new chapter in East Asian history. The echoes of the past, with its turbulence and strife, slowly receded, as the peoples of Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and even the distant lands of Russia and the Qing Empire, looked forward to forging a path of peace and prosperity. The Treaty of Kyoto, hence, stood not just as a monument to the resolution of the Russo-Japanese War but as a beacon of hope—a hope that diplomacy and understanding might prevail over the specters of war and conquest in the years to come."},{"prompt":"What shows do most kids watch on YouTube","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, kids' viewing habits on YouTube are incredibly diverse, encompassing a wide range of content from unboxing videos and toy reviews to educational content and episodes or clips from popular kids' TV shows.

I don't want a raycast to collide with a wall whose normal is facing away from the raycast direction. How can I account for this programmically? Would the dot product help here","completion":"Yes, using the dot product can indeed help you determine whether a ray should collide with a wall depending on the direction the wall's normal is facing relative to the raycast's direction. This technique is rooted in understanding how dot products can indicate the angle between two vectors. In 3D programming and game development, a raycast typically has a starting point and a direction. Similarly, a surface (like your wall) has a normal vector that points perpendicularly away from its face. The angle between the ray's direction and the wall's normal can decide if the ray should \\"see\\" the wall or not. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can use the dot product for this purpose: # Understanding the Dot Product The dot product of two vectors **A** and **B** is calculated as: [ text{Dot}(A, B) = ||A|| times ||B|| times cos(theta) ] Where: - ( ||A|| ) and ( ||B|| ) are the magnitudes (lengths) of vectors **A** and **B**, - ( cos(theta) ) is the cosine of the angle ( theta ) between **A** and **B**. The key part to note is that the dot product can tell us about the angle between two vectors: - If the dot product is positive, the angle ( theta ) between **A** and **B** is less than 90 degrees. - If the dot product is zero, the vectors are perpendicular. - If the dot product is negative, the angle ( theta ) is greater than 90 degrees. # Applying to Your Scenario Given: - **N** is the normalized vector normal to the wall, - **D** is the normalized direction vector of the ray. Calculate the dot product ( text{Dot}(N, D) ). You can decide on how to handle the collision based on the sign of this value. # Implementation Concept (Pseudocode) \`\`\`cpp Vector3 wallNormal = GetWallNormal(); // Normal vector of the wall Vector3 rayDirection = GetRayDirection(); // Direction vector of the ray // Assuming both vectors are normalized. If not, normalize them before proceeding. float dot = DotProduct(wallNormal, rayDirection); if(dot < 0){ // The wall's normal is facing towards the ray, indicating potential visibility or collision // Proceed with handling the collision } else{ // The wall's normal is facing away from the ray, ignore the collision } \`\`\` # Dot Product Function (If Needed) Here's a simple dot product function example if you're implementing from scratch: \`\`\`cpp float DotProduct(Vector3 a, Vector3 b) { return a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y + a.z * b.z; } \`\`\` This method ensures your raycast system respects the orientation of walls, allowing for more physically accurate simulations or game mechanics. It efficiently filters out walls that should be invisible or non-collidable based on their facing direction relative to the ray."},{"prompt":"Write a Chaotic story where Tom accidentally sets all the monsters from Perim into Earth, is threatened with account termination and bumps into a allergic kid who happens to see monsters (This is a crossover story)","completion":"In the quiet room lit only by the flickering light of a computer screen, Tom's fingers danced with a nervous energy over the keyboard. His focus was unyielding, locked onto the screen displaying the world of Perim, a realm where chaotic monsters roamed wild and battles determined fate. But as every avid player of Chaotic knows, crossing the line between Perim and Earth was a forbidden act, an unwritten rule. Tonight, driven by curiosity and a hacker's pride, Tom was about to break that rule. Typing in a complex sequence of commands, Tom initiated an algorithm that was supposed to let him access Perim's creatures in augmented reality, bringing them to life right in his room. With anticipation building inside him, he watched as the computer executed the commands. Then, there was a spark, not just from the computer, but from reality itself. The room vibrated with an unseen energy, and in an instant, it wasn't just his room. Monsters from Perim, in all their terrifying glory, began to pour into Earth's reality at an exponential rate. As Tom looked on in horror, realizing the magnitude of his mistake, a digital window popped up on his screen: **WARNING: Unauthorized Cross-Reality Breach Detected. Your account is subject to IMMEDIATE termination.** But the digital threat paled in comparison to the real-world chaos that Tom had unleashed. Creatures of every shape and size roamed the streets, causing pandemonium. Tom, feeling a surge of responsibility amidst his fear, knew he had to find a way to revert the chaos. In a desperate bid, Tom ran out into the crowded streets, his mind racing with possible solutions. That's when he quite literally bumped into Alex, a scrawny kid with glasses too big for his face, sneezing uncontrollably. \\"Are you okay?\\" Tom asked, more out of civility than genuine concern at the moment. Alex looked up at him with watery eyes, \\"Allergies...but did you see it? The monster?\\" He sniffed. \\"I always see them, but today everyone else can too.\\" Tom's heart skipped a beat. This kid, allergic and apparently capable of seeing monsters even before the breach, could be the key to fixing everything. \\"Listen, I need your help. I know this is going to sound crazy, but—\\" \\"Crazy?\\" Alex interrupted. \\"Dude, with Raznus walking down Main Street, I don't think 'crazy' is in today's vocabulary.\\" Together, they concocted a plan. Using Alex's unique ability to see monsters and Tom's knowledge of Perim's creatures, they decided to lure the monsters into a digital trap Tom could construct if he could regain access to his Chaotic account. Breaking into a run, they headed towards Tom's house, dodging havoc and monsters alike. Tom's mind was racing, not just with fear and adrenaline, but with codes and algorithms that might just reverse his catastrophic mistake. Reaching his computer, Tom began to program furiously, his fingers once again dancing over the keys. Meanwhile, Alex, in an odd display of courage, leaned out the window, shouting and sneezing to attract the attention of nearby monsters, guiding them towards their location. Just as a particularly large creature loomed over their safe haven, threatening to shatter it to pieces, Tom hit the enter key. The world seemed to hold its breath. And then, one by one, the monsters began to vanish, sucked back into the digital realm of Perim. Exhaustion overcame them as the last echoes of chaos faded. The digital warning on Tom's screen blinked out, replaced by a message: **Account Status: Under Review. We hope you've learned from this experience, [User].** Tom let out a long breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. He looked over at Alex, managing a weak smile. \\"Thanks,\\" he said. \\"You saved us.\\" Alex simply nodded, already in the throes of another sneezing fit. But through the incessant sneezes, a grin was clear on his face. Together, they had averted a disaster that would have surely rewritten the boundaries between worlds. Yet, in the quiet aftermath, both understood that the line between reality and the digital world should never be crossed again. And Tom, with a newfound respect for the monsters of Perim, realized that some things are better left within the confines of screens and imagination."},{"prompt":"Dot product difference in 2 vs 3 dimensions","completion":"The dot product, also known as the scalar product, is a fundamental operation in vector algebra. It takes two vectors and returns a scalar (a number, not a vector) that reflects the degree to which the vectors align with each other. The dot product can be calculated in any number of dimensions, but here we'll focus on its application in 2 and 3 dimensions. # In 2 Dimensions For vectors **A** = (a₁, a₂) and **B** = (b₁, b₂) in a 2-dimensional space, the dot product is calculated using the formula: **A** ⋅ **B** = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ This formula effectively multiplies each component of the vectors together (a₁ with b₁, and a₂ with b₂) and then adds these products. # In 3 Dimensions For vectors **A** = (a₁, a₂, a₃) and **B** = (b₁, b₂, b₃) in a 3-dimensional space, the dot product formula is extended to account for the additional dimension: **A** ⋅ **B** = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + a₃b₃ So, in addition to the multiplications and addition of the components in the first two dimensions, you also multiply the third components (a₃ and b₃) and add this to the sum. # Difference Between 2 and 3 Dimensions The key difference between calculating the dot product in 2 and 3 dimensions is simply the consideration of an extra component in each vector when in 3 dimensions. You're adding one more term to the sum (a₃b₃). Conceptually, however, the operation is essentially the same across dimensions: you're multiplying corresponding components of the vectors and adding those products together. The result, in both 2D and 3D, gives you a measure of how much the vectors align. When the dot product is positive, it means the vectors have a component in the same direction; when negative, it indicates they point in opposite directions; and when zero, it means the vectors are perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other, having no component of one in the direction of the other. Regardless of the dimension, the geometric interpretation of the dot product can also be expressed in terms of the magnitudes of the vectors (**|A|** and **|B|**) and the cosine of the angle (θ) between them: **A** ⋅ **B** = **|A|** **|B|** cos(θ). This interpretation remains valid and is consistent across any number of dimensions, highlighting the dot product's role in understanding the geometric and algebraic properties of vectors in multidimensional spaces."},{"prompt":"Write a story in Chaotic where Tom and Kaz accidentally port the Perim creatures into Earth, the CodeMasters threaten to ban both of them, and they bump into an allergic kid who is frequently called Zick, who can see monsters (This is a crossover story btw)","completion":"In the heart of the chaotic hustle and bustle of a small, seemingly ordinary town, Tom and Kaz, two avid players of the Chaotic trading card game, found themselves embroiled in an adventure beyond their wildest dreams. Known for diving deep into the world of Perim through the virtual reality portals in their game, they had never imagined that their actions would blend the boundaries between two worlds. One evening, as the purple hue of twilight enveloped the sky, Tom and Kaz huddled together in Kaz's basement, surrounded by their extensive collection of Chaotic cards and memorabilia. They were attempting something no one in their world had tried before - to augment the connection between Earth and Perim, enhancing their gaming experience to unprecedented levels. However, their experiment took a dramatic turn when they inadvertently created a portal that did not just allow them to visit Perim, but also allowed its creatures to cross over into Earth. As the first of the Perim creatures emerged, a towering, fearsome creature with eyes gleaming in the dim light of the basement, Tom and Kaz realized the gravity of their mistake. The creature, although bewildered, was just the first of many. Soon, their quiet town was teeming with creatures of all shapes and sizes, from the majestic OverWorlders to the cunning UnderWorlders, turning their world upside down. Panic ensued among the townsfolk, with reports of bizarre creatures popping up all over town. Amidst this chaos, the CodeMasters, the legendary overseers of the Chaotic world, intervened. They appeared before Tom and Kaz, their expressions stern and unforgiving, threatening to ban them from Chaotic for endangering both worlds with their recklessness. Just when things couldn't seem any more dire, Tom and Kaz bumped into a peculiar kid known to the town as Zick. Zick was an odd one, frequently seen chatting away to thin air or sneezing uncontrollably for no apparent reason. It was rumored he was allergic to just about everything. However, the truth was far more incredible; Zick could see monsters. Unseen by ordinary humans, these monsters were as real to Zick as the nose on his face, and now, he was witnessing an inexplicable surge in their numbers. The trio, an unlikely gathering of heroes, found themselves bound together by fate to resolve the crisis at hand. With the combined abilities of Tom and Kaz's knowledge of the Perim creatures and Zick's unique sight, they embarked on a mission to send the creatures back to their world before the CodeMasters' ban came into effect. Their journey was fraught with challenges, as they navigated through a town now riddled with chaos. With each creature they encountered, Zick's allergies acted as a bizarre compass, guiding them towards their targets. They faced fierce battles, forged unexpected alliances, and learned invaluable lessons about responsibility and friendship. In the end, through a daring plan that utilized the very portal they had mistakenly created, Tom, Kaz, and Zick managed to return the Perim creatures to their rightful world. The CodeMasters, impressed by their resolve and the bravery they displayed, decided to spare them the ban, with a stern warning about the dangers of meddling with forces beyond their understanding. As life in the small town returned to normal, Tom, Kaz, and Zick emerged not just as heroes, but as close friends. They had saved two worlds from utter chaos and, in the process, discovered the true depth of their courage and the unbreakable bond that shared adventures could forge. The portal between Earth and Perim was sealed, but the memories of the extraordinary events that unfolded remained a testament to the incredible adventure that bridged two worlds, brought together by a mistake, but resolved by the unity and determination of three unlikely heroes."},{"prompt":"Write the 2 franchises used in this story and win a prize","completion":"The two franchises used in the story are: 1. Chaotic - A franchise that revolves around a trading card game, a television series, and an interactive website, where players can enter a code from their physical trading cards to play online. The story draws upon the world of Perim, the creatures, and the concept of players being able to transport themselves into the game's universe. 2. Monster Allergy - This franchise includes comic books and an animated television series that follows the story of Ezekiel Zick (often referred to as Zick), a young boy who has the ability to see and interact with monsters. He is also known for his numerous allergies, some of which are triggered by the monsters themselves. Congratulations on identifying them! In the world of storytelling, merging these two universes brings about a unique narrative that combines the adventurous and fantastical elements of both franchises."},{"prompt":"Your prize is free hugs (virtural)","completion":"Thank you!

Unbeknownst to Tom, Kaz, and Zick, they too were grappling with the consequences of the portal's activation but from a different angle. Sarah and Peyton, ever the resourceful duo, were initially caught off-guard by the appearance of Perim creatures. However, they quickly adapted to the situation. Recognizing the gravity of what had transpired, they embarked on a mission to maintain a semblance of order amidst the chaos. Their journey led them to coordinate with local authorities and the Chaotic community, disseminating information on how to peacefully coexist with the Perim creatures while a solution was being sought. While Peyton utilized his in-depth knowledge of the creatures to advise on non-confrontational interaction, Sarah took charge of logistics, making sure that the townspeople had access to safe shelters and resources. Their swift and effective response played a crucial role in preventing panic and ensuring that both humans and creatures remained unharmed during this tumultuous time. On the other side of the adventure, and perhaps in a different dimension of trouble altogether, was Elena Potato from the Monster Allergy universe. Unaware of the convergence occurring in Tom and Kaz's world, Elena faced her own set of challenges. With Zick suddenly gone, she found herself at the forefront of handling monster-related issues in Oldmill Village. Elena, possessing a strong and courageous spirit, rose to the challenge. She worked closely with Timothy-Moth, Zick's loyal talking cat, to manage the surge in monster activity, which had unexpectedly increased perhaps due to the rippling effects of the portal's activation. Without knowing the source of the upheaval, Elena relied on her wit, her growing understanding of the monster world, and her steadfast determination to protect her town. While these adventures unfolded separately, they were intrinsically linked by the chaos ensuing from the portal's opening. Sarah and Peyton in one town and Elena in another demonstrated impressive resilience and leadership. Their efforts, though unbeknownst to each other, were parallel battles in a war against a shared, albeit unknowingly, adversary. In the end, as Tom, Kaz, and Zick worked to resolve the crisis at its core, the valiant endeavors of Sarah, Peyton, and Elena ensured that their worlds remained intact, setting the stage for an eventual reunion where tales of their separate adventures would be shared in awe and laughter, highlighting the strength found in friendship and unity even when faced with the most unpredictable of circumstances."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[역시 가르친 보람이 있어.] 민국이는 첫 발걸음을 떼는 게 어려워서 그렇지 첫 발걸음만 뗐다 하면 뭐든 잘해냈다. 연기도 그랬고, 한글도 그랬다. 어느새 보쌈을 먹은 구성현 부장과 여자가 일어섰다. “사장님, 계산이요.” “잘 드셨어요?” “네, 아주 맛있게 먹었네요. 직원들도 좋아할 것 같아요.” 구성현 부장은 방긋 웃으며 포장된 보쌈까지 야무지게 챙겼다. [구성현. 제법 입맛이 까다로운 사람인데, 맛있다고 할 정도면 어느 정도 인정받은 건가. 서비스 점수라도 더 챙겨야지.] 나는 얼른 조르르 달려가서 구성현 부장과 여자에게 인사를 했다. “안녕히 가세요. 또 와주세요.” “응. 또 올게. 사장님, 아드님 정말 잘 키우셨네요.” “감사합니다. 또 오세요.” “네에.” 구성현 부장과 여자는 가게 문을 열고 나갔다. 아빠가 환하게 웃으며 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 공부하기도 바쁠 텐데 아빠 가게까지 나와서 고생이 많아. 아빠가 저녁으로 보쌈 싸줄 테니까, 엄마랑 가서 맛있게 먹어.” “녜에!” 나는 오랜만에 어깨춤도 춰줬다. “그나저나 심사위원들 우리 집은 빼먹었나. 왜 심사위원 같은 사람들은 안 오나 몰라.” [아빠, 좀 전의 그 사람들이 효진 그룹 심사위원들이야. 아빠, 제발 눈치 좀!] “성국아, 아빠 떨어졌나 보다.” “아빠, 붙을 거야. 꼭!” “역시 아들밖에 없구나.” 아빠는 나를 안아 들었다. * * * 김미영이 아침부터 일찍 집에 방문했다. 오늘은 바로 민국이의 밥벌이 기회를 잡을 오디션 날이기 때문이다. 나는 아침 일찍 일어나서 배부른 엄마 대신 민국이를 씻기고 머리도 빗겼다. “형아, 여기 여기.” 민국이는 머리를 이리저리 쓸어 올리며 신경을 썼다. “밍구가, 형아 청담동에서 머리하던 사람이야. 가만히 좀 있어.” “응.” 김미영이 가방을 챙기더니 우리를 봤다. “성국이가 민국이 참 잘 챙기네요.” 이때, 엄마가 부른 배를 잡고 걸어 나왔다. “언니, 송혜선 씨가 다른 소속사 접촉하고 있다는데… 걱정이네요. 임선미도 잠정적 은퇴 상황이고, 아역 배우들은 활동, 한계가 있잖아요.” “성국이 엄마. 우리 원래 성국이 은퇴할 때까지만 이 일 하다가 접으려고 했잖아요. 여기까지 온 것도 정말 대단한 거죠.” “그렇긴 해도… 아깝잖아요. 그동안 사업도 잘됐고.” “성국이랑 임선미 덕분에 자리 잡았지만, 이 일 그만둔다고 우리 이제 굶어 죽는 거 아니잖아요.” [무슨 소리야? 매니지먼트를 그만둔다고?] 나는 김미영을 쳐다봤다. “절대 안 돼!” 내 소리에 놀란 김미영과 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 왜 그래?” “내가 할 거예요. 회사 내가 할 거라고요.” 나는 단호하게 말했다. “성국아, 넌 내년이면 유학 갈 거잖아.” “유학 다녀와서 할 거라고요! 회사!” 나는 주먹을 앙 쥐었다. 김미영이 고개를 끄덕였다. “그래, 이 일은 어쩌면 성국이 덕분에 시작한 일이니까 성국이 의사가 제일 중요하지. 우리도 좀 더 내실 있는 배우들 위주로 팀을 다시 꾸려보는 거 생각해봐요.” “아니요!” 나는 고개를 저었다. “성국아, 배우들 말고 뭐?” “아이돌!” “아이돌?” “네에. 아이돌 그룹을 만들어야 해요.” 이제 앞으로 대한민국 연예계는 아이돌이 움직인다. 이미 자리 잡은 ST를 비롯한 수많은 기획사들이 아이돌 그룹을 키워내고, 대한민국은 K-POP 열풍을 일으킨다. 삼전 그룹에 있을 당시 연예 기획사에 관심이 있어서 시스템과 교육과정을 훑어본 적이 있었다. “성국아, 음악 쪽은 우리가 잘 몰라서….” 김미영이 난색을 표했다. “흠…. 조금만 기다려 주세요. 제가 공부하고 와서 꼭 아이돌 그룹 만들 거예요.” “그래, 알았어. 성국아, 우선은 오늘 민국이 데리고 오디션장 가자.” [진짜 어서 크고 싶다. 쑥쑥.] * * * 민국이가 오디션을 볼 배역은 16부작 미니시리즈의 주인공 부부 아들이었다. 주인공 부부가 아들을 두고 이혼했다가 다시 만난다는 그렇고 그런 이야기였다. 나는 대기실에 앉아 아이들을 매의 눈으로 살폈다. [이 중에 나중에 좀 눈여겨볼 만한 얼굴들이 있나.] 다들 눈만 동그랗게 큰 개성 없는 얼굴이었다. 민국이는 옆에서 열심히 대본을 읽고 또 읽었다. 나는 민국이 엉덩이를 토닥거렸다. [그래, 머리가 나쁘면 열심히 해야 하는 거야.] 민국이는 나를 한번 보고 씨익 웃더니 대본을 또 읽고 또 읽었다. “아빠. 아빠, 오늘 밤 나 아빠랑 엄마랑 손잡고.” “민국아. 여기에 좀 더 애절한 감정을 섞어봐야지. 엄마랑 아빠랑 네 곁에서 안 자고, 이제 너 혼자 잔다고 생각을 해봐.” “히잉. 밍구기 시로.” “그치? 그 감정을 이 대사에 녹여내.” “응, 형아.” 내가 민국이를 지도하는 사이에 한 명의 남자아이가 들어왔다. 내 또래로 보이는 남자아이는 꽤 익숙한 얼굴이었다. 바로 내 인생의 첫 경쟁자였던 덕풍 제지의 손자 이재희였다. 민국이의 첫 오디션 때 내가 도와준 덕분에 작은 배역을 맡고는 그 뒤로 간간이 배역을 맡는 것 같았다. 이재희의 곁에는 늘 보이던 엄마가 보이지 않았다. 대신 젊은 여자가 보였다. [소속사 들어간 건가….] 나는 민국이를 두고 이재희에게 다가갔다. “재희야, 나 기억해?” 해맑게 웃으며 접근했지만, 이재희는 경계의 눈빛으로 나를 봤다. “난 동생 오디션 따라왔어.” [이재희, 넌 내 경쟁자가 절대 될 수 없어. 난 이제 아역 은퇴했다고.] 이재희는 그때서야 눈빛을 풀고 알은척을 했다. “어, 안녕. 성국이 맞지? 오랜만이야.” “기억하네.” “응. 덕분에 오디션 붙었잖아.” [돌머리는 아니군. 상황 파악 제대로 하는 것 보니.] 나는 얼른 젊은 여자에게도 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요. 전성국입니다.” “어머, 네가 그 유명한 다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 성국이구나.” “저는 잘 기억이 안 나요. 어릴 적이라서요.” “나 완전 너 팬이었어.” 여자는 얼른 지갑을 열더니 명함을 한 장 내밀었다. “아직도 아역 하니?” “지금은 안 해요.” “아쉽네. 이건 내 명함이야.” 나는 한눈에 기획사 이름을 기억해냈다. 신성 기획. 바로 신성중이 있던 기획사였다. “재희도 우리 신성 기획 소속이야.” [쯧쯧, 보나 마나 노예 계약일 텐데.] 씁쓸한 마음이 들었다. 이때, 김미영이 뒤에서 다가왔다. “안녕하세요. 성국이 담당하고 있는 SKJ 김미영 대표입니다.” “전 신성 기획 아역 담당 이주미입니다. 반갑습니다.” 두 사람이 대화를 나누는 사이에 나는 얼른 이재희에게 속삭였다. “신성 기획이랑 얼마나 계약했어?” “7년.” “그렇게 오래?” “근데 일도 잘 안 잡아주고, 난 완전 찬밥이야.” “흠… 재희야, 신성 기획이랑 계약 끝나면 날 찾아와.” 이재희의 눈이 동그래졌다. 이재희는 그사이 키도 제법 크고 얼굴에 젖살도 빠졌다. 아주 잘생긴 얼굴은 아니었지만, 호감 가는 얼굴이었다. 이재희는 순진하게 물었다. “성국아, 널 찾아가면 뭐가 있어?” “너희 집 망했다며?” 이재희의 눈빛이 곧 어두워졌다. “응.” “어머니는?” “엄마는 일하러 다니셔. 맨날 다리가 아프시대. 내가 얼른 돈 벌어 우리 엄마 호강시켜 드려야 해.” 그동안 사정은 더 나빠진 것 같았다. 그나마 다행인 것은 재희의 어머니가 정신은 차린 모양이었다. “재희야, 아역 생활도 학교생활도 착실히 하고. 친구 골라 사귀고, 나쁜 애들이랑 어울리지 마. 괜한 사진 같은 것도 찍히지 말고. 그래야 나중에 연예인 생활 할 때 별 탈 없을 거야.” “노력할게.” “노력이 아니라 꼭 그래야 해. 알아들어?” “응.” 재희는 고개를 끄덕였다. “신성 기획이랑도 좋게 헤어지고. 집안 일으켜 세우고 싶으면, 7년 후에 나 찾아와.” “성국아, 널 어떻게 찾아가?” “SKJ 엔터테인먼트는 계속 있을 거니까, 꼭 찾아와.” “응. 꼭 찾아갈게.” 이때, 이주미가 이재희를 불렀다. “재희야, 다음 네 차례야. 대사 다 외웠지?” “네에.” 이재희는 자리에서 일어나며 나를 잡았다. “성국아, 고마워.” “7년 후에 보자.” “응.” 이재희는 한결 밝은 얼굴로 오디션장으로 들어갔다. “형아!” 뒤에서 민국이가 나를 찾았다. “형아! 형아! 민국이 응아!” [하아.] 민국이는 오디션장 들어가기 전에 응아를 하는 나쁜 버릇을 가지고 있었다. “알았어. 참아.” “못 참아, 형아!” 나는 얼른 민국이의 손을 잡고 화장실로 달려갔다. “형아, 바지. 어서! 나 급해!” 나는 얼른 민국이의 바지를 내렸다. 민국이는 변기에 앉자마자 곧 마음의 평화를 얻었다. “휴… 시원해엥.” 쏴아아-. 나는 코를 꽉 잡은 채 변기 물을 내렸다.

Director Gu Seong-hyeon smiled slightly, then opened his wallet and pulled out a ten-thousand-won note. \\"This is for helping your dad out. It's from me.\\" \\"It's okay. I'll just take your kind thoughts.\\" At my response, Gu Seong-hyeon burst into laughter. \\"You're not going to take it?\\" \\"Yes. I'm helping my dad, so I'll get my allowance from him.\\" \\"You're a smart kid. Mr. Owner, please pack three servings of bossam. I'll take them when I leave.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon cheerfully placed an additional order. I quickly went back to my seat and perked up my ears to listen to the conversation between Director Gu Seong-hyeon and the woman. \\"The place is cozy.\\" \\"The Sooyou branch is small too, but the taste is above average.\\" \\"The Sooyou branch seems to have gained some fame, but this place is small.\\" \\"Let's try the taste.\\" \\"Let's do that...\\" Just then, my dad came out with the bossam. Unaware of anything, my dad placed the bossam down as usual and explained. \\"The shrimp sauce is directly sourced by the owner's mother from Ganggyeong, where she runs a salted seafood business. Try it. It's different from what you buy in stores.\\" \\"Thank you. We'll enjoy it.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon politely greeted and started eating the bossam. My dad then came over to us and offered a drink. \\"Seong-guk, do you want some cider?\\" [Sigh, dad, just go into the kitchen. Don't loiter around and lose points unnecessarily.] I quickly pushed my dad into the kitchen. \\"Dad, go to the kitchen. We have guests.\\" \\"Alright, alright. So-young, since we have guests, keep an eye on the kids.\\" \\"Okay. Don't worry.\\" I quickly took out a book from my bag. Min-guk poked me in the side, and he also took out a script. It was for an audition we were going to see in a few days. Min-guk flipped through the pages and started reading the script without the help of mom or me. I looked at Min-guk with surprise. \\"Min-guk, you don't need your brother anymore?\\" \\"Yeah. Ming-gu can read it all by himself.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yeah! Brother, want to read?\\" \\"Sure.\\" Min-guk smiled slyly and continued reading the script. \\"Dad. I want to live with both mom and dad. Jeong-hwan likes both. I can't choose just one.\\" Min-guk read without missing a single character. I looked at Min-guk with surprise. \\"Brother, Ming-gu reads well, right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I nodded unconsciously and patted Min-guk on the back. [It's worth teaching him.] Min-guk found it hard to take the first step, but once he did, he did well in everything. It was the same with acting and learning Hangul. Soon, Director Gu Seong-hyeon and the woman who had finished their bossam stood up. \\"Owner, the bill, please.\\" \\"Did you enjoy your meal?\\" \\"Yes, we really enjoyed it. The staff will like it too.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon smiled and neatly packed the bossam. [Gu Seong-hyeon. He's quite picky about taste, so if he says it's good, does that mean we're somewhat recognized? I should gather more service points.] I quickly ran over to Director Gu Seong-hyeon and the woman to say goodbye. \\"Goodbye. Please come again.\\" \\"Yeah. I'll come again. Owner, you've raised your son well.\\" \\"Thank you. Please come again.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon and the woman left the store. My dad smiled brightly and patted my head. \\"Seong-guk, you must be busy studying, but you're helping out at dad's store too. I'll pack some bossam for dinner, so go eat it with mom.\\" \\"Yes!\\" I even danced a little shoulder dance for the first time in a while. \\"I wonder if the judges skipped our house. Why don't people like judges come?\\" [Dad, those people just now were judges from Hyojin Group. Dad, please be more observant!] \\"Dad must have failed.\\" \\"Dad, you'll pass. For sure!\\" \\"You're the only one I have, son.\\" Dad lifted me up. * * * Kim Mi-young visited our house early in the morning. Today was the day Min-guk had the opportunity to secure his livelihood through an audition. I woke up early in the morning, washed Min-guk, and combed his hair instead of the full-bellied mom. \\"Brother, here, here.\\" Min-guk was particular about his hair, brushing it this way and that. \\"Ming-gu, your brother used to get his hair done in Cheongdam-dong. Stay still.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Kim Mi-young was packing her bag when she saw us. \\"Seong-guk really takes good care of Min-guk.\\" Then, mom, holding her belly, walked out. \\"Sister, I heard Song Hye-sun is contacting other agencies... I'm worried. Im Sun-mi is also in a semi-retirement situation, and there are limits to child actors' activities.\\" \\"Seong-guk's mom. We were originally planning to quit this business when Seong-guk retires. It's really amazing that we've come this far.\\" \\"But still... It's a shame. The business was going well.\\" \\"Thanks to Seong-guk and Im Sun-mi, we've established ourselves, but quitting won't leave us starving.\\" [What? Quitting management?] I looked at Kim Mi-young. \\"Absolutely not!\\" Surprised by my voice, Kim Mi-young and mom looked at me. \\"Seong-guk, what's wrong?\\" \\"I'll do it. I'll run the company.\\" I spoke firmly. \\"Seong-guk, you're going to study abroad next year.\\" \\"I'll do it after I come back from studying abroad! The company!\\" I clenched my fist. Kim Mi-young nodded. \\"Alright, this business started because of Seong-guk, so his opinion is the most important. Let's think about reorganizing the team with more substantial actors.\\" \\"No!\\" I shook my head. \\"Seong-guk, besides actors, what?\\" \\"Idols!\\" \\"Idols?\\" \\"Yes. We need to create an idol group.\\" From now on, the Korean entertainment industry will be driven by idols. Already established companies like ST and many others are nurturing idol groups, and South Korea is creating a K-POP craze. I had an interest in entertainment agencies while at Samjeon Group, so I had looked into their systems and training programs. \\"Seong-guk, we don't know much about music...\\" Kim Mi-young showed reluctance. \\"Hmm... Just wait a little. I'll study and definitely create an idol group.\\" \\"Alright, got it. Seong-guk, let's take Min-guk to the audition site for now.\\" [I really want to grow up fast. So fast.] * * * The role Min-guk was auditioning for was the son of the main couple in a 16-episode miniseries. It was a typical story where the main couple divorces, leaving their son behind, and then reunites. I sat in the waiting room, eyeing the children like a hawk. [Among them, are there any faces worth noting for later?] They all had big, round eyes but lacked individuality. Min-guk was next to me, diligently reading and re-reading the script. I patted Min-guk on the back. [Right, if you're not smart, you have to work hard.] Min-guk looked at me once, smiled, and continued reading and re-reading the script. \\"Dad. Dad, I want to hold hands with mom and dad tonight.\\" \\"Min-guk. You need to mix a bit more desperate emotion here. Think about how you're going to sleep alone now, not with mom and dad by your side.\\" \\"Sniff. Ming-gu is sad.\\" \\"Right? Put that emotion into this line.\\" \\"Okay, brother.\\" While I was coaching Min-guk, a boy entered. He seemed to be my age and had a familiar face. It was Lee Jae-hee, my first rival in life and the grandson of Deokpung Paper. Thanks to my help during Min-guk's first audition, he managed to get a small role and seemed to have gotten a few roles since then. Jae-hee's mom, who was always by his side, was nowhere to be seen. Instead, a young woman was present. [Did he join an agency?] I left Min-guk and approached Jae-hee. \\"Jae-hee, do you remember me?\\" I approached him with a bright smile, but Jae-hee looked at me warily. \\"I'm here because of my brother's audition.\\" [Jae-hee, you can never be my rival. I've retired from child acting.] Jae-hee then relaxed and acknowledged me. \\"Oh, hi. Seong-guk, right? Long time no see.\\" \\"You remember.\\" \\"Yeah. Thanks to you, I passed the audition.\\" [Not a blockhead. He understands the situation well.] I quickly greeted the young woman as well. \\"Hello. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"Oh my, you're the famous Seong-guk from 'Five Boys and a Baby Basket.'\\" \\"I don't remember well. I was young.\\" \\"I was a huge fan of yours.\\" The woman quickly opened her wallet and handed me a business card. \\"Are you still doing child acting?\\" \\"I'm not doing it now.\\" \\"That's a shame. Here's my card.\\" I memorized the name of the agency at a glance. Shinseong Planning. It was the agency where Shinseong Middle was. \\"Jae-hee is also under Shinseong Planning.\\" [Tsk, tsk, probably a slave contract.] I felt bitter. Then, Kim Mi-young approached from behind. \\"Hello. I'm SKJ's representative, Kim Mi-young, in charge of Seong-guk.\\" \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, in charge of child actors at Shinseong Planning. Nice to meet you.\\" As the two exchanged words, I whispered to Jae-hee. \\"How long did you sign with Shinseong Planning?\\" \\"7 years.\\" \\"That long?\\" \\"But they hardly get me any work. I'm totally neglected.\\" \\"Hmm... Jae-hee, when your contract with Shinseong Planning ends, come find me.\\" Jae-hee's eyes widened. Jae-hee had grown quite a bit and lost his baby fat. Although not extremely handsome, he had a likable face. Jae-hee naively asked. \\"Seong-guk, what will I find if I come to you?\\" \\"Your family's business went under, right?\\" Jae-hee's eyes darkened. \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Your mother?\\" \\"Mom's working. She says her legs hurt all the time. I need to earn money quickly to give my mom a comfortable life.\\" It seemed their situation had worsened since then. At least, it was good that Jae-hee's mother had come to her senses. \\"Jae-hee, do well in both school and child acting. Choose your friends wisely, don't hang out with bad kids, and don't get caught in unnecessary photos. That way, you won't have any problems when you become an entertainer.\\" \\"I'll try.\\" \\"It's not about trying. You have to do it. Got it?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" Jae-hee nodded. \\"Part ways with Shinseong Planning amicably. If you want to revive your family's fortunes, come find me after 7 years.\\" \\"Seong-guk, how can I find you?\\" \\"SKJ Entertainment will still be here, so make sure to come find me.\\" \\"Yeah. I'll definitely come find you.\\" Then, Lee Joo-mi called Jae-hee. \\"Jae-hee, it's your turn next. Did you memorize all your lines?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Jae-hee stood up and grabbed me. \\"Seong-guk, thank you.\\" \\"See you in 7 years.\\" \\"Yeah.\\" Jae-hee entered the audition room with a much brighter face. \\"Brother!\\" Min-guk was looking for me from behind. \\"Brother! Brother! Min-guk needs to poop!\\" [Sigh.] Min-guk had a bad habit of needing to poop right before entering the audition room. \\"Got it. Hold it in.\\" \\"I can't, brother!\\" I quickly grabbed Min-guk's hand and ran to the bathroom. \\"Brother, pants. Quick! I'm in a hurry!\\" I quickly pulled down Min-guk's pants. As soon as Min-guk sat on the toilet, he found peace of mind. \\"Phew... So refreshing.\\" Swoosh. I held my nose and flushed the toilet. [Jeon Min-guk, if you fail this audition, you're dead.]"},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[하아, 아빠. 세상 오래 안 살아봐서 모르나 본데, 돈이 곧 행복이라고!] 나는 속으로 버럭 화를 내다 문득 멈칫했다. 저번 생에서 주간지 인터뷰 중에 나에게 삼전 그룹의 후계자로 살아서 행복하냐고 물었던 적이 있었다. 나는 그때 행복하다고 답했다. 하지만 행복하지 않았다. 부모님은 사이가 나빴고, 동생들은 경쟁자들이었다. 누군가 뒤처지기를 바랄 뿐이었다. 아내와의 관계는 서먹했고, 자식들은 사랑했지만 일찍부터 유학을 보내 곁에 두고 보지도 못했다. 뭐만 하면 후계자의 자리를 위협하던 사람들. 주변에 사람은 많았지만, 의지할 사람은 아무도 없었다. 나는 저번 생에서 정말 행복했을까? 아빠가 나를 꼭 안았다. “성국아, 어서 커서 아빠랑 맥주 한잔 해야지.” [아빠, 난 와인. 맥주는 배 나온다고.] 아빠는 나를 안아 들고 내 방으로 들어갔다. “아빠, 나 화장실!” “아차, 깜빡했네. 미안. 아빠가 미안한 김에 화장실 앞까지 비행기 태워줄게.” [아빠, 나 어린애 아니라고.] “자, 갑니다. 아빠 비행기!” 하지만 또 아빠 비위도 맞춰줘야지. 까르르르. [이럴 땐 웃어줘야지.] 내가 웃자 아빠의 웃음소리가 들렸다. [내가 진짜 아빠 업어 키운다, 키워.] * * * “구수영 회장님께서 성국 군을 후원하실 모양입니다. 돌아가신 첫째 아드님의 이름으로 만든 준호 재단의 첫 장학생으로요.” 양 비서는 말을 마치고 전재형 회장의 얼굴을 살폈다. 전재형 회장의 미간이 구겨졌다. 좀처럼 펴질 줄 몰랐다. “이유가 궁금한데…. 왜 삼전이 아니고 효진인 거지?” “잘은 모르지만, 효진 그룹에서 성국 군에게 조건 없는 지원을 약속했다고 합니다.” “우리도 마찬가지 아니었던가.” “하지만 삼전 장학생의 경우 삼전 그룹에 입사하거나, 사회에 나가서 삼전에 관한 일을 할 때 삼전으로부터 자유롭지 못하다는 인식이 있습니다. 성국 군과 가족들은 그 부분이 걸린 모양입니다.” 전재형 회장은 가운뎃손가락으로 구겨진 미간을 폈다. 처음 맛보는 실패였다. 공들인 탑이 무너진 순간이기도 했다. “양 비서, 이제 성국이에게서 손을 떼도록 하지. 우리도 할 만큼 했고, 효진 그룹에서 후원한다니 성국이가 엇나가지만 않는다면 좋은 인재가 될 거야.” “네. 알겠습니다.” “괜찮다면 후원 계획과 출국 일정만 알려주게.” “알아내는 대로 바로 보고하겠습니다.” 전재형 회장은 머리를 싸잡았다. 와인이 딱 한 잔 필요한 타이밍이었지만, 회사라 참았다. ‘성국이에게 왜 이렇게 미련이 남을까?’ 전재형 회장 자신도 이해하지 못하는 미련이었다. 뭘 해도 부족한 태국이 대신 자신의 후계자 재목이라 여겨서일까…. 전재형 회장은 고개를 저었다. 훌륭한 인재야 널렸다. 삼전의 후원이면 줄을 설 인재들도 많았다. 성국이에게 끌리는 건 정말 삼청동 이 선생의 말처럼 부자간의 인연, 그런 느낌이었다. ‘내 아들이었으면… 내 새끼였으면… 내 후계자였으면….’ 전재형 회장은 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. 그러곤 발아래 펼쳐진 서울을 내려다봤다. 분명 다 가졌는데, 단 하나 가지지 못한 것. 그건 후계자였다. * * * 황철수 비서가 보쌈집 테이블 위에 나를 위한 플랜이 가득 담긴 계획표와 학교 카탈로그를 펼쳐 놨다. 설명은 황철수 비서 옆에 앉은 효진가 첫째 딸 구예정이 시작했다. “성국아, 네 영어 실력이 충분히 좋고 토플도 거의 만점이지만 우선 어학연수 겸 사회성을 기르기 위해서 단기 어학 코스를 진행하려고 해.” 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. “그다음에 여기는 우리 동생 준호도 다닌 명문 사립이거든. 우리나라로 치면 중고등학교가 같이 있는 곳인데, 기숙사가 제공되는 학교야. 여기에 입학 허가를 받으려고.” 익숙한 곳이었다. 나는 아니지만, 저번 생에서 내 자식들이 다닌 명문 보딩스쿨이었다. 저번 생에서 내가 직접 자식들을 위해 선택한 보딩스쿨인 만큼 모든 게 완벽했다. 나는 미소를 지었다. “어서 공부하고 싶어요.” “성국아, 넌 그대로만 이쁘게 크자. 그 얼굴이면 나 같으면 공부 안 하고 연예인 했을 거야.” 효진가 둘째이자 막내 구예리가 투덜거렸다. “누나도 같이 가요?” “나도 그 근처 고등학교 좀 다니다 난 편하게 아무 대학이나 갈 거야.” “구예리. 제발 정신 차리고 공부 좀 하자.” “언니, 난 돈 많으니까 편하게 살 거야. 언니나 공부 열심히 해서 회사 물려받아.” “나도 자신이 없어 그래.” 구예정도 투덜거렸다. 사실 효진 그룹의 가장 불행한 지점은 저번 생의 나만큼 똑똑한 이 집 장남 구준호가 일찍 세상을 떠난 일이었다. “성국아, 이제 몇 달 후면 미국 갈 건데, 뭐 하며 지낼 거야?” 구예리가 눈을 반짝이며 물었다. 나는 턱을 매만졌다. “주식 좀 사려고요.” * * * 1998년 7월 코스피는 300선마저 붕괴되고 200선으로 추락한다. 더 이상 떨어질 곳이 없을 것 같자, 땅마저 파고 들어가는 실정이었다. 나는 주식거래소에 앉아서 코스피 지수가 추락하는 화살표를 보며 흐뭇한 표정을 지었다. 같이 온 아빠는 안절부절못했다. “성국아, 요즘 누가 주식을 해. 오늘도 어제보다 더 떨어졌고, 내일은 더 떨어질 거라고 그래. 우리 가지고 있는 삼전 주식도 파는 게 낫지 않을까?” “…….” 나는 입을 꼭 다물고 고개를 저었다. 위기는 곧 기회이다! 이건 개미들이 꼭 기억해야 할 말이었다. 위기에 베팅할 배포가 없으면 부자 될 기회는 잡을 수가 없다. 나는 삼전에 베팅하기로 했다. 남은 돈 2억을 모두! “성국아….” 아빠가 내 등을 딱 잡았다. “아빠, 나만 믿어!” 다음 날 코스피는 좀 더 더 떨어졌다. 삼전 전자 역시 안 떨어질 수가 없었다. 가게에서 나란히 앉아 뉴스를 보던 아빠의 얼굴은 거의 울상이었다. “성국아, 이번 투자는 정말 잘못한 거 같아.” “아빠!” “응?” “투자는 길게 보는 거야. 나 미국 다녀와서 다 팔 거야.” “하아….” 아빠는 나보다 더 절망적인 얼굴이었다. 이때, 가게의 전화가 요란하게 울렸다. 아빠는 축 처진 어깨로 일어났다. “그래, 성국아. 괜찮아. 이젠 아빠가 돈 많이 벌게.” 그러곤 곧 전화를 받았다. “여보세요. 네… 맞습니다. 정말요? 진짜요? 진짜 제가 된 거죠!” 아빠의 얼굴에 곧 화색이 돌았다. “네, 알겠습니다. 본선 준비하겠습니다!” [진짜 아빠 아직 어리다니까. 쯧쯧.] 아빠는 전화를 끊고 달려오더니 나를 안아 들었다. “성국아, 아빠가 이번 효진 푸드 맛집 찾기 본선에 진출했대!” “아빠, 난 그럴 줄 알았어.” “이 녀석 좀 봐라. 되고 나니 그럴 줄 알았대.” [난 진짜 알았다고. 구성현 부장한테 내가 얼마나 고개를 숙였는데. 어? 나 전성국이 허리가 나가는 줄 알았다고!] 아빠는 나를 놓고는 정신없이 가게를 돌아다녔다. “근데 뭘 하면 되지? 이제부터… 수유 본점 사장님한테 전화를 걸어야겠지….” 정신없는 아빠를 붙잡았다. “아빠, 엄마한테 먼저 연락.” “아, 맞다. 그리고 수유 사장님한테 전화해야겠다.” [그렇지. 정말 아빠는 나 없으면 안 돼. 이런 아빠 두고 어떻게 유학 가지?] 나는 눈앞이 깜깜했다. * * * 효진 푸드의 맛집 간편식을 만드는 경연 본선 진출은 전국에서 총 서른 개의 팀이 결정됐다. 이 팀들 중에서 한식, 중식, 일식, 양식별로 두 팀씩, 총 여덟 팀이 최종 간편식 팀으로 결정된다. 구성현 부장이 앞에 선 본선 진출자들을 보며 설명을 했다. “최종 선발된 여덟 팀은 저희 효진 푸드 팀과 함께 간편식 개발에 바로 착수할 예정입니다. 최종 선발되지 않더라고 저희 효진 푸드에서는 지속적으로 새로운 간편식을 같이 개발할 기회가 주어지니, 너무 낙심하지 마세요.” 엄마 그리고 나, 민국이와 김미영 팀장까지 모두 플래카드 맞춰서 아빠를 응원하러 나온 길이었다. - 아빠, 힘내세요! 이 플래카드 때문에 모두의 시선이 우리 집 식구들에게 집중됐다. [하아, 숨고 싶다.] 거기다 지나가는 사람마다 “네가 그 TV. 맞지?” “네, 맞아요. 전성국입니다.”를 벌써 서른 번쯤 한 것 같았다. “성국아, 아빠가 너 덕분에 힘 엄청 낼 거 같아.” 김미영이 쀼루퉁한 얼굴의 나를 보며 위로했다. 이때 내 머릿속에는 새로운 아이디어가 떠올랐다. “대표님.” “응, 왜?” “이런 프로그램 만들면 어때요?” “무슨 프로그램?” “이런 음식 경연대회요. 사람들이 음식에 위로를 가장 많이 받잖아요. 유명 맛집이나, 유명 쉐프들뿐 아니라 우리가 몰랐던 숨겨진 실력자들을 찾는 일종의 오디션이요.” 김미영이 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. [김 매니저, 뭐가 그렇게 놀라워. 나 전성국이야. 인생 2회 차라고.] “언니, 왜 그래요?” “아니, 방금 성국이가 아주 좋은 아이디어를 말해서….” “뭔데요?” “요리사 오디션을 해보면 어떨까?” “저희가요?” “매니지먼트도 매니지먼트지만, 외주 제작을 해보면 어떨까 고민 중이었거든. 삼전 기획에 있을 때 만났던 외주 제작 감독이나 작가들도 내가 좀 아니까….” 엄마도 화색이 돌았다. “언니, 안 그래도 저희 매니지먼트 방향성 고민 중이었잖아요. 한번 고민해봐도 좋을 것 같아요.” “그렇지… 외주 제작도 하면서 매니지먼트도 하면 우리 배우들도 외주 제작 프로그램에 자연스레 출연시킬 수도 있고….” [내 말이 그 말이야.] 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. “정말 재미있을 것 같은데….” 김미영의 눈이 오랜만에 반짝였다.","completion":"Episode 69 Minguk was chosen as the main character's son in a 16-episode miniseries. The role had a significant amount of screen time per episode, so the income was good. It was a relief that he seemed to be making a living. Moreover, his mother's belly was growing day by day, and his father's bossam restaurant was slowly regaining its vitality. However, there was still no contact from Hyojin Food. After work, worry filled his father's voice as he drank beer. \\"Soyoung, maybe it was a mistake to apply. The owner of Suyu keeps calling every day... Why isn’t the result coming out?\\" \\"It's a big company. When I worked with models and big companies, I noticed it takes longer than expected because there are many stages of approval.\\" \\"That's true...\\" \\"Honey, don't be discouraged even if you don't make it. You said many long-established restaurants applied too.\\" \\"I at least wanted to pass the preliminary round. As a father, I wanted to show Seonguk and Minguk that I could do it.\\" While studying at my desk, I suddenly heard my father's sigh and felt a surge of emotion. It seemed he wanted to show us his growth. I quietly opened the door. \\"Seonguk, going to the bathroom?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Seonguk, were mom and dad's voices loud while you were studying?\\" My father quickly ran to me and hugged me tightly. I could feel my father's thin back. Is this what it feels like as I grow taller and my father seems to shrink? \\"Dad, to Seonguk, you're always the best.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I nodded sincerely. The poorest of the poor. My father, who was born into this world with nothing to rely on, did his best to take care of me and our family. He always wrapped us in love and worried about how his children would live. I patted my father's thin back. \\"Dad... Seonguk will grow up quickly and earn a lot of money.\\" \\"Seonguk. Dad doesn't wish for you to make a lot of money. I just want you to be happy.\\" What? What did he just say? Happiness.... [Ha, Dad. You must not know because you haven't lived long in this world, but money is happiness!] I was about to burst out in anger internally when I suddenly paused. In my previous life, during an interview with a weekly magazine, I was asked if I was happy living as the heir to the Samjeon Group. I answered that I was happy. But I wasn't happy. My parents had a bad relationship, and my siblings were competitors. Everyone just hoped someone else would fall behind. My relationship with my wife was awkward, and although I loved my children, I sent them abroad for education early and couldn't keep them by my side. People always threatened my position as the heir. There were many people around me, but no one I could rely on. Was I really happy in my previous life? My father hugged me tightly. \\"Seonguk, let's have a beer together when you grow up.\\" [Dad, I prefer wine. Beer makes you gain weight.] My father carried me into my room. \\"Dad, I need to go to the bathroom!\\" \\"Oh, I forgot. Sorry. Let me give you an airplane ride to the bathroom as an apology.\\" [Dad, I'm not a kid.] \\"Here we go. Dad's airplane!\\" But I had to play along with my father's mood. Giggling. [I should smile at times like this.] Hearing me laugh, my father also laughed. [I'm really raising my dad, raising him.] * * * \\"Chairman Koo Sooyoung has decided to sponsor Seonguk. He will be the first scholarship recipient of the Junho Foundation, named after his late eldest son.\\" Secretary Yang finished speaking and gauged Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's reaction. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's brow furrowed. It didn't seem to relax easily. \\"I'm curious about the reason... Why not Samjeon but Hyojin?\\" \\"I'm not sure, but it seems Hyojin Group has promised unconditional support to Seonguk.\\" \\"Wasn't it the same for us?\\" \\"However, there's a perception that Samjeon scholarship recipients are not free from Samjeon Group if they join the company or work in society related to Samjeon. It seems that was a concern for Seonguk and his family.\\" Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung smoothed his furrowed brow with his middle finger. It was his first taste of failure. It was also the moment a tower he had invested in crumbled. \\"Secretary Yang, let's step back from Seonguk. We've done enough, and since Hyojin Group is sponsoring him, as long as Seonguk doesn't go astray, he'll become a great talent.\\" \\"Yes, I understand.\\" \\"If possible, just inform me about the sponsorship plan and departure schedule.\\" \\"I'll report as soon as I find out.\\" Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung held his head. He needed a glass of wine, but he refrained since he was at the office. 'Why can't I let go of Seonguk?' Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung couldn't understand his own lingering feelings. Was it because he saw Seonguk as a potential heir, a replacement for his own lacking descendants? Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung shook his head. There were plenty of excellent talents. There were many talents who would line up for Samjeon's sponsorship. The attraction to Seonguk was really like what Teacher Lee from Samcheong-dong said, a connection between father and son. 'If he were my son... my child... my heir...' Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung stood up abruptly. Then he looked down at Seoul spread out beneath his feet. He had everything, but there was one thing he couldn't have. That was an heir. * * * Secretary Hwang Cheol-soo spread out a plan full of plans for me and a school catalog on the bossam restaurant table. The explanation was started by Koo Ye-jeong, the eldest daughter of Hyojin family, sitting next to Secretary Hwang. \\"Seonguk, your English skills are sufficient, and your TOEFL score is almost perfect, but first, we plan to conduct a short-term language course to improve your social skills.\\" I nodded. \\"Then, this is a prestigious private school that our younger brother Junho also attended. It's like a combined middle and high school in our country, and it offers boarding. We're trying to get admission here.\\" It was a familiar place. Not for me, but in my previous life, it was the prestigious boarding school my children attended. As it was a boarding school I personally chose for my children in my previous life, everything was perfect. I smiled. \\"I want to start studying soon.\\" \\"Seonguk, just grow up beautifully as you are. If I had that face, I would have become a celebrity instead of studying.\\" Koo Ye-ri, the youngest and second daughter of the Hyojin family, grumbled. \\"Are you going too, sister?\\" \\"I'll attend a nearby high school for a while, then I'll go to any college comfortably.\\" \\"Ye-ri. Please, let's focus and study.\\" \\"Sister, I have a lot of money, so I'll live comfortably. You study hard and take over the company.\\" \\"I'm not confident either.\\" Koo Ye-jeong also grumbled. In fact, the most unfortunate aspect of the Hyojin Group was the early death of the smartest son of the family, Koo Junho, who was as smart as me in my previous life. \\"Seonguk, you're going to the US in a few months, what are you going to do?\\" Koo Ye-ri asked with sparkling eyes. I stroked my chin. \\"I'm thinking of buying some stocks.\\" * * * In July 1998, the KOSPI broke through the 300-point barrier and plummeted to the 200-point range. It seemed there was no further to fall, as if even the ground was giving way. I sat at the stock exchange, watching the KOSPI index plummet with a satisfied expression. My father, who came with me, was restless. \\"Seonguk, who invests in stocks these days? It fell more today than yesterday, and it will fall even more tomorrow. Shouldn't we sell the Samjeon stocks we have?\\" \\"......\\" I firmly shut my mouth and shook my head. A crisis is an opportunity! This was something ants must remember. If you don't have the courage to bet on a crisis, you can't seize the opportunity to become rich. I decided to bet on Samjeon. All of my remaining 200 million won! \\"Seonguk....\\" My father grabbed my back. \\"Trust me, Dad!\\" The next day, the KOSPI fell even further. Samjeon Electronics couldn't help but fall as well. Sitting side by side in the restaurant, watching the news, my father's face was almost in tears. \\"Seonguk, this investment seems really wrong.\\" \\"Dad!\\" \\"Huh?\\" \\"Investment is about looking at the long term. I'll sell everything when I come back from the US.\\" \\"Ha...\\" My father looked even more despairing than me. Then, the restaurant's phone rang loudly. My father stood up with slumped shoulders. \\"Alright, Seonguk. It's okay. Dad will earn a lot of money now.\\" Then he answered the phone. \\"Hello. Yes... Yes, that's right. Really? Really, I made it?\\" Joy returned to my father's face. \\"Yes, I understand. I'll prepare for the finals!\\" [I told you, Dad is still young. Tsk tsk.] My father hung up the phone and ran to me, lifting me up. \\"Seonguk, Dad made it to the finals of the Hyojin Food Delicious Restaurant Search!\\" \\"Dad, I knew it would happen.\\" \\"Look at this guy. Now that it's happened, he says he knew it would.\\" [I really knew it. Do you know how much I bowed to Manager Koo Seong-hyun? Huh? I thought my back was going to break!] My father put me down and started running around the restaurant in a frenzy. \\"But what should I do now? From now on... I should call the Suyu main branch owner first...\\" I grabbed my frantic father. \\"Dad, call Mom first.\\" \\"Ah, right. And then I should call the Suyu owner.\\" [That's right. Dad really can't do without me. How can I go abroad leaving such a dad behind?] I felt darkness before my eyes. * * * A total of thirty teams were selected for the finals of the Hyojin Food Delicious Ready-Meal Competition. Among these teams, two teams each from Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Western cuisine, a total of eight teams, will be selected as the final ready-meal teams. Manager Koo Seong-hyun stood in front of the finalists and explained. \\"The eight teams selected in the final will immediately start developing ready-meals with our Hyojin Food team. Even if you are not selected in the final, Hyojin Food will continue to provide opportunities to develop new ready-meals together, so don't be too discouraged.\\" Mom, Minguk, Kim Mi-young, the manager, and I all came out with banners to support Dad. - Dad, cheer up! Because of this banner, everyone's attention was focused on our family. [Ha, I want to hide.] Moreover, passersby kept saying, \\"You're the one from TV, right?\\" \\"Yes, that's right. I'm Seonguk.\\" I must have said it about thirty times already. \\"Seonguk, Dad feels like he can gain a lot of strength thanks to you.\\" <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> comforted me, who had a sullen face. Then, a new idea popped into my head. \\"Manager.\\" \\"Yes, why?\\" \\"How about making a program like this?\\" \\"What kind of program?\\" \\"A cooking competition. People receive the most comfort from food, right? It could be a kind of audition to find hidden talents, not just famous restaurants or chefs.\\" Kim Mi-young looked at me with surprised eyes. [Manager Kim, what's so surprising? I'm Seonguk. I'm on my second life.] \\"Sister, what's wrong?\\" \\"No, Seonguk just mentioned a really good idea...\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"How about a chef audition?\\" \\"Us?\\" \\"I was considering external production as well as management. I know some directors and writers from when I was at Samjeon Planning...\\" Mom also looked pleased. \\"Sister, we were considering the direction of our management anyway. It might be good to think about it.\\" \\"That's right... If we do external production and management, we can naturally cast our actors in the external production programs...\\" [That's what I'm saying.] I nodded. \\"It sounds really fun...\\" Kim Mi-young's eyes sparkled for the first time in a while."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[오늘은 내가 양보해주지.] 나는 팔짱을 끼고 구성현 부장의 발표를 기다렸다. “자, 이제 마지막은 한식 부문입니다. 까다로운 한식을 간편식으로 만드시기 위해 모두 애 많이 쓰셨습니다. 그럼, 효진 푸드와 함께할 첫 번째 팀은…. 오늘 접시 깨지셨는데, 합격하셨습니다. 바로 <마산 아구찜> 팀입니다.” “와아!” 손에 붕대를 둘둘 만 아주머니가 일어나서 환호를 했다. 아빠는 부러운 눈길로 아주머니를 쳐다봤다. [자, 다음 팀 어서!] 구성현 부장이 심사 차트를 보더니 빙긋 미소를 지었다. “정말 오늘 아이디어와 맛 모두 좋은 점수를 받은 팀입니다. 보쌈 도시락과 1인용 족발 술안주를 만드신 <원아저씨 보쌈> 팀입니다! 축하드립니다!” 아빠는 그 순간 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. 그러곤 나와 민국이를 안아 들고 뽀뽀를 해댔다. “성국아, 민국아. 아빠가 해냈어!” [아빠, 뽀뽀는 사양할게.] “성국아, 아빠가 사랑한다.” 아빠는 연신 뽀뽀를 해댔다. [그래, 오늘만 허락해줄게. 내일부터는 국물도 없어, 아빠.] 나는 볼을 슬그머니 아빠 쪽으로 돌렸다. * * * 아빠와 수유 사장님은 가게에서 심각하게 계약서를 검토 중이었다. 김미영이 옆에서 돕고 있었다. “계약서상으로는 크게 문제가 없네요. 지원할 때 조건과 동일하네요. 1년 내에 간편식을 각 상호를 따서 출시하고 개런티로 순매출의 10프로네요.” “사인해도 되겠죠, 김 대표님?” “제가 보기에는 큰 문제는 없어 보입니다. 두 분 축하드려요!” 김미영의 말에 아빠와 수유점 사장님은 그제야 미소를 지었다. “와, 이게 꿈이야, 생시야! 우리 상호 이름으로 된 상품이 전국 마트랑 편의점에 짝 깔리는 거잖아.” 수유점 사장님은 거의 울 것 같은 얼굴이었다. “참, 두 분도 계약서를 작성하시는 게 좋을 것 같아요.” 김미영이 감격한 두 사람에게 찬물을 끼얹었다. “저희끼리도요?” “네. 동업이라는 게 원래 좀 어렵잖아요. 두 분 모두 고생하셨고, 서로 잘되는 것을 바라는 것도 잘 알지만, 계약서로 깔끔하게 서로 수익 배분하는 것도 정리해두는 게 좋을 것 같아서요. 나중을 위해서라도요.” 김미영의 말은 정확했다. 처음엔 의리로, 우정으로 시작한 사업이, 되든 안 되든 싸우고 헤어지는 게 동업의 수순이었다. “전 수유점 사장님이 더 수익 많이 가져가셔야 한다고 생각해요.” [아빠, 지금 무슨 소리야?] 옆 테이블에서 사이다를 마시며 대화를 듣던 나는 발끈했다. “무슨 소리야. 이 기회며 뭐며 다 자네 덕분이잖아. 도시락이나 1인용 술안주 아이디어도 다 자네가 낸 거고. 이번 경연에서 제일 중요한 건 간편식으로 만들어낸 아이디어였어.” [수유 사장님, 간만에 마음에 통하네.] 하지만 아빠는 고개를 절레절레 저었다. “사장님이 보쌈과 족발 기술 전수 안 해주셨으면 이 자리도 없었죠.” “두 분, 그럼 공평하게 5 대 5로 하시죠. 지분도 5 대 5. 그리고 나중에 연계된 어떤 사업을 하든 5 대 5로 시작하는 것으로요. 그리고 한쪽의 일방적인 계약 파기도 안 되며, 타인에게 양도도 안 됩니다.” “당연하지. 난 죽을 때까지 보쌈집 할 거야.” 수유점 사장님이 허허 웃었다. “저두요. 사장님, 그럼 저희 뭘 하든 공평하게 5 대 5. 그렇게 해요.” “고마워.” “무슨 말씀이세요. 제가 항상 더 고맙죠.” “그냥저냥 막걸리집 하는 나한테 보쌈 전문점 해보라고 한 것도 자네고, 이 대회 나가자고 한 것도 자네잖아. 자네 덕분에 나까지 덩달아 성장하는 것 같아서 고마워.” [사장님, 앞으로도 그 고마움 절대 잊지 마세요.] 수유점 사장님은 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국이 이 녀석, 뭐라 쫑알거리냐. 성국아, 넌 진짜 복덩이다. 너 태어나고 너희 집도 다 잘 풀리고, 아저씨도 덩달아 잘 풀리고.” [당연하지. 전직 재벌이 되는 건 로또 당첨되기보다도 어려운 복을 타고난 사람이라고!]","completion":"Episode 70 \\"The time given to you from now is 2 hours. During this time, please recreate a dish suitable for convenience food. Now, let's begin!\\" With the words of Director Gu Seong-hyeon, the competition began. Since the dish was to be produced using a large corporation's factory system, the main goal was to create a dish that could be easily released within 2 hours. The father and the owner of <Uncle Won's Bossam> nursing home had focused on launching a dish suitable for convenience food over the past month. The father's idea was to make bossam and jokbal available in convenience stores and supermarkets as single-serving snacks and lunch boxes, as they are dishes that require a long time to prepare. The family watched eagerly from the cheering section set up around the competition area as the father and the nursing home owner cooked. Sweat naturally formed on their hands. Min-guk's brow also furrowed deeply. The father and the nursing home owner, having worked together for a long time, started cooking seamlessly, taking turns being the main chef. The mother clasped her hands and watched the father cook. I couldn't take my eyes off the father cooking either. Before I knew it, I was holding my mother's hand tightly. The mother patted my hand. \\"Seong-guk, your father is really cool....\\" \\"Yes!\\" I answered vehemently. The father was always a solid head of the household and a person who silently did his work. Today, he was a truly cool person doing what he loved. Director Gu Seong-hyeon grabbed the microphone again. \\"There are 30 minutes left. Please set up according to the convenience food lunch box we have prepared.\\" Clang! At that moment, the sound of a plate dropping to the floor was heard. It was the agujjim team cooking right next to the father. \\"What should we do now.\\" The lady, in a hurry, touched the plate with her hand and ended up bleeding profusely. \\"Please wait a moment! We will stop for 10 minutes. All other teams, please stop as well!\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon quickly went to the agujjim team with the paramedics. A paramedic quickly applied pressure to the bleeding hand and administered first aid. The father, wearing several thick gloves, quickly cleaned up the broken plate. The lady kept apologizing to the father. \\"I'm so sorry.\\" \\"It's okay, you're not hurt. That's what matters.\\" The staff came and quickly cleaned up the broken plate. Almost 10 minutes had passed. The flow was important in cooking. The flow of the father and the nursing home owner, who were just slicing the freshly cooked bossam and jokbal, was also interrupted. And there were 30 minutes left! The clock started ticking again. Director Gu Seong-hyeon started the countdown. \\"Now, there are 5 minutes left. Everyone, please start wrapping up.\\" All thirty teams were frantically finishing up. The father and the nursing home owner were seen checking until the last moment to make sure nothing was missed. The father neatly placed the bossam in the convenience food lunch box, filled the empty space with shrimp sauce, and added white rice, pickled radish, and kimchi on the side. \\"Now, there are 30 seconds left. Please stop your hands and step back when the bell rings. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!\\" At the shout of Director Gu Seong-hyeon, the bell rang. The father and the nursing home owner looked at each other, smiled faintly, and took a step back. Sweat poured down the father's face like rain. \\"Everyone, you've worked hard. Now, five specially invited expert judges will start the evaluation.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon put down the microphone and picked up the evaluation chart. Then, he and the other five expert judges began to visit each team. The father's team was in the latter half. The experts discussed the composition and taste of the convenience food with eagle eyes. It was hard to guess their thoughts because they all had poker faces. The father and the nursing home owner wiped their sweat and waited anxiously for their turn. Finally, it was the father's turn. Director Gu Seong-hyeon smiled and greeted them, then examined the bossam lunch box. \\"You've made a lunch box with bossam.\\" \\"Yes, people usually think of bossam as a drinking snack, but actually, boiled meat and kimchi can be a great meal. It's filling for just one meal and allows you to get a balanced intake of nutrients, so we composed it this way.\\" \\"You've made the jokbal as a drinking snack?\\" \\"Jokbal has a texture that comes alive when it cools down. Many people like that chewy texture. Considering the characteristics of convenience stores and supermarkets that require refrigerated distribution, we made jokbal as a drinking snack. Plus, with the increasing number of single-person households, we set it up for one person.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon nodded. The experts tasted the bossam lunch box and jokbal snack, meticulously writing something on the evaluation chart. \\"We've seen it well.\\" Director Gu Seong-hyeon passed by the father and the nursing home owner with an inscrutable face. The father finally took a breath and looked at his family. I gave my father a thumbs up. \\"Dad, you're the best!\\" As my voice echoed through the competition hall, everyone burst into laughter. The father smiled at me more brightly than ever. I was proud to be born as my father's son in this life. * * * The process is more important than the result. It's enough that we worked hard. That's all nonsense! I anxiously awaited the father's evaluation results. \\"Honey, you really worked hard today.\\" \\"I'm so nervous about the result.\\" \\"Seong-guk's father, you were really amazing today. My hands were sweating.\\" \\"The result should be good too.\\" [Of course. If the result is bad, everything is bad!] I clenched my fist. \\"Seong-guk, your father was cool today, right?\\" \\"Yeah. A little.\\" \\"Weren't you saying he was the best earlier?\\" [That was then, but now we're waiting for the result. Dad, let's not lose tension.] I patted my father's back to keep him in check. The nursing home owner laughed at me. \\"Seong-guk is more nervous. Thanks to you, or rather, thanks to Seong-guk, we participated in this competition and had a really good experience.\\" [Owner, it's not over until it's over! Why are you talking as if it's all done!] I glanced at the owner with eagle eyes and anxiously awaited the result. Finally, Director Gu Seong-hyeon came out with the paper containing the evaluation results. The bustling hall suddenly quieted down. Everyone's gaze was focused on Director Gu Seong-hyeon. \\"You've waited a long time. But before that, I want to say thank you to everyone for their hard work today.\\" [Skip the small talk and announce the results already!] \\"Now, let's announce the results without further delay. As planned, we've selected two teams each from Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Western cuisine, making a total of eight teams. First, let's announce the Western cuisine category. <Familiar Pasta> who made Italian pasta convenience food and <King Steak> who made steak lunch boxes!\\" \\"Wow!\\" Cheers and applause erupted simultaneously. The losers in the same Western cuisine category managed to clap for them. In the end, only the winners exist in the world. Japanese and Chinese cuisines were announced in turn. Now, it was finally time for Korean cuisine. As I reached out to hold my father's hand, my mother was already holding it tightly. [Today, I'll let it go.] I crossed my arms and waited for Director Gu Seong-hyeon's announcement. \\"Now, the last category is Korean cuisine. It was challenging to make Korean cuisine into convenience food, and everyone worked hard. The first team to join Hyojin Food is... despite breaking a plate today, you've passed. It's the <Masan Agujjim> team.\\" \\"Wow!\\" The lady with bandages on her hand stood up and cheered. The father looked at the lady enviously. [Now, the next team, hurry up!] Director Gu Seong-hyeon looked at the evaluation chart and smiled faintly. \\"Today, a team that received good scores for both idea and taste. The team that made bossam lunch boxes and single-serving jokbal snacks, <Uncle Won's Bossam> team! Congratulations!\\" At that moment, the father stood up abruptly. Then he hugged me and Min-guk and showered us with kisses. \\"Seong-guk, Min-guk. Dad did it!\\" [Dad, I'll pass on the kisses.] \\"Seong-guk, Dad loves you.\\" The father kept giving kisses. [Alright, I'll let it slide for today. No more from tomorrow, Dad.] I slightly turned my cheek towards my father. * * * The father and the nursing home owner were seriously reviewing the contract at the store. Kim Mi-young was helping them. \\"There doesn't seem to be a big problem with the contract. It's the same as the conditions provided during the application. You'll launch convenience food under each brand name within a year and get a guarantee of 10% of the net sales.\\" \\"Should we sign it, CEO Kim?\\" \\"From what I see, there doesn't seem to be a big problem. Congratulations to both of you!\\" At Kim Mi-young's words, the father and the nursing home owner finally smiled. \\"Wow, is this a dream or reality! Our brand name products will be lined up in supermarkets and convenience stores nationwide.\\" The nursing home owner's face looked almost tearful. \\"By the way, you two should also draft a contract.\\" \\"Between us too?\\" \\"Yes. Business partnerships are originally a bit difficult. I know both of you have worked hard and wish each other well, but it's better to cleanly arrange the profit distribution through a contract for the future. Just in case.\\" Kim Mi-young's words were accurate. Whether a business started with loyalty or friendship, ending up fighting and breaking up was the course of partnership, whether it succeeded or not. \\"I think the nursing home owner should take more profit.\\" [Dad, what are you talking about?] Listening to the conversation while drinking soda at the next table, I was indignant. \\"What are you talking about? This opportunity and everything is thanks to you. The idea for the lunch box and single-serving drinking snack was all yours. The most important thing in this competition was the idea of making it into convenience food.\\" [Owner, we finally see eye to eye.] But the father shook his head. \\"If the owner hadn't taught me the bossam and jokbal techniques, we wouldn't be here.\\" \\"You two, then let's make it fair and go 50-50. Share and profit distribution 50-50. And if you start any related business in the future, start it 50-50. Also, unilateral contract termination by one party is not allowed, nor is transfer to another person.\\" \\"Of course. I'm going to run a bossam restaurant until I die.\\" The nursing home owner laughed heartily. \\"Me too. Owner, let's make everything fair and go 50-50.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" \\"What are you talking about? I'm always more grateful.\\" \\"It was you who suggested I run a bossam specialty restaurant and participate in this competition. Thanks to you, I feel like I'm growing too.\\" [Owner, never forget that gratitude.] The nursing home owner patted my head. \\"Seong-guk, what are you grumbling about? Seong-guk, you're really a blessing. Since you were born, your house has been doing well, and I've been doing well too.\\" [Of course. Being born as a former chaebol is luckier than winning the lottery!]"},{"prompt":"Hello","completion":"Hello!

A posição do div é atualizada ajustando-se as propriedades \`left\` e \`top\` com base na posição atual e na velocidade definida.

В частности, вы пытаетесь вставить данные в таблицу \`db_users\` в поле (или полевой ключ) \`errorassembly\`, но значения, которые вы пытаетесь вставить, уже существуют в этом поле. Это ограничение \`UNIQUE\` гарантирует, что все значения в столбце уникальны в пределах таблицы. Поэтому, если ваше приложение пытается вставить или обновить строку в таблице таким образом, что в столбце \`errorassembly\` будет две или более одинаковых записи, SQLite отклонит операцию и выдаст ошибку, которую вы видите. Чтобы решить эту проблему, у вас есть несколько вариантов: 1. **Проверьте данные перед вставкой:** Убедитесь, что данные, которые вы пытаетесь вставить, уникальны для столбца \`errorassembly\`. Это может включать выборку из базы данных для проверки существующих значений перед вставкой. 2. **Обновление записей вместо вставки:** Если ваше намерение состоит в том, чтобы обновить существующие данные, а не вставлять новые, используйте оператор \`UPDATE\` вместо \`INSERT\`. 3. **Ошибку можно обработать в приложении:** Может быть ситуация, когда ожидается попытка вставки дублирующихся данных. В этом случае можно обработать исключение и, например, оповестить пользователя о том, что данные уже существуют. 4. **Использование \`INSERT OR REPLACE\` или \`INSERT OR IGNORE\`:** SQLite поддерживает эти две директивы, которые могут помочь управлять ситуациями с уникальным нарушением. \`INSERT OR REPLACE\` заменит существующие данные новыми, тогда как \`INSERT OR IGNORE\` просто проигнорирует попытку вставки дублирующих значений. Выбор подходящего решения будет зависеть от логики вашего приложения и требований к данным в вашей базе данных."},{"prompt":"привет в чем ошибка InvalidCastException: Specified cast is not valid.

В контексте вашего приложения, это означает, что происходит попытка принудительно преобразовать один тип данных в другой, но эти типы не совместимы. На практике это может происходить, например, когда вы пытаетесь привести тип данных, полученный из базы данных, к типу, ожидаемому вашим приложением, но типы данных не совпадают. Рассмотрим ситуацию на примере. Допустим, у вас есть следующий код, который пытается получить список пользователей из базы данных: \`\`\`csharp public List<User> GetUsers() { List<User> users = new List<User>(); string query = \\"SELECT * FROM users\\"; // Выполнение запроса к базе данных // Предположим, что reader - это объект SqliteDataReader while (reader.Read()) { users.Add(new User { // Предположим, ID ожидается как int, но в базе данных он хранится как string ID = (int)reader[\\"ID\\"], Name = reader[\\"Name\\"].ToString(), // Другие поля... }); } return users; } \`\`\` Если в базе данных ID пользователя хранится как строковое значение (например, \`\\"1\\"\`, \`\\"2\\"\`), а код пытается привести это значение к \`int\`, произойдет \`InvalidCastException\`, так как прямое приведение строкового типа к целому числу не является допустимым в C# без явного преобразования. Чтобы решить эту проблему, вам необходимо правильно обработать преобразование типов. В примере выше, это можно сделать следующим образом: \`\`\`csharp ID = int.Parse(reader[\\"ID\\"].ToString()), // Для случая, когда мы уверены, что значение можно преобразовать \`\`\` или используя метод \`Convert\`: \`\`\`csharp ID = Convert.ToInt32(reader[\\"ID\\"]), // Безопасный способ, который обрабатывает DBNull и другие потенциальные проблемы \`\`\` Важно тщательно проверить код на предмет операций приведения типа и убедиться, что преобразование между типами допустимо и выполняется безопасно. Возможно, в вашем случае ошибка возникает в другой части кода, не показанной в вопросе, поэтому рекомендуется внимательно изучить, где именно происходят операции приведения типа, и убедиться, что все они допустимы."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

TV를 틀 때마다 각종 예능이나 광고에서 노스트라다무스의 예언이 나왔다. 하지만 나는 이미 이 세계가 멸망하지 않는다는 것을 너무 잘 알고 있었다. ‘우유가 없네.’ 나는 우유 잔을 들고 부엌으로 향했다. 아빠가 막 욕실에서 나왔다. “성국아, 우유 더 줘?” “응, 아빠.” 아빠는 <원아저씨 보쌈>의 도시락과 족발 술안주 발매 이후 가게까지 덩달아 매출이 상승하는 바람에 아침 일찍부터 가게에 나갔다. 아르바이트생까지 두 명을 뒀지만, 사람들의 발길이 끊이지 않았다. “자, 여기.” “감사합니다.” 아빠는 방긋 웃고는 로션을 발랐다. “성국아, 아빠가 돈 많이 벌어서 휴가 때 꼭 너 보러 미국 갈게. 좋지?” “응.” 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. “성국이 이제 다 컸다고 아빠한테 뽀뽀도 안 해줄 거야?” [아빠, 난 원래 태어날 때부터 마흔 살이었다고.] 하지만 예의상이라는 게 있다. 부모 자식 간에도 예의상 해야 할 일이 있는 것이다. 나는 얼른 아빠 뺨에 뽀뽀를 날렸다. 쪽. 쪽. 쪽. 쪽. 쪽. “알았어, 이 녀석아. 그만해도 돼.” 아빠는 유쾌하게 웃으며 셔츠를 입었다. 엄마가 지희를 안고 안방에서 슬그머니 나왔다. “민국이 아직도 자?” “응, 다들 조용히 좀 해.” [민국이 이 녀석. 일곱 살이나 먹었으면 아침에 빠딱빠딱 일어나야지.] 이리저리 봐도 모자란 민국이 녀석을 두고 떠나려니 마음이 편하지 않았다. “성국아, 지희 좀 봐줄래? 엄마가 얼른 아빠랑 네 아침 차릴게.” 엄마는 지희를 바닥에 눕혔다. 지희는 민국이보다도 얌전했다. 눕혀놓으면 눕혀놓는 대로 가만히 있었다. 나는 지희 얼굴을 빤히 쳐다봤다. [하아….] 한숨이 나왔다. [지희야, 넌 대체 누굴 닮은 거야?] 나는 완벽하게 엄마, 아빠의 장점만 닮았다. 민국이도 그럭저럭 봐줄 만은 했다. 하지만 지희는 엄마, 아빠가 가진 단점만 그대로 닮았다. 엄마의 짱구 이마. 아빠의 사각 턱. 지희의 미래 플랜은 아무래도 대대적인 수정이 필요해 보였다. [머리는 똑똑한가?] 나는 얼른 지희 옆에 앉아서 동화책을 읽어주기 시작했다. 하지만 지희는 그저 몸만 바동거릴 뿐이었다. 나는 고개를 절레절레 흔들며 지희를 내려다봤다. [전지희. 도대체 너, 뭐 먹고 살래?] 히죽히죽. [웃긴. 오빠님이 말씀하시잖아.] 히죽히죽. [오빠 백일 때는 이미 뭐 먹고 살지 걱정했단 말이야.] 히죽히죽. [말을 말자.] 나는 동화책을 덮어버렸다. * * * “어, 언니. 성국이한테 말해볼게.” 밥을 먹던 엄마가 전화를 끊더니 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 했던 거 기억나?” “응. ‘저스트’랑 같이 했잖아.” “와, 우리 성국이는 정말 머리가 천재인가 봐.” “엄마가 맨날 말하자나. 그건 왜?” “이번에 방송국에서 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 그 후’로 너랑 촬영을 하고 싶대. 그 감독님이 이제 곧 우리 기획사에서 하는 작품 감독도 하시잖아. 이야기하다가 의견이 나왔는데, 방송국도 좋다고 하고 ‘저스트’도 스케줄을 빼본다고 했대.” ‘저스트’는 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 이후 대박 그룹이 되었다. 특히 내가 선곡해준 <거짓이야>라는 곡은 지금까지도 회자되는 명곡이다. 마이클이라는 건방진 놈도 빠지고, 선한 영향력을 주는 아이돌 그룹이 되어서 팬덤도 대단했다. “엄마, 출연료는?” 아빠가 내 이마를 손가락으로 지그시 눌렀다. “이 녀석. 어린 게 그렇게 돈 밝히면 안 된다고 아빠가 그랬잖아.” “경제관념이 밝은 거야.” 나는 이제 서서히 속마음을 말로 표현하기 시작했다. “암튼 성국이, 말로는 이길 수가 없어.” “성국아, 이 프로그램 하고 가는 게 어떨까? 엄마 생각에는 성국이가 공부하러 가기 전에 찍고 가면 우리 가족들이 성국이 그리울 때마다 이 영상 보면 될 것 같아서 해봤으면 좋겠어.” “우선 미팅부터 해볼래.” “그래, 이따 오후에 감독님이 사무실로 온다니까 같이 가보자.” “응!” * * * “성국아, 이게 얼마 만이야. 언제 이렇게 큰 거야?” “안녕하세요, 감독님.” “나 기억나?” “잘은 안 나요.” 나는 거짓말을 했다. 내가 기억을 못 할 리가 없었다. 하지만 두 돌쯤 만난 사람을 여덟 살에 기억하는 아이는 많지 않았다. “이 녀석, 천재라고 소문이 자자하던데, 나도 기억 못 하고. 서운한데.” “죄송합니다.” “와, 말도 못 했는데… 이제 말도 잘하고. 영어랑 프랑스어도 잘한다며?” “네.” 감독은 몇 년 사이에 머리가 한결 가벼워졌다. 모자로 대충 가리고 있었지만, 이마가 넓어졌다. “참, 김 대표가 그러던데. 성국아, 네가 요리 경연 프로그램 아이디어 냈다며?” “아빠가 하시는 것 보니까 재미있어서요.” “성국아, 네 기획으로 우리가 이번에 프로그램 계획 중이야. 잘되면 기획에 네 이름 올라갈 거야.” [저작권 좀 챙기는 건가….] 나는 방긋이 웃었다. “감사해요.” 돈 이야기는 따로 하지 않았다. 이제 돈 이야기를 하면 마냥 순순해 보이지만은 않은 나이가 됐다. “감독님, 커피 한 잔 하시면서 이야기하세요. 성국이 오자마자 쉴 새 없이 말씀하신다는 거 아세요?” 김미영이 요령 있게 감독을 내게서 떼 갔다. [겨우 한숨 돌렸네.] 어릴 적에야 말도 못 하고, 발음도 어눌하니 속으로 이런저런 말을 내뱉었지만 나이가 들면서 말하는 게 조심스러워졌다. 불쑥불쑥 내뱉던 속마음이 터져 나올 것 같아서였다. “성국아, 이제 같이 회의할까?” “네!” 나는 얼른 회의실로 들어갔다. “성국이는 우유.” 김미영 대표가 우유를 내밀었다. 엄마는 얼른 커피를 감독과 스태프 몇 명에게 돌렸다. “감독님, 정말 너무 오랜만에 뵈어요.” “성국이 동생이 또 태어났다면서요?” “네, 곧 백일이에요.” “그 녀석도 정말 한 인물 하겠네요.” “딸이에요. 아직 백일이라 잘 모르겠어요, 저희는.” 그 말인즉슨, 지희의 인물은 나와 민국이. 즉, 우리와 비교할 게 아니란 말이었다. 감독은 커피를 마시며 기획안을 몇 개 돌렸다. “이번에 성국이랑 ‘저스트’의 재회편 한번 보세요.” 스태프들과 김미영, 엄마와 나는 감독이 돌린 기획안을 얼른 훑었다. 이야기는 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 7년 후’라는 콘셉트이었다. ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 당시 무명에 가까웠던 그룹 저스트. 그리고 겨우 두 돌에 가까워진 나의 7년 후 삶이 얼마나 변했는지를 쫓는 이야기였다. ‘저스트’는 대한민국의 국민 아이돌이 되었다. 하지만 지금은 계약 기간이 끝나고 범선을 비롯한 몇 명의 멤버들이 다른 기획사로 이적했다. 일반적인 보이 밴드의 해체 수순을 맞은 것이다. 그리고 나에 대한 이야기는 간략했다. 어린 나이에 천애 고아가 된 부모 밑에서 태어난 나는 뛰어난 외모와 재능으로 대중들의 마음을 사로잡고 종종 모델 활동을 하던 중에 대중들의 시야에서 사라진다. 하지만 그사이에 나는 천재라는 말을 들을 정도로 언어와 각종 분야에서 두각을 나타내고 효진 그룹의 준호 재단 첫 후원자로 미국 유학을 앞두고 있다는 내용이었다. 나는 문득 궁금한 사람이 있었다. “감독님, 마이클은요?” “마이클? 성국아, 너 마이클은 기억하니?” 아차. 하지만 이럴 때는 태연하게 대처하면 된다. “비디오테이프 봤어요.” “역시 천재는 비범하네. 마이클 뭐 하지?” 감독이 스태프 중 한 명을 쳐다봤다. 구성 작가인 듯 보였다. “저희도 안 그래도 수소문했는데요.” “뭔 사고 친 건 아니지?” “자잘한 사고는 쳤고요. 다행히 얼마 전부터 이태원에서 미국식 수제 버거집 운영하고 있어요. 나름 평가도 좋네요.” “마음 잡았나 보네.” “결혼도 했어요.” 마이클의 인생은 저번 생에서 지켜본 것과는 조금 달라졌다. 일찍 ‘저스트’를 탈퇴하고 우여곡절을 겪고 사람이 됐나 보다. “감독님, 마이클 만나고 싶어요.” “성국아, 진심이야?” “네. 옛날 비디오 보니까 마이클이랑 저랑 맨날 싸워서요. 애기가 그러면 안 되는 건데, 사과하고 싶어요.” “저희가 종종 옛날 비디오 애들한테 보여 주거든요.” 엄마가 설명을 해줬다. “성국아, 네가 사과할 일은 없어. 마이클이 다 너 괴롭힌 거야.” [감독, 알지. 나 다 기억한다고. 근데 그렇게 하면 프로그램이 되겠어, 어디.] “저도 마이클 괴롭힌 거 같아요.” 나는 그저 방긋 웃었다. 감독은 볼펜으로 머리를 슥슥 긁더니 구성 작가를 쳐다봤다. “마이클과 성국이의 화해의 장 같은 거 만들어볼까? 그 김에 다른 멤버들과의 화해의 장 같은 것도 만들고. 어때?” “괜찮은데요. 근데 마이클이 하려고 할까요?” “이태원에서 수제 버거집 한다며. 요즘 경기 어려운데 방송 나오면 광고도 되고 좋지. ‘저스트’ 멤버들도 결국 다 찢어진 건데, 지들 광고할 수 있다니까 다 나온다는 거 아니야.” “한번 접촉해 볼게요.” “성국이 덕분에 아이템 하나 건졌네.” 감독은 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. * * * “아기 바구니와 다섯 남자 7년 후요?” “네, 마이클 씨.” 구성 작가는 진땀을 빼고 있었다. 이태원의 수제 버거집을 운영한다는 마이클의 성격은 하나도 바뀌지 않았다. “제가 그 프로 때문에 얼마나 욕을 먹었는데요. 나가고 싶겠어요? 더군다나 사생활까지 밝혀져서 그룹에서도 거의 쫓겨나다시피 나왔잖아요.” “그래서요. 그룹 멤버들과 화해의 장, 이런 거 만들면 좋을 것 같아서요.” “말이 되는 소리를 해요. 저 나가도 한 명도 안부 전화 한 통 없었어요.” 마이클은 수제 버거의 패티를 뒤집으며 투덜거렸다. “그런 오해, 서로 풀어보자는 거죠.” “됐어요. 장사도 안 되는데 귀찮게 마시고 가세요.” “그러니까 더 나오셔야죠.” 마이클이 구성 작가를 쳐다봤다. “장사 어렵잖아요. 저희 콘셉트가 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 7년 후잖아요. 다큐식으로 그간의 여정과 지금 삶의 모습을 따라갈 거거든요. 그럼 이 가게. 마이클 씨가 지금 하고 있는 일 등이 자연스럽게 노출되죠. 광고 효과도 분명 톡톡히 얻으실 거예요. 어떠세요?” 마이클은 패티를 뒤집다 말고 구성 작가를 쳐다봤다. “좋아요. 하죠. 단, 조건이 있습니다. 먼저 이거 하나 드셔보세요.” 구성 작가는 마이클이 내민 수제 버거를 한 입 깨물었다. 육즙이 촉촉하게 배어 나오는 것이 맛이 꽤 괜찮았다. “맛있네요.” “그쵸?” “저희 가게에 ‘저스트’ 멤버들 다 왔으면 좋겠어요. 그래야 제대로 홍보되죠. 대충 저만 찍고 가는 거 다른 사람들도 다 알아요. 홍보하려고 나온 거요. 그렇게만 해주시면 전 좋아요.” 마이클은 막 타들어가는 패티를 뒤집으며 말했다.","completion":"Episode 72 Dad messed up my hair. \\"You're quite decisive. Sungguk, it's your stock, so do as you please. Just don't come asking Dad for money if you end up losing.\\" \\"That won't happen.\\" I spoke calmly. Samsung stocks are like dung beetles rolling dung. They will keep rolling and growing. * * * The new year of 1999 has dawned. The study abroad process is almost finished, and all that's left is to leave the country. My family wanted to spend Jihee's 100th day together, so we postponed the departure date to after Jihee's 100th day. I woke up at 7 AM, had a warm glass of milk, and searched for stock and world news on my laptop. Although it was obviously not yet time to overcome the IMF crisis, the overall economy was reviving. \\"Hmm... Is this year the end of the world that Nostradamus talked about...\\" I chuckled to myself. Every time I turned on the TV, various variety shows and commercials mentioned Nostradamus's prophecy. But I knew too well that this world would not end. \\"I'm out of milk.\\" I took my empty glass and headed to the kitchen. Dad had just come out of the bathroom. \\"Sungguk, more milk?\\" \\"Sure, Dad.\\" Dad had been busy since early morning because the sales at his store, <Uncle Won's Bossam>, soared after launching a lunchbox and pork hocks as a drinking snack. Even though he hired two part-timers, the customers never stopped coming. \\"Here you go.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Dad smiled and applied lotion. \\"Sungguk, Dad will make a lot of money and definitely visit you in the U.S. during the holiday. Sounds good?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I nodded. \\"Sungguk, are you too grown up to give Dad a kiss now?\\" [Dad, I was born a forty-year-old.] But there's such a thing as courtesy. Even between parents and children, there are things you do out of courtesy. I quickly pecked Dad on the cheek. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. \\"Alright, that's enough, you.\\" Dad laughed heartily and put on his shirt. Mom came out of the master bedroom, holding Jihee. \\"Is Minkuk still sleeping?\\" \\"Yeah, everyone, please be quiet.\\" [Minkuk, you're seven years old. You should be waking up bright and early.] Leaving behind Minkuk, who seemed to lack in many areas, made me feel uneasy. \\"Sungguk, can you watch Jihee for a bit? Mom will quickly prepare breakfast with Dad.\\" Mom laid Jihee down on the floor. Jihee was even more well-behaved than Minkuk. She stayed still wherever she was laid down. I stared at Jihee's face. [Sigh...] I sighed. [Jihee, who do you take after?] I perfectly inherited only the good traits from Mom and Dad. Minkuk was somewhat okay too. But Jihee seemed to have inherited only the flaws from Mom and Dad. Mom's bulging forehead. Dad's square jaw. Jihee's future plans seemed to need a major revision. [Is she smart at least?] I quickly sat next to Jihee and started reading her a fairy tale. But Jihee just wiggled her body. I shook my head and looked down at Jihee. [Jeon Jihee. What are you going to do for a living?] Giggling. [Funny. Your brother is telling you.] Giggling. [I was already worried about what I'd do for a living when I was a hundred days old.] Giggling. [Let's not talk about it.] I closed the fairy tale book. * * * \\"Oh, sister. I'll talk to Sungguk.\\" Mom hung up the phone and looked at me. \\"Sungguk, do you remember doing 'Five Men and a Baby Basket'?\\" \\"Yeah. I did it with 'Just'.\\" \\"Wow, our Sungguk is really a genius.\\" \\"Mom always says that. Why?\\" \\"This time, the broadcasting station wants to film 'Five Men and a Baby Basket: The Sequel' with you. That director is going to direct a project at our agency soon. While discussing, the idea came up, and the broadcasting station and 'Just' are trying to make room in their schedule.\\" 'Just' became a hit group after 'Five Men and a Baby Basket.' Especially the song <It's a Lie> that I chose for them is still considered a classic to this day. Michael, that arrogant guy, left, and they became an idol group that exerts a positive influence, so their fandom was incredible. \\"Mom, what about the appearance fee?\\" Dad pressed his finger against my forehead. \\"This kid. You shouldn't be so keen on money at your age, Dad told you.\\" \\"It's being financially savvy.\\" I began to express my inner thoughts more openly. \\"Anyway, Sungguk, you can't win with words.\\" \\"Sungguk, how about doing this program before you go? Mom thinks it would be nice for our family to watch this video whenever we miss Sungguk before he goes to study.\\" \\"Let's have a meeting first.\\" \\"Okay, the director will come to the office this afternoon, so let's go together.\\" \\"Okay!\\" * * * \\"Sungguk, how long has it been? When did you get so big?\\" \\"Hello, Director.\\" \\"Do you remember me?\\" \\"Not really.\\" I lied. There was no way I couldn't remember. But it's rare for a child to remember someone they met around their second birthday at the age of eight. \\"This kid, I heard you're a genius, but you don't remember me. I'm hurt.\\" \\"I'm sorry.\\" \\"Wow, you can even speak well now. And I heard you're good at English and French?\\" \\"Yes.\\" The director had lost quite a bit of hair in a few years. He was casually covering it with a hat, but his forehead had widened. \\"By the way, Kim CEO mentioned that you came up with the idea for a cooking competition program?\\" \\"I thought it was interesting watching Dad do it.\\" \\"Sungguk, we're planning a program based on your idea. If it goes well, your name will be on the planning.\\" [I wonder if they'll take care of the copyright...] I smiled broadly. \\"Thank you.\\" We didn't talk about money. I had reached an age where talking about money wouldn't make me look simply innocent. \\"Director, have a cup of coffee and talk. You know Sungguk just got here and you haven't stopped talking?\\" Kim Miyoung skillfully diverted the director's attention from me. [I finally caught a break.] When I was younger, I couldn't speak and my pronunciation was unclear, so I would blurt out various thoughts internally, but as I grew older, I became cautious about speaking. I was afraid that my inner thoughts would burst out uncontrollably. \\"Sungguk, shall we have a meeting now?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I quickly entered the meeting room. \\"Sungguk, here's your milk.\\" CEO Kim Miyoung handed me a glass of milk. Mom quickly served coffee to the director and a few staff members. \\"Director, it's really been too long.\\" \\"Sungguk's sibling was born, right?\\" \\"Yes, it's almost 100 days.\\" \\"That kid will surely be quite a character.\\" What that meant was, Jihee's character couldn't be compared to mine and Minkuk's. In other words, we shouldn't compare her to us. The director sipped his coffee and passed around a few proposals. \\"Take a look at this reunion episode with Sungguk and 'Just'.\\" Staff members, Kim Miyoung, Mom, and I quickly skimmed through the proposals the director handed out. The story was about 'Five Men and a Baby Basket 7 Years Later.' The group Just, which was almost unknown during 'Five Men and a Baby Basket,' and me, who was almost two years old at the time, how our lives have changed after 7 years. 'Just' became the nation's idol group in South Korea. However, now their contract period has ended, and several members, including Beomseon, have moved to other agencies. It was the typical disbandment process of a boy band. And the story about me was brief. Born under parents who were orphaned at a young age, I captivated the public's heart with my outstanding appearance and talent, occasionally engaging in modeling activities before disappearing from the public eye. Meanwhile, I was recognized as a genius, excelling in languages and various fields, and became the first sponsor of the Junho Foundation of the Hyojin Group, preparing to study abroad in the U.S. I suddenly became curious about someone. \\"Director, what about Michael?\\" \\"Michael? Sungguk, do you remember Michael?\\" Oops. But in such cases, it's best to stay calm. \\"I saw the videotape.\\" \\"Indeed, a genius is extraordinary. What's Michael doing?\\" The director looked at one of the staff members. It seemed to be a scriptwriter. \\"We've been looking for him too.\\" \\"He didn't get into any trouble, did he?\\" \\"He got into minor troubles. Fortunately, he's been running an American-style homemade burger shop in Itaewon recently. It's quite well-reviewed.\\" \\"He seems to have settled down.\\" \\"He's married too.\\" Michael's life had changed a bit from what I had observed in my previous life. He left 'Just' early, went through ups and downs, and became a decent person. \\"Director, I want to meet Michael.\\" \\"Sungguk, are you serious?\\" \\"Yes. I saw in the old video that Michael and I always fought. It's not right for a baby to do that, so I want to apologize.\\" \\"We often show the old videos to the kids.\\" Mom explained. \\"Sungguk, you don't have to apologize. Michael was the one who bullied you.\\" [Director, I know. I remember everything. But would that make for a good program, huh?] \\"I think I also bullied Michael.\\" I just smiled broadly. The director scratched his head with a pen and looked at the scriptwriter. \\"Shall we create a scene of reconciliation between Michael and Sungguk? While we're at it, let's also create scenes of reconciliation with other members. What do you think?\\" \\"That sounds good. But would Michael be willing to do it?\\" \\"He's running a homemade burger shop in Itaewon. The economy is tough these days, so appearing on the show would be good advertising. 'Just' members are ultimately all split up, but if they can advertise themselves, they'll all come.\\" \\"Let's try contacting him.\\" \\"Thanks to Sungguk, we've got an item.\\" The director patted my head. * * * \\"Five Men and a Baby Basket 7 Years Later?\\" \\"Yes, Mr. Michael.\\" The scriptwriter was sweating. Michael's personality, who was running a homemade burger shop in Itaewon, hadn't changed at all. \\"Do you know how much I was criticized because of that show? Do you think I'd want to go? Moreover, my private life was exposed, and I was almost kicked out of the group.\\" \\"That's why. Let's resolve those misunderstandings and create a scene of reconciliation.\\" \\"Talk sense. Not a single one of them called me after I left.\\" Michael flipped the burger patty while grumbling. \\"Let's resolve those misunderstandings and misunderstandings.\\" \\"Fine. But I have a condition. First, try this.\\" The scriptwriter took a bite of the homemade burger Michael offered. The juicy patty was quite delicious. \\"It's good.\\" \\"Right?\\" \\"I want 'Just' members to come to our shop. That's the proper way to promote. Everyone knows if you just film me and leave, it's for promotion. If you do that, I'm fine with it.\\" Michael flipped the burning patty and spoke."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[전지희. 너는 이 전성국 동생으로 태어난 이상, 인생 빡세게 살 각오 해야 할 거야.] * * * 1998년 12월 11일 금요일. 정식으로 아빠와 수유점 사장님이 합동으로 개발한 <원아저씨 보쌈>의 도시락과 혼술 족발 안주가 효진 푸드의 이름을 걸고 전국의 편의점과 마트에 전시되는 날이다. 아빠와 엄마 그리고 나와 민국이. 유모차에 탄 지희까지 우리 가족 모두는 아파트 상가에 있는 효진 푸드 편의점을 찾았다. 그런데 어디에도 아빠의 <원아저씨 보쌈> 상품은 보이지 않았다. “아직 도착을 안 했나….” 아빠는 실망한 기색이 역력했다. [아빠, 나만 믿어.] 나는 얼른 계산대로 가서 까치발을 세우고 물었다. “사장님.” “나, 사장 아니고 알바인데.” “알바님, <원아저씨 보쌈> 도시락이랑 족발이 안 보여서요.” “그게 뭔데?” [하아, 이 가게 알바인 네가 알아야지, 내가 어떻게 알아!] 삼전 그룹 후계자일 때 너 같은 알바 만났으면 정말 인생 앞날이 캄캄하게 만들어버릴 수 있었는데. 나는 화를 가라앉히며 다시 물었다. “한번 찾아봐 주시겠어요? 효진 푸드에서 나온 거예요. 오늘 나온다고 했어요.” “진짜 애가 가지가지 오만 가지 시키네.” 알바는 투덜거리면서 창고로 들어갔다. 이때, 사장으로 보이는 중년의 남자가 들어서더니 진열대를 살폈다. “영석아, 효진 푸드에서 나온 음식, 왜 진열 안 돼 있어? 회사에서 오늘 저녁에 관리자 돈다고 했어.” “지금 진열하려고요.” “아이고, 내 속이 터진다, 터져.” 사장은 못마땅한 얼굴로 중얼거렸다. 그러곤 나를 쳐다봤다. “아이고, 잘생겼네, 고 녀석. 뭐 찾아?” “<원아저씨 보쌈>에서 나온 도시락이랑 족발이요.” “어, 지금 진열할 거야. 근데 너 그거 어떻게 알아? 오늘 나온 건데.” 난 아빠를 자랑스럽게 가리켰다. “저희 아빠가 개발한 거예요.” “어? 여기 상가에 있는 <원아저씨 보쌈>에서 했다더니 진짜인가 보네.” 사장은 얼른 아빠에게 다가갔다. “오가며 저도 몇 번 시켜 먹었는데, 그 집 보쌈, 안 그래도 맛있다고 생각했어요.” “감사합니다.” 아빠는 쑥스러운 듯 머리를 긁적였다. 이때, 알바생이 <원아저씨 보쌈>의 도시락과 족발을 가지고 나왔다. “이런! 이웃 가게에서 만들다니…. 맨 앞에 전시할게요.” “감사합니다!” 내가 소리치자 민국이도 따라 소리쳤다. “감싸합니다!” “아이고, 애들도 이쁘네. 니들 사탕 줄까?” “밍구기 딸기맛 사탕 좋아해요.” 편의점 사장이 사탕을 가지러 간 사이에 아빠는 기분 좋게 여섯 개의 도시락과 술안주 할 족발 세 개까지 야무지게 챙기고 맥주와 소주도 담아 계산대로 갔다. “사장님, 이거 계산해 주세요.” “이거 개발하면서 많이 드셨죠?” “네. 그래도 사장님 매상도 올리고 앞으로도 진열 잘 부탁드린다는 의미로요.” “당연하죠. 아파트 상가에 있는 <원아저씨 보쌈>집에서 만든 거라고 내가 홍보 엄청 할게요.” “감사합니다.” 나는 얼른 과자와 우유 몇 개까지 계산대 위에 올렸다. “아빠, 계산.” [이 정도는 매상 팍팍 올려줘야지.] 엄마도 평소 같으면 편의점에서 사지도 않는 기저귀까지 계산대에 올렸다. “사장님, 이것도요.” “우리 매상도 이렇게 올려주시니, 진짜 <원아저씨 보쌈> 대박 났으면 좋겠네요.” * * * <원아저씨 보쌈> 도시락으로 저녁상이 차려졌다. 김미영이 사온 도시락까지 해서 내일 저녁까지는 보쌈 도시락을 먹어야 할 판이었다. “저도 동네 마트랑 편의점 싹 돌았는데, 맨 앞에 전시되어 있어서 너무 기분 좋더라고요.” “부끄럽네요. 김 대표님, 한 잔 하세요.” 아빠는 김미영 대표의 잔에 맥주를 따랐다. “아빠, 난 우유.” “밍구기는 딸기 우유.” “이 녀석들 자기주장 확실하네.” 아빠는 얼른 나와 민국이의 잔에도 우유를 따라줬다. “참, 성국아. 너 다음 달이면 출국이지?” “네.” 드디어 유학길에 오를 날이 정해졌다. 9월부터 시작하는 미국 학기 전에 적응을 위해서 1월에 출국해서 짧은 어학 코스를 밟을 예정이었다. 엄마는 옆에서 벌써부터 걱정 가득한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 엄마 성국이 보고 싶어서 어쩌지.” “엄마가 미국 오면 되지.” 나는 담담하게 말했다. [어차피 크면 다 품 떠나는 게 자식이야, 엄마.] 더 큰 세상에 나가기 위해서는 대한민국에 머무를 수만은 없었다. 아빠가 좀 시무룩한 얼굴로 맥주를 마셨다. “아빠도 성국이 엄청 보고 싶을 거 같아.” “형아, 밍구기도. 밍구기도 가고 싶어.” “민국아, 넌 좀 더 공부를 잘해야 해. 형아 없는 동안 공부 열심히 하고 있어.” [없는 집에서 성공하려면 공부를 뛰어나게 잘하든, 특출한 재능이 있든가 해야 하는 거야.] 나는 민국이 머리를 쓰다듬었다. 민국이는 거의 울 듯한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. 이전에는 이 얼굴에 마음이 약해져서 미국 유학을 포기했다. 하지만 이제 그럴 수 없었다. 대한민국 교육은 나를 담기에는 그릇이 작았다. 이때, 아빠 핸드폰이 울렸다. 신파로 흐르는 흐름을 막아주는 적절한 타이밍의 전화였다. “여보세요. 네, 부장님.” 효진 푸드 구성현 부장인 모양이었다. “벌써 그런 게 집계가 되나요? 첫날인데요.” 전화를 받는 아빠의 표정이 점점 밝아졌다. “이렇게 신경 써주셔서 감사합니다. 네, 부장님도 좋은 주말 되세요.” 아빠는 전화를 끊고, 뿌듯한 얼굴로 가족들을 쳐다봤다. “<원아저씨 보쌈>이 오늘 발매한 간편식 중에서 2등 했대요.” “진짜?” “응.” 아빠는 쑥스러운 듯 고개를 끄덕였다. 그 와중에도 미소는 점점 얼굴에 번졌다. 나는 얼른 아빠에게 가서 안겨서 등을 도닥였다. [아빠, 그동안 수고했어. 이제 나도 마음 편하게 미국 갈 수 있겠어. 아빠 이렇게 성장시키느라 지난 8년 동안 나 정말 힘들었어.] 울컥. 지난 8년의 고생을 생각하니 갑자기 눈물이 벅차올랐다. “성국아, 우는 거야?” “응.” “왜? 아빠가 잘돼서 기분 좋아서?” “응.” 대답은 그렇게 하고, 주마등처럼 지나가는 내 고생을 떠올렸다. 원룸에서 시작해서 잠실 아파트까지. 민국이도 사람 만들고, 이제 아빠 일도 자리를 잡아갔다. 내가 미국 가 있을 동안 가족들 손가락 빨 일은 적어도 없을 거 같았다. 지희가 꼬물거리면서 히죽거렸다. [그래, 지희야. 나 미국 가 있는 동안 무럭무럭 잘 자라서 보자. 오빠가 돌아와서 너도 밥벌이 제대로 하게 해줄게.] 아빠가 내 등을 도닥이며 안았다. “성국아, 아빠 고생을 네가 알아주다니 아빠도 감동이야.” [아빠 고생 말고, 내 고생.] * * * 엄마도 오랜만에 마신 맥주 한 잔에 얼굴이 붉어졌다. 다들 기분이 좋아진 가운데, 민국이는 이미 거실에서 꾸벅꾸벅 졸았다. 아빠가 민국이를 안고 일어났다. “민국이는 내가 재울게. 김 대표님, 오늘 한 잔 더 해야 하니까 좀만 기다리세요.” “그럴게요.” “언니, 그럼 저도 얼른 지희 재우고 올게요. 우리끼리 진짜 오랜만에 한잔해요.” “성국이도!” 나는 얼른 우유를 마시며 손을 들었다. “성국이 넌 자야지.” “하아, 어른들은 너무해.” “성국이는 좀 더 놀게 하자. 나 성국이랑 할 이야기도 있어.” [무슨 이야기?] 나는 김미영 대표를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 니가 저번에 말한 음식 프로그램 경연 말이야.” “네.” “<다섯 남자와 아기 바구니> 하셨던 감독님이 몇 년 전에 프리로 선언하시면서 나왔거든. 그동안 IMF 때문에 힘드셨는데, 우리 아이템 좋다고 같이 해보자고 하셔.” [내 촉은 틀리지 않는다고.] 나는 가만히 김미영의 다음 말을 기다렸다. “그래서 당분간 매니지먼트를 쉬고 제작사로 전환하려고 하거든.” [김 대표, 뜸 들이지 말고 어서 다음 이야기를 해봐.] “성국아, 난 네가 가진 능력이 좀 남다른 거 같아. 미국 가서 하고 싶은 공부 많이 하고, 엔터테인먼트 업계 공부 해보면 어떨까 싶어서.” 이번에는 내 눈이 반짝였다. 확실히 김미영은 삼전 기획 경리부에서 썩기에는 아까운 사람이었다. “앞으로 우리나라도 연예계 업계가 더 커질 거고, 지금처럼 주먹구구로 하는 시스템에 많이 변화가 올 것 같아. 넌 어릴 적에 아역으로 일도 해봤고, 이 업계 일을 경험해 봤잖아. 한번 잘 생각해봐.” “조언 감사해요.” 나는 깍듯하게 감사의 말을 전했다. 김미영 대표는 맥주를 마시며 빙긋 웃었다. “성국아, 정말 너랑 대화하다 보면 회사에서 높은 분이랑 대화하는 것 같단 말이야, 꼭.” [당연하지. 나 전직 삼전 그룹 회장이야.] 나는 그저 미소를 지었다. 엄마와 아빠가 민국이와 지희를 재우고 나왔다. 나도 슬슬 자리를 떠줘야 할 타이밍이었다. “엄마, 성국이도 잘래.” “성국아, 양치해야지.” [치카치카 시르다.] 나는 엄마 손에 끌려 욕실로 들어갔다. * * * “끝도 없이 추락할 것만 같은 코스피 지수가 상승세를 타고 있습니다. 대한민국은 빠르게 IMF 부채를 갚는 중이고, 수출 흑자는 사상 최대치입니다.” 뉴스에서 기분 좋은 소식이 흘러나왔다. 내가 바닥에서 줍듯이 산 삼전 주식이 가파른 상승 곡선을 그리는 것은 당연했다. 뉴스를 보던 아빠가 허리를 바로 세웠다. “성국아, 저것 봐. 삼전 주식 장난 아니게 올랐어.” [아빠, 나만 믿으라니까.] “성국아, 너 비상금 필요할지 모르니까 조금 팔까?” 나는 팔을 딱 낀 채 고개를 절레절레 저었다. 삼전은 장투다. 나는 삼전 주식의 끝을 이미 알고 있다.","completion":"Episode 71 Finally, the day had arrived. The day our third child was born. Mom had been in labor since the morning, and after lunchtime, she grabbed my hand and we headed to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic. Dad closed the store to come, and CEO Kim Mi-young was with us too. Since my aunt was looking after Min-guk, I waited anxiously for the birth of the third child with Dad and CEO Kim Mi-young in front of the delivery room. Dad kept pacing back and forth in front of the delivery room. \\"Mr. Sung-guk, please sit and wait.\\" \\"It feels like it's been a long time since she went into the delivery room, why haven't we heard anything?\\" \\"It hasn't even been an hour yet.\\" \\"Is that so...\\" [Dad, calm down.] I shook my head in disbelief. Although we occasionally heard screams from the hallway, we waited calmly. I had experienced childbirth twice in my previous life. This was Dad's third time, so he should have been better at this than me, but he was restless. Then, the door to the delivery room opened, and a nurse came out. \\"You're Kim So-young's guardian, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"The baby is almost out. If you want to cut the umbilical cord, come in with me.\\" \\"Of course, I'll cut it.\\" Dad hurried into the delivery room. Kim Mi-young looked at me with a happy face. \\"Sung-guk, you have a baby sister.\\" [Should I be happy?] I wasn't happy at all. Dad was just managing one pork wrap shop, and we were barely starting to prepare ready-to-eat meals. They were to be launched by the end of the year, so the revenue would probably be seen next year, and now there was one more child. Mom worked at SKJ Entertainment, where I was signed, but she had to take her hands off work for a while because of childcare. Moreover, SKJ Entertainment was trying to change its business type to a production company after Song Hye-sun left, so there was hardly any income at the moment. Min-guk was barely making his own living... And now a third child.... It really was a mountain beyond a mountain, and a tree with many branches has no calm days. The nurse came out again and gestured to me and Kim Mi-young. \\"You can see the baby in the newborn room. It's a girl.\\" Kim Mi-young held my hand tightly and headed to the newborn room. There was a little blood bundle beyond the glass. I pressed my forehead against the glass. [Jeon Ji-hee. Since you were born as the sister of this Jeon Sung-guk, you should be prepared to live a tough life.] * * * December 11, 1998, Friday. It was the official day when the <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> lunchbox and solo-drinking pig's feet snack, jointly developed by Dad and the owner of the nursing home, were displayed in convenience stores and supermarkets nationwide under the name of Hyo-jin Food. Dad, Mom, me, Min-guk, and even Ji-hee in the stroller, our whole family visited the Hyo-jin Food convenience store in the apartment complex. But Dad's <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> products were nowhere to be seen. \\"Maybe they haven't arrived yet....\\" Dad looked visibly disappointed. [Dad, just trust me.] I quickly went to the counter and stood on tiptoe to ask. \\"Excuse me.\\" \\"I'm not the owner, I'm just a part-timer.\\" \\"Part-timer, I can't see the <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> lunchbox and pig's feet.\\" \\"What's that?\\" [Sigh, you're the part-timer here, you should know, not me!] If I were still the heir to the Samjeon Group, I could have made your future bleak. I calmed down and asked again. \\"Could you please check? It's from Hyo-jin Food. It was supposed to be released today.\\" \\"Kids these days ask for everything.\\" The part-timer grumbled and went into the storage room. Then, a middle-aged man who seemed to be the owner came in and looked around the display. \\"Yeong-seok, why isn't the food from Hyo-jin Food displayed? The company said they'd check tonight.\\" \\"I was about to display it.\\" \\"Oh, my stomach is going to burst.\\" The owner muttered discontentedly and then looked at me. \\"Hey, handsome boy, what are you looking for?\\" \\"The lunchbox and pig's feet from <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap>.\\" \\"Oh, we're about to display it. But how did you know? It was released today.\\" I proudly pointed at my dad. \\"My dad developed it.\\" \\"Oh? I heard it was from <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> in our complex, so it's true.\\" The owner quickly approached my dad. \\"I've ordered from there a few times, thinking the pork wrap was really good.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Dad scratched his head shyly. Then, the part-timer came out with the <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> lunchbox and pig's feet. \\"Oh! It's made by the store next door.... I'll display it at the front.\\" \\"Thank you!\\" I shouted, and Min-guk followed suit. \\"Thank you!\\" \\"Oh, the kids are cute too. Do you want some candy?\\" \\"Min-guk likes strawberry-flavored candy.\\" While the convenience store owner went to get candy, Dad proudly picked up six lunchboxes and three pig's feet for drinking snacks, along with beer and soju, and went to the counter. \\"Owner, please ring these up.\\" \\"You must have eaten a lot while developing these, right?\\" \\"Yes. But it's also to help increase your sales and to ask for good display in the future.\\" \\"Of course. I'll promote it a lot since it's made by <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> in our apartment complex.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" I quickly put some snacks and milk on the counter. \\"Dad, pay for these.\\" [I have to help boost the sales.] Mom, who usually wouldn't buy from a convenience store, even put diapers on the counter. \\"Owner, this too, please.\\" \\"I hope <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> really hits it big since you're helping our sales like this.\\" * * * <Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> lunchboxes were prepared for dinner. With the lunchboxes Kim Mi-young brought, we had to eat pork wrap lunchboxes until tomorrow's dinner. \\"I also went around the neighborhood mart and convenience store, and it felt so good to see them displayed at the front.\\" \\"It's embarrassing. CEO Kim, have a drink.\\" Dad poured beer for CEO Kim Mi-young. \\"Dad, I want milk.\\" \\"Min-guk wants strawberry milk.\\" \\"These kids are so assertive.\\" Dad quickly poured milk for me and Min-guk. \\"By the way, Sung-guk, you're leaving the country next month, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" The day I would go abroad for my studies was set. I was scheduled to leave in January to adapt before the American semester starting in September and to take a short language course. Mom looked at me with a face full of worry from the side. \\"Sung-guk, mom will miss you so much.\\" \\"Mom can come to the U.S.\\" I said calmly. [After all, children leave the nest when they grow up, Mom.] To step into a bigger world, I couldn't stay in South Korea forever. Dad drank his beer with a somewhat gloomy face. \\"Dad will miss Sung-guk a lot too.\\" \\"Brother, Min-guk too. Min-guk wants to go too.\\" \\"Min-guk, you need to study harder. Study hard while your brother is away.\\" [To succeed from a humble background, you either need to study exceptionally well or have a special talent.] I patted Min-guk's head. Min-guk looked at me almost tearfully. In the past, I gave up going to the U.S. because of that face. But I couldn't do that anymore. South Korean education was too small a vessel to contain me. Then, Dad's phone rang. It was a timely call that interrupted the melodramatic flow. \\"Hello. Yes, Manager.\\" It seemed to be Manager Goo Seong-hyeon from Hyo-jin Food. \\"Can you already tally that? It's the first day.\\" Dad's expression brightened as he took the call. \\"Thank you for taking care of it. Yes, have a good weekend too, Manager.\\" Dad hung up and looked at his family with a proud face. \\"<Uncle Won's Pork Wrap> ranked second among the convenience foods released today.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Dad nodded shyly, but his smile spread across his face. I quickly hugged Dad and patted his back. [Dad, you've worked hard. Now I can go to the U.S. with peace of mind. Dad, I've really struggled to grow you up over the past 8 years.] I choked up. Thinking about the hardships of the past 8 years suddenly brought tears to my eyes. \\"Sung-guk, are you crying?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Why? Are you happy because Dad is doing well?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I answered that way, but I recalled my struggles flashing before my eyes. From a one-room apartment to a Jamsil apartment. I made Min-guk a decent person, and now Dad's business was starting to settle. It seemed there would be no need for my family to worry while I was in the U.S. Ji-hee giggled and squirmed. [Yes, Ji-hee. Grow well while I'm in the U.S. When I come back, I'll make sure you can earn your keep too.] Dad hugged me and patted my back. \\"Sung-guk, Dad is moved that you recognize his hard work.\\" [Not Dad's hard work, my hard work.] * * * Mom's face turned red after a rare drink of beer. Everyone was in a good mood, and Min-guk was already dozing off in the living room. Dad stood up with Min-guk in his arms. \\"I'll put Min-guk to bed. CEO Kim, please wait a bit longer for another drink.\\" \\"Sure.\\" \\"Then I'll quickly put Ji-hee to bed too. Let's have a real drink together for the first time in a while.\\" \\"Sung-guk too!\\" I quickly drank my milk and raised my hand. \\"Sung-guk should go to bed.\\" \\"Ah, adults are so unfair.\\" \\"Let Sung-guk stay up a bit longer. I have something to talk to him about.\\" [What do you want to talk about?] I looked at CEO Kim Mi-young. \\"Sung-guk, about the food competition program you mentioned last time.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"The director who did <Five Men and a Baby Basket> declared himself freelance a few years ago and left. He's had a tough time since the IMF, but he said he likes our item and wants to work on it together.\\" [My intuition is never wrong.] I quietly waited for Kim Mi-young's next words. \\"So, I'm thinking of taking a break from management and transitioning to a production company.\\" [CEO Kim, don't beat around the bush and continue.] \\"Sung-guk, I think you have a special talent. How about studying a lot in the U.S., including the entertainment industry?\\" My eyes sparkled. Kim Mi-young was indeed too good to waste away in the accounting department of Samjeon Planning. \\"I think the entertainment industry in our country will grow even more, and the current makeshift system will undergo many changes. You've worked as a child actor and experienced this industry. Think about it.\\" \\"Thank you for the advice.\\" I politely expressed my gratitude. Kim Mi-young drank her beer and smiled broadly. \\"Sung-guk, talking to you feels like I'm talking to a high-ranking executive at a company, really.\\" [Of course. I'm the former chairman of Samjeon Group.] I just smiled. Mom and Dad came back after putting Min-guk and Ji-hee to bed. It was time for me to leave the spot. \\"Mom, Sung-guk will go to bed too.\\" \\"Sung-guk, you need to brush your teeth.\\" [Brush, brush, Sir.] I was dragged into the bathroom by Mom. * * * \\"The KOSPI index, which seemed to be in endless decline, is on the rise. South Korea is rapidly repaying its IMF debt, and export surpluses are at an all-time high.\\" The news broadcasted good news. It was natural for the Samjeon stocks I picked up from the bottom to draw a steep upward curve. Dad straightened up as he watched the news. \\"Sung-guk, look at that. Samjeon's stock has risen incredibly.\\" [Dad, just trust me.] \\"Sung-guk, should we sell a bit in case you need emergency funds?\\" I firmly shook my head. Samjeon is for long-term investment.

[살면서 장학생 한 번쯤 되는 거 아니야? 다들 공부 못했나 봐?] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “작가님, 성국이가 장학생으로 뽑힌 거면 공부를 엄청 잘한 거 아니에요?” “네. 성국이가 영어, 프랑스어는 거의 모국어처럼 하고요. 다른 학업 성취도 뛰어나요. 삼전 그룹도 엄청 탐냈다고 들었어요.” 모두들 나를 다시 쳐다봤다. [다들 그렇게 쳐다볼 필요 없어. 나 아이큐 고작 121이야. 평범한 편이라고.] “성국아, 나중에 너 뭐가 될 거야? 박사? 교수?” [그런 건 시시해서 안 해.] 나는 고개를 저었다. “엔터테인먼트 회사 하고 싶어요.” 그 말에 다들 놀라 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 정말 남다르구나.” 범선이 놀라는 사이, 달칵 문 열리는 소리가 났다. 마이클이 수염을 덥수룩하게 기른 모습으로 들어섰다. 마이클은 주머니에 손을 푹 찔러 넣은 게 여전히 불만 가득한 얼굴이었다. “어, 마이클!” 태형이 리더답게 마이클을 먼저 반겼다. “어… 형.” 마이클은 굳은 인상으로 어색하게 인사했다. [자식. 아직도 앙금이 남아 있구만.] 마이클은 나를 보더니 두툼한 손으로 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “네가 성국이구나. 많이 컸네.” [누가 할 소리. 마이클, 사람은 좀 됐어?] 문이 열리면서 커피와 간단한 스낵을 들고 김미영이 들어왔다. “이제 다 모이셨네요. 감독님이 사실 다들 인사 먼저 하고 이야기도 나누라고 좀 천천히 오신대요. 그래도 30분 안에는 오실 거예요. 커피 좀 드세요. 성국이는 우유.” [나도 진하게 내린 에스프레소 한 잔 마시고 싶다고.] 하지만 내 손은 우유를 잡고 있었다. 마이클은 내 우유를 뺏더니 입구를 손으로 열어서 빨대까지 집어넣었다. “마셔.” [마이클, 방송 탈 거라고 착한 척 연기하는 거야?] “감사합니다.” 나는 꾸벅 인사를 하고 우유를 쭉 들이켰다. “마이클, 그동안 어떻게 지냈어? 이태원에서 수제 버거집 낸 거 맞아?” 리더인 태형이 대표로 마이클에서 물어봤다. “네, 한 반년 됐어요. 장사도 그럭저럭 돼요. 다른 멤버들 소식은 간간이 연예 뉴스에서 봤어요.” 마이클은 생각 외로 덤덤하게 자기 이야기를 풀어놨다. “팀 탈퇴하고… 뭐 쫓겨나다시피 한 거지만, 그땐 화도 많이 나고 열도 받고 그래서 나쁜 일도 좀 하고….” 마이클은 ‘저스트’ 탈퇴 후 다른 그룹을 만들었지만, 곧 대마초를 피우는 바람에 그 팀마저 해체됐다. “암튼 다시 미국 가서 이 일 저 일 기웃거려 봤는데, 하고 싶은 것도 뭐, 그렇더라고요. 그 와중에 동네 수제 버거집에서 아르바이트했는데, 요리가 재미있어서 이것저것 하다가 이 길로 들어서게 됐어요.” “네 길 잘 찾았구나.” 태형이 마이클을 도닥였다. “우리도 우여곡절 많았어. 잘나갈 때야 서로 정신없었고, 해체하기 전에는 서로 의견도 갈리고 싸우기도 많이 하고… 성국이 있는데 이런 이야기 해도 되나 몰라.” 나는 괜히 손바닥으로 귀를 막는 시늉을 했다. “이 녀석, 완전 여우네.” 태형은 유쾌하게 웃고는 이야기를 이었다. “나랑 루카스, 재현이는 지금 소속사에 계속 남아서 개인 음반이나 활동 할 거 같아. 범선이는 이번에 영화 들어가.” “다들 제 갈 길 잘 가시네요. 성국아, 넌 초등학생이지?” “성국이 효진 그룹 장학재단에서 후원해서 미국에 유학 간대. 성국이 알고 보니까 천재였더라고.” “그래서 너, 나 쫓겨나게 만들었구나?” 마이클이 나를 빤히 쳐다봤다. 회의실 안은 갑자기 조용해졌다. 사실 그때의 일을 기억하는 사람들이라면 마이클의 말이 틀리지 않다는 것을 알 것이다. 앙숙으로 관계 설정이 된 마이클과 나는 꽤 인기 있는 조합이었다. 시청자들의 반응도 좋았고, 감독과 작가도 계속해서 우리를 부각시켰다. 하지만 그 시절 마이클은 싸가지 없기로는 내 전생에 비할 수가 없었고, 나는 그 꼴이 보기 싫어서 마이클의 실수를 부각시켜 그대로 아웃시켜 버렸다. 범선이 마이클을 말렸다. “야, 두 살짜리가 뭘 알았겠어. 그만해.” “아니. 난 얘가 두 살이 아니라 꼭 마흔쯤 먹은 아저씨 같았다니까. 암튼 그랬다고.” “다 네가 그 일로 안 풀려서 그런 거지, 애가 뭘 안다고 그래.” “암튼 나도 다 잊었어요.” 나는 모른 척 우유를 쪽 마셨다. * * * 첫 촬영이 시작됐다. 카메라가 나를 쫓아다니며 하루를 찍는 거였다. 나는 평소대로 아침 7시에 일어나서 세수를 하고는 엄마가 따라주는 우유를 가지고 방으로 가서 노트북으로 증시 상황과 세계 뉴스를 검색했다. 옆에 있던 작가가 이런 질문을 던졌다. “성국아, 다 영어고 간혹 프랑스어 독일어도 있는데 다 해석 가능해?” “네.” 나는 기사 몇 개를 클릭해서 내용을 전반적으로 알려줬다. 오전 내내 카메라는 효진 그룹에서 제공하는 영재교육을 받는 내 모습을 담았고 담당 선생님들의 인터뷰를 땄다. 대부분 이 나이의 아이에게 있어서 굉장히 특별한 재능이고, 성국이가 일반 학교에서 적응하지 못한 이유가 이거라는 식으로 이야기를 했다. 마지막엔 카메라가 나를 메인으로 잡았다. 질문은 간단했다. “성국아, 미국 가서 공부해서 뭐가 되고 싶어?” “대한민국 엔터테인먼트 업계를 이끌어 나가고 싶어요.” “다시 배우 할 생각이야?” “아니요. 좋은 가수와 배우들을 키우고 싶어요.” 나는 배시시 웃었다. “컷!” 감독님의 사인 소리가 크게 울렸다. * * * [여기가 마이클이 하는 햄버거 가게구나.] 마이클이 하는 가게는 생각보다 협소했다. 대형 철판이 전면부에 있었고, 앉아서 먹을 수 있는 자리는 네 군데뿐이었다. 대부분 포장 손님들인 것 같았다. 나는 마이클에게 사온 금전수 화분을 내밀었다. “돈 많이 버는 나무래요.” “네가 산 거야, 성국아?” “네!” 마이클은 온화한 미소를 지었다. 아마 자막에는 ‘앙숙이었던 두 사람은 이제 친구가 되려고 합니다.’ 뭐 이렇게 나갈 것 같았다. 곧이어 ‘저스트’ 멤버들이 도착했다. 모두들 선물 하나씩 챙겨온 모습이었다. “마이클, 우리 브로마이드에 사인해서 걸어둘까?” 루카스가 마이클까지 있는 1집 대형 브로마이드를 꺼냈다. “야, 우리 이제 한물갔잖아.” 재현이 농담조로 말했다. “한물갔어도 ‘저스트’는 ‘저스트’지. 다들 사인해줘.” 마이클이 오히려 흔쾌히 찬성하자 모두들 브로마이드에 사인을 하기 시작했다. “성국이도 사인해야지.” 구성 작가가 슬그머니 예전 방송국에 걸려 있었던 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 브로마이드를 내밀었다. “와, 이거 완전 유물이잖아.” 태형이 반갑게 브로마이드를 들었다. “야, 다들 여기에도 사인해. 성국아, 너두 사인해야지.” “네!” 나는 얼른 펜을 들고 내 얼굴 위로 세 글자를 또박또박 썼다. -전성국. 1999년 1월 23일. 모두 사인한 대형 브로마이드 두 장이 마이클의 수제 버거집에 걸렸다. 마이클이 정성껏 구운 수제 버거를 들고 나왔다. “자, 이게 내가 미국에서 3년간 알바하며 비법 배워온 수제 버거야. 맛들 봐요.” 나는 큼지막한 수제 버거 하나를 한 입에 깨물었다. 순간 육즙이 미친 듯이 입속으로 돌진했다. [허, 이거 진짜 맛있잖아.] 마이클이 내 표정을 보더니얼른 내 옆구리를 슬쩍 찌르며 속삭였다. “성국아, 예전에 네가 나 망하게 했으니까 살리는 것도 네가 해야지.”","completion":"Episode 73 Click. The meeting room door opened, and the members of 'Just' entered. Still close friends, the leader Taehyung, muscle man Lucas, and the handsome Jaehyun entered together. \\"Sungguk-ah! Is it really Sungguk?\\" \\"Yes! I'm Sungguk. Hello.\\" I greeted them with a stranger's face and a bow. Remembering an idol I saw around the age of two would be an overstatement. \\"Wow, Sungguk-ah! Do you remember us?\\" \\"Not really.\\" [I remember everything, though. But why don't I see Beomseon?] Click. As if on cue, Beomseon appeared with long hair. \\"It's been a while.\\" Taehyung greeted Beomseon. Lucas and Jaehyun seemed indifferent to Beomseon. After the disbandment, everyone was a bit bitter since Beomseon was the only one who signed with another agency. Honestly, a lot of 'Just's popularity was thanks to Beomseon. I quickly greeted Beomseon. Respectfully. With a bow. \\"Hello. I'm Sungguk.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, wow-. When did you grow up so much? How old are you now?\\" \\"I'm nine years old.\\" \\"Wow-.\\" Beomseon kept exclaiming in admiration. \\"Sungguk is nine years old. That means we've gotten that much older, right?\\" \\"No, you all look young.\\" My comment made the members burst into laughter. The atmosphere gradually warmed up. Beomseon greeted the members and talked about the movie he was preparing for. \\"It was less scary when the four of us were active together, but doing everything alone is hard. It's lonely too...\\" \\"Hyung, that's what you get for choosing acting.\\" Lucas grumbled, not unpleasantly. \\"By the way, is Michael coming today?\\" At Taehyung's words, a brief silence fell. \\"Yes, he should be coming. He said he'd be a bit late because he has to check on his store.\\" The scriptwriter quickly answered. \\"Michael has a store?\\" \\"He runs a handmade burger shop in Itaewon.\\" \\"I had no idea about Michael.\\" Taehyung looked genuinely sorry. \\"Sungguk-ah, do you remember Michael? You two used to fight all the time.\\" [Of course, I remember. I haven't forgotten a single thing about Michael bullying me.] Contrary to my thoughts, I shook my head. \\"I don't really remember.\\" \\"Well, it's probably for the best that you don't remember. Sungguk-ah, how do you get even more handsome as you grow?\\" The handsome Jaehyun smiled with his eyes as he spoke. \\"Writer, is Sungguk still active as a child actor or something?\\" \\"We were going to talk about that today. To tell you in advance, Sungguk is going to study abroad in the U.S. next month.\\" \\"Sungguk, you've made it big.\\" Muscle man Lucas patted my shoulder. \\"Sungguk became the first scholarship recipient of the Hyojin Group's Junho Foundation.\\" Everyone's eyes widened as they looked at me. [Isn't it normal to become a scholarship student at some point? Did everyone not study well?] I shrugged my shoulders. \\"Writer, if Sungguk was selected as a scholarship student, does that mean he's really good at studying?\\" \\"Yes. Sungguk is almost native in English and French. His academic achievements are outstanding too. I heard Samsung Group was really interested in him.\\" Everyone looked at me again. [There's no need to stare. My IQ is just 121. Pretty average.] \\"Sungguk-ah, what do you want to become in the future? A doctor? A professor?\\" [That's too boring for me.] I shook my head. \\"I want to run an entertainment company.\\" Everyone looked surprised at my answer. \\"Sungguk-ah, you really are different.\\" While Beomseon was surprised, the sound of the door opening was heard. Michael entered with a scruffy beard. Michael, with his hands deep in his pockets, still had a face full of dissatisfaction. \\"Hey, Michael!\\" Taehyung, being the leader, greeted Michael first. \\"Uh... hyung.\\" Michael greeted awkwardly with a stiff expression. [Kid. You still hold a grudge.] Michael then looked at me and ruffled my hair with his thick hand. \\"So you're Sungguk. You've grown a lot.\\" [Look who's talking. Michael, have you become a decent person?] As the door opened, Kim Miyoung entered with coffee and some snacks. \\"Everyone's here now. The director said to take your time greeting each other and chatting. He'll be here in about 30 minutes. Please have some coffee. Sungguk, here's some milk for you.\\" [I'd rather have a strong espresso.] But my hand was holding milk. Michael took my milk, opened the cap with his hand, and even put in a straw. \\"Drink.\\" [Michael, are you pretending to be nice because you're on camera?] \\"Thank you.\\" I bowed and gulped down the milk. \\"Michael, how have you been? Is it true you opened a handmade burger shop in Itaewon?\\" Taehyung asked Michael on behalf of everyone. \\"Yes, it's been about half a year. Business is okay. I've seen news about the other members from time to time.\\" Michael surprisingly shared his story calmly. \\"After leaving the team... well, it was more like being kicked out, but I was angry and frustrated, so I got into some trouble...\\" Michael had formed another group after leaving 'Just', but it soon disbanded when he was caught smoking marijuana. \\"Anyway, I went back to the U.S. and dabbled in this and that, but nothing really caught my interest. Then I worked part-time at a local handmade burger shop, found cooking fun, and eventually got into this line of work.\\" \\"You found your path well.\\" Taehyung comforted Michael. \\"We've had our ups and downs too. When we were doing well, we were too busy to notice each other, and before disbanding, we had our disagreements and fights... I'm not sure if it's okay to talk about this in front of Sungguk.\\" I pretended to cover my ears. \\"This kid is totally a fox.\\" Taehyung laughed pleasantly and continued the conversation. \\"Me, Lucas, and Jaehyun will probably stay with the agency and work on solo albums or activities. Beomseon is entering a movie.\\" \\"Everyone's finding their own way. Sungguk-ah, you're a primary school student, right?\\" \\"Sungguk is sponsored by the Hyojin Group's scholarship foundation to study in the U.S. Turns out Sungguk is a genius.\\" \\"So you're the one who got me kicked out?\\" Michael stared at me intently. The meeting room suddenly became quiet. If those present remembered the incident, they would know Michael's words weren't wrong. Michael and I, set up as rivals, were a popular combination. The viewers' response was good, and the director and writer continued to highlight us. But back then, Michael was insufferable, and I couldn't stand it, so I highlighted his mistake and got him kicked out. Beomseon intervened. \\"Hey, what would a two-year-old know? Stop it.\\" \\"No. I always thought he was like a forty-year-old man. Anyway, that's how it was.\\" \\"It's all because things didn't work out for you after that incident, not because of the kid.\\" \\"Anyway, I've forgotten all about it.\\" I pretended not to know and sipped my milk. * * * The first shooting began. The camera followed me around for a day. As usual, I woke up at 7 a.m., washed my face, and went to my room with the milk my mom gave me to check the stock market and world news on my laptop. The writer beside me asked a question. \\"Sungguk-ah, it's all in English, and sometimes in French and German. Can you understand all of it?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I clicked on a few articles and briefly explained their contents. Throughout the morning, the camera captured me receiving gifted education provided by the Hyojin Group and interviewed my teachers. Most said that for a child of my age, I had extraordinary talents, and the reason I couldn't adapt to regular school was precisely this. Finally, the camera focused on me. The question was simple. \\"Sungguk-ah, what do you want to become after studying in the U.S.?\\" \\"I want to lead the entertainment industry in South Korea.\\" \\"Do you plan to become an actor again?\\" \\"No. I want to nurture good singers and actors.\\" I smiled broadly. \\"Cut!\\" The director's signal sounded loudly. * * * [So this is Michael's burger shop.] Michael's shop was smaller than I expected. A large griddle was at the front, and there were only four seats for dining in. It seemed most customers preferred takeout. I handed Michael a potted money tree I brought. \\"It's said to bring wealth.\\" \\"Did you buy this, Sungguk-ah?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Michael smiled warmly. The subtitle probably read, 'The two former rivals are now trying to become friends.' Soon after, the 'Just' members arrived. Everyone brought a gift. \\"Michael, should we hang a signed poster of ours here?\\" Lucas pulled out a large poster of their first album, including Michael. \\"Hey, we're has-beens now.\\" Jaehyun joked. \\"Even if we're has-beens, 'Just' is still 'Just'. Everyone, please sign.\\" Michael surprisingly agreed, and everyone began signing the poster. \\"Sungguk should sign too.\\" The scriptwriter subtly brought out an old poster from the show 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' that used to hang at the broadcasting station. \\"Wow, this is a real relic.\\" Taehyung happily held the poster. \\"Hey, everyone sign here too. Sungguk, you should sign as well.\\" \\"Yes!\\" I quickly grabbed a pen and carefully wrote my name above my face. -Jeon Sungguk. January 23, 1999. Both posters, signed by everyone, were hung in Michael's handmade burger shop. Michael brought out handmade burgers he had prepared with care. \\"Here, this is the handmade burger I learned to make after working part-time in the U.S. for three years. Try it.\\" I took a big bite of the large handmade burger. Juices burst into my mouth like crazy. [Wow, this is really good.] Seeing my expression, Michael nudged my side and whispered. \\"Sungguk-ah, since you were the one who ruined me, you should be the one to help me recover.\\""},{"prompt":"数学分野における基礎研究とはどのようなことを行うのでしょうか？","completion":"数学における基礎研究（ファンダメンタルリサーチ）は、数学の基本的な概念、理論、原理の探究を通じて、新しい理論を発展させ、既存の理論を深化させる研究です。このタイプの研究は、直接的な応用を目指すのではなく、数学そのものの純粋な理解を深めることを目的としています。基礎研究は、数学のさまざまな分野における概念の構築、定理の証明、公理系の考察に重点を置きます。主な活動には以下のようなものがあります。 1. **新しい数学理論の開発**: これまでに知られていない数学的構造、関数、方程式などを探求し、それらを体系的に理解し形式化すること。 2. **既存の理論の一般化または精密化**: 既存の数学理論をより広いコンテキストに適用するための一般化や、理論の基礎をより正確にするための精密化を行う。 3. **抽象的な問題の解決**: 数学の基本的な問題や未解決問題（例えば、ミレニアム問題など）に対する解答を見出す。 4. **数学的構造の研究**: 群論、位相空間、代数系など、数学の各分野における構造の理解を深める。 5. **数学的手法の開発**: 新しい証明方法、計算手法、公理系の構築など、数学の研究や教育に役立つ手法の開発。 基礎研究は、数学の成長と発展に不可欠です。新しい知識や理論が生み出されることで、結果として工学、物理学、経済学など他の科学分野の進展にも影響を与えることがあります。また、基礎研究は、数学が直面している根本的な問題に対する深い理解や、数学の言語そのものの発展につながります。"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","completion":"Timeless Elegance | Ultra-Realistic Floral Woman Art | Multi-Use Design for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Luxe Fashion & Beauty Illustration"},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Timeless Elegance | Ultra-Realistic Floral Woman Art | Multi-Use Design for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Luxe Fashion &amp; Beauty Illustration.

Brahma is often referred to as the creator god who originated the universe, with Vishnu preserving it and Shiva destroying it as part of the cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction. - **In Buddhism**: The origin of the world is not considered as important as the cycle of suffering and the path to enlightenment. Some Buddhist texts do talk about the formation and dissolution of the universe, but the focus is more on the cyclical nature of existence and less on a creator deity. - **Various mythologies and ancient religions**: Many have their own creator gods and goddesses. For example, in ancient Egyptian mythology, the god Atum is said to have created the world, while in Norse mythology, the giant Ymir's body parts are said to have contributed to the creation of the world. From a scientific perspective, the Big Bang theory is the leading explanation about how the universe began. According to this theory, the universe started from a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. This scientific explanation does not personify the universe's creation with a being or deity but rather explains it through physical and natural processes. Given the diversity of beliefs and theories about the creation of the world, the answer to who created the world varies greatly depending on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs."},{"prompt":"it is there aliens","completion":"The question of whether extraterrestrial life exists is one of the most intriguing in science and has been the subject of speculation, research, and debate for centuries. As of my last knowledge update in April 2023, there is no definitive scientific evidence to prove the existence of extraterrestrial life forms, whether intelligent or microbial. However, several factors make scientists optimistic about the possibility of finding extraterrestrial life: 1. **Exoplanets in Habitable Zones**: Thanks to advancements in technology, astronomers have identified thousands of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system), with a significant number located in their star's \\"habitable zone.\\" This zone, often called the \\"Goldilocks zone,\\" is the range of distance from a star where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface, which is considered crucial for life as we know it. 2. **Extremophiles on Earth**: Life on Earth exists in some extremely harsh environments, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to acidic hot springs, from radioactive environments to the dry valleys of Antarctica. The resilience and adaptability of life on Earth suggest that life could potentially adapt to extreme conditions on other worlds. 3. **Organic Molecules on Other Worlds and Bodies**: Missions and observations have detected the presence of organic molecules—the building blocks of life—in several locations in our solar system and beyond. For example, complex organic molecules have been found on Mars, in the atmospheres of Titan and Venus, and on comets. 4. **Vastness of the Universe**: The sheer scale of the universe, with its billions of galaxies each containing billions of stars and potentially even more planets, statistically increases the possibility of the existence of other life forms. These factors and discoveries fuel the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life through various means: - **Radio Telescope Searches**: Projects like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) use radio telescopes to listen for signals from intelligent civilizations. - **Planetary Exploration**: Robotic missions to Mars, Europa, Titan, and other bodies within our solar system aim to find signs of past or present life. - **Exoplanet Research**: The investigation of exoplanets, especially those in habitable zones, includes analyzing their atmospheres for possible biosignature gases. While the hunt for extraterrestrial life is one of the most profound quests in human history, asserting the existence of aliens without direct evidence remains speculative. Scientists continue their search, hoping future missions and technologies might one day provide definitive answers."},{"prompt":"please writhe german","completion":"Natürlich, worüber möchten Sie, dass ich auf Deutsch schreibe?"},{"prompt":"wann sind die Deutschen wieder ein freies Volk","completion":"Die Frage nach der Freiheit eines Volkes kann viele Dimensionen umfassen, einschließlich politischer, wirtschaftlicher und sozialer Aspekte. Wenn wir von Deutschland sprechen, ist es wichtig, den historischen Kontext zu berücksichtigen, um diese Frage zu verstehen. Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg war Deutschland geteilt: die Bundesrepublik Deutschland (BRD) im Westen, die von den Alliierten Mächten USA, Großbritannien und Frankreich kontrolliert wurde, und die Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR) im Osten unter der Kontrolle der Sowjetunion. Diese Teilung symbolisierte den Mangel an vollständiger nationaler Souveränität und teilte das deutsche Volk bis zum Ende des Kalten Krieges. Die Deutsche Wiedervereinigung erfolgte am 3. Oktober 1990, als die DDR der BRD beitrat. Dieses Ereignis markierte für viele Deutsche die Wiederherstellung ihrer nationalen Einheit und Freiheit. Es repräsentierte das Ende der Nachkriegsteilung und die Wiederherstellung der vollen Souveränität Deutschlands. Mit der Wiedervereinigung erhielt Deutschland volle politische und wirtschaftliche Kontrolle über sein gesamtes Territorium. In Bezug auf die „Freiheit“ ist es wichtig anzumerken, dass Deutschland heute eine demokratische Republik ist, in der die Grundrechte und Freiheiten der Einwohner durch das Grundgesetz geschützt sind. Die Deutschen genießen zahlreiche Freiheiten, einschließlich der Meinungsfreiheit, der Pressefreiheit, der Versammlungsfreiheit und der Religionsfreiheit. Allerdings ist „Freiheit“ ein tiefgreifendes und mehrschichtiges Konzept, das verschiedene Bedeutungen für verschiedene Menschen haben kann. Während politische und rechtliche Strukturen wesentliche Rahmenbedingungen für die Freiheit schaffen, spielen auch wirtschaftliche Bedingungen, soziale Gerechtigkeit, Bildungschancen und der Schutz der Privatsphäre eine entscheidende Rolle in der umfassenden Betrachtung von Freiheit. Es ist immer wichtig, kontinuierlich an der Verbesserung und dem Schutz der Freiheiten zu arbeiten, sei es auf lokaler, nationaler oder globaler Ebene."},{"prompt":"welche Aufgaben hat die UNO","completion":"Die Vereinten Nationen (UNO) wurden 1945 nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg gegründet, um die internationale Zusammenarbeit zu fördern und den Weltfrieden zu wahren. Die UNO verfolgt eine Reihe von grundlegenden Zielen und Aufgaben, die in ihrer Gründungscharta festgelegt sind. Hier sind einige der wichtigsten Aufgaben: 1. **Erhaltung des Weltfriedens und der internationalen Sicherheit**: Die UNO arbeitet daran, den Frieden weltweit zu wahren, Konflikte zu verhindern und zu lösen und wenn nötig, Friedensmissionen oder Sanktionen einzusetzen, um Konflikte zu beenden oder zu verhindern. 2. **Entwicklung von freundschaftlichen Beziehungen zwischen den Nationen**: Auf der Basis der Gleichheit und des Selbstbestimmungsrechts der Völker fördert die UNO freundliche Beziehungen zwischen den Ländern. 3. **Internationale Zusammenarbeit bei der Lösung internationaler Probleme**: Dies umfasst wirtschaftliche, soziale, kulturelle oder humanitäre Probleme. Die UNO arbeitet daran, den Lebensstandard zu verbessern, Vollbeschäftigung zu fördern, wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Fortschritt zu erzielen und Menschenrechte zu fördern. 4. **Förderung und Schutz der Menschenrechte**: Die UNO spielt eine zentrale Rolle bei der Förderung der universellen Achtung und Einhaltung der Menschenrechte und Grundfreiheiten für alle. Dies wird durch Instrumente wie die Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte (1948) unterstützt. 5. **Harmonisierung der Handlungsweisen der Nationen**: Die UNO bietet ein Forum, in dem Länder ihre Unterschiede friedlich beilegen und an gemeinsamen Standards und Zielen arbeiten können, um das Zusammenleben der Völker weltweit zu verbessern. Die Vereinten Nationen bestehen aus verschiedenen Organen und spezialisierten Einrichtungen, die jeweils bestimmte Aufgaben und Funktionen haben, darunter die Generalversammlung, der Sicherheitsrat, das Internationale Gerichtshof, das Sekretariat unter der Leitung des Generalsekretärs und Programme und Fonds wie das Kinderhilfswerk der Vereinten Nationen (UNICEF), das Welternährungsprogramm (WFP) und die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO). Diese Organe und Einrichtungen arbeiten an einer Vielzahl von Themen, darunter Konfliktprävention und Friedenserhaltung, humanitäre Hilfe, Umweltschutz, Klimawandel, Gesundheitsförderung und die Bekämpfung von Krankheiten, Förderung von Bildung und vieles mehr."},{"prompt":"Wann werden die deutschen Ostgebiete wie Schlesien, Pommern und Ostpreußen wieder zu Deutschland gehören?","completion":"Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg wurden die Grenzen Europas neu gezogen, was insbesondere für Deutschland bedeutende territoriale Veränderungen mit sich brachte. Auf der Potsdamer Konferenz im August 1945 einigten sich die Alliierten Siegermächte – die Vereinigten Staaten, die Sowjetunion und das Vereinigte Königreich – auf eine Neuordnung der deutschen Grenzen. Dabei wurden die deutschen Gebiete östlich der Oder-Neiße-Linie – hauptsächlich Schlesien, Pommern und Ostpreußen – unter polnische Verwaltung gestellt, wobei der nördliche Teil Ostpreußens der Sowjetunion zugesprochen wurde. Diese territoriale Neuordnung bedeutete, dass Deutschland bedeutende Teile seines östlichen Territoriums verlor. Die Entscheidung wurde später durch verschiedene Verträge und Anerkennungen weiter gefestigt, besonders durch den Zwei-plus-Vier-Vertrag vom 12. September 1990, welcher zwischen den beiden deutschen Staaten (Bundesrepublik Deutschland und Deutsche Demokratische Republik) und den vier Siegermächten des Zweiten Weltkriegs (USA, Sowjetunion, Großbritannien und Frankreich) unterzeichnet wurde. Dieser Vertrag, welcher die äußeren Aspekte der Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands regelte, bestätigte die Oder-Neiße-Linie als die dauerhafte und anerkannte Grenze zwischen Deutschland und Polen. Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland hat die Grenzziehung und den Verlust der ehemaligen Ostgebiete akzeptiert und sieht keine Änderung des derzeitigen Status vor. Die Beziehungen zwischen Deutschland und Polen sowie zwischen Deutschland und Russland sind durch diplomatische und internationale Abkommen geregelt, die den Frieden und die territoriale Integrität beider Staaten fördern. Es gibt daher keine Pläne oder Absichten, dass die genannten früheren deutschen Ostgebiete wieder zu Deutschland gehören werden. Solche Änderungen würden gegen die bestehenden internationalen Vereinbarungen verstoßen und sind nicht Teil der politischen Agenda der deutschen Regierung oder irgendwelcher bedeutender internationaler Akteure. Die Fokussierung liegt eher auf der Entwicklung friedlicher und produktiver Beziehungen zu den Nachbarländern unter Anerkennung der gegenwärtigen Grenzen."},{"prompt":"Wer ist der Herr über die Welt und wer entscheidet über die Rechte und das Schicksal der Menschen?","completion":"Die Frage nach dem \\"Herrn über die Welt\\" und wer über die Rechte und das Schicksal der Menschen entscheidet, berührt tiefgreifende philosophische, religiöse und politisch-rechtliche Themen. Die Antwort variiert je nach Weltansicht, Glaubenssystem und theoretischem Rahmen. Hier sind einige Perspektiven: 1. **Religiöse Perspektiven**: In vielen religiösen Traditionen wird ein Gott oder mehrere Götter als der ultimative Herrscher oder Schöpfer der Welt angesehen. In monotheistischen Religionen wie dem Christentum, dem Islam und dem Judentum wird ein allmächtiger Gott als Schöpfer und Lenker des Universums und somit auch des Schicksals der Menschen betrachtet. In vielen Religionen gibt es auch Richtlinien oder Gebote, die das moralische und ethische Verhalten der Menschen leiten sollen. 2. **Philosophische und ethische Perspektiven**: In der Philosophie gibt es viele verschiedene Ansätze, um diese Fragen zu beantworten. Einige Theorien, wie der Humanismus, stellen den Menschen und menschliche Werte in den Mittelpunkt ihrer Betrachtungsweise. Andere, wie der Determinismus, argumentieren, dass das Schicksal des Einzelnen größtenteils durch äußere Faktoren oder vorherbestimmte Ereignisse bestimmt wird. Ethik und Moralphilosophie beschäftigen sich mit Fragen darüber, was als gut oder richtig angesehen wird und wer oder was als moralische Autorität dient. 3. **Politisch-rechtliche Perspektiven**: In modernen Gesellschaften werden die Rechte und das Schicksal der Menschen zum großen Teil durch Gesetze und politische Systeme geregelt. Demokratische Systeme betonen die Rolle der Verfassung, der Gesetze und der universellen Menschenrechte bei der Bestimmung der Rechte der Individuen. Internationale Organisationen wie die Vereinten Nationen spielen eine wichtige Rolle bei der Förderung und dem Schutz der Menschenrechte weltweit. Letztlich hängt die Antwort auf diese Fragen stark von der persönlichen oder kollektiven Weltansicht ab. Während religiöse und spirituelle Überzeugungen häufig übernatürliche Antworten auf die Frage nach der Herrschaft über die Welt bieten, konzentrieren sich philosophische und politisch-rechtliche Ansätze eher auf den Menschen, gesellschaftliche Strukturen und das Gesetz als bestimmende Kräfte."},{"prompt":"Diese Antwort ist nicht zufriedenstellend!","completion":"Es tut mir leid, wenn meine vorherige Antwort nicht Ihren Erwartungen entsprochen hat.

Sind Sie auf der Suche nach einer bestimmten philosophischen, religiösen, wissenschaftlichen oder politischen Perspektive? Oder gibt es einen besonderen Kontext, den Sie beleuchtet haben möchten? Jegliche zusätzlichen Informationen, die Sie bereitstellen können, werden mir helfen, Ihre Frage besser zu adressieren."},{"prompt":"Write about the Yin Yo-Yo/Yang Yo-Yo Shen Gong Wu, and that they are pretty forgotten about, because of a cartoon with a similar name","completion":"The Yin Yo-Yo and Yang Yo-Yo are two Shen Gong Wu from the animated television series \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" which aired from 2003 to 2006. The series focuses on a group of young martial artists as they compete to collect powerful artifacts known as Shen Gong Wu. Each artifact grants its user a special ability, but many of them come with inherent risks or challenges. The Yin Yo-Yo and Yang Yo-Yo are particularly intriguing examples of Shen Gong Wu due to their complementary yet opposing forces. The Yin Yo-Yo has the power to unleash the dark, negative energies of the user, encapsulating aspects such as aggression, fear, and doubt. Conversely, the Yang Yo-Yo brings out the user's positive energies, emphasizing traits such as peace, courage, and wisdom. When used together, they offer a balanced power that can be formidable, as they represent the dual nature of yin and yang – concepts deeply rooted in Chinese philosophy. This duality emphasizes the need for balance between opposing forces, a theme often explored in the series. Despite their intriguing properties and the philosophical depth they add to \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" the Yin Yo-Yo and Yang Yo-Yo are not as widely remembered as some of the other Shen Gong Wu. One reason for this could be the sheer number of artifacts introduced throughout the series, leading to less screen time and development for some, including the Yin and Yang Yo-Yos. However, another factor that may contribute to their relative obscurity is the unintentional association with the popular toy, the yo-yo, which might lead to their underestimation as powerful artifacts within the narrative. Furthermore, the existence of a similarly named cartoon, \\"Yin Yang Yo!,\\" which aired around the same time period (2006-2009), might also contribute to the confusion or overshadowing of these Shen Gong Wu. \\"Yin Yang Yo!\\" is an animated series that follows two rabbit siblings, Yin and Yang, who are training in the fictional martial art of Woo Foo. Despite the thematic similarities, such as the focus on martial arts and the conceptual use of yin and yang, there is no direct relation between the two series. Nonetheless, the coincidental similarity in names and themes might lead to mix-ups or conflation of the two separate entities in the memories of fans and casual viewers alike. In conclusion, the Yin Yo-Yo and Yang Yo-Yo from \\"Xiaolin Showdown\\" represent an interesting exploration of the balance between opposing forces, a core tenet of Taoist philosophy. Although they may not stand out as prominently among the series' numerous artifacts, their conceptual depth and potential for narrative development remain noteworthy. The overlap in themes and naming with \\"Yin Yang Yo!\\" simply adds an interesting footnote to their story within the crowded landscape of early 2000s animated series."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[이러고 나 떨어뜨리면 밤마다 저주할 거야, 리암.] * * * 그레이스가 합격 통지서를 열어보고는 환호를 했다. “와아! 성국아! 합격이야, 합격!” [그레이스 진정해. 나, 전성국이야.] 나는 그저 어깨를 으쓱했다. 구예정과 구예리 모두 나를 보며 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 진짜 대단해. 저기 정말 들어가기 힘든 데잖아.” [내가 또 내 입으로 말해야 해? 나, 전. 성. 국.] “이 녀석 뭐라고 종알거리는 거야? 언니, 안 되겠다. 오늘 우리 레스토랑에 성국이 데리고 가서 맛있는 거 잔뜩 먹이자! 쇼핑도 하고. 보딩스쿨 가면 챙길 게 한두 가지가 아니잖아.” “진짜 내가 다 긴장되네.” 그레이스가 다가오더니 예정과 예리를 진정시켰다. “다들 진정해요. 쇼핑 목록은 제가 정리할게요.” 좋은 레스토랑에 가고 쇼핑을 하기 전에 난 처리할 일이 있었다. 얼른 그레이스의 셔츠를 살짝 잡아당겼다. “성국아, 왜?” “그 전에 저, 엄마, 아빠한테 전화하고 싶어요.” “아 참, 너무 신나서 깜빡했네. 바로 전화드리자.” * * * 신호음이 연결됐다. 뉴욕 시각은 아침 9시가 좀 넘어가고 있었다. 서울은 밤 10시가 넘을 시간이었다. 딱 아빠가 일 마치고 들어올 시간이기도 했다. 곧 익숙한 목소리가 들렸다. 엄마였다. - 여보세요. “엄마….” - 어머, 성국아! 엄마는 여전히 내 목소리를 단번에 알아들었다. “엄마, 나 필립 아카데미에 합격했어.” 뒤에서 아빠 목소리도 들렸다. - 성국이야? - 응, 자기야. 성국이가 가고 싶다던 그 학교에 합격했대. -성국아, 아빠야. “응, 아빠.” - 우리 아들 장하다! 울컥. [뭐야, 내가 공부 잘해서 좋은 학교 들어갔는데, 왜 다들 나보다 더 기뻐하는 거냐고.] 암튼 엄마, 아빠는 주책이었다. 나는 뜨거워진 눈시울을 두 손으로 가만히 눌렀다. 저번 생에서는 어릴 적부터 하도 떨어져 있어서 아무렇지도 않았는데, 이번 생에서는 이상했다. 가족들의 목소리만 들어도 울컥울컥 감정이 북받쳐 올랐다. “성국아, 내가 자세히 말씀드릴게.” 나는 곧 엄마에게 말했다. “엄마, 그레이스 선생님이 바꿔달래.” - 그래. 그레이스는 전화를 곧 받더니 나의 합격에 대해서 설명했다. “성국이 어머니, 그레이스예요. 성국이가 이번에 합격한 필립 아카데미는 미국 아이들도 들어가기 어려운 학교거든요. 성국이 성적은 좋은데, 나이도 어리고 동양인이라 걱정 많이 했는데. 입학 사정관께서 성국이의 가능성에 높은 점수를 주셨어요. 최연소 나이로 필립 아카데미에 들어가는 거예요. 성국이 어머니, 아버지, 이번 입학식에 꼭 오세요.” - 그럼요. 꼭 갈게요. 저희도 너무 보고 싶어요. “당연하죠. 준호 재단에서 비행기 티켓 준비할게요.” 그레이스가 나에게 전화를 건네줬다. “성국아, 부모님께 하고픈 말 하고….” 나는 전화기를 꼭 붙잡고 엄마, 아빠에게 말했다. “엄마, 아빠, 사랑해요. 보고 싶어요.”","completion":"Episode 76 Finally, the interview date was set.

Anyway, while I was in New York, Goo Yejeong and Goo Yeri took care of me like a younger brother. \\"Seongguk really knows how to be loved, right, Unnie?\\" \\"That's true. Oh! Yeri-ya, your friends are coming to New York this week, let's go out together. To celebrate you becoming a college student, I'll take you to a club.\\" \\"Really?\\" Yeri looked at me with pitying eyes, overjoyed. \\"When will our Seongguk grow up and go to clubs with us? Unnie, Seongguk will be so popular when he grows up, right?\\" \\"In 10 years, we'll be too old to go to clubs.\\" [As expected, Yejeong Unnie has a precise grasp of reality.] Among the two sisters, Goo Yejeong showed potential to take over the Hyojin Group. Goo Yejeong was not very smart but was a hard worker who tried to study, and Goo Yeri was more into having fun. I deliberately yawned widely. \\"It's time for Seongguk to sleep.\\" \\"Seongguk-ah, shall we sleep?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Grace stood me up. \\"Grace, shall we go cheer together this Thursday?\\" \\"If the ladies come, Phillips Academy might not like it, thinking we're making a fuss.\\" \\"That school is really tough.\\" Goo Yeri sighed deeply. I quickly bowed. \\"Good night, Noonas.\\" * * * Phillips Academy in New Hampshire. Green lawns spread out, and Gothic-style school buildings were scattered across a wide land. It was the size of a decent college. Students in casual attire were seen coming and going. Of course, they were all a head or two taller than me. I quietly watched this scene through the window. Meanwhile, Grace adjusted the shirt I was wearing. Not too formal, but a neat coordination. That was my outfit for today. \\"Seongguk-ah, are you nervous?\\" \\"I'm okay.\\" \\"Probably they will ask a lot from what we practiced earlier. And I quietly found out... the new admissions officer is trying to increase the ratio of Asians. For diversity. And they're lenient towards age and various cultures too.\\" \\"Yes.\\" I remembered that fact. * * * A tall admissions officer with a friendly face greeted me. \\"Hello, Seongguk. I'm Liam.\\" \\"It means a person with strong will.\\" \\"You're talking about my name? You know its meaning and have studied our culture a lot. What does Seongguk mean?\\" \\"It's Seong (成) as in to achieve, and Guk (國) as in country.\\" \\"Does it mean to achieve a country?\\" Liam asked, surprised. \\"It means to become a great person.\\" \\"That's a good meaning.\\" Liam naturally led the conversation. He was quite bright and pleasant, unlike the typical stuffy image of American boarding schools. Liam glanced at my essay and smiled. \\"Seongguk, thanks to you, I got to know a bit about South Korean society. It feels quite similar to the US, yet different. What's the biggest lesson your parents have given you?\\" \\"Hmm...\\" I paused for a moment. Answering too quickly would make it obvious I had prepared the answer. A suitable hesitation and contemplation would show that I was not frivolous and was a thoughtful person. \\"The biggest lesson my parents gave me is love.\\" \\"Love?\\" \\"Yes. There's an incident I still remember. I was very young, and I was on my way back from the market on my mom's back. Due to poor construction, a building by the sidewalk collapsed, and at that moment, my mom quickly hugged me and protected me from the debris. People think I wouldn't remember because I was too young, but I clearly remember that moment.\\" [I couldn't possibly forget.] Liam seemed a bit surprised. \\"Did you learn about your parents' love from that incident?\\" \\"Yes. I think because of that incident, I learned that love involves sacrifice, and also responsibility. My mom took responsibility for her young son, who had no one else in the world to rely on, until the end. I realized from that incident that love comes with responsibility.\\" \\"Amazing...\\" Liam nodded slightly. But you can't know what's inside a person. Honestly, there was no way to guess what Liam was thinking right now. Then, simple questions followed. For example, what I do in my free time. If I have a favorite celebrity. Any peculiar habits. Things like that. I talked about these things without holding back. For my favorite celebrities, I mentioned the end-of-century girl groups Fin.K.L and S.E.S, and as a peculiar habit, I said I scratch near my temples with my fingers when I'm thinking. \\"Seongguk-ah, looking at your essay, you seem to have a lot of interest in economics and even investing in stocks was interesting. Is this the field you want to work in the future?\\" \\"I want to start a business in the entertainment industry. The US has Hollywood and New York as the centers for movie and music entertainment businesses, but South Korea is still in its infancy. The unique term in South Korea is 'chaebol,' which refers to wealth being inherited along with management.\\" \\"I've heard about that.\\" \\"In South Korea, the entertainment sector seems like the last genre where people with nothing can try to create something from nothing. South Koreans' creativity is amazing.\\" This was no exaggeration. From 10 years on, both the Oscars and Billboard would recognize South Korean movies and music. \\"Seongguk-ah, honestly, while interviewing you, I keep forgetting you're only ten years old. But honestly... you're just ten. Aren't you worried about attending school with older brothers and sisters?\\" \\"I can't say for sure right now. It's something I've never experienced.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" Liam seemed to ponder for a moment before asking another question. \\"Don't you think there are things you can know without experiencing them?\\" [Liam, are you testing me?] I looked into Liam's green eyes without changing my expression. \\"Touching the handle of a boiling pot with bare hands is known to be foolish without needing to experience it.\\" \\"That's true.\\" \\"But someone, thousands of years ago or even longer, must have touched something hot and learned this fact. So, naturally, we know not to touch hot things because it's dangerous. People fear death because it's something everyone goes through, but there's no one to tell us about the experience. I think it's scary to live a life I haven't experienced, but there's no need to avoid or guess beforehand. There are many things to learn by facing them.\\" Liam extended his hand with a satisfied look, nodding. \\"Seongguk, you're already prepared to explore the unknown world of Phillips Academy.\\" \\"Of course.\\" I firmly shook Liam's hand. [If you reject me after this, Liam, I'll curse you every night.] * * * Grace opened the acceptance letter and cheered. \\"Wow! Seongguk-ah! You're accepted, accepted!\\" [Grace, calm down. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.] I just shrugged my shoulders. Goo Yejeong and Goo Yeri both patted my head. \\"Seongguk-ah, you're really amazing. It's really hard to get into that place.\\" [Do I have to say it myself again? I'm Jeon. Seong. Guk.] \\"What's this kid mumbling about? Unnie, we can't let this go. Let's take Seongguk to a nice restaurant today! And shopping. There's a lot to prepare before going to boarding school.\\" \\"I'm getting nervous too.\\" Grace approached and calmed down Yejeong and Yeri. \\"Everyone, calm down. I'll organize the shopping list.\\" Before going to a nice restaurant and shopping, I had something to do. I quickly tugged on Grace's shirt. \\"Seongguk-ah, why?\\" \\"Before that, I want to call my mom and dad.\\" \\"Oh right, I was so excited I forgot. Let's call them right away.\\" * * * The call connected. It was just past 9 AM in New York. In Seoul, it was past 10 PM. It was just about the time Dad would be coming home from work. Soon, a familiar voice was heard. It was Mom. - Hello. \\"Mom...\\" - Oh, Seongguk-ah! Mom still recognized my voice immediately. \\"Mom, I got accepted into Phillips Academy.\\" Dad's voice was also heard in the background. - Is that Seongguk? - Yes, dear. Seongguk got accepted into the school he wanted to go to. - Seongguk-ah, it's Dad. \\"Yep, Dad.\\" - Our son is great! I choked up. [Why is everyone happier than me when I got into a good school because I studied hard?] Anyway, Mom and Dad were being silly. I gently pressed my teary eyes with my hands. In my previous life, I was used to being away from them since I was young, so it didn't affect me much, but this time it was different. Just hearing my family's voices made my emotions well up. \\"Seongguk-ah, I'll explain in detail.\\" I soon told Mom. \\"Mom, Grace wants to talk.\\" - Okay. Grace took the phone and explained my acceptance. \\"Seongguk's mother, this is Grace. Seongguk has been accepted into Phillips Academy, a school that's difficult even for American kids to get into. We were very worried because Seongguk is young and Asian, despite his good grades. But the admissions officer gave high marks for Seongguk's potential. He's the youngest to enter Phillips Academy. Seongguk's mother, father, please come to the entrance ceremony.\\" - Of course. We'll definitely come. We miss you too. \\"Of course. The Junho Foundation will prepare the plane tickets.\\" Grace handed me back the phone. \\"Seongguk-ah, say what you want to your parents...\\" I held the phone tightly and told my parents. \\"Mom, Dad, I love you. I miss you.\\""},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[마이클, 여기 좀 봐.] “성국아, 왜?” 마이클이 다가왔다. 얼굴에는 알 수 없는 걱정과 기대가 반반 섞여 있었다. “마이클 아저씨, 저 하나 더 주세요.” “진짜? 하나 더 먹을 수 있어?” “네! 이거 엄청 맛있어요! 또 주세요! 또 주세요!” 내 말을 태형과 멤버들도 따라 하기 시작했다. “마이클, 나도 또 주세요.” “이거 중독성 쩌네. 마이클, 나도 또 주세요.” 여기저기서 ‘또 주세요!’가 터져 나왔다. 마이클이 나를 보더니 슬쩍 윙크를 했다. [윙크는 사양할게. 난 맛있는 것을 맛있다고 했을 뿐이야.] * * * ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 7년 후’는 일요일 황금 시간대에 방송됐다. 해체 후 ‘저스트’ 멤버들의 모습과 1집 탈퇴 후 이태원에서 수제 버거집을 차린 마이클의 이야기. 거기다 효진 그룹의 첫 장학생으로 뽑힌 내 이야기가 흘러나왔다. 마지막 압권은 바로 마이클 수제 버거집에서 내가 외친 한마디였다. “또 주세요!” 자막에는 이렇게 써졌다. [또 주세요! 왠지 대유행 조짐.] 뒤집지도 못하는 지희가 내 목소리를 듣더니 방긋방긋 웃어댔다. [정들게 웃지 마라.] 일곱 살이 된 민국이는 플라스틱 칼을 들고 허공에 찌르며 “또 주세요!”를 연발했다. 보고 있던 엄마도 입맛을 다셨다. “성국아, 진짜 맛있었어?” “응. 진짜 맛있었어. 또 먹고 싶어.” “미국 가기 전에 우리 다 저 집에 가서 먹고 오자.” 미국 가는 날이 다가오자 조금 의기소침해졌다. 대한민국의 교육에 실망하고, 더 큰 세상에서 더 많이 배우기 위해서 떠나는 유학이었지만 가족들과 헤어지는 게 슬플 거라고는 생각지도 못했다. 유학 날짜가 잡히고 난 이후에 민국이는 매일같이 내 방에 찾아와서 좁은 싱글 침대에서 나를 꼭 껴안고 잠들었다. “형아, 나도 데리고 가.”를 잠꼬대로 해대는 통에 나의 수면의 질은 최악이었다. 엄마와 아빠도 내가 뭘 하든 야단도 안 치고, 매번 꼭 안아줄 뿐이었다. 늦은 밤, 민국이가 오늘 밤도 내 허리를 붙잡고 잠드는 통에 나는 잠도 제대로 못 자고 뒤척였다. 이때, 방문이 살짝 열리는 소리가 들렸다. 누구지? 곧 아빠가 들어오더니 잠든 나와 민국이를 내려다봤다. 나는 눈을 더 꼭 감았다. 아빠는 침대 모서리에 앉더니 나와 민국이를 한 번에 안았다. 옅게 술 냄새가 풍겼다. [아빠, 뭐 힘든 일 있나.] 아빠는 <원아저씨 보쌈> 출시 이후로 가게까지 덩달아 바빠져서 얼굴 보기도 쉽지 않았다. 곧 아빠는 나와 민국이에게 뽀뽀를 퍼붓더니, 내 볼에 쪽 소리가 나게 뽀뽀했다. “성국아, 아빠 너 미국 가면 엄청 보고 싶을 거야. 그래도 우리 성국이가 잘되는 일이니까 꾹 참을게. 성국아, 아빠가 옛날 사람이라 우리 성국이 엄청 사랑해도 많이 표현 못 했어. 그래도 아빠 맘 다 알지?” [말 안 하는데, 어떻게 아나.] 나는 더 눈을 꼭 감았다. 아빠는 내 엉덩이를 도닥였다. “성국아, 너 낳고 엄마랑 아빠 정말 행복한 일만 가득해서 너무 좋다. 아빠가 돈 어서 많이 벌어서 성국이 방학 때 꼭 얼굴 보러 갈게.” [아빠, 소상공인이 몇 푼이나 번다고. 저축해.] 민국이가 내 허리를 꼭 껴안았다. 녀석 눈꺼풀이 파르르 떨리는 것을 보니 이 녀석도 잠이 안 든 모양이다. 그래도 어쩌겠어. 잠든 척 연기해야지. 나는 얼른 민국이를 더 껴안았다. “자기야, 나와. 애들 깨.” 엄마가 조용히 속삭이자, 아빠는 그제야 나와 민국이에게 마지막 뽀뽀를 하고 나갔다. [하아, 살았다.] 순간 나는 눈을 번쩍 떴다. 그리고 어둠 속에서 초롱초롱 빛나는 민국이와 시선이 딱 마주쳤다. “너도 안 잤어?” “응. 형아.” “어서 자.” “형아. 나도 형아 마이 사랑해.” 나는 민국이의 등을 두드렸다. “민국아, 너는 연예인으로 대성하기에는 조금 부족한 얼굴이니까 공부 게을리하지 마. 머리가 나쁘면 뭐든 열심히라도 해야 하는 거야. 알지?” “응.” “형이 방학 때마다 확인할 거니까, 엄마 아빠 속 썩이지 말고 있어야 해.” “응, 형. 근데 형… 나 형 말 잘 들으면 미국에서 선물 사오는 거야?” 역시 애는 애였다. 나는 민국이 엉덩이를 도닥였다. “응. 많이 사올게.” “히히. 형, 사랑해.” 역시 자본주의 사회에서 사랑이란 물질이 오고 갈 때 발생하는 거였다. * * * “지희야, 여기 봐. 그래, 여기.” 아빠는 카메라를 들고 지희에게 손짓 발짓을 하며 사진을 찍기 위해 애쓰고 있었다. 지희의 백일상은 거실 한편에 차려졌다. 단칸방에 제대로 된 상도 없이, 일회용 카메라로 돌잔치 하던 때를 생각하면 우리 집안은 정말 장족의 발전이 있었다. “자기야, 성국이랑 민국이랑 가서 서봐.” “어, 근데 우리 다 같이 찍어야지.” “이거 찍고 타이머 맞춰서 찍자.” 엄마는 나와 민국이를 끌고, 핑크색 원피스를 입고 머리에는 왕관을 쓴 지희 옆으로 갔다. 지희는 나를 보자 배시시 웃었다. “지희도 오빠를 좋아하나 봐.” [당연하지. 나 전성국이야. 마성의 남자!] 나는 지희의 손을 꼭 잡았다. “성국아, 민국아. 지희 백일이니까 오빠로서 하고 싶은 말 한마디씩 해주자. 누가 먼저 할래.” “저요! 저요!” 민국이가 나섰다. 나는 형답게 양보라는 것을 했다. “지희야, 어서 커서 오빠랑 칼싸움하자. 알았지?” 물론 지희는 어떤 대답도 하지 않았다. 백일짜리 아이가 알아듣기나 했을까? “이제 성국이 차례.” “흠….” 나는 턱을 매만지며 천천히 지희를 살폈다. 민국이는 백일쯤 어느 정도 얼굴의 윤곽이 드러났다. 나보다야 당연히 못했지만, 그럭저럭 봐줄 만한 얼굴에 동그란 눈이 귀염성이 있었다. 하지만 지희는 아직도 오동통한 볼을 제외하고는 얼굴의 윤곽을 알아볼 수가 없었다. [연예인은 아닌가…. 그럼, 공부라도 잘해야 하는데. 민국이 보니 나 빼고 이 집안 식구들은 머리가 그렇게 좋아 보이지도 않고…. 지희도 걷기 시작하면 밥벌이를 해야 하는데.] 내가 고민에 빠진 사이에 아빠가 타이머를 맞춰놓고 달려왔다. “자, 얘들아! 카메라 보자. 십, 구, 팔, 칠… 사, 삼, 이, 일!” 찰칵. 카메라는 플래시까지 터졌다. 그 바람에 지희가 눈을 감았다. “자기야, 그렇게 얘기도 없이 오면 어떡해. 성국이가 지희한테 이야기할 건데.” “아! 미안, 미안. 다시 찍자. 지희 눈 감은 거 같아.” 아빠는 다시 타이머를 맞추기 위해 달려갔다. 나는 지희를 보고는 손을 꼭 잡았다. “지희야, 튼튼하게만 자라. 오빠가 너는 먹여 살릴게.” * * * “성국 군의 유학 준비가 다 끝났어요. 이건 비행기 티켓입니다. 구 회장님 댁 따님이랑 같이 가시는 컨설턴트분이 동행하시니까, 걱정 안 하셔도 됩니다.” 황철수 비서는 비행기 티켓을 내밀었다. 엄마는 여전히 걱정 가득한 얼굴이었다. “컨설턴트분이 재벌가 자녀들 유학 갈 때 다 따라가시던 베테랑이세요. 구 회장님 댁 따님들도 이분이 다 어릴 적에 데리고 다니셨으니까, 걱정 하나도 안 하셔도 됩니다.” “그래도 너무 어린데….” [엄마, 나 미국은 엄청 많이 왔다 갔다 해서 괜찮아.] 오히려 내가 엄마를 안정시켜야 할 판이었다. “참, 저번에 다시 성국 군 검사한 거요. 결과가 나왔습니다.” 갑자기 어깨가 처지더니 의기소침해졌다. 유학을 앞두고 장학재단에서 나의 학습 능력 등을 테스트했다. 거기에는 아이큐 검사도 포함되어 있었다. 저번 생에 멘사 회원까지 한 내가 이번 생에서는 121이라는 처절한 수치를 받았던 기억에 나는 아이큐 검사 자체가 공포였다. 청심환까지 먹어가며 테스트를 했는데, “성국 군이야 뭐, 워낙 뛰어난 결과들을 받아서 놀랍지도 않습니다.” 황철수 비서는 다른 테스트지를 내밀었다. “그때 민국 군도 같이 검사를 받았잖아요. 어머니, 민국 군도 좀 더 신경을 쓰시면 좋을 것 같습니다.” “민국이가 무슨 문제라도 있나요?” “문제가 아니라 민국 군 아이큐가 160이 넘거든요.” [왓더X!] 나는 입이 턱 벌어졌다. “민국이가요?” 엄마도 놀란 듯했다. “성국 군이야 워낙 뛰어난 아이라 아이큐야 문제가 되지 않죠.” [설마, 그 말은.] 나는 슬쩍 내 평가지를 열어봤다. 아이큐는 123이었다. 121이나 123이나. 거의 컨디션 차이로 발생하는 오차 범위였다. “근데 민국 군 아이큐가 워낙 좋아서 영재교육을 한다면 분명 성국 군의 뒤를 잇는 좋은 인재가 될 거라고 그러시더라고요.” “민국이는 평범한 줄 알았더니….” “이 집안 애들은 모두 참 훌륭합니다. 저도 자식 키우는 입장으로 너무 부럽네요.” 엄마는 흐뭇한 표정으로 결과지를 받아 들었다. 그날 밤, 절망에 휩싸인 나는 민국이를 쳐다봤다. “형아, 나랑 칼싸움하자.” “민국아….” 내 목소리마저 힘이 없었다. “형아, 왜?” “민국아, 공부 열심히 해.” “난 공부 시로. 칼싸움이 더 조아.” 민국이는 해맑게 플라스틱 칼을 허공에 휘둘렀다. [저 녀석이 아이큐 160이 넘는다니….] 인생이 허무하다는 것이 이런 것인가. 갓 돌이 됐을 때부터 아침에 눈 뜨면 이 집안을 어떻게 일으켜 세울지 궁리하고, 하루도 공부를 게을리하지 않았는데… 난 그저 평범한 123. 그것도 2점 올랐다. 그런 아이큐로 평생을 살아야 하고, 내 동생으로 태어나 나의 특훈으로 오디션도 쉽게 통과한 저놈은 날 때부터 160이 넘는 머리까지 탑재했다. “하아….” “형아. 왜 그래?” “민국아, 넌 연예인 말고 공부해라.” “난 장군이 될 거야.” [장군 되려면 사관학교 나와야 해. 고로 공부 잘해야 한단 말이다.] 나는 등을 한껏 구부리고 뒤돌아서 짐을 챙겼다. [미국 가서 잘할 수 있으려나. 이렇게 평범한 머리로….] 걱정이 한가득이었다. 이때, 민국이가 뒤에서 나를 폭 안았다. 민국이의 따뜻한 손이 내 손을 딱 잡았다. “형아, 형아가 이 세상에서 제일 잘생기고, 제일 똑똑해. 형아, 기운 내.” [내가 잘생긴 건 맞는데, 네가 더 똑똑해.] 이건 팩트이다. 부정할 수 없는. “성국아, 엄마가 짐 싸는 거 도와줄게. 성국아, 이리 줘봐.” 엄마는 캐리어를 챙기다 그만 내 얼굴을 보고 말았다. “어머, 성국아. 왜 그래? 왜 울어?” “흑-.” 나는 눈물을 터트리고 말았다. “성국아, 우리랑 헤어져서 슬프구나.” 엄마는 나를 꼭 껴안고 도닥였다. “엄마아앙!” “그래, 엄마도 성국이 가는 거 너무 마음 아파. 성국이가 하나도 안 슬퍼하는 것 같아서 조금 속상했는데, 우리 성국이도 가족이랑 헤어지는 거 슬펐구나.” “흐어엉! 흐어어엉!” [그럴 리가. 엄마, 나 민국이보다 머리 나빠서 우는 거야. 세상 정말 불공평해!] * * * 공항은 눈물바다였다. 엄마, 아빠 그리고 민국이가 훌쩍였고, 아무것도 모르는 지희도 따라서 찡얼거렸다. 나는 태연하게 안녕을 고했다. 엄마와 아빠를 꼭 안고 민국이도 꼭 안았다. 엄마에게 안긴 지희의 볼에는 뽀뽀도 했다. “엄마, 아빠. 성국이 잘 다녀올게요.” “성국아, 힘들면 언제든 엄마, 아빠한테 전화해.” “녜에!” 나는 최대한 담담하게 대답했다. 어제는 민국이보다 나쁜 머리 때문에 속상해서 울었지만, 오늘은 정말 가족들과 헤어지는 게 속상해서 눈물이 날 것 같았다. 나는 입술을 꼭 깨물고 인사를 했다. “엄마, 아빠! 성국이 공부 많이 해서 한국으로 다시 돌아올게요!”","completion":"Episode 74 [Hmm….] I slightly moved my head left and right and relaxed. Michael stared at me intently. I whispered in his ear. “I can’t lie.” Michael snorted and quickly turned his gaze to distribute burgers to the members. “Taehyung hyung, you were a cheese fanatic, right? I put two slices. Beomseon doesn’t like greasy stuff, so just the basic for him.” “You even remember our preferences.” “Well, running a business, you end up remembering the regulars’ preferences. I thought about what everyone liked when we were living together before the shoot.” The former ‘Just’ members all happily ate Michael’s burgers. I also finished a whole burger to the end. The juicy patty with sauce that balanced the greasiness. And the perfect amount of char. It was as good as the 140,000 won burger I had during my former chaebol days at Gordon Ramsay’s. I quickly raised my hand and looked at Michael. [Michael, look here.] “Seongguk, what is it?” Michael approached. A mix of unknown worry and anticipation was on his face. “Uncle Michael, please give me another one.” “Really? You can eat another?” “Yes! It’s really delicious! Please give me another! Another one!” My words prompted Taehyung and the other members to start saying the same. “Michael, give me another one too.” “This is addictive. Michael, another one for me too.” ‘Another one, please!’ burst out from here and there. Michael looked at me and then slyly winked. [I’ll pass on the wink. I just said it was delicious.] * * * ‘Five Men and a Baby Basket 7 Years Later’ was broadcast during the prime time slot on Sunday. It showed the appearance of the ‘Just’ members after disbandment and the story of Michael, who opened a handmade burger shop in Itaewon after leaving the group after the first album. Plus, my story as the first scholarship recipient of the Hyojin Group was aired. The highlight was the moment I shouted at Michael’s handmade burger shop. “Another one, please!” The subtitle read: [Another one, please! Seems like it’s going to be a huge trend.] Jihee, who couldn’t even flip over, heard my voice and grinned broadly. [Don’t smile so endearingly.] Seven-year-old Minguk wielded a plastic knife in the air and kept shouting “Another one, please!” Even mom licked her lips watching. “Seongguk, was it really delicious?” “Yeah. It was really delicious. I want to eat it again.” “Let’s all go to that place before we leave for America.” As the day to leave for America approached, I became a bit downhearted. Disappointed with education in South Korea and leaving to learn more in the bigger world, I hadn’t thought it would be sad to part with my family. After the date for studying abroad was set, Minguk came to my room every day and fell asleep hugging me tightly on the narrow single bed. “Hyung, take me with you,” he would talk in his sleep, making my sleep quality the worst. Mom and dad didn’t scold me for anything and just hugged me every time. Late at night, as Minguk fell asleep holding my waist again, I couldn’t sleep properly and tossed and turned. Then, I heard the door open slightly. Who is it? Soon, dad came in and looked down at Minguk and me sleeping. I closed my eyes tighter. Dad sat on the edge of the bed and hugged Minguk and me at once. A faint smell of alcohol wafted. [Dad, is there something troubling you?] After the launch of <Uncle Won’s Bossam>, dad became busier with the restaurant, making it hard to even see his face. Soon, dad showered Minguk and me with kisses, then kissed my cheek with a smack. “Seongguk, dad’s going to miss you so much when you go to America. But it’s for our Seongguk’s good, so I’ll bear it. Seongguk, dad is old-fashioned and couldn’t express how much he loves you. But you know all of dad’s feelings, right?” [How would I know if you don’t say it.] I clenched my eyes shut even tighter. Dad patted my butt. “Seongguk, having you and your mom made dad so happy. I’ll make a lot of money and definitely come to see you during your vacation.” [Dad, how much can a small business owner make. Save it.] Minguk hugged my waist tightly. His eyelids fluttered, showing he wasn’t asleep either. But what can I do? I have to pretend to be asleep. I quickly hugged Minguk tighter. “Honey, come out. The kids will wake up.” Mom whispered quietly, and dad finally gave Minguk and me one last kiss before leaving. [Phew, that was close.] Suddenly, I opened my eyes wide. And in the darkness, my gaze met Minguk’s, shining brightly. “You weren’t asleep either?” “Yeah. Hyung.” “Go to sleep.” “Hyung. I love my hyung too.” I patted Minguk’s back. “Minguk, you have a slightly lacking face to become a celebrity, so don’t neglect your studies. If you’re not smart, you have to at least work hard at something. Got it?” “Yeah.” “I’ll check every vacation, so don’t cause trouble for mom and dad.” “Yeah, hyung. But hyung… if I listen well, will you buy me a gift from America?” As expected, a child was still a child. I patted Minguk’s butt. “Yeah. I’ll buy you a lot.” “Hehe. Hyung, I love you.” Indeed, in a capitalist society, love seemed to occur when material things were exchanged. * * * “Jihee, look here. Yes, here.” Dad was gesturing and struggling to take a picture of Jihee with the camera. Jihee’s 100th-day celebration was set up on one side of the living room. Thinking back to when we had a simple celebration in a single room without a proper table, using a disposable camera, our family had indeed made significant progress. “Honey, take Seongguk and Minguk and stand there.” “Oh, but we should all take a picture together.” “Let’s take this and then set the timer for a group photo.” Mom pulled me and Minguk to Jihee’s side, who was wearing a pink dress and a crown on her head. Jihee smiled broadly when she saw me. “Jihee seems to like her oppa.” [Of course. I’m Jeon Seongguk. The man with a fatal charm!] I firmly held Jihee’s hand. “Seongguk, Minguk. Since it’s Jihee’s 100th day, let’s each say something as her oppas. Who wants to go first?” “Me! Me!” Minguk stepped forward. I, being the older brother, gave way. “Jihee, grow up quickly and let’s have a sword fight with oppa. Got it?” Of course, Jihee didn’t respond. Would a 100-day-old baby understand? “Now it’s Seongguk’s turn.” “Hmm….” I stroked my chin and slowly examined Jihee. By the time Minguk was 100 days old, his facial contours were somewhat visible. Though not as good as mine, he had a reasonably nice face with round eyes that added cuteness. But Jihee’s face was still indiscernible except for her chubby cheeks. [Not a celebrity material…. Then, she should at least study well. Seeing Minguk, except for me, it seems like this family doesn’t have great brains…. Jihee will have to start working as soon as she can walk.] While I was lost in thought, dad set the timer and ran over. “Okay, kids! Look at the camera. Ten, nine, eight, seven… four, three, two, one!” Click. The camera flashed. Because of that, Jihee closed her eyes. “Honey, how can you do that without warning? Seongguk was about to say something to Jihee.” “Oh! Sorry, sorry. Let’s take it again. Jihee seems to have closed her eyes.” Dad ran to set the timer again. I looked at Jihee and firmly held her hand. “Jihee, just grow up healthy. Oppa will take care of feeding you.” * * * “Seongguk’s preparations for studying abroad are all set. Here’s the plane ticket. A consultant who will accompany the daughter of Chairman Gu’s family is going with you, so you don’t have to worry.” Secretary Hwang Cheolsoo handed over the plane ticket. Mom still looked worried. “The consultant is a veteran who has accompanied the children of chaebol families abroad. Since the daughters of Chairman Gu’s family were also taken care of by this person since they were young, you really don’t have to worry.” “But he’s still so young….” [I’m fine, mom. I’ve been to and from America so many times.] It was rather me who had to reassure mom. “By the way, the results from Seongguk’s last assessment are out.” Suddenly, he looked dejected and disheartened. Before leaving for study abroad, the foundation tested my learning abilities, including an IQ test. Having been a Mensa member in my previous life, I was terrified of IQ tests after receiving a dismal score of 121 in this life. I took the test with anxiety, even consuming a calming pill, “Seongguk, well, as expected, you achieved outstanding results.” Secretary Hwang Cheolsoo handed over another test paper. “Minguk also took the test with you, remember? Mother, it might be good to pay more attention to Minguk.” “Is there a problem with Minguk?” “It’s not a problem, but Minguk’s IQ is over 160.” [What the X!] My mouth dropped open. “Minguk?” Mom seemed surprised too. “Seongguk is already an exceptional child, so his IQ isn’t a problem.” [Does that mean,] I sneakily opened my evaluation. My IQ was 123. Whether it’s 121 or 123, it’s practically the difference caused by condition on the day. “But since Minguk’s IQ is exceptionally high, if he receives gifted education, he will surely follow in Seongguk’s footsteps as a great talent.” “I thought Minguk was just average….” “This family’s children are all truly remarkable. As a parent myself, I’m quite envious.” Mom received the result paper with a pleased expression. That night, engulfed in despair, I looked at Minguk. “Hyung, let’s have a sword fight.” “Minguk….” My voice was devoid of energy. “Hyung, why?” “Minguk, study hard.” “I hate studying. Sword fighting is better.” Minguk cheerfully swung his plastic sword through the air. [That kid has an IQ over 160….] The feeling of life’s futility was this. From the moment I could walk, I pondered daily on how to uplift this family, never neglecting my studies… Yet, I’m just an ordinary 123. And that’s after gaining 2 points. With such an IQ, I have to live my life, while my brother, born into my family and easily passing auditions with my special training, came equipped with an IQ over 160 from birth. “Sigh…” “Hyung, what’s wrong?” “Minguk, don’t become a celebrity, study.” “I’m going to be a general.” [To become a general, you need to graduate from a military academy. Hence, you need to study well.] I slumped my shoulders and turned around to pack my things. [Can I do well in America with such an ordinary brain…?] I was full of worries. Then, Minguk suddenly hugged me from behind. Minguk’s warm hand firmly grasped mine. “Hyung, you’re the most handsome and smartest in the world. Cheer up, hyung.” [I may be the most handsome, but you’re smarter.] This is a fact. Indisputable. “Seongguk, let mom help you pack. Seongguk, give it here.” Mom stopped packing the suitcase and looked at my face. “Oh my, Seongguk. What’s wrong? Why are you crying?” “Sob-.” I burst into tears. “Seongguk, you’re sad because you’re leaving us.” Mom hugged me tightly and comforted me. “Mommy!” “Yes, Seongguk. Mom’s heart aches so much because you’re leaving. I thought Seongguk wasn’t sad at all, which made me a bit sad, but our Seongguk was also sad about leaving the family.” “Sob! Sob!” [Not at all. Mom, I’m crying because my IQ is lower than Minguk’s. The world is so unfair!] * * * The airport was a sea of tears. Mom, dad, and Minguk were sobbing, and even Jihee, who knew nothing, started to whimper. I said goodbye calmly. I hugged mom and dad tightly and also hugged Minguk tightly. I even kissed Jihee, who was in mom’s arms, on the cheek. “Mom, dad! Seongguk will study hard and return to Korea!” “Seongguk, if it’s hard, call mom and dad anytime.” “Yes!” I answered as calmly as possible. Yesterday, I cried because I was upset about having a lower IQ than Minguk, but today, I felt like crying because I was genuinely sad about leaving my family. I bit my lip hard and said goodbye. “Mom, dad! Seongguk will study a lot and come back to Korea!”"},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[난 1등 아니면 안 한다고.] “여기를?” 그레이스가 조금 난감한 표정을 지었다. “여긴… 워낙 입학 제도가 까다롭거든.” [나도 잘 안다. 그레이스, 효진에서 돈 어마어마하게 받을 텐데 진가를 발휘해야지.] 원래 어느 나라에서든 1등 하는 곳들은 콧대가 하늘을 찔렀다. “전 꼭 여기 가고 싶어요.” 내가 집은 미국의 보딩스쿨은 뉴햄프셔에 위치한 미국 내 1등 보딩스쿨이었다. 그리고 그곳에서 난 꼭 만날 사람이 있었다. 바로 마크 주크버스. * * * 그레이스 최는 자신이 아는 인맥을 모두 동원 중이었다. 성국이가 가고자 하는 보딩스쿨은 정말 한 해에 한 명 보내기도 힘든 곳으로 유명했다. 성국이의 성적이 최고이기는 했지만, 동양인. 거기다가 나이까지 어린 약점을 가지고 있었다. 하지만 SSAT에서 만점에 가까운 성적을 받은 데다가, 효진 그룹이 죽은 아들 이름으로 세운 준호 재단의 첫 장학생인 성국이를 이 학교에 보내지 못한다면 자신의 커리어에 큰 오점으로 남을 게 분명했다. 그레이스 최는 성국이에 대한 서류가 가득 든 봉투를 가지고 뉴햄프셔로 향했다. * * * 입학 상담실장의 콧대는 하늘을 찔렀다. 그도 그럴 것이 대한민국은 IMF의 위기에 빠진 동양의 작은 나라일 뿐이었다. 그레이스 최는 성국의 뛰어난 성적표와 각종 활동이 요약된 포트폴리오를 내밀었다. 입학 상담실장은 우선 그레이스 최 같은 입학 대리인을 좋아하지도 않았다. 어릴 적부터 뭐든 스스로 결정하는 것에 후한 점수를 주는 게 미국 문화이기 때문이다. 그레이스 최는 최대한 차분히 지금의 상황을 설명했다. “성국이는 올해 미국 나이로 여덟 살이 된 아이입니다. 이 학교에 꼭 지원하고 싶다고 해서, 지금 머무는 뉴욕과 거리가 멀어서 제가 우선 상담을 하러 온 것이니 양해 부탁드립니다.” 입학 상담실장은 콧방귀도 안 뀌고 서류를 훑었다. 학교에서 요구하는 각종 성적과 만점에 가까운 SSAT 성적표. 아역 모델부터 시작한 방송 커리어 등 호감 가는 요소가 많았다. “집안 형편은 미국으로 유학 올 정도로 좋지는 않습니다. 하지만 효진 그룹에서 처음으로 선발한 장학생이라는 점을 알아주셨으면 좋겠습니다.” “여긴 미국 최고의 학교인 거 아시죠? 그 정도 브레인들은 세계 각국에서 몰려옵니다. 성적도 좋고, 스토리도 있지만… 솔직히 저희 학교가 찾는 인재상인지는 모르겠네요. 나이도 너무 어리고요. 기숙사 생활이 가능할까요?” “미국에 적응하느라 작년부터 거의 1년 동안 뉴욕의 아파트에서 저와 함께 생활했습니다. 기숙사에 문제없이 적응 가능한 수준입니다. 이곳이 미국 최고의 보딩스쿨인 만큼 경쟁률도 높다는 것을 잘 압니다. 제가 알고 싶은 것은, 성국이가 이 학교에 붙기 위해서 뭐가 더 필요할까요?” 그레이스 최는 대범하게 물어봤다. 내가 아쉽다고 저자세를 취하면 어디서든 무시받기 좋았다. 입학 상담실장은 그런 그레이스 최의 태도가 무척 마음에 들었다. 물론 성국이란 아이의 나이와 커리어, 거기다 성적만 본다면 어느 학교에서든 탐낼 아이이기도 했다. “저희 학교에 지원하실 것 같으니… 우선 인터뷰 전에 에세이를 하나 보고 싶은데요. 가능할까요?” 그레이스 최의 미간이 구겨졌다. 불과 열 살밖에 안 된 아이와 평범한 고등학교 입학 단계의 아이 사이에 가장 큰 차이를 보이는 것이 바로 에세이였다. 성국이가 과연 할 수 있을까? 그건 그레이스 최도 장담할 수 없었다. * * * [에세이라고? 그건 껌이지.] 나는 그레이스가 왜 손톱까지 물어뜯으며 걱정하는지 알 수 없었다. 미국 교육 특성상 에세이를 누가 써주거나 하면 안 된다. 나중에 그 사실이 밝혀지면 퇴학까지 각오해야 되는 일이기 때문에, 에세이는 꼭 내가 써야 했다. 나는 팔뚝을 걷어 올렸다. [그레이스, 내가 말 안 했나 본데. 나 이래봬도 저번 생에서 삼전 그룹 사보에 글도 기고하고 했어. 유명한 소설가 이문석 선생님한테 직접 사사한 실력이라고.] 그레이스가 나를 보더니 빙긋 웃었다. “성국아, 자신 있어?” “네에!” “성국아, 만약 이번 보딩스쿨 떨어지면 다른 데 알아보자.” “흠….” 나는 잠시 턱을 매만졌다. 고민하고 있단 포즈이다. [그레이스, 떨어질 일은 없겠지만… 세상에 100프로는 없으니까. 그렇게 하지.] 나는 그레이스를 올려다봤다. “네, 다른 학교도 원서 넣을게요.” “고맙다, 성국아. 여기가 최고이긴 하지만, 다른 학교도 여기 못지않게 좋아.” [그건 나도 안다고. 다만 내가 만나고 싶은 사람이 있을 뿐이야, 그레이스.] 나는 얼른 종이를 펴고 에세이를 쓰기 시작했다. 에세이의 주제는 간단했다. 내 인생에 대한 이야기였다. 대한민국은 계급이 없는 나라입니다. 조선 시대 양반, 중인, 상민이라는 계급이 있긴 했지만, 일제강점기와 한국전쟁을 겪으면서 이 계급 체계는 완전히 무너졌습니다. 대한민국은 그 이후 눈부신 경제발전을 이뤘지만, 그 때문에 돈이 곧 계급이 되는 사회가 됐습니다. 아마 대한민국에서 계급을 매긴다면 저희 부모님은 최하위층이 분명합니다. 아버지, 어머니 모두 어릴 적에 고아원에 버려지다시피 하셨기 때문입니다. 공부를 잘했지만, 고아가 대학 가기 힘드니 기술이나 배우라는 선생님의 말에 결국, 공부를 포기하고 요리를 배우신 아버지. 결혼하고 아이를 낳으면서도 10년 후쯤에는 방 두 칸 되는 집에 살기를 꿈꿨던 어머니. 그분들이 제 부모님이십니다. 그리고 저는 그 어려운 부모님 밑에서 태어나 돌도 안 된 나이에 광고 모델을 하며…. 울컥. 나는 내 인생 이야기를 적으면서도 눈시울이 붉어졌다. 정말 대한민국에서 가장 어려운 집안에서 태어난 전직 재벌이라니…. 크응. 나는 콧물을 들이켰다. 그레이스 최가 곁으로 오더니 내 어깨를 토닥였다. “성국아, 힘들어?” “괜찮아요.” “그럼, 왜? 엄마, 아빠 보고 싶어?” “…….” 나는 대답 대신 입을 꼭 다물었다. 아마 그레이스 최는 아무리 설명해도 모를 것이다. 전직 재벌이었다가, 이건 뭐, 지상도 아닌 지하로 추락한 내 인생. 지하층에서 해 뜨는 지상으로 올라오기까지 한 내 개고생. [하아, 전성국. 정말 고생 많았어.] 이때, 그레이스가 내 어깨를 도닥였다. “성국아, 내가 에세이 잠시 읽었는데… 다 좋은데 말이야.” [반전 있는 끝말은 뭐야. 내 에세이에 흠이라도 있단 말인가, 그레이스?] “여기까지는 완벽하거든….” [당연한 말을. 어서 다음 말을 해봐, 그레이스.] 그레이스는 잠시 고민 끝에 말을 이었다. “성국아, 이건 염려인데 말이야. 미국이라는 나라가 겸손이라는 문화가 없지만, 열 살이 집안을 일으켜 세웠다는 이야기 같은 건 좀 오버 같아서. 그렇게 안 쓸 거지?” 뜨끔. 나는 정곡을 찔렸다. [그레이스, 그건 오버 아니고 사실인데…. 그레이스가 잘 몰라서 하는 말인가 본데. 이 집안, 진짜 내가 일으켜 세웠어.] 난 씁쓸한 미소를 지으며 에세이를 쓱쓱 지웠다. 그레이스는 내 어깨를 도닥였다. 10년 동안의 내 개고생을 언젠가 인정받는 날이 있겠지.","completion":"Episode 75 \\"Seong-guk, nice to meet you. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" I greeted her with a bow. Grace Choi was one of the famous consultants in this field. She charged enormous fees in exchange for designing study abroad courses for children from major families, including chaebols, and taking responsibility for their admissions to prestigious universities. Although there were many people doing this kind of work, Grace Choi was famous because she took perfect care of even the students' private lives. Due to the nature of the country, the United States, and being away from their parents, many children often went astray, easily accessing various drugs that were not allowed in Korea. Grace Choi was famous for perfectly caring for these aspects as well. Because of her reputation, being chosen by Grace Choi was considered a guarantee of admission to a famous university. Of course, there were exceptions. They were the daughters of Chairman Gu Su-young, Ye-jeong and Ye-ri. \\"Seong-guk, have you been well? I'm going to look around the duty-free shop with my sister, do you want to come?\\" \\"I'll stay here and read a book.\\" \\"Lady, please take good care of our Seong-guk.\\" \\"Go ahead, ladies.\\" Grace Choi had been in charge of Jun-ho, the deceased son of Chairman Gu Su-young. Through that connection, she also took on the two daughters of Chairman Gu Su-young, who were lacking in academic performance but had bright personalities. Of course, I was an exception. Strictly academic performance! Strictly potential! I was proudly chosen by Grace Choi based on these criteria alone. \\"Seong-guk, what book are you reading?\\" [Are you going to monitor even the books now, Grace?] \\"I'm reading this book.\\" I showed her the cover of the book. \\"It's <Demian> by Hermann Hesse.\\" Grace Choi's eyes widened for a moment. \\"Seong-guk, is this the original German version?\\" \\"Yes. I wanted to study because German is difficult.\\" \\"Did you also study German?\\" \\"I'm not very good at it.\\" It was true. Although I could speak English, Japanese, and French almost at a native level, German was a bit difficult for me, and Chinese, which I learned later, was only good enough for simple conversations. That's why I always excluded Chinese when asked how many languages I could speak. \\"Seong-guk, you have a great ambition for languages.\\" [Since I didn't master it in my previous life, I'll try in this one.] \\"Are you particularly interested in humanities, Seong-guk?\\" \\"Yes. Especially in the entertainment business.\\" \\"Entertainment?\\" \\"Yes!\\" At that time, the perception of the entertainment business in South Korea was minimal. But I knew. If companies like Samsung create something from something, the entertainment industry is a business that creates something from nothing. \\"America is the best place to study for that.\\" I nodded. That was also why I chose to study in the United States. Grace Choi handed me a schedule. \\"You'll arrive at New York JFK airport tomorrow morning if you take the plane today. You'll live with Ye-jeong and Ye-ri sisters for about two weeks to adapt to life in the US, and then you'll immediately start a language course at Columbia.\\" [I don't need a language course, but okay for now.] I silently nodded. \\"My academic achievements of passing the elementary school qualification exam with a perfect score at a young age have been recognized, and I'll be able to enroll in a boarding school in time for the fall semester in September.\\" \\"Okay.\\" I calmly responded. \\"Seong-guk, many kids go abroad to study at your age, but I've never seen a child as calm as you.\\" [Of course. New York and Boston were like my own home, Grace.] \\"Do you have any questions?\\" \\"I'd like to read a book for now.\\" \\"Okay. Oh, and you can call me Grace comfortably.\\" \\"Yes, Grace.\\" I smiled and began reading <Demian>. There's a famous quote in <Demian>. - Whoever wants to be born must destroy a world. Now, I am trying to be reborn as the second Jeon Seong-guk. To do so, I must break out of this small world called South Korea. * * * I scored almost perfect on the SSAT, the entrance exam for private high schools in the United States. There was only one question that confused me, but that tripped me up, so it wasn't a perfect score. Well, it's human to make a mistake or two. Grace Choi handed me the score report with a happy face. \\"Seong-guk, you already know your score, but take a look. You did really well. With this score, you can go to any high school in the US. It seems like it was a good decision to take the middle school qualification exam.\\" [Of course.] I shrugged. Originally, I was going to go to a private middle school after finishing a short-term language course, but I decided to take the middle school qualification exam instead. The reason was a boarding school I really wanted to go to. And there was someone I wanted to meet. Grace Choi handed me a list of prestigious boarding schools in the US. \\"Seong-guk, with your scores, it seems like you can go anywhere here.\\" \\"I choose here.\\" The place I pointed to was, of course, the top boarding school in the US. [I don't do anything but first place.] \\"Here?\\" Grace looked a bit troubled. \\"It's... well-known for its rigorous admission process.\\" [I know that well. Grace, you're going to receive a huge amount of money from Hyojin, so you better show your worth.] Top places in any country always had their noses in the air. \\"I really want to go here.\\" The boarding school I chose was located in New Hampshire, the top boarding school in the US. And there, I had someone I must meet. Mark Zuckerberg. * * * Grace Choi was mobilizing all her contacts. The boarding school Seong-guk wanted to attend was famous for being difficult to send even one student a year. Seong-guk's academic performance was excellent, but being Asian and young were weaknesses. However, since he scored almost perfect on the SSAT and was the first scholarship student selected by the Hyojin Group's Jun-ho Foundation, not being able to send Seong-guk to this school would be a significant stain on her career. Grace Choi, holding an envelope full of documents about Seong-guk, headed to New Hampshire. * * * The admissions counselor's nose was high in the air. After all, South Korea was just a small country in the East that had fallen into the IMF crisis. Grace Choi presented Seong-guk's outstanding transcript and a portfolio summarizing various activities. The admissions counselor didn't like admissions agents like Grace Choi to begin with. In American culture, giving high scores to those who make decisions on their own from a young age was the norm. Grace Choi explained the situation as calmly as possible. \\"Seong-guk is eight years old in American age this year. He really wanted to apply to this school, so I came for a consultation first since we're staying in New York, which is far from here. I hope you understand.\\" The admissions counselor didn't even snort and skimmed through the documents. The various grades required by the school and the SSAT score report, almost perfect. The broadcasting career that started from being a child model had many appealing factors. \\"The family's financial situation isn't good enough to afford studying in the US. However, I hope you recognize that he is the first scholarship student selected by the Hyojin Group.\\" \\"You know this is the best school in the US, right? Brains like that come from all over the world. The grades are good, and the story is there, but... I'm not sure if he's the type of student we're looking for. He's also very young. Can he handle dorm life?\\" \\"He's been living with me in an apartment in New York for almost a year to adapt to the US. He can definitely adapt to dorm life. I understand that this school is the best boarding school in the US and has a high competition rate. What I want to know is, what more does Seong-guk need to get into this school?\\" Grace Choi asked boldly. If I showed a low stance because I was desperate, it was easy to be ignored anywhere. The admissions counselor liked Grace Choi's attitude very much. Of course, considering Seong-guk's age, career, and grades alone, any school would covet him. \\"If you're going to apply to our school... I'd like to see an essay before the interview. Is that possible?\\" Grace Choi's brow furrowed. The biggest difference between a child of just ten years and a normal high school applicant was the essay. Could Seong-guk really do it? That was something even Grace Choi couldn't guarantee. * * * [An essay? That's a piece of cake.] I didn't understand why Grace was biting her nails in worry. In American education, it's forbidden for someone else to write your essay. If that fact is discovered later, you have to be prepared for expulsion, so I had to write the essay myself. I rolled up my sleeves. [Grace, didn't I tell you? In my previous life, I even contributed articles to Samsung Group's magazine. I was personally mentored by the famous novelist Lee Moon-seok.] Grace looked at me and smiled. \\"Seong-guk, are you confident?\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Seong-guk, if we fail to get into this boarding school, let's look elsewhere.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" I pretended to ponder for a moment. [Grace, there won't be a failure, but... since there's no 100% in life, let's do that.] I looked up at Grace. \\"Yes, I'll apply to other schools too.\\" \\"Thank you, Seong-guk. This place is the best, but other schools are not bad either.\\" [I know that too. It's just that I have someone I want to meet, Grace.] I quickly spread out the paper and started writing the essay. The topic of the essay was simple. It was about my life. South Korea is a country without a class system. During the Joseon Dynasty, there were classes such as nobles, middle class, and commoners, but this class system completely collapsed through the Japanese occupation and the Korean War. South Korea has achieved remarkable economic development since then, but as a result, it has become a society where money is equivalent to class. If we were to classify classes in South Korea, my parents would definitely be at the bottom. Both my father and mother were practically abandoned in orphanages when they were young. My father, who was good at studying but was told by his teacher that it was difficult for an orphan to go to college and should learn a skill instead, eventually gave up studying and learned cooking. My mother, who dreamed of living in a two-room house about ten years after getting married and having a child. They are my parents. And I was born under such difficult parents and started working as an advertising model before I was even a year old.... I choked up. Writing my life story, I was a former chaebol born in the most difficult family in South Korea.... I sniffled. Grace Choi came over and patted my shoulder. \\"Seong-guk, is it hard?\\" \\"I'm okay.\\" \\"Then, why? Do you miss your mom and dad?\\" \\"......\\" Instead of answering, I just closed my mouth tightly. Grace Choi probably wouldn't understand even if I explained. A former chaebol who fell not just to the ground but to the basement of life. My struggle to climb from the basement to the surface where the sun rises. [Ah, Jeon Seong-guk. You've really had a hard time.] Then, Grace patted my shoulder. \\"Seong-guk, I read your essay for a moment... everything is perfect until here.\\" [Of course. Now, what's the next thing you're going to say, Grace?] Grace hesitated for a moment before continuing. \\"Seong-guk, this is a concern, but... America doesn't have a culture of humility, but saying a ten-year-old lifted up the family seems a bit over the top. You're not going to write that, right?\\" I felt a sting. [Grace, that's not an exaggeration but a fact... You probably don't know because you're not aware. I really lifted up this family.] I smiled bitterly and erased parts of the essay. Grace patted my shoulder. Someday, my ten years of struggle will be recognized."},{"prompt":"Muv-luvシリーズをプレイして、そのストーリーの深さや設定の作りこみに非常に感動しました。 周りのキャラクターが彼ら、彼女ら自身の戦いのために成長することや、それを見た主人公が共に成長していく姿。主人公が何度、成長したと思ってもそれを覆す決意を揺るがす悲惨な現実をこれでもかと突き付けてくる物語の凄惨さ。命より大切なものを失ってから、やっとこさ成長できた主人公が立ち向かう現実。 これらに非常に感銘を受けました。これは一生忘れません。どんな映画や小説、","completion":"アニメでもなかなか味わうことができない、深い感動と学びを提供してくれるのがMuv-Luvシリーズですよね。このシリーズは、ただの恋愛アドベンチャーゲームとして始まりながらも、途中からSFとミリタリー要素が強くなり、人類の存亡をかけた壮大なストーリーへと発展していきます。その過程で、キャラクターたちが直面する挑戦や、彼らの心の成長、苦痛と喪失、そして希望に至るまで、非常に人間的でリアルな物語が描かれています。 Muv-Luvシリーズの特徴的な点は、複数のルートやエンディングを経験することで、主人公だけでなく、周囲のキャラクターたちの背景や心情も深く理解できるようになっています。また、物語が進むにつれて露わになる、圧倒的な規模の世界観や複雑に絡み合った政治、軍事の背景は、プレイヤーにさまざまな角度から物事を考えさせ、深い印象を残します。 加えて、人間の強さや弱さ、命の尊さ、そして何よりも大切なものを守るための選択と決断についてのテーマは、プレイヤーに重いメッセージを投げかけます。Muv-Luvシリーズを通じて、人間がどのように困難に立ち向かい、乗り越えていくかの模範を見ることができるとともに、自分自身の人生や選択について深く考えさせられるでしょう。 Muv-Luvシリーズが細部にわたり丁寧に作り込まれた設定、背景、キャラクターたちの成長といった要素が組み合わさって、他のどんな映画や小説、アニメでもなかなか味わえない特別な体験をプレイヤーに提供してくれるのは、その深いストーリーテリングと、プレイヤーが物語に没入していく過程にあります。確かに、これらの体験は一生忘れられないものになるでしょう。"},{"prompt":"Придумай и опиши следующие нации из средневековой фэнтези игры; 1.

This series revolves around a group of young warriors in training, who seek out and protect various magical artifacts known as Shen Gong Wu, to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. The Yin YoYo and the Yang YoYo stand out among the myriad of Shen Gong Wu for their unique properties and the profound implications they hold for those who wield them. These artifacts are intrinsically connected and are designed to work in tandem. The Yin YoYo embodies the essence of yin, representing qualities such as darkness, passivity, and absorption. Conversely, the Yang YoYo embodies the yang attributes of brightness, activity, and creation. In the philosophy of yin and yang, these forces are seen as complementary, rather than opposing, elemental forces that shape the universe and all living things within it. The true power of these Shen Gong Wu is revealed when they are used together, allowing the wielder to enter the Yin-Yang World. This dimension is a place of balance but also of great danger, as it inverts the nature of those who enter it, challenging their understanding of themselves and the world around them. The requirement to possess both YoYos safeguards against the imbalance that would occur should one venture into the Yin-Yang World with one aspect of their being unrepresented. This mechanism is demonstrated in the poignant episode \\"Judging Omi,\\" where Omi, the young monk protagonist, experiences firsthand the consequences of entering the Yin-Yang World without this balance. Upon his attempted return to Earth, only his good half is able to come back, leading to significant existential and moral dilemmas for him and his friends. The depiction of the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo, along with the concept of the Yin-Yang World, reflects a deeper narrative layer within \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" emphasizing themes of balance, duality, and the journey toward self-understanding. These objects are not merely tools of power but are imbued with philosophical significance, echoing the ancient Chinese beliefs in the necessity of balance and harmony within the universe and the self. Due to the specialized nature of these Shen Gong Wu and the nuances of their applications within the series, the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo may not be as prominently featured or as instantly recognizable as other artifacts in the series. Furthermore, the unique and somewhat cryptic naming convention of these Shen Gong Wu can lead to confusion and difficulty in finding specific information about them, as searches may inadvertently direct inquirers to content related to the general concept of yin and yang or other unrelated media that share similar naming patterns. Despite their relative obscurity, the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo hold a special place within the lore of \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" encapsulating the show's thematic depth and its inventive reimagining of ancient philosophies within a contemporary fantasy context."},{"prompt":"Write that a cartoon with a similar name and Google Autocorrect could also be a perfect storm for those looking for info about the Wu","completion":"The pursuit of detailed information about the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo, as depicted in \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" can often lead to a converging point of frustration and fascination, largely due to a phenomenon resulting from the interplay between the series' nomenclature and modern digital search algorithms. The presence of a cartoon with a remarkably similar name, coupled with the intricacies of Google's autocorrect and suggestion features, creates a perfect storm for those earnestly scouring the internet for insights on these specific Shen Gong Wu. When trying to navigate through the vastness of the internet to learn more about the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo, searchers may find themselves ensnared in a web of unrelated content. This is in part because the keywords \\"Yin\\" and \\"Yang\\" are deeply ingrained within a wide array of cultural, philosophical, and entertainment contexts beyond \\"Xiaolin Showdown.\\" Therefore, attempts to pinpoint information on these particular artifacts often yield results that are tangentially related at best. Adding to the complexity is Google's sophisticated yet sometimes overly zealous autocorrect feature, designed to interpret and anticipate the user's intent. While immensely beneficial in many scenarios, this feature can inadvertently steer users away from their intended search target towards more commonly discussed topics that share similar naming conventions. Hence, what was a quest for knowledge about these unique Shen Gong Wu can quickly devolve into a journey through unrelated content about yin and yang principles, other animations, or even various toys and games incorporating \\"yoyo\\" in their names. This digital quagmire illustrates not only the challenges of seeking information on more obscure topics in an era dominated by SEO (Search Engine Optimization) practices and algorithmic determinations but also highlights the peculiar position of \\"Xiaolin Showdown\\" within the broader cultural landscape. Despite its dedicated fanbase and significant impact on early 2000s animated television, the nuanced details of its lore, including elements like the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo, often occupy a niche corner of the web that requires persistence and specificity to uncover. For fans and newcomers alike, the quest for knowledge about the Yin YoYo and Yang YoYo embodies a microcosm of the broader challenges faced when attempting to dive deep into the intricate world of \\"Xiaolin Showdown.\\" It serves as a reminder of the often unexpected journeys we embark upon in the digital age, all in pursuit of elucidating the hidden corners of our favorite fictional universes."},{"prompt":"Rescreva a história de final fantasy 7 só que versão dark e realista onde sephroot venceu no final","completion":"Em um mundo enegrecido pela ganância corporativa e pela deterioração ambiental, a história de Final Fantasy VII toma um rumo sombrio e realista, culminando numa conclusão onde o vilão, Sephiroth, emerge vitorioso. A megacorporação Shinra, monopolizando o recurso vital conhecido como Mako, sucumbe a seus próprios demônios internos de corrupção e poder desenfreado. Enquanto isso, o protagonista, Cloud Strife, junto a um grupo de resistentes chamado AVALANCHE, inicia uma batalha desesperada para deter tanto a Shinra quanto a ascensão inevitável de Sephiroth, um ser quase divino, nascido de experimentos científicos desumanos, desejoso de se tornar um deus através da destruição completa do planeta. Conforme a batalha pelo destino do mundo avança, as linhas entre o bem e o mal se embolam em meio a revelações dolorosas sobre a natureza de seus inimigos e deles mesmos. Cloud, lutando não apenas contra Sephiroth mas contra a própria identidade fragmentada, vê cada vitória sendo ofuscada por consequências terríveis. O panorama do mundo de Final Fantasy VII é marcado por paisagens desoladas, cidades em ruínas e ecossistemas em colapso, refletindo o custo humano e ambiental da eterna busca por poder e controle. A narrativa atinge seu clímax em uma sequência de eventos marcada por sacrifícios heroicos e traições devastadoras. Um a um, os companheiros de Cloud caem, deixando-o enfrentar Sephiroth em uma última batalha apocalíptica. No entanto, ao invés do triunfo esperado, o mundo testemunha a queda definitiva de seus heróis. Sephiroth, demonstrando ser o adversário supremo, usa o poder da Black Materia para convocar Meteor, uma magia capaz de infligir uma ferida maciça ao planeta, o suficiente para ele absorver a energia vital liberada e transcender à divindade. Contra toda esperança, o Meteor atinge a superfície do planeta, desencadeando calamidades indescritíveis e marcando o princípio de uma era de escuridão. Sobreviventes da catástrofe enfrentam um mundo irreconhecível, cada dia uma luta pela existência contra as consequências do reinado tirânico de Sephiroth. Com o Lifestream, a força vital do planeta, severamente enfraquecido e contaminado pelo Mako e pela energia negativa do Meteor, a recuperação parece um sonho distante, deixando as poucas almas restantes em um estado de desesperança constante. Final Fantasy VII, nesta versão dark e realista, termina não com uma nota de triunfo, mas com uma meditação sombria sobre as consequências de nossas ações e o preço da ambição desmedida. A vitória final de Sephiroth representa mais do que a derrota dos protagonistas; simboliza o triunfo do desespero sobre a esperança, do individualismo sobre a comunidade e do poder destrutivo da humanidade sobre a natureza."},{"prompt":"Write about the Xiaolin Showdown episode Judging Omi","completion":"\\"Judging Omi\\" is the 25th episode of the third season of the animated television series \\"Xiaolin Showdown.\\" The episode originally aired in the United States on May 6, 2006. \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" created by Christy Hui, is centered around the adventures of four young Xiaolin monks: Omi, Kimiko, Raimundo, and Clay, as they travel the world to collect powerful artifacts known as Shen Gong Wu and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. In \\"Judging Omi,\\" the story unfolds with the young monks embarking on another quest to retrieve a newly revealed Shen Gong Wu, the Sphere of Yun. However, the episode gives a significant focus on Omi and his personal journey, both in terms of his physical quest for the Wu and his moral and ethical growth. The episode begins with Master Fung informing the monks about the Sphere of Yun, a Shen Gong Wu that can replicate the abilities of any other Wu but with only half the power. Recognizing the strategic advantage it could afford them, the monks set out to claim it. During their journey, they encounter Chase Young and Wuya, who also seek the Sphere for their nefarious purposes. The core of \\"Judging Omi\\" lies in the internal and external trials that Omi faces. He is tricked into a scenario where his judgment and character are put to the test. Chase Young, leveraging Omi's pride and naiveté, presents him with a series of challenges that are as much about combat as they are about making difficult moral choices. One pivotal moment in the episode is when Omi is given the choice to save his friends or secure the Sphere of Yun. Omi chooses to save his friends, demonstrating his growth from a monk often accused of being selfish or overly competitive into a more compassionate and team-oriented individual. This choice highlights the thematic emphasis on the importance of virtue, friendship, and the sometimes difficult decisions that come with leadership. \\"Juding Omi\\" culminates in a showdown where the monks, utilizing their wits, teamwork, and the lessons learned throughout their journey, manage to outsmart Chase Young and Wuya, securing the Sphere of Yun.

This scenario could occur after events like a massive fire, a volcanic eruption, or any other disaster that produces a significant amount of ash. This literal interpretation would often suggest the aftermath of a catastrophic event, highlighting the scale of destruction and the impact on the environment. 2. **Metaphorical Interpretation**: Metaphorically, the phrase can be rich in symbolism and may convey several profound meanings, including: - **The Aftermath of Destruction or Loss**: Used metaphorically, it could represent the remnants or consequences of a devastating event in someone's life, such as the end of a relationship, the loss of a job, or the death of a loved one. The \\"ash\\" signifies what is left after something has been consumed by metaphorical fire. - **Feeling Overwhelmed**: Standing \\"ankle deep\\" in something can also suggest being partially submerged or overwhelmed by an experience or emotion. In this sense, the ash could symbolize feelings of despair, sadness, or suffocation by the aftermath of a challenging situation. - **A Call to Rebirth or Renewal**: In some cultures, ash is symbolic of cleansing, purification, and rebirth. From this point of view, being \\"ankle deep in ash\\" could imply the initial stages of emerging from a period of destruction or hardship and moving towards renewal and rebuilding. It speaks to the potential of new growth and beginnings that can emerge from the remnants of the past. - **Reflection on Transience**: Ashes can also represent the transient nature of life and material possessions, highlighting the inevitability of decay and the importance of acceptance and letting go. The exact interpretation depends greatly on the context in which the phrase is used, including the narrative or discussion surrounding it. It could be a poignant visual in literature, a descriptive element in a personal anecdote, or a metaphorical expression in a poem or song, each carrying its unique set of connotations and insights. Without additional context, these interpretations offer a broad understanding of the phrase \\"ankle deep in ash,\\" embracing both its literal and symbolic dimensions."},{"prompt":"Hero for a day?","completion":"The phrase \\"hero for a day\\" can be interpreted in a few ways, depending on the context. Here are some possible meanings: 1. **Achieving Momentary Glory**: The phrase could imply that someone has done something significant or heroic that has earned them admiration and recognition, but suggests that this acclaim is temporary. It might be used to describe a situation where an individual's actions have led to a brief period of fame or hero status among peers, in the media, or in the public eye. However, this status is not expected to last long, implying that the attention and praise will soon fade. 2. **A Chance to Prove Oneself**: \\"Hero for a day\\" might also refer to a situation or opportunity where an individual has the chance to step up and demonstrate their capabilities, valor, or virtue, albeit briefly. It suggests a temporary role where one gets to exhibit qualities typically associated with being a hero, such as bravery, selflessness, or the ability to make a significant positive impact on others. 3. **Experimental Role-playing or Simulation**: In another context, it could literally refer to a role-playing scenario, game, or simulation where participants get to act out the role of a hero for a day. This could be part of an educational activity, team-building exercise, or simply for entertainment, where people experience what it feels like to be in a hero's shoes, making decisions and solving problems. 4. **Metaphorical for Making a Difference**: On a more metaphorical level, \\"hero for a day\\" might be used to encourage individuals to take actions, however small, that can make a positive difference in someone's life or in society. It suggests that even temporary actions or decisions can have a meaningful impact, and that everyone has the potential to be a hero in their own way, even if just for a short while. 5. **Critique of Transient Recognition**: Additionally, the phrase might critique the way society often briefly lionizes individuals for heroic deeds, only to quickly forget about them and move on to the next story or sensation. In this sense, it points to the fleeting nature of fame and recognition in the modern world, where being a \\"hero for a day\\" might not lead to lasting acknowledgment or change. Overall, the interpretation of \\"hero for a day\\" largely depends on the narrative or thematic context in which it is used, ranging from literal to metaphorical, and encompassing both positive and critical connotations."},{"prompt":"Gere script em python que faça armazenamento virtual indicando o caminho e o caminho da pasta","completion":"Para elaborar um script simples em Python que realiza o armazenamento (ou gravação) de algum conteúdo em um arquivo, seguido pela indicação dos caminhos de origem e destino, podemos usar as funções básicas de arquivo do Python.

[흠…. 엄마, 아빠 오는데 플렉스 좀 해볼까.] 효진 그룹에서 지원해주긴 했지만, 그동안 번 돈으로 부모님께 진짜 미국과 뉴욕을 구경시켜 주고 싶었다. 우선 코스피 바닥일 때 산 삼전의 주식이 4만 원에서 20만 원을 돌파했다. 정확히 5배가 올랐다. 이 추세는 당분간 계속될 것이기 때문에, 나는 큰맘 먹고 주식 일부를 처분하기로 했다. 또 사고 싶은 주식도 있기 때문이다. [엄마, 아빠는 뉴욕이 처음이니까 우선 자유의 여신상도 보여주고, 센트럴파크도 가고… 스테이크도 먹어야겠지. 아빠는 요식업자니까 맛집을 좀 찾아봐야겠네. 디즈니랜드는 너무 먼데….] 똑. 똑. 노크 소리가 들렸다. 문이 열리면서 구예정이 들어왔다. “성국아, 오늘 합격 축하하러 저녁 먹으러 가자.” “네.” “근데 이게 다 뭐야?” “아빠, 엄마 오면 같이 가고픈 데 계획 짜는 거예요.” 구예정은 주식 시세가 뜬 화면을 가리켰다. “그게 아니라 이거 주식 아니야?” “네, 엄마, 아빠 제대로 구경시켜 주고 싶어서요. 주식 좀 팔려고요.” “성국아, 준호 재단에서 다 제공할 거야. 그러니까 너무 걱정하지 마.” “민국이가 디즈니랜드도 가보고 싶다고 해서요. 이런 건 제 돈으로 하려고요. 준호 재단에서 너무 많이 도와주셨잖아요.” 그건 사실이었다. 뉴욕의 아파트와 과외 공부. 거기다 그레이스 최라는 최고의 교육 컨설턴트까지. [디즈니랜드 가는 비용까지 대달라고 하기엔 나도 양심이라는 게 있어.] 구예정은 잠시 고민하더니, 얼른 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “우선 이건 오늘 저녁 먹고 고민해보자. 성국아, 어서 준비해.” “네.” * * * 구예정이 데리고 간 곳은 당연히 미슐랭 스타를 받은 고급 레스토랑이었다. 구예정과 구예리도 평소 편안한 복장을 벗고 나름 드레시한 옷으로 멋을 냈다. “아가씨들 덕분에 저도 좋은 곳 많이 오네요.” 그레이스도 동행한 자리였다. “저희 때문에도 고생하시고, 성국이 이번에 입시 때문에 정말 고생하셨잖아요. 맛있는 건 같이 먹어야죠.” 역시 구씨 자매는 친절했다. 예약한 자리로 직원이 자연스레 안내했다. 고급스러운 인테리어와 분위기. [나도 즐겨 오던 곳인데…. 캬아.] 와인 한잔 생각이 간절했지만, 나는 이제 고작 열 살이었다. “언니, 우리 와인 한잔 하자. 축배를 들어야지. 성국이는 뭐 마실래?” “사과 주스요.” 내가 주문할 수 있는 유일한 주스였다. “성국이 언제 커서 우리랑 와인 마시지.” “예리야, 성국이 크면 우리랑 안 논다니까.” “언니도 너무해. 성국아, 커도 우리랑 놀아줄 거지?” “당연하죠.” 입에 발린 말이다. 이때, 구예정이 구예리의 어깨를 톡톡 치며 누군가를 손가락으로 가리켰다. “어머, ‘저스트’ 범선 아니야?” [범선이라고?] 나는 고개를 휙 돌렸다. 정말 범선이었다. “어머, 언니! 언니 완전 범선 팬이잖아.” [알지, 알지. 해체한 ‘저스트’ 음악 밤마다 매일 듣잖아.] “성국아, 너 범선 씨 알지?” 나를 바라보는 구예리의 눈이 별처럼 빛났다. [내가 나서줘야 할 때인가. 내가 없으면 안 되는 거야.] 나는 대답 대신 몸으로 보여주기로 했다. 의자를 빼고 일어나 범선에게 걸어갔다. 미국 오기 직전에 같이 프로그램을 한 적이 있어서 범선도 분명 나를 기억할 게 당연했다. 범선은 여러 사람들과 자리를 기다리는 중이었다. 내가 걸어가자 범선의 눈이 커지더니 믿을 수 없다는 표정으로 나를 쳐다봤다. [맞아, 나 전성국이야.] “성국아? 성국이 맞지?” “네에! 잘 지내셨어요?” “아, 맞다. 성국이 미국 유학 간다고 했었지. 여기 가족들이랑 온 거야?” [우리 집은 여기 올 형편은 안 된다고.] 나는 도리도리 고개를 저었다. “저 후원해 주시는 효진 그룹분들이랑 왔어요.” 이때, 구예정이 얼른 다가왔다. “안녕하세요. 구예정이라고 합니다.” “아, 네. 안녕하세요.” 범선이 어색하게 인사를 했다. 예나 지금이나 범선은 낯을 좀 가렸다. “혹시 지금 기다리시는 거예요?” “아, 네. 예약을 했는데, 뭐가 잘 안 된 모양이에요.” “일행이 몇 명이신데요?” “저까지 해서 총 세 명이요.” “제가 한번 말해볼게요.” 구예정은 매니저에게 다가가 범선 일행의 일을 이야기하더니, 곧 웃으면서 돌아왔다. “저희 옆자리로 안내해 주신대요. 아마 예약이 안 되신 모양이에요.” “정말 감사합니다.” 범선은 얼른 인사를 했다. [잠깐, 이게 아닌데. 내가 기억하는 사랑의 짝대기는 분명 범선과 예리인데….] “성국이 덕분에 밥 먹게 생겼네. 안 그래도 배 엄청 고팠거든.” 곧 매니저가 범선 일행을 우리 바로 옆자리로 안내했다. 그사이 예리는 화장을 고쳤는지, 얼굴이 한결 화사해져 있었다. “언니, 범선 진짜 잘생겼다.” “너 예전에 ‘저스트’ 콘서트 가서 사진 같이 찍었잖아.” “그때보다 더 잘생긴 거 같아. 성국아, 다 너 덕분이야.” [당연하지. 근데 자매들 간에 범선 놓고 싸우지만 마.] 나는 조금 걱정이 됐다. 아무래도 예리는 갓 스무 살에 철없는 이미지였다면 예정은 나름 성숙하고 안정적인 면이 있었다. 범선은 얼른 우리 테이블에 와서 인사를 했다. “정말 고맙습니다. 혹시 괜찮으시면 오랜만에 얼굴 본 김에 제가 2차 사도 될까요?” [당연하지!] “성국이랑 나랑은 먼저 집에 가 있을게요. 아가씨들은 만나고 오세요.” [무슨 소리야? 나도 2차 가고 싶다고! 뉴욕의 밤이 얼마나 화려하고 예쁜데.] 내가 종알거리자 범선이 옆으로 다가왔다. “성국아, 진짜 반갑다.” [반가우면 2차!] “성국아, 내일 점심 같이 먹을까?” [2차는 물 건너갔단 이야기구나….] 나는 어쩔 수 없이 고개를 끄덕였다. “오빠, 누구랑 같이 오신 거예요?” “이쪽은 ‘저스트’ 때부터 나랑 같이 일한 방무혁 작곡가시고요.” [방무혁이라고?] 나는 얼른 어둑한 실내 속 묵직한 실루엣을 확인했다. 방무혁이 분명했다. “그 옆에는 나랑 오래 일한 매니저.” [내일 점심은 무슨 일이 있어도 꼭 먹어야겠는걸.] * * * “성국아, 여기가 뉴욕에서 가장 맛있는 햄버거 맛집이래. 너랑 이태원 마이클 버거집 간 게 벌써 2년 전이야.” 범선은 정말 한 말은 잘 지키는 사람이었다. 어린 나와의 약속 따위 피곤하면 쉽게 취소할 수도 있는데, 범선은 그러지 않았다. 나는 얼른 테이블에 앉아서 햄버거를 받아 들었다. 오늘은 매니저는 없고 방무혁은 함께였다. “형, 내가 성국이 말했지? 천재라고.” “세상 너무 불공평한 거 같은데. 천재인데, 얼굴도 완전 잘생겼잖아. 성국아, 앞에 두고 말해서 미안해.” “괜찮아요.” 나는 태연한 척 햄버거를 먹었다. “형, 우리 타이틀곡 <거짓이야> 그거 성국이가 선곡해준 거잖아. 성국아, 그 노래 만든 형이 이분이셔.” “우와!” 나는 최대한 아이답게 신기한 듯 리액션을 해줬다. [이미 다 아는 사실이라고. 내가 방무혁의 미래에 대해서 좀 아는데, 굳이 말하진 않겠어. 대한민국의 K-POP이 세계를 평정하는 날이 온다는 정도만 말할게. 그래서 나 지금 방무혁이랑 아주 긴밀히 가까워질 계획이라고.] 방무혁은 햄버거를 연신 먹으며 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 진짜 이쪽으로 나갈 생각 없어?” “형, 성국이 캐스팅하는 거야?” “나도 언제까지 작곡이나 할 수는 없잖아. 돈 좀 더 벌면 아이돌 그룹 제작해 보려고. 성국이 같은 애가 있으면 딱 센터감인데. 성국아, 진짜 관심 없어?” “전 아이돌보다 엔터테인먼트 사업에 관심 많아요.” “뭐어?” 방무혁은 꽤 놀란 눈치였다. 그에 반해 범선은 태연했다. “형, 성국이 보통 애 아니라고 했잖아.” “난 네가 그냥 그렇게 말할 때, 뭐 그런가 보다 했지. 엔터테인먼트 사업이면 어떤 분야에 관심이 많아?” “영화나 아이돌 그룹 제작, 저도 해보고 싶거든요.” 나는 솔직하게 이야기했다. 이건 일종이 테스트이기도 했다. 나같이 어린애의 말이라고 무시한다면 방무혁은 더는 상종할 필요가 없는 사람이었다. “나랑 비슷하네. 성국아, 그럼 넌 여기서 그쪽으로 공부해볼 생각이야?” “네. 엔터테인먼트 사업 쪽으로 공부해서 한국 가고 싶어요.” “성국아, 우선 네가 이쪽 사업에 관심 있다는 건 잘 알겠고. 진짜 이 일을 하고 싶으면 이 일을 좋아해야 한다고 생각해. 책만 보던 애들이 갑자기 영화 한다고 하거나, 음악 한다고 하는 거 나 안 믿거든. 어릴 적부터 음악이든 영화든 꾸준히 보고 즐겨야지 보는 눈도 생기는 거야.” “명심할게요.” 방무혁이 입가에 묻은 햄버거 소스를 닦으며 빙긋 웃었다. “성국아, 미국에서 돌아오면 꼭 나 찾아와.” “어떻게 찾아가요?” “성국아, 핸드폰 있지?” “네.” 나는 얼른 핸드폰을 내밀었다. 방무혁은 내 핸드폰에 전화번호를 입력했다. “성국아, 내 번호도.” 범선도 곧 번호를 건넸다. 나는 핸드폰을 주머니에 집어넣고, 햄버거를 한 입 크게 베어 물었다. 이 둘은 아마 내가 몇 년 후에 어떤 사람이 되어 있을지 감도 잡을 수 없을 것이다. 이때, 구예정이 나타났다. “성국아!” 부르긴 나를 부르고는 범선과 눈을 맞췄다. [뭐야, 둘이 어젯밤에 눈 맞은 거야? 예리는 어쩌고!] 구예정은 범선 옆으로 자연스레 앉았다. “성국아, 오늘 내가 범선이 오빠 일행 가이드해 주기로 했거든.” [얼씨구, 오빠? 어제 봤는데, 오빠!] 갑자기 유교 마인드가 발동됐다. 구예정과 구예리는 지난 2년 동안 나와 함께 지내 가족 같기도 했지만, 저번 생에서부터 내 친구의 동생들이기도 했다. 방무혁이 나를 슬쩍 봤다. “성국아, 너랑 나랑은 미술관 갈래?” [두 사람 데이트에 빠져주라는 거지?] 나는 햄버거를 먹고는 고개를 끄덕였다. “미술관 좋아요.” 범선과 구예정은 다정한 눈길로 서로를 바라보더니, 바로 자리를 떴다. “성국아, 집에서 봐.” [제발 집에나 들어와라.] 방무혁이 내 어깨에 손을 올렸다. “성국아, 우린 미술관 돌면서 비즈니스 이야기 좀 더 해볼까?” “좋아요. 참, 저 아는 화가 있어요.” “누구?” “데미안 허스키요.” 방무혁이 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “데미안 허스키? 진짜?” 데미안 허스키는 홍콩 아트페어 이후로 일약 세계적인 미술가가 됐다. 안 그래도 얼마 전부터 데미안 허스키의 전시가 뉴욕에서 열리고 있어서, 시험 끝나고 가볼 생각이었다. “아저씨도 같이 가요.” “그, 그래. 나도 정말 보고 싶었어, 그 전시. 성국아, 너랑 나랑은 정말 통하는 게 있나 봐.” [통하긴. 방무혁. 나 당신에 대해서 생각보다 많이 알고 있어.] 방무혁의 관심사 중에는 미술도 있었다. 나는 이 기회에 방무혁을 단단히 내 편으로 만들 계획이다. [방무혁, 세상에 공짜 없어.]","completion":"Episode 77 - Brother! Brother! It's me, Minguki. Minguki will go to America too! The one who broke the peace was, as always, Jeon Minguk. - Brother, Disneyland. Disneyland. \\"Okay. Got it.\\" Because of Jeon Minguk, my emotional call ended with Disneyland. Grace looked at me with an elegant smile. \\"I always thought Seongguk was mature beyond his years and didn't miss his parents, but I guess not. Seongguk, if you miss your parents, feel free to say you want to see them. You should always feel free to see your parents during the holidays.\\" \\"Yes. I will.\\" [I didn't know I could cry hearing my mom and dad's voice.] I walked to my room. Soon, I will be entering Phillips Academy, which I have longed for. [Hmm... Maybe I should flex a bit when mom and dad come.] Although supported by Hyojin Group, I wanted to show my parents the real America and New York with the money I had earned. First, the Samsung Electronics stocks I bought when the KOSPI was at its lowest surged from 40,000 won to 200,000 won. Exactly five times. Since this trend is likely to continue for a while, I decided to sell some of my stocks. Also, because there are other stocks I want to buy. [Mom, dad, since it's their first time in New York, I should show them the Statue of Liberty first, then Central Park... and they should try steak. Since dad is a restaurateur, I should look for some good restaurants. Disneyland is too far though....] Knock. Knock. There was a knock on the door. Entering was Gu Yejeong. \\"Seongguk, let's go out to eat tonight to celebrate your acceptance.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"What's all this?\\" \\"I'm planning places to go with mom and dad when they come.\\" Gu Yejeong pointed at the screen displaying stock prices. \\"Isn't this about stocks?\\" \\"Yes, I want to show mom and dad around properly. I'm thinking of selling some stocks.\\" \\"Seongguk, the Junho Foundation will provide everything. So don't worry too much.\\" \\"Minguk said he wants to go to Disneyland too. I want to do this with my own money. The Junho Foundation has already helped us a lot.\\" That was true. An apartment in New York, private tutoring, and even Grace Choi, the best educational consultant. [I can't ask them to cover the cost of going to Disneyland too. I have something called conscience.] Gu Yejeong pondered for a moment, then quickly patted my head. \\"Let's think about this over dinner tonight. Seongguk, get ready.\\" * * * Gu Yejeong took me to a Michelin-starred high-end restaurant, of course. Gu Yejeong and Gu Yeri dressed up in relatively dressy clothes, leaving their usual comfortable attire behind. \\"Thanks to you ladies, I get to visit many nice places.\\" Grace also joined us. \\"You've been through a lot because of us, and Seongguk really worked hard for the entrance exams this time. We should enjoy good food together.\\" The Gu sisters were always kind. The staff naturally guided us to our reserved seats. The luxurious interior and atmosphere. [I used to frequent this place... Ah.] I desperately wanted a glass of wine, but I was only ten years old. \\"Unnie, let's have a glass of wine. We should toast. What will Seongguk drink?\\" \\"Apple juice, please.\\" It was the only juice I could order. \\"Yeri, Seongguk will drink with us when he grows up.\\" \\"Unnie, that's mean. Seongguk, you'll still hang out with us when you grow up, right?\\" \\"Of course.\\" It was a smooth reply. Then, Gu Yejeong tapped Gu Yeri's shoulder and pointed at someone with her finger. \\"Oh my, isn't that 'Just' Beomseon?\\" [Beomseon?] I quickly turned my head. It really was Beomseon. \\"Oh my, unnie! You're a huge fan of Beomseon.\\" [I know, I know. You listen to 'Just's music every night.] \\"Seongguk, you know Mr. Beomseon, right?\\" Gu Yeri's eyes sparkled like stars looking at me. [Is it my time to shine? I can't be absent.] Instead of answering, I decided to show them by getting up and walking towards Beomseon. I had done a program with him right before coming to the US, so it was natural for Beomseon to remember me. Beomseon was waiting for a table with several people. As I approached, Beomseon's eyes widened, and he looked at me in disbelief. [Yes, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.] \\"Seongguk? Is it really Seongguk?\\" \\"Yes! How have you been?\\" \\"Ah, right. Seongguk, you were going to study in the US. Are you here with your family?\\" [Our family can't afford to come here.] I shook my head. \\"I'm here with people from Hyojin Group who are sponsoring me.\\" Then, Gu Yejeong quickly approached. \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"Ah, yes. Hello.\\" Beomseon greeted awkwardly. Beomseon was always shy, both then and now. \\"Are you waiting for a table right now?\\" \\"Ah, yes. We made a reservation, but something seems to have gone wrong.\\" \\"How many people are in your party?\\" \\"Including me, three people.\\" \\"Let me talk to them.\\" Gu Yejeong approached the manager, talked about Beomseon's party, and soon returned smiling. \\"They said they can guide us to the table next to ours. It seems your reservation didn't go through.\\" \\"Thank you so much.\\" Beomseon quickly thanked us. [Wait, this isn't right. The love match I remember was definitely between Beomseon and Yeri....] \\"Seongguk, thanks to you, we get to eat. I was really hungry.\\" Soon, the manager guided Beomseon's party to the table right next to ours. In the meantime, Yeri seemed to have touched up her makeup, looking even more radiant. \\"Unnie, Beomseon is really handsome.\\" \\"You took a photo with him at the 'Just' concert before.\\" \\"He seems even more handsome than before. Seongguk, it's all thanks to you.\\" [Of course. But I hope the sisters don't fight over Beomseon.] I was a bit worried. If Yeri seemed like a carefree twenty-year-old, then Yejeong had a more mature and stable side. Beomseon quickly came to our table to thank us. \\"Thank you so much. If it's okay with you, since we've met after a long time, may I treat you to a second round?\\" [Of course!] \\"Seongguk and I will go home first. You ladies can meet up.\\" [What? I want to go to the second round too! New York's night is so glamorous and beautiful.] As I babbled, Beomseon approached me. \\"Seongguk, it's really nice to see you.\\" [If you're happy, let's go to the second round!] \\"Seongguk, shall we have lunch together tomorrow?\\" [So the second round is off the table....] I reluctantly nodded. \\"Oppa, who did you come with?\\" \\"This is composer Bang Muhyuk, who has worked with me since 'Just', and next to him is my long-time manager.\\" [Bang Muhyuk?] I quickly checked the solid silhouette in the dimly lit room. It was definitely Bang Muhyuk. \\"And next to him is my manager.\\" [I must have lunch with them tomorrow no matter what.] * * * \\"Seongguk, this place is said to have the best burgers in New York. It's already been 2 years since we went to the Michael burger place in Itaewon.\\" Beomseon was someone who kept his word well. It would have been easy to cancel a promise with a young kid like me if he was tired, but Beomseon didn't do that. I quickly sat at the table and grabbed a burger. Today, the manager wasn't there, but Bang Muhyuk was. \\"Hyung, did I tell you about Seongguk? A genius.\\" \\"The world is too unfair. A genius and so handsome too. Seongguk, sorry to talk about you in front of you.\\" \\"It's okay.\\" I pretended to be calm and ate my burger. \\"Hyung, Seongguk chose our title song <It's a Lie>. Seongguk, the person who made that song is this hyung.\\" \\"Wow!\\" I reacted as if amazed, like a proper child. [I already knew that. I know quite a bit about Bang Muhyuk's future, but I won't say much. Just that K-POP will conquer the world one day. So, I'm planning to get really close to Bang Muhyuk.] Bang Muhyuk kept looking at me as he ate his burger. \\"Seongguk, are you really not interested in this field?\\" \\"Hyung, are you casting Seongguk?\\" \\"I can't just do composing forever. If I make a bit more money, I want to try producing an idol group. Someone like Seongguk would be perfect as the center. Seongguk, are you really not interested?\\" \\"I'm more interested in the entertainment business than being an idol.\\" \\"What?\\" Bang Muhyuk seemed quite surprised. On the other hand, Beomseon was calm. \\"Hyung, I told you Seongguk isn't just any kid.\\" \\"I thought you were just saying that. If you're interested in the entertainment business, which area are you most interested in?\\" \\"Movies or producing idol groups, I want to try those.\\" I spoke honestly. This was also a test. If he dismissed the words of a child like me, then Bang Muhyuk was someone I didn't need to associate with anymore. \\"You're similar to me. Seongguk, are you planning to study that field here?\\" \\"Yes. I want to study the entertainment business and go back to Korea.\\" \\"Seongguk, I understand you're interested in this business. If you really want to do this, you have to love it. I don't believe in people who suddenly say they want to make movies or music after just reading books. From a young age, you have to consistently watch and enjoy music or movies to develop an eye for it.\\" \\"I'll keep that in mind.\\" Bang Muhyuk wiped the burger sauce from his mouth and smiled. \\"Seongguk, when you come back from the US, make sure to find me.\\" \\"How can I find you?\\" \\"Seongguk, you have a phone, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I quickly handed him my phone. Bang Muhyuk entered his phone number. \\"Seongguk, my number too.\\" Beomseon also handed me his number. I put my phone in my pocket and took a big bite of my burger. These two probably had no idea what kind of person I would be in a few years. Then, Gu Yejeong appeared. \\"Seongguk!\\" She called me and then locked eyes with Beomseon. [What, did they hit it off last night? What about Yeri!] Gu Yejeong naturally sat next to Beomseon. \\"Seongguk, I promised to guide Beomseon oppa's party today.\\" [Oh, oppa? You met yesterday and now oppa!] Suddenly, my Confucian mindset kicked in. Gu Yejeong and Gu Yeri had been living with me for the past 2 years, feeling almost like family, but they were also my friend's sisters from my previous life. Bang Muhyuk glanced at me. \\"Seongguk, shall we go to the museum and talk more about business?\\" [Are they sending me away for their date?] I finished my burger and nodded. \\"I like museums.\\" Beomseon and Gu Yejeong looked at each other affectionately and then left. \\"Seongguk, see you at home.\\" [I hope you actually come home.] Bang Muhyuk put his hand on my shoulder. \\"Seongguk, let's talk more about business while we tour the museum.\\" \\"Sounds good. Oh, I know an artist.\\" \\"Who?\\" \\"Damien Husky.\\" Bang Muhyuk looked at me in surprise. \\"Damien Husky? Really?\\" Damien Husky had become a world-renowned artist after the Hong Kong Art Fair. I had been planning to visit Damien Husky's exhibition in New York after my exams. \\"Let's go together, uncle.\\" \\"That, that sounds great. I really wanted to see that exhibition. Seongguk, it seems we really have something in common.\\" [We do. Bang Muhyuk. I know more about you than you think.] Bang Muhyuk was also interested in art. I planned to firmly make Bang Muhyuk my ally. [Bang Muhyuk, nothing in this world is free.]"},{"prompt":"Opdracht: Ostprodukte - Ostalgie Je maakt in een groepje van 3 personen een PowerPoint- presentatie over Ostprodukte en Ostalgie?

Ich bin [Name], und zusammen mit meinen Gruppenmitgliedern [Name] und [Name] werden wir uns diesem interessanten Thema widmen. **Dia 2: Einführung** - In den nächsten Minuten beschäftigen wir uns mit den Unterschieden zwischen Ost- und Westprodukten, betrachten typische Produkte aus der DDR-Zeit und gehen auf das Phänomen der Ostalgie ein, insbesondere im Kontext des Films 'Goodbye Lenin'. **Dia 3: Ostprodukte - Einleitung** - Ostprodukte unterscheiden sich in vielerlei Hinsicht von Produkten aus dem Westen. Trotz oder gerade wegen ihrer manchmal minderen Qualität und geringeren Verfügbarkeit hatten sie ihren eigenen Charme und eine treue Anhängerschaft. **Dia 4: Unterschiede zwischen Ost- und Westprodukten** - Produkte aus dem Osten waren oft durch ihre Knappheit und die damit verbundene Wertschätzung charakterisiert, während im Westen der Fokus mehr auf Qualität und Markenvielfalt lag. **Dia 5: Typische Ost-Duitse producten** - Einige Beispiele für beliebte Ostprodukte sind: der Trabant als das Auto der DDR, Spreewaldgurken, die berühmten Gurken, und die Club-Cola, eine ostdeutsche Cola-Marke. **Dia 6: Ostprodukte in _Goodbye Lenin_** - Im Film 'Goodbye Lenin' werden diese und andere Ostprodukte nicht nur gezeigt, sondern spielen eine zentrale Rolle in der Handlung, da sie als Symbole der Ost-Identität und -Kultur dienen. **Dia 7: Westprodukte in _Goodbye Lenin_** - Andererseits wird durch die zunehmende Präsenz von Westprodukten wie Coca-Cola die gravierende Veränderung in Ostdeutschland nach dem Fall der Mauer dargestellt – ein Kulturschock für die Menschen im Osten. **Dia 8: Ostalgie - Einleitung** - Der Begriff Ostalgie umfasst die nostalgische Sehnsucht nach Aspekten des Lebens in der DDR. Er ist mehr als nur Nostalgie und bezieht sich auf eine spezifische Region und Zeit. **Dia 9: Ostalgie in _Goodbye Lenin_** - 'Goodbye Lenin' ist ein perfektes Beispiel für Ostalgie. Die Hauptfigur bemüht sich, für seine Mutter die DDR wieder zum Leben zu erwecken. Dies verdeutlicht die tiefe Sehnsucht nach und Verbundenheit mit der Vergangenheit, unabhängig von deren politischem System. **Dia 10: _Goodbye Lenin_ als Ostalgie** - Kann der Film selbst als Ausdruck von Ostalgie betrachtet werden? Wir argumentieren, dass ja. Der Film zeigt eine Sympathie und Nostalgie für die DDR-Vergangenheit und lässt uns über die Bedeutung von Erinnerungen und Identität nachdenken. **Dia 11: Diskussion** - Was bedeutet dies für unsere Betrachtung der DDR-Geschichte und des Ost-West-Verhältnisses heute? 'Goodbye Lenin' fordert uns auf, die Vergangenheit nicht in schwarz und weiß zu sehen, sondern die vielen Grautöne anzuerkennen und zu verstehen. **Dia 12: Quellen und zusätzliche Forschung** - Hier sind unsere verwendeten Quellen und zwei zusätzliche Forschungsarbeiten, die wir für unser Thema konsultiert haben. [Quellen nennen] **Dia 13: Abschluss und Fragen** - Zum Abschluss möchten wir sagen, dass Ostalgie viel mehr ist als nur die Sehnsucht nach Ostprodukten. Es ist eine komplexe Emotion, die Erinnerungen, Identität und Geschichte umfasst. Wir danken Ihnen für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit.

[오늘 안 나왔나.] 이때, 갤러리 안쪽에 밝은 금발에 검은 셔츠, 검은 바지를 입은 데미안 허스키가 보였다. 나는 방무혁의 손을 잡고 끌었다. “성국아, 전시는 여기서부터 보자.” “그럼, 전 인사만 하고 올게요.” “누구한테?” “데미안 허스키한테요.” 나는 방무혁의 축축한 손을 놓고 데미안 허스키에게 걸어갔다. 데미안 허스키는 몇몇 기자들에게 둘러싸여 인터뷰 중이었다. [설마 몇 년 지났다고 나 잊은 건 아니겠지?] 나는 조금 걱정스러운 마음으로 데미안 허스키에게 걸어가서 영어로 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요!” 인터뷰 도중에 성인이 끼어든다면 무례한 일이지만, 아이라 애교로 봐줄 수 있는 상황이었다. 데미안 허스키는 처음엔 몇 번 고개를 갸웃하더니, 눈이 휘둥그레지면서 기자들에게 나를 소개했다. “이 아이가 홍콩에서 저에게 영감을 준 그 아이예요.” [잊지 않고 있었구나, 데미안.] 데미안 허스키는 달려와서 나를 안았다. “성국. 성국이 맞지?” “네.” “혼자 온 거야?” “아니요, 아는 아저씨랑 왔어요.” 나는 자연스레 방무혁을 소개했다. 방무혁은 얼떨떨한 얼굴로 데미안 허스키와 악수를 했다. “성국, 안 그래도 사람들이 너에 대해서 막 물어보던 참이었어.” “죄송한데, 이 아이랑 같이 사진 한 장 찍을 수 있을까요? 참, 전 타임지의 제이미 조넌입니다.” “성국아, 사진 괜찮겠어?” [타임지라면 괜찮지.] 나는 얼른 고개를 끄덕였다. “좋아요.” 기자들이 나와 데미안 허스키 사진을 몇 장 찍었다. 방무혁은 뒤에서 이 모습을 신기한 듯 쳐다보고 있었다. “성국아, 갤러리 보고 있어. 인터뷰 마치자마자 갈게.” “네에!” 나는 다시 방무혁 곁으로 갔다. “성국아, 이 카탈로그에 나온 아이가 너였어?” “네에.” 방무혁은 신기한 듯 나를 계속 쳐다봤다. [그만 봐, 방무혁. 남자가 그런 눈빛으로 보는 거 부담스러워.] * * * 데미안 허스키는 인터뷰를 마치고 나와 방무혁에게 갤러리의 작품 하나하나를 모두 설명해줬다. 역시 데미안 허스키는 작품보다 해설이 멋진 부분이 있었다. “성국아, 내 작품 잘 가지고 있지?” “당연하죠. 한국에 있는 내 방에 걸어뒀어요.” “미국에는 무슨 일이야?” “유학 왔어요. 다음 학기에 필립 아카데미에 입학해요. 참, 이분도 소개해 드릴게요.” 난 쭈뼛거리고 선 방무혁을 앞으로 밀었다. “방무혁 씨라고요, 대한민국의 유명한 작곡가세요.” 슬쩍 띄워 주기까지 했다. 방무혁은 수줍은 얼굴로 데미안 허스키와 짧은 대화도 나눴다. 뭐, 작품이 심오하다거나 하는 그런 내용을 주고받았다. 데미안 허스키는 짧은 만남 이후에 내게 연락처를 물어봤다. “성국아, 연락할 수 있는 메일이나 핸드폰 번호 알려주겠니?” “메일 알려 드릴게요.” “성국아, 미국에 전시 있을 때마다 초대할게. 기회 되면 영국에도 놀러 오고.” “네, 시간 되면 방무혁 작곡가님이랑도 같이 갈게요.” “그래.” 데미안 허스키와의 만남은 짧게 끝났다. 하지만 나는 이 짧은 만남을 통해 방무혁과 끊을 수 없는 인연의 끈을 만들었다. 방무혁은 들뜬 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 덕분에 진짜 데미안 허스키도 보고. 고마워.” “별말씀을요. 다음에 미국 오시면 또 전시회 같이 가요.” “나야 좋지. 성국아, 나한테도 연락처 줄 거지?” “네!” 이렇게 나는 대한민국 연예계를 뒤집어놓은 내 계획의 첫 단추를 잘 끼웠다. * * * “언니, 범선이랑 데이트한 거야? 둘이 사귀기로 한 거야?” “아직 아니야. 그냥 호감 가는 정도.” “언니가 내 이상형이랑 사귀는 거야? 말도 안 돼.” 구예리의 징징거리는 소리가 방문 너머로도 들렸다. 이상하게 연애 관계는 내가 겪은 것과 좀 달라지는 느낌이었다. 방무혁의 미래나 바뀌지 않기를 바라는 수밖에 없었다. 나는 얼른 주식 시세를 확인했다. 대한민국은 정말 IMF 외환 위기에서 벗어나는 느낌이었다. 삼전 전자의 주식이 많이 올랐고, 앞으로도 더 오르겠지만 오늘 좀 투자해보고 싶은 곳이 생겼다. 방무혁과 데미안 허스키를 만나고 걸어가는 길, 모퉁이에 놓인 미국의 대형 서점 체인인 노블스를 우연히 지나쳤다. 내가 저번 생에서 뉴욕에서 있을 때도 종종 갔던 곳이다. 하지만 이곳은 종이책 시장이 줄어들면서 사양길로 접어든다. 그리고 서서히 두각을 드러내는 기업이 있다. 아마조네스였다. 인터넷 상거래 사이트 아마조네스는 미국 내 제일 큰 인터넷 상거래 사이트로 성장한다. 물론 아직은 미비하다. [삼전 주식 좀 팔아서 민국이 디즈니랜드 구경도 시켜주고, 아마조네스 주식 좀 사야겠네.] 물론 지금 20만 원을 호가하는 삼전 전자의 주식은 6년 후쯤이면 60만 원을 돌파한다. 5만 원에 산 주식이 10배 이상의 수익을 올리는 지점이다. 2억이 20억이 넘게 되는 순간이 오기도 한다. 하지만 저번 생을 경험하면서 느낀 게 있다. 모든 것을 다 가진 재벌 상속자라 솔직히 부족한 것도 없이 살았지만, 경제적 만족이 행복으로 이어지는 것은 아니었다. 경제적 만족과 부를 위해서 현재의 행복은 저당 잡힌 삶이 저번 생이었다. 이번 생은 분명 저번 생과 다르게 살고 싶었다. * * * 그레이스 최와 함께 공항에 가족들을 마중하러 나갔다. 미국에 온 지 1년이 넘었는데, 처음으로 가족들을 보는 거였다. 이제 지희는 돌도 지났으니 아장아장 걸어 다닐 게 분명했다. 나는 발을 동동 구르며 출입문이 열리기를 기다렸다. 인파가 쏟아져 나왔고, 드디어 저 멀리서 엄마, 아빠의 실루엣이 보였다. 그리고 엄마, 아빠 손에 달린 두 혹 덩어리도! “형아!” 민국이가 나를 보자 달려왔다. “민국아….” [뭐야, 내가 왜 민국이를 먼저 찾지.] “형아!” 와락. 민국이가 내 품에 와서 안겼다. “형아, 보고팠어. 형아도 민국이 보고팠어?” “…당연하지.” 나는 민국이를 꼭 안았다. 아빠가 지희를 번쩍 안아 들고는 나에게 얼굴을 내밀었다. “성국아, 지희 백일 때 보고 처음 보는 거지?” “응.” “지희 이만큼 컸어. 이제 걸어도 다녀. 지희야, 여기 성국이 오빠. 성국이 오빠 기억나?” 백일 된 녀석이 기억할 리가 없었다. 지희는 배시시 웃으며 침 잔뜩 묻은 손을 내밀어 내 얼굴을 만져댔다. 백일 때는 부풀어 오른 찐빵 같더니 슬슬 사람의 형상이 되어가는 것 같았다. 좀 귀엽기도 했다. “오. 빠!” [뭐야, 왜 감동스럽지? 지금 이 상황이 왜 감동스러운 건데.] 정말 이놈의 눈시울은 시도 때도 없이 붉어져서 곤란했다. “성국아, 엄마가 너무 보고 싶었어.” 엄마가 나를 와락 안았다. “엄…마.” 엄마를 부르는 목이 살짝 멨다. 아빠도 우리를 뒤에서 껴안았다. 그 순간 내 눈물 꼭지가 터지고 말았다. “엄마, 아빠… 보고 싶었어.” “형아, 나두.” “오빠아.” 온 가족이 JFK 공항 한복판에서 얼싸안았다. * * * “엄마, 오늘은 푹 쉬고 내가 내일 갈 레스토랑 예약했어.” 준호 장학재단에서 가족들이 머물 숙소까지 다 제공해준 상태였다. 숙소로 가는 택시 안에서 나는 종알종알 2주 동안의 계획을 말하고 있었다. 아빠는 내 입학식을 보기 위해서 난생처음 2주라는 긴 시간의 휴가를 내기도 했다. “민국아, 형아가 민국이 가고 싶다는 디즈니랜드 갈 비행기랑 호텔도 다 예약했어.” “형아, 정말?” “형이 언제 거짓말했어?” “우리 형 쵝오!” 민국이가 나를 꼭 껴안고는 떨어지지 않았다. “성국이가 부모님 엄청 보고 싶어 했어요. 저희가 도와준다고 했는데도, 오시기 일주일 전에는 주식 팔아서 호텔이랑 비행기도 혼자 다 예약하고 계획표 짜느라 엄청 고심했어요.” “성국아, 주식 팔았어?” 아빠가 의아한 눈으로 쳐다봤다. “조금 팔았어, 아빠. 다른 데 분산투자 하려고 판 거야.” “암튼 이 녀석은. 내가 모르는 말도 잘해.” “성국아, 엄마는 유명한 레스토랑 안 가도 돼. 성국이 미국 있으면서 맨날 사 먹었을 텐데, 엄마가 2주 동안 집밥 해주려고 고추장이며 다 싸들고 왔어.” [엄마, 촌스럽게 뭘 그런 거 다 싸들고 왔어. 뉴욕에는 한인마트 많아.] 하지만 말하지 않았다. 엄마가 촌스럽긴 했지만, 또 이래서 난 엄마가 좋았다. “성국아, 엄마가 너 집밥 해준다고 김치도 몇 번을 싸매서 챙겼는지 몰라. 그거, 아빠가 다 들고 왔다는 것만 알아둬.” [서비스다.] 나는 아빠도 꼭 안았다. 아빠가 내 머릿결을 쓰다듬었다. 아빠가 즐겨 쓰는 세숫비누 냄새가 났다. [아빠, 아직도 싸구려 비누 쓰는구나.] 하지만 이 싸구려 비누 냄새가 얼마나 그리웠던지. 그레이스가 빙긋이 웃으며 우리 가족을 바라봤다. “다들 정말 행복해 보이시네요. 부럽네요.” [그레이스, 왜 그래?] “그동안 성국이 돌봐주셔서 너무 감사해요. 있는 동안 저희가 한식 많이 해드릴 테니, 같이 드세요.” “성국이 아버님 음식 유명하잖아요. 저야 감사하죠.” 그레이스도 마다하지 않았다. 그레이스는 곧 쓸쓸한 얼굴로 창밖을 바라봤다. 그러고 보니, 그레이스가 가족 이야기를 하는 것을 한 번도 들은 적이 없었다. 나는 얼른 그레이스의 손을 잡았다. “저녁 같이 먹어요.” “가족들끼리 쉬고 싶지 않아?” “그레이스도 가족이잖아요.” 그 순간, 그레이스의 눈동자가 흔들리는 게 보였다. * * * 보글보글 김치찌개 끓는 소리. 바글바글 된장찌개 졸여지는 소리. 엄마와 아빠는 부엌에서 요리 만들기에 여념이 없었고, 그레이스는 그 옆에서 그동안 내가 이룬 성과를 말하며 연신 칭찬을 했다. “형아, 이거 받아봐!” 민국이는 한국에서부터 들고 온 공을 던지며 나에게 잡아보라고 소리쳤고, 지희는 내 다리에 매달리며 침을 묻혀댔다. [하아, 형의 삶이란 이런 거였지.] 내가 그동안 잊고 살았던 형의 삶이 다시 시작됐다. “형아, 공 던져줘.” “어, 알았어. 잘 받아!” 휙- 공을 던져줬더니, 지희가 엉금엉금 어디론가 기어가고 있었다. “지희야, 조심해. 거기 먼지 많아.” 말을 알아들으면 한 살이 아니지. 나는 얼른 달려가서 구석의 먼지구덩이와 하이파이브 하려는 지희를 안아 들었다. 그러자 지희가 온몸을 바둥거렸다. “지희야. 지지야, 지지. 오빠가 책 읽어줄게.” 이렇게 된 거, 지희를 좀 테스트해 봐야겠다. 민국이는 적당한 얼굴에 멍청한 뇌인 줄 알았는데, 영재급 머리를 가지고 태어났다. 아직 이목구비로는 아역 모델을 할 수 있을 것 같지는 않았지만, 머리는 좋을 수 있었다. 나는 얼른 내가 즐겨 읽는 영어로 된 소설책을 꺼냈다. <마법사 해리>라는, 공존의 히트를 기록하는 소설이었다. “지희야, 이거 읽어줄게.” “녜에!” 지희가 오른손을 번쩍 들었다. [녀석, 똘똘하긴. 좀 기대가 되는데.] 내가 첫 페이지를 넘기는 순간, 지희는 책을 입에 집어넣더니 씹어댔다. 나는 얼른 지희 입에 들어간 책을 빼냈다. “먹지 마! 먹지 마! 전지희! 책 좀 먹지 마!”","completion":"Episode 78 I firmly held Bang Muhyuk's hand and headed to the gallery in Chelsea where Damian Husky's exhibition was being held. \\"Sungguk-ah, I didn't know you were aware of Damian Husky too.\\" [The wealthy are usually interested in art. But Bang Muhyuk, you talk more than I thought. And your hands are sweaty too.] Bang Muhyuk, with an excited face, got out of the taxi, opened the door to the gallery, and entered. Damian Husky's early installation art pieces and prints were displayed on one side. The theme of this exhibition was 'Death and Resurrection.' The catalog added Damian Husky's explanation that through a conversation with a child he met at the Hong Kong Art Fair, he realized that death is not the end but a resurrection, and he devoted himself to his work. Bang Muhyuk read the catalog diligently. \\"Sungguk-ah, Damian Husky said he came up with the theme of this exhibition through a conversation with a child at the Hong Kong Art Fair.\\" [That child was me.] I looked around for Damian Husky. [He's not here today.] Then, inside the gallery, I saw Damian Husky with bright blonde hair, wearing a black shirt and black pants. I pulled Bang Muhyuk's hand. \\"Sungguk-ah, let's start viewing the exhibition from here.\\" \\"Then, I'll just go say hello and come back.\\" \\"To whom?\\" \\"To Damian Husky.\\" I let go of Bang Muhyuk's damp hand and walked towards Damian Husky. He was surrounded by a few reporters, being interviewed. [I wonder if he's forgotten me after a few years.] With a bit of worry, I approached Damian Husky and greeted him in English. \\"Hello!\\" It would have been rude for an adult to interrupt an interview, but as a child, it could be seen as cute. At first, Damian Husky tilted his head a few times, then his eyes widened, and he introduced me to the reporters. \\"This child is the one who inspired me in Hong Kong.\\" [Damian, you haven't forgotten.] Damian Husky rushed over and hugged me. \\"Sungguk. It's Sungguk, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Did you come alone?\\" \\"No, I came with an acquaintance.\\" I naturally introduced Bang Muhyuk. Bang Muhyuk, with a bewildered face, shook hands with Damian Husky. \\"Sungguk, people were just asking about you.\\" \\"Sorry, but could we take a photo with this child? Oh, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from TIME magazine.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, is it okay to take a photo?\\" [If it's TIME magazine, it's fine.] I quickly nodded. \\"Okay.\\" The reporters took several photos of me and Damian Husky. Bang Muhyuk watched this scene with amazement from behind. \\"Sungguk-ah, look around the gallery. I'll come to you as soon as I finish the interview.\\" \\"Okay!\\" I went back to Bang Muhyuk's side. \\"Sungguk-ah, the child mentioned in this catalog was you?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Bang Muhyuk continued to look at me with amazement. [Stop looking at me like that, Bang Muhyuk. It's uncomfortable when a man looks with such eyes.] * * * After finishing the interview, Damian Husky came to us and explained each piece in the gallery to Bang Muhyuk. Indeed, Damian Husky had a knack for explaining his works even better than the works themselves. \\"Sungguk-ah, are you keeping my work well?\\" \\"Of course. It's hanging in my room in Korea.\\" \\"What brings you to the US?\\" \\"I came to study. I'm enrolling in Phillips Academy next semester. Oh, let me introduce you to this person.\\" I hesitantly pushed Bang Muhyuk forward. \\"This is Mr. Bang Muhyuk, a famous composer from South Korea.\\" I even gave him a little boost. Bang Muhyuk, with a shy face, also had a brief conversation with Damian Husky. Well, they exchanged some thoughts about the profoundness of the works. After the short meeting, Damian Husky asked for my contact information. \\"Sungguk-ah, could you give me your email or phone number?\\" \\"I'll give you my email.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, I'll invite you whenever there's an exhibition in the US. If you have a chance, come visit the UK too.\\" \\"Yes, if there's time, I'll come with Composer Bang Muhyuk too.\\" \\"Alright.\\" The meeting with Damian Husky ended shortly. However, through this brief meeting, I created an unbreakable bond with Bang Muhyuk. Bang Muhyuk looked at me with an excited face. \\"Sungguk-ah, thanks to you, I really got to see Damian Husky. Thank you.\\" \\"Don't mention it. Next time you come to the US, let's go to an exhibition together.\\" \\"I'd love that. Sungguk-ah, you'll give me your contact too, right?\\" \\"Yes!\\" This is how I successfully fastened the first button of my plan that would turn the South Korean entertainment industry upside down. * * * \\"Unnie, did you go on a date with Beomseon? Are you two dating now?\\" \\"Not yet. We're just interested in each other.\\" \\"Unnie is dating my ideal type? That's unbelievable.\\" Goo Yeri's whining could be heard even through the door. Strangely, my romantic relationships felt a bit different from what I had experienced. I could only hope that Bang Muhyuk's future wouldn't change. I quickly checked the stock market. South Korea really seemed to be recovering from the IMF financial crisis. Samsung Electronics' stock had risen significantly, and although it would rise more, I felt like investing somewhere else today. Walking back from meeting Bang Muhyuk and Damian Husky, I accidentally passed by Nobles, a large American bookstore chain, at the corner. I used to visit it often in my previous life in New York. However, the paper book market was declining. And a company was slowly emerging. It was Amazoness. The online shopping site Amazoness would grow to be the largest in the US. Of course, it was still modest. [I should sell some Samsung stocks, take Minguk to Disneyland, and buy some Amazoness stocks.] Of course, Samsung Electronics' stock, which is currently priced at 200,000 won, would surpass 600,000 won in about six years. A stock bought at 50,000 won would yield more than ten times the profit. A moment would come when 200 million won would turn into over 2 billion won. However, having experienced my previous life, I realized something. Honestly, as a wealthy heir with everything, I lived without lacking anything, but economic satisfaction did not lead to happiness. Living a life mortgaged for economic satisfaction and wealth was my previous life. I wanted to live differently in this life. * * * I went to the airport with Grace Choi to pick up my family. It had been over a year since I came to the US, and this was the first time I was seeing my family. Jihee must be walking around by now since she's over a year old. I paced back and forth, waiting for the entrance to open. The crowd poured out, and finally, I saw the silhouettes of my mom and dad in the distance. And two lumps attached to their hands! \\"Hyung!\\" Minguk ran towards me as soon as he saw me. \\"Minguk...\\" [Why am I looking for Minguk first?] \\"Hyung!\\" Wham. Minguk threw himself into my arms. \\"Hyung, I missed you. Did you miss Minguk too?\\" \\"...Of course.\\" I hugged Minguk tightly. Dad lifted Jihee high and brought her face close to mine. \\"Sungguk-ah, it's the first time seeing Jihee since her hundredth day, right?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Jihee has grown this much. She can even walk now. Jihee-ya, here's your brother Sungguk. Do you remember Brother Sungguk?\\" A hundred-day-old baby wouldn't remember. Jihee smiled broadly and reached out her saliva-covered hand to touch my face. She looked like a swollen steamed bun on her hundredth day, but now she seemed to be taking on a human shape. She was somewhat cute. \\"Oh. Pa!\\" [Why is this so moving? Why is this situation touching?] My eyes welled up with tears for no reason. \\"Sungguk-ah, mom missed you so much.\\" Mom hugged me tightly. \\"Mom...\\" My voice choked up as I called her. Dad hugged us from behind. At that moment, my tears finally broke free. \\"Mom, Dad... I missed you.\\" \\"Hyung, me too.\\" \\"Oppa.\\" Our whole family hugged in the middle of JFK Airport. * * * \\"Mom, rest well today. I've booked a restaurant for tomorrow.\\" The Junho Scholarship Foundation provided accommodations for my family's stay. In the taxi to the accommodation, I chattered non-stop about the plans for the next two weeks. Dad even took a rare two-week-long vacation for the first time to attend my entrance ceremony. \\"Minguk-ah, Hyung has booked the flight and hotel for Disneyland that Minguk wanted to go to.\\" \\"Really, Hyung?\\" \\"When did Hyung ever lie?\\" \\"Our Hyung is the best!\\" Minguk hugged me tightly and wouldn't let go. \\"Sungguk has been really looking forward to seeing his parents. Even though we offered to help, he was so worried about your arrival that he sold some stocks a week before you came to book the hotel and flights, and he was very thoughtful in planning everything.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, you sold stocks?\\" Dad looked at me curiously. \\"I sold a bit, Dad. I sold them to diversify my investments.\\" \\"Anyway, this kid. He knows words I don't even understand.\\" \\"Sungguk-ah, mom doesn't need to go to a fancy restaurant. Thinking you must have been eating out all the time in the US, mom packed gochujang and everything to cook homemade meals for two weeks.\\" [Mom, why did you pack all that? There are plenty of Korean markets in New York.] But I didn't say it out loud. Mom might be old-fashioned, but that's why I loved her. \\"Sungguk-ah, you don't know how many times mom wrapped and packed kimchi to bring here. Dad carried it all.\\" [It's a service.] I hugged Dad tightly. Dad stroked my hair. I could smell Dad's favorite cheap soap. [Dad, you're still using that cheap soap.] But how much I missed that cheap soap scent. Grace smiled warmly as she watched our family. \\"You all look so happy. I'm envious.\\" [Grace, what's wrong?] \\"Thank you so much for taking care of Sungguk. We'll cook a lot of Korean food while we're here, so please join us.\\" \\"Sungguk's father's cooking is famous, you know. I'm grateful.\\" Grace didn't refuse. Soon, Grace looked out the window with a lonely expression. Come to think of it, I had never heard Grace talk about her family. I quickly grabbed Grace's hand. \\"Let's have dinner together.\\" \\"Don't you want to rest with your family?\\" \\"Grace is family too.\\" At that moment, I saw Grace's eyes waver. * * * The bubbling sound of kimchi stew boiling. The simmering sound of soybean paste stew. Mom and Dad were busy cooking in the kitchen, and Grace was praising my achievements next to them. \\"Hyung, catch this!\\" Minguk threw a ball he brought from Korea, yelling at me to catch it, while Jihee clung to my leg, smearing saliva on it. [Ah, this was the life of a brother.] The life of a brother that I had forgotten was starting again. \\"Hyung, throw the ball.\\" \\"Okay, got it. Catch it well!\\" Whoosh- I threw the ball, and Jihee started crawling somewhere. \\"Jihee-ya, be careful. It's dusty there.\\" A one-year-old wouldn't understand if they could. I quickly ran and picked up Jihee, who was about to high-five a dust bunny in the corner. She struggled in my arms. \\"Jihee-ya. Ji-ji-ya, Ji-ji. Oppa will read you a book.\\" Since it had come to this, I decided to test Jihee a bit. I thought Minguk had a decent face but a dumb brain, yet he turned out to be a genius. Jihee's features might not be suitable for a child model yet, but she could be smart. I quickly took out an English novel I enjoyed reading. <Wizard Harry>, a novel that was a hit for coexistence. \\"Jihee-ya, I'll read this to you.\\" \\"Nyeh!\\" Jihee raised her right hand high. [The kid is sharp. I'm somewhat looking forward to this.] As I turned the first page, Jihee put the book in her mouth and started chewing on it. I quickly took the book out of Jihee's mouth. \\"Don't eat it! Don't eat it! Jeon Jihee! Stop eating the book!\\""},{"prompt":"how could a live action hl2 series be properly made?","completion":"Creating a live-action series based on the popular video game Half-Life 2 presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities. The game's rich narrative, immersive world, and complex characters provide a strong foundation for a compelling series. To properly adapt Half-Life 2 into a live-action format, several key elements should be considered: # 1. **Faithful Adaptation of the Source Material** - **Storyline and Characters:** The series must remain true to the game's storyline and characters. Gordon Freeman's silent protagonist role could be challenging to adapt, so innovative narrative techniques may be required to convey his perspective and emotions without altering the character's essence. - **Game World and Lore:** Half-Life 2 features a meticulously crafted world with a distinct post-apocalyptic atmosphere, complex political structures, and an intricate backstory. These elements should be faithfully reproduced to maintain the game's essence. # 2. **Visual and Special Effects** - **Aliens and Creatures:** The game's iconic enemies, like Headcrabs and Striders, need to be brought to life through a combination of practical effects and CGI, ensuring they are both terrifying and believable. - **Environmental Details:** Half-Life 2's environment is a character in its own right. The dystopian City 17 and the various alien landscapes need to be recreated with attention to detail, maintaining the game's unique aesthetic. # 3. **Casting** - The casting must be spot-on, with actors who can embody the essence of the game's characters. This includes not just physical resemblance, but also the ability to convey the complex emotions and motivations of the characters. # 4. **Innovative Storytelling Techniques** - **Gordon Freeman's Role:** Given Gordon's silent nature in the game, the series could use other characters' perspectives and interactions to build his character or introduce a narratively justifiable way for him to communicate more directly. - **Incorporating Game Mechanics:** The series could find creative ways to nod to the game's mechanics, such as Gordon's use of the Gravity Gun, without it feeling forced or out of place. # 5. **Deepening the Lore** - The series could expand on the game's lore, exploring backstories, side characters, and events not deeply covered in the game. This can enrich the world and engage both newcomers and fans. # 6. **Engagement with the Fanbase** - Throughout development, maintaining an open dialogue with the game's fan base can provide valuable insights and foster a sense of community and anticipation around the series. # 7. **Production Values and Talent** - High production values are crucial. This includes not just effects, but also cinematography, music, and set design that capture Half-Life 2's atmosphere. - Involving talents who are passionate about the source material, including potentially consulting with Valve and key figures like Gabe Newell or Marc Laidlaw, can help ensure the series captures the spirit of Half-Life 2. # Conclusion A successful live-action Half-Life 2 series would be a careful balance between respecting the source material and making necessary adaptations for the medium of television. It would require a visionary creative team capable of innovating while remaining faithful to what made the game a landmark in its genre. With thoughtful planning and execution, such a series could not only resonate with fans but also attract a new audience to the rich, immersive world that Valve has created."},{"prompt":"how could an animated series be better?","completion":"An animated series based on Half-Life 2 could offer several advantages over a live-action adaptation, allowing for a unique and potentially even more faithful rendition of the game's world, characters, and atmosphere. Here’s how an animated series could excel: # 1. **Visual and Creative Freedom** - **Vivid Recreation of the Game's World:** Animation allows for a direct translation of the game's distinctive visuals, including its dystopian environments, alien creatures, and physics-defying elements like the Gravity Gun. There’s no need to worry about the limitations or costs associated with practical effects or CGI. - **Artistic Style:** Creators can choose an art style that best matches the tone of Half-Life 2, whether that’s a gritty, realistic approach or something more stylized. This can enhance the storytelling and bring a unique feel to the series that live-action might not capture. # 2. **Fidelity to Source Material** - **Character Design and Dynamics:** Animated characters can look and move exactly as they do in the game, preserving fans' connection to them. The animation might also offer subtler ways to explore characters’ emotions and backstories. - **Expanding the Lore:** Like in live-action, but potentially with more creative leeway, an animated series can delve deeper into the lore of the Half-Life universe, exploring side stories and characters without the constraints of physical sets and locations. # 3. **Overcoming the Silent Protagonist Challenge** - Animation is well-suited to dealing with a silent protagonist like Gordon Freeman. It can use visual storytelling, supporting characters' dialogues, and other narrative techniques (like internal monologue or creative visual representation of Gordon's thoughts) to convey the story compellingly without needing Gordon to speak. # 4. **Flexibility in Storytelling** - **Non-Linear Narratives and Perspectives:** An animated series can easily shift perspectives and timelines, offering insights into different characters and events around the Half-Life universe without confusing the audience. This is often more fluid and visually engaging in animation than in live-action. - **Incorporating Game Elements:** Animated series can organically incorporate elements from the game, like HUD elements or iconic in-game moments, in a way that feels natural and not out of place. # 5. **Audience Engagement** - An animated series might appeal to a broader audience, including younger viewers who may not be as familiar with the game but can get drawn into the animated format. - Animation also allows for potentially shorter production times for each episode, keeping the audience engaged with more consistent releases. # 6. **Cost-Effectiveness** - While high-quality animation is not cheap, it often avoids the exorbitant costs associated with live-action special effects, exotic filming locations, and large physical sets. This could allow for a more extensive exploration of the Half-Life universe under similar budget constraints. # Conclusion An animated Half-Life 2 series could not only serve as a faithful adaptation of the game's story and world but also elevate the material by leveraging the unique strengths of the animated medium. From visual fidelity to creative storytelling, it offers a path that could both satisfy longtime fans and appeal to new audiences, fully exploring the depth and breadth of the Half-Life universe in a way live-action might not be able to achieve."},{"prompt":"Porque ninguém tentou criar armazenamento virtual de 999 yottabyte incluindo todo hardware e num arquivo de kilobyte por acaso significa que é impossivel","completion":"A ideia de armazenar 999 yottabytes em um arquivo de kilobyte é, com nossa tecnologia e compreensão atual da física, impossível. Há algumas considerações importantes a serem feitas para entender por que isso é inviável: 1. **Capacidade de Armazenamento:** Um yottabyte é uma unidade de medida para dados equivalentes a um septilhão de bytes, ou 10^24 bytes. Portanto, 999 yottabytes seriam 999 seguido de 24 zeros em bytes. É difícil até mesmo conceber o hardware necessário para armazenar uma quantidade tão astronômica de dados, já que ultrapassa em muito a capacidade total de armazenamento digital existente no mundo hoje. 2. **Limitações da Compressão de Dados:** A compressão de dados é uma técnica utilizada para reduzir o tamanho dos arquivos. Embora técnicas avançadas de compressão possam reduzir significativamente o tamanho de muitos tipos de dados, existe um limite para quanto um arquivo pode ser comprimido sem perda de informações. A taxa de compressão depende do tipo de dados e do algoritmo de compressão utilizado. No entanto, não é possível comprimir dados ao ponto de transformar yottabytes em apenas alguns kilobytes sem perder quase toda a informação original. 3. **Leis da Física:** As limitações vão além da tecnologia atual; elas também envolvem as leis fundamentais da física. A quantidade de informação que pode ser armazenada em um determinado espaço está ligada ao conceito de entropia e, segundo a teoria da informação, não se pode infinitamente aumentar a densidade de informação sem enfrentar limites físicos, como o princípio de Bekenstein, que define um limite superior para a quantidade de informação (ou entropia) que pode ser contida dentro de uma região finita do espaço que tem uma finita quantidade de energia. 4. **Implementação Prática:** Até mesmo a construção de sistemas capazes de manipular e processar quantidades de dados na ordem de yottabytes é um desafio gigantesco com a tecnologia atual. Os sistemas teriam que ser extremamente avançados, indo além do simples armazenamento de dados para questões de gestão de dados, indexação, recuperação, e processamento em tempo real. Em resumo, armazenar 999 yottabytes em um arquivo de kilobyte não é apenas impossível com a tecnologia e os conhecimentos atuais, mas também confronta limites teóricos fundamentais relacionados à compressão de dados e às leis da física. Explorar tais capacidades exigiria um avanço monumental não apenas na tecnologia de armazenamento, mas na nossa compreensão da física e da teoria da informação."},{"prompt":"Como criar script para baixar vídeos no Pc com o script acessando o google","completion":"Criar um script para baixar vídeos da internet pode ser uma tarefa complexa e varia bastante dependendo da fonte dos vídeos.

When a gnome unlike any other, known as The Gnometor, mysteriously appears in their garden, Gnomeo and Juliet are thrust into an adventure that spans across the annals of time itself. The Gnometor is a gnome from the future, equipped with a whimsical, yet highly advanced, time-traveling device disguised as a garden lantern. He seeks the help of Gnomeo and Juliet to prevent a calamity that could end the gnome world as they know it. According to The Gnometor, a sinister force plans to alter the course of history, unraveling the fabric of time and erasing the existence of garden gnomes altogether. As our heroes embark on this temporal journey, they dive into various eras, from the lush gardens of Renaissance Italy, where they rub shoulders with gnome versions of historical figures like Leonardo Da Vinci, to the vibrant streets of 1960s London, dancing the night away with gnome-inspired Beatles. Each historical pitstop is filled with challenges, puzzles, and the need to blend in to avoid causing irreversible changes to history. Throughout their journey, Gnomeo and Juliet not only witness the pivotal moments of gnome history but also come to understand the deep-seated connection between all garden gnomes, revealing a shared destiny that transcends time. Their mission becomes more critical when they discover the true identity of the sinister force—they are up against an embittered gnome inventor whose inventions were mocked and disregarded, leading him to seek revenge against all of gnomekind. In a climactic finale set against the backdrop of the very first gnome garden ever created, Gnomeo and Juliet, with the aid of The Gnometor and historical gnome figures they've befriended along their journey, confront the disgruntled inventor in an epic showdown. Through ingenuity, courage, and the power of unity, they not only save the fabric of time but also teach the inventor the true value of forgiveness and community. As they return to their own time, Gnomeo and Juliet find their garden forever changed, now flourishing more than ever—a testament to their incredible journey and the timeless bonds they've forged. The Gnometor, before departing, leaves behind his lantern, not just as a memento of their adventure but as a reminder that their actions, no matter how small, can have a profound impact on the future. **Title Reveal:** As the sun sets on their newest adventure, Gnomeo and Juliet watch The Gnometor disappear into the annals of time, knowing their garden—and their hearts—will always be open to whatever extraordinary adventure comes knocking next. *Gnomeo, Juliet, and The Gnometor: Gnomes Through Time* - A tale of time, love, and gnomes, teaching us that history is not just about the past, but a guide for the future, and every gnome has a role to play in it."},{"prompt":"Write a short Trivia where the Gnometor is an obvious parody of someone","completion":"**Trivia: Unraveling The Gnometor's Timeless Inspiration** Did you notice the whimsical and yet strangely familiar character of The Gnometor in \\"Gnomeo, Juliet, and The Gnometor: Gnomes Through Time\\"? With his eccentric mannerisms, unique garden lantern time machine, and a mission to affect the course of history, The Gnometor is an affectionate nod to one of science fiction's most iconic characters: The Doctor from the legendary British television series, \\"Doctor Who.\\" **Here are a few fun facts that highlight this playful parody:** 1. **Time Machine Disguise**: Just as the Doctor travels through time in the TARDIS, a spaceship disguised as a British police box thanks to its malfunctioning \\"chameleon circuit,\\" The Gnometor's time machine is cleverly disguised as a garden lantern, blending seamlessly into the garden setting. 2. **The Gnometor's Costume**: Taking inspiration from the various incarnations of the Doctor, The Gnometor's attire combines elements from different Doctors' iconic looks, such as a bow tie (a nod to the Eleventh Doctor) and a long, flowing coat reminiscent of the Tenth Doctor's. This sartorial mishmash pays homage to the Doctor's ever-evolving but always distinctive style. 3. **No Companions, No Problem**: Much like the Doctor often travels with companions, The Gnometor finds his own in Gnomeo and Juliet, who become unwitting yet eager participants in his time-traveling escapades. This mirrors the Doctor's penchant for picking up companions from different times and places to join in on adventures across the cosmos. 4. **A Champion of the Undergnome**: The Doctor is known for standing up to bullies and fighting for justice across the universe. Similarly, The Gnometor's mission to prevent a gnome disaster showcases his commitment to protect gnomekind and ensure the safety of their world, irrespective of the personal risks. His backstory of being an outsider among his own people until stepping up as a hero mirrors many of the Doctor's own journeys. 5. **Gnomes in Space and Time**: The episodes within the film featuring historical and futuristic settings serve as a playful homage to the genre-spanning adventures of \\"Doctor Who,\\" which has taken its audience from the distant past to the far reaches of the future, encountering aliens, historical figures, and everything in between. 6. **The Sonic Screwdriver Gets a Garden Twist**: While The Gnometor doesn't carry a sonic screwdriver, he's equipped with a multi-functional garden tool that serves as a nod to the Doctor's famous gadget. This tool proves handy in various sticky situations throughout their adventure, showcasing the ingenuity and resourcefulness that both characters share.
