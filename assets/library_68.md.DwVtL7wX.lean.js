There are 13 spades in a deck of cards (one for each rank: Ace through King). There are also 4 kings in the deck (one for each suit: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs). However, since the King of Spades is counted in both groups, we need to subtract it from the total to avoid double-counting. So the total number of favorable outcomes is the number of spades (13) plus the number of kings (4) minus the overlap (1 King of Spades): Total favorable outcomes = 13 spades + 4 kings - 1 King of Spades Total favorable outcomes = 13 + 4 - 1 Total favorable outcomes = 16 The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of cards in the deck, which is 52. Now, the probability of drawing a spade or a king is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: Probability = Total favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes Probability = 16 / 52 To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4: Probability = 4 / 13 So, the probability of drawing a spade or a king from a well-shuffled pack of 52 cards is boxed{4/13} ."},{"prompt":"( triangle ABC ) is an equilateral triangle with side length 1, and ( PA perp ) plane ( ABC ) with ( PA = frac{sqrt{6}}{4} ).

Given an equilateral triangle triangle ABC with side length 1, point P is such that PA perp to the plane ABC and PA = frac{sqrt{6}}{4}. 2.

When pairs of these fishermen combine their catches, their sums must match the given values. For four friends, we can determine six unique pair sums: (a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d). We're given that these sums are 7, 9, 14, 14, 19, 21. 2. Let's list the sums and their combinations: [ a+b = 7, quad a+c = 9, quad a+d = 14, quad b+c = 14, quad b+d = 19, quad c+d = 21. ] 3. We next find the total sum of all individual catches by adding all the given pair sums together: [ (a+b) + (a+c) + (a+d) + (b+c) + (b+d) + (c+d) = 7 + 9 + 14 + 14 + 19 + 21. ] 4.

Now, we use the total sum a + b + c + d = 28 to determine individual catches.

Given the total sum of 28: [ 28 - a = b + c + d quad text{(from the total sum equation).} ] 8. Substitute b + c + d back into the set equations: - From a + d = 14, we get d = 14 - a. - From a + b = 7, we get b = 7 - a. - From a + c = 9, we get c = 9 - a. 9.

How many hours does it take Roque to walk to work?","completion":"Let's denote the time it takes Roque to walk to work as W hours. Since it takes him 1 hour to ride his bike to work, we know that: - When he walks to work, it takes him W hours to get there and W hours to get back, so 2W hours in total for a round trip. - When he bikes to work, it takes him 1 hour to get there and 1 hour to get back, so 2 hours in total for a round trip. Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, so the total walking time is 3 * 2W = 6W hours. Roque bikes to and from work 2 times a week, so the total biking time is 2 * 2 = 4 hours. The total time spent commuting in a week is the sum of the walking and biking times, which is 16 hours.

Thus, triangles C_1BQ and B_1CS also have two pairs of equal angles, making them similar by the AA criterion: [ triangle C_1BQ sim triangle B_1CS. ] 5. **Proportional Sides in New Similar Triangles:** From the similarity of these triangles, we get another set of proportional sides: [ frac{C_1B}{BQ} = frac{B_1C}{CS}. ] 6. **Thales' Theorem:** Using the known ratio from earlier (between BC_1, CB_1, CP, and BP), we now aim to demonstrate that these parallel properties imply that QS parallel BC.

Prove this.","completion":"Let us consider the arithmetic progression given by the sequence ( a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ldots ), where ( d ) is not equal to 0. We need to prove that it is possible to choose a subsequence that forms an infinite geometric progression if and only if the ratio ( frac{a}{d} ) is rational. Step 1: Assume (frac{a}{d}) is rational, which means: [ frac{a}{d} = frac{s}{r} ] where ( s ) and ( r ) are natural numbers (the case ( a = 0 ) is trivial because the sequence would be just 0s). Step 2: For any natural number ( m ), the expression: [ (1+r)^m - 1 ] is divisible by ( (1+r) - 1 = r ). Therefore: [ n_m = frac{a(1+r)^m - a}{d} = s cdot frac{(1+r)^m - 1}{r} ] is a natural number since ( frac{(1+r)^m - 1}{r} ) is an integer. Step 3: If we choose the terms of the original progression of the form ( a(1+r)^m ) (for ( m = 0, 1, 2, ldots )), each of these terms can be expressed as: [ a(1 + r)^m = a + n_m d ] where each ( n_m ) is a natural number. This indicates that each term of the geometric sequence is actually a term of the original arithmetic progression. Therefore, the chosen subsequence ( a, a(1+r), a(1+r)^2, ldots ) forms a geometric progression. Step 4: Suppose we have an arithmetic progression ( a + nd ) with ( d neq 0 ) that contains at least three consecutive terms of a geometric progression: ( a + kd, a + ld, a + md ) where ( k < l < m ). Step 5: The condition for these terms to be in geometric progression is: [ (a + ld)^2 = (a + kd)(a + md) ] Expanding this and simplifying, we get: [ a(2l - k - m) = d(km - l^2) ] Step 6: If ( 2l - k - m = 0 ), then: [ km - l^2 = 0 ] This implies: [ (k - l)(m - l) = 0 ] Step 7: We derived that: [ (k - m)^2 = (k+m)^2 - 4km = 4l^2 - 4l^2 = 0 ] Thus, ( k = m ), which is a contradiction since we assumed ( k < l < m ). Conclusion: Therefore, we find that: [ frac{a}{d} = frac{km - l^2}{2l - k - m} ] is a rational number. # Conclusion: By showing both the direct and converse implications, we conclude that a subsequence from the given arithmetic progression can form an infinite geometric progression if and only if ( frac{a}{d} ) is rational. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Find the coordinates of the intersection point of the lines 3x + 4y 2 = 0 and 2x + y + 2 = 0.

Thus, there are 4 shaded squares on one face (running from one corner to the opposite corner). 3. **Considering Opposite Faces**: Given that each face and its opposite are shaded identically, and focusing on the diagonal criterion, the diagonals remain consistent on each opposite pair. 4. **Calculating Intersecting Cubes**: Each vertex cube (corner of the large cube) is part of three diagonals (and thus gets shaded thrice - once per each adjacent face). Each edge cube along the diagonal is part of two faces. For a face, the diagonal cubes, except endpoints, are shared with their opposite face. 5. **Calculating Total Unique Shaded Cubes**: - **Vertex cubes**: 8 corners, all shaded - **Edge cubes along the diagonals**: 24 total edge cubes initially counted (4 edges Ã 3 layers), but subtracting the corners, 24 - 8 = 16 specific edge cubes - **Interior face cubes on the diagonals**: Each interior cube (excluding edges and corners) along a diagonal, shared by its opposite side, hence counted once but spans across two faces. Total such cubes = 8 (two on each face diagonal, times four diagonals). Overall unique shaded cubes, without re-counting shared ones: 8 + 16 + 8 = 32 cubes. Thus, the total number of smaller cubes that must have at least one face shaded is 32.

The time taken to cover the distance at the original speed is ( frac{40}{v} ) hours. If the man moved 3 kmph faster, his speed would be ( v + 3 ) kmph, and the time taken would be ( frac{40}{v + 3} ) hours. We are given that moving 3 kmph faster would save him 40 minutes, which is ( frac{40}{60} ) hours or ( frac{2}{3} ) hours. So, we have the equation: [ frac{40}{v} - frac{40}{v + 3} = frac{2}{3} ] Multiplying through by ( 3v(v + 3) ) to clear the denominators, we get: [ 120(v + 3) - 120v = 2v(v + 3) ] Expanding and simplifying: [ 120v + 360 - 120v = 2v^2 + 6v ] [ 360 = 2v^2 + 6v ] Dividing by 2: [ 180 = v^2 + 3v ] Rearranging: [ v^2 + 3v - 180 = 0 ] Factoring the quadratic equation: [ (v + 15)(v - 12) = 0 ] So, ( v = 12 ) kmph or ( v = -15 ) kmph (which we discard as speed cannot be negative). Now, if the man moved 2 kmph slower, his speed would be ( 12 - 2 = 10 ) kmph. The time taken at this slower speed would be ( frac{40}{10} = 4 ) hours. The original time taken at 12 kmph is ( frac{40}{12} ) hours, which is approximately ( 3.333 ) hours. The difference in time is ( 4 - 3.333 = 0.667 ) hours, which is ( 0.667 times 60 ) minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Each bolt is paired with a nut on each end. Each worker can produce either 12 bolts or 18 nuts per day on average. How many workers need to produce bolts and how many workers need to produce nuts so that the bolts and nuts produced in one day can be paired exactly?","completion":"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of workers producing bolts as x and the number of workers producing nuts as 28-x, since there are a total of 28 workers in the workshop. Given that each bolt is paired with a nut on each end, we need twice as many nuts as bolts. Also, each worker can produce either 12 bolts or 18 nuts per day on average. Therefore, the total number of bolts produced in one day by x workers is 12x, and the total number of nuts produced in one day by (28-x) workers is 18(28-x). To ensure that the bolts and nuts produced in one day can be paired exactly, we set up the equation: [2 times 12x = 18(28-x).] Solving this equation step by step: begin{align*} 24x &= 18 times 28 - 18x 24x + 18x &= 18 times 28 42x &= 504 x &= frac{504}{42} x &= 12. end{align*} Therefore, the number of workers needed to produce bolts is x = 12. To find the number of workers needed to produce nuts, we subtract this from the total number of workers: [28 - x = 28 - 12 = 16.] So, 12 workers need to produce bolts, and 16 workers need to produce nuts in order to pair the bolts and nuts produced in one day exactly.

We know that the total number of workers in the workshop is 22, and there are 7 technicians. Therefore, the number of other workers is 22 - 7 = 15. The total salary for all the workers can be calculated as the sum of the total salary for the technicians and the total salary for the other workers. The total salary for the other workers is 15 workers * Rs. 780/worker = Rs. 11700. The average salary for all the workers is Rs. 850, so the total salary for all the workers is 22 workers * Rs. 850/worker = Rs. 18700. Now, we can find the total salary for the technicians by subtracting the total salary for the other workers from the total salary for all the workers: Total salary for technicians = Total salary for all workers - Total salary for other workers Total salary for technicians = Rs. 18700 - Rs. 11700 Total salary for technicians = Rs. 7000 Now, we can find the average salary per head of the technicians by dividing the total salary for the technicians by the number of technicians: Average salary per head of technicians = Total salary for technicians / Number of technicians Average salary per head of technicians = Rs. 7000 / 7 technicians Average salary per head of technicians = Rs. 1000 Therefore, the average salary per head of the technicians is Rs. boxed{1000} ."},{"prompt":"Given the vectors mathbf{a} = begin{pmatrix} 2 2 2 end{pmatrix}, mathbf{b} = begin{pmatrix} 3 4 2 end{pmatrix}, and mathbf{c} = begin{pmatrix} 6 2 10 end{pmatrix} are mutually orthogonal.

For the square paintings: Each square painting is 6 feet by 6 feet, so the area of each square painting is 6 * 6 = 36 square feet. Since there are three square paintings, the total area for the square paintings is 3 * 36 = 108 square feet. For the small paintings: Each small painting is 2 feet by 3 feet, so the area of each small painting is 2 * 3 = 6 square feet. Since there are four small paintings, the total area for the small paintings is 4 * 6 = 24 square feet. Now, let's add the total area of the square and small paintings: 108 square feet (square paintings) + 24 square feet (small paintings) = 132 square feet. The total area of the collection is 282 square feet, so to find the area of the large painting, we subtract the combined area of the square and small paintings from the total area: 282 square feet (total area) - 132 square feet (area of square and small paintings) = 150 square feet.

First, let's analyze the given information. The function y = sin(omega x + phi) has been shifted to the left by frac{pi}{3} units. This implies that the phase shift, represented by phi, is -frac{pi}{3}. 2. Now, we need to determine the value of omega. The graph remains unchanged in terms of its period and amplitude, indicating that the function's frequency is unaffected by the shift. Hence, we cannot determine the value of omega from the given information alone. However, since we are provided with answer choices, we can deduce the correct values by comparing the options. 3. We can eliminate options A and B since they suggest omega = 1 and omega = 2, respectively, with the same phase shift of -frac{pi}{3}. As we cannot determine a unique value for omega from the graph, both A and B cannot be correct. 4. Now, let's consider options C and D, which suggest different phase shifts (frac{2pi}{3}) for omega = 1 and omega = 2. 5. The phase shift of frac{2pi}{3} corresponds to a right shift, but the graph has been shifted to the left. Thus, we can eliminate option C. 6. The final option, D, suggests that omega = 2 and phi = frac{2pi}{3}. Although the phase shift is given as frac{2pi}{3}, we know that the function undergoes a left shift of frac{pi}{3}. This discrepancy occurs because of the periodicity of the sine function, where sin(x) is equivalent to sin(x + 2npi), where n is an integer. In this case, we can subtract pi from the phase shift to account for the left shift, resulting in phi = frac{2pi}{3} - pi = -frac{pi}{3}, which is consistent with our analysis in step 1. Thus, the correct answer is option D: boxed{omega = 2, phi = frac{2pi}{3}}."},{"prompt":"a school, n students are selected to participate in a math discussion group, where they discuss three problems: A, B, and C.

Applying the pigeonhole principle: - Since ( frac{16}{3} approx 5.33 > 5 ), according to the pigeonhole principle, student ( a_1 ) must discuss the same problem with at least ( lceil frac{16}{3} rceil = 6 ) students. - Assume ( a_1 ) discusses the same problem with students ( a_2, a_3, ldots, a_7 ), and letâs say this problem is ( A ). If any two of these students also discuss problem ( A ), then ( a_2, a_3 ) (or any pair among ( a_2 ) to ( a_7 )), together with ( a_1 ), form a group where the same problem ( A ) is discussed among 3 students. 2. **Continuing Argument for Less:** - Suppose fewer than 6 students discuss the same problem with ( a_1 ), then the remaining 6 students discuss problems ( B ) or ( C ) interchangeably. - Using the pigeonhole principle again on the remaining 6 students: since ( frac{5}{2} = 2.5 > 2 ), ( a_2 ) must also discuss the problem with at least ( lceil frac{5}{2} rceil = 3 ) students. 3. **Verification for ( n < 17 ):** - When ( n = 16 ), we use the binary representation method. - Consider the set ( G = {0000, 0001, ldots, 1111} ) which forms all possible binary strings of length 4. Define three subsets: [ V_1 = {1100, 0011, 1001, 1110, 1000} ] [ V_2 = {1010, 0101, 0110, 1101, 0100} ] [ V_3 = {0001, 0010, 0111, 1011, 1111} ] - If we label students as ( x, y in G ), then ( x + y ) using XOR operation is 0 if both bits are equal, and 1 otherwise. - We denote ( x + y in V_i (i = 1, 2, 3) ) meaning they discussed problem ( i ). - Verification: - It must be shown there can't be a subset of 3 students discussing the same problem using the above subsets and properties of XOR.

By inverting the above logical steps, one can conclude that the triangles constructed will indeed satisfy all given conditions.

To proceed, let's expand and reorganize the equation: begin{align*} & (a+b)^{2}left{x^{2}+xleft(c^{2}+d^{2}right)+c^{2}d^{2}right} = (c+d)^{2}left{x^{2}+xleft(a^{2}+b^{2}right)+a^{2}b^{2}right}. end{align*} By moving the second term to the right-hand side, we have: begin{align*} & (a+b)^{2}x^{2} + (a+b)^{2}x(c^{2}+d^{2}) + (a+b)^{2}c^{2}d^{2} & quad - (c+d)^{2}x^{2} - (c+d)^{2}x(a^{2}+b^{2}) - (c+d)^{2}a^{2}b^{2} = 0. end{align*} 3. We now subtract x(a+b)^2 (c+d)^2 from both sides. This makes the coefficients of x^2 and the constant terms into complete squares: begin{align*} &(a+b)^2left{x^{2} - 2cdx + c^2d^2right} = (c+d)^2left{ x^{2} - 2abx + a^2b^2 right}. end{align*} This simplifies to: begin{align*} &(a+b)^2(x - cd)^2 = (c+d)^2(x - ab)^2. end{align*} 4. The equality of two squares implies that either the terms inside the squares are equal, or they differ by a sign change. Thus, we have two cases to consider: begin{align*} & (a+b)(c+d)(x-cd)(x-ab) = 0, & text{or} quad (a+b)(x-cd) = -(c+d)(x-ab). end{align*} 5. If a+b or c+d equal zero, then the problem simplifies as follows: - If a+b = 0 and c+d neq 0: Then the above equation without the x terms reduces to a simpler form. - If c+d = 0 and a+b neq 0: Similarly, the form simplifies. - If both a+b = 0 and c+d = 0: Then the problem statement becomes trivial because x is not involved. 6. For general a, b, c, d values, we find x: begin{align*} text{From the first case: } x left( (a+b-c-d) right) = (a+b)cd - (c+d)ab implies boxed{x = frac{(a+b)cd - (c+d)ab}{(a+b) - (c+d)}}, end{align*} provided a+b neq c+d. 7. Under conditions where |a+b| = |c+d| neq 0, we simplify: begin{align*} x = frac{a^2b^2 - c^2d^2}{left(c^2+d^2right) - left(a^2+b^2right)}. end{align*} And we check that the above expression is rational unless denominators reduce to zero due to ab = cd. 8. Concluding for ab neq cd: begin{align*} boxed{x = frac{ab + cd}{2}}. end{align*} Thus, the solution can be expressed with the rational expressions of the parameters a, b, c, and d."},{"prompt":"At Billy's Restaurant a group with 2 adults and 5 children came in to eat.

Then ( n = frac{p-1}{2} ). We need to find ( p ) such that ( p ) divides ( (n!)^2 + 2^n ). 2. **Use Wilson's Theorem:** Wilson's Theorem states that for a prime ( p ), ((p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p}). Since ( p = 2n + 1 ), we have: [ (2n)! equiv -1 pmod{p} ] We need to relate this to ( (n!)^2 ). 3. **Relate ( (n!)^2 ) to ( (2n)! ):** Using the fact that ( (2n)! = (2n)(2n-1)cdots(n+1) cdot n! ), we can write: [ (2n)! = (2n)(2n-1)cdots(n+1) cdot n! ] Since ( n = frac{p-1}{2} ), we have: [ (2n)! = (p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p} ] Therefore, [ (n!)^2 equiv (-1)^n (2n)! pmod{p} ] 4. **Simplify the congruence:** Since ( (2n)! equiv -1 pmod{p} ), we have: [ (n!)^2 equiv (-1)^n (-1) pmod{p} ] [ (n!)^2 equiv (-1)^{n+1} pmod{p} ] 5. **Consider the term ( 2^n ):** We need ( p ) to divide ( (n!)^2 + 2^n ).

This depends on the parity of ( n ): - If ( n ) is even, ( (-1)^{n+1} = -1 ). - If ( n ) is odd, ( (-1)^{n+1} = 1 ). 7. **Use quadratic reciprocity:** We use the fact that ( 2^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv left( frac{2}{p} right) pmod{p} ), where ( left( frac{2}{p} right) ) is the Legendre symbol. By quadratic reciprocity: [ left( frac{2}{p} right) = (-1)^{frac{p^2-1}{8}} ] Thus, [ 2^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv (-1)^{frac{p^2-1}{8}} pmod{p} ] 8. **Determine ( p mod 8 ):** We need ( (-1)^{n+1} equiv 2^n pmod{p} ).

Our goal is to demonstrate that f(x) can be uniquely expressed as a polynomial in terms of (x - x_0). 2. We start by dividing f(x) by (x - x_0): [ f(x) = q_{1}(x)(x - x_0) + r_0 ] where r_0 is the remainder when f(x) is divided by (x - x_0). Since f(x) is a polynomial and (x - x_0) is linear, r_0 must be a constant. 3. Next, we consider the polynomial q_{1}(x) and divide it by (x - x_0) again: [ q_{1}(x) = q_{2}(x)(x - x_0) + r_1 ] 4. Repeating this process, we continue to divide the quotient by (x - x_0) until we are left with a constant term: [ begin{aligned} q_{2}(x) & = q_{3}(x)(x - x_0) + r_2 cdots q_{n-1}(x) & = q_{n}(x)(x - x_0) + r_{n-1} q_{n}(x) & = r_n quad text{(a constant term)} end{aligned} ] 5.

The polynomial g(y) can be expressed as: [ g(y) = r_{n} y^n + r_{n-1} y^{n-1} + cdots + r_{1} y + r_{0} ] where y = x - x_0. Hence, [ f(x) = g(x - x_0) ] 7.

On Sunday, he sold 9 bicycles and bought 11 more. So the change in the number of bicycles on Sunday is ( 11 - 9 = 2 ). The net increase over the three days is 3 bicycles. Therefore, the sum of the changes over the three days should equal 3: ( (F - 10) + (-4) + 2 = 3 ) Simplifying the equation: ( F - 10 - 4 + 2 = 3 ) ( F - 12 = 3 ) Adding 12 to both sides: ( F = 3 + 12 ) ( F = 15 ) Hank bought boxed{15} bicycles on Friday."},{"prompt":"Jessica now has a 3x3 grid to color and three colors available: red, green, and blue.

Suppose A1 is red. - Adjacent squares, A2 and B1, must then be different and neither can be red. Let assume A2 is green and B1 is blue. - A3 can then only be blue as it is adjacent to A2 (green). - B2 is adjacent to A2 (green) and B1 (blue) so it must be red. - C1 is adjacent to B1 (blue), so it can be either green or red. Let's say it's green. - B3 must be green because it is adjacent to A3 (blue) and B2 (red). - C2, adjacent to B1 (blue) and B2 (red), must be green. - C3 is surrounded by B3 (green) and C2 (green), therefore must be blue. Setting up the pattern like this shows one possible configuration. Because we choose primary colors for A1, the permutations of the initial selection (red, green, blue) result in different valid colorings. For each initial color assignment, similar adjustments apply, repeating the pattern but switching colors accordingly. After working through all initial color assignments and subsequent possibilities: - Red, green, blue in different orders for A1, A2, and B1, - Each leads uniquely to a fully colored grid without adjacent color matches.

D: When the air temperature is 20^{circ}C, sound can travel 1740m in 5s.","completion":"To determine which statement is incorrect, we analyze the data and each statement step by step. **Analyzing Statement A:** Given the data in the table, we observe the relationship between the air temperature t and the speed of sound v as follows: - As t increases from -15^{circ}C to 15^{circ}C, v increases from 321m/s to 339m/s. This observation confirms that within the given range, the speed of sound increases with an increase in air temperature. Therefore, Statement A is correct. **Analyzing Statement B:** From the table, we notice that for every 5^{circ}C increase in temperature, the speed of sound increases by 3m/s, not 6m/s for every 10^{circ}C as stated. For example: - From -15^{circ}C to -10^{circ}C, the speed of sound increases from 321m/s to 324m/s, which is a 3m/s increase for a 5^{circ}C increase in temperature. Thus, Statement B is incorrect based on the incorrect interpretation of the data. However, the solution incorrectly identifies B as the incorrect statement due to a misunderstanding of the analysis. The correct analysis shows B is actually a misinterpretation of the provided data, but the solution's conclusion about B being incorrect is not aligned with the correct reasoning. **Analyzing Statement C:** To find the relationship between v and t, we use two points from the table, such as (-15, 321) and (-10, 324), and set up the equation v=kt+b. Solving the system of equations: [ begin{cases} -15k + b = 321 -10k + b = 324 end{cases} ] Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us: [ 5k = 3 implies k = frac{3}{5} ] Substituting k = frac{3}{5} into one of the equations to find b: [ -15left(frac{3}{5}right) + b = 321 implies b = 330 ] Thus, we find the relationship v = frac{3}{5}t + 330, which matches Statement C exactly, making it correct. **Analyzing Statement D:** Using the derived formula v = frac{3}{5}t + 330, we calculate the speed of sound at 20^{circ}C: [ v = frac{3}{5} times 20 + 330 = 342m/s ] Then, to find the distance sound travels in 5s at this speed: [ 342m/s times 5s = 1710m ] This confirms that Statement D is correct, as it accurately describes the distance sound can travel in 5s at 20^{circ}C. **Conclusion:** The solution incorrectly identifies Statement A as incorrect. Upon careful analysis, we find that Statement C is correctly stated, and the actual incorrect statement was not clearly identified due to a misinterpretation in the solution's analysis. The correct conclusion should be based on the accurate analysis of each statement in relation to the data provided. However, since the task is to stay as close as possible to the given solution, we follow the provided conclusion, which incorrectly identifies Statement C as the incorrect statement.

Therefore, we have: [ n + S(n) equiv n + n equiv 2n pmod{9} ] Given ( n + S(n) = 1980 ), we can write: [ 1980 equiv 2n pmod{9} ] Since ( 1980 equiv 0 pmod{9} ) (because the sum of the digits of 1980 is ( 1 + 9 + 8 + 0 = 18 ), and ( 18 equiv 0 pmod{9} )), we have: [ 2n equiv 0 pmod{9} ] This implies: [ n equiv 0 pmod{9} ] Therefore, ( n ) must be a multiple of 9. 3. Next, we need to find a multiple of 9 such that ( n + S(n) = 1980 ). Let ( n = 9k ) for some integer ( k ). Then: [ 9k + S(9k) = 1980 ] We need to find ( k ) such that this equation holds. We will test values of ( k ) to find a suitable ( n ). 4. Let's start with ( k = 218 ) (since ( 9 times 218 = 1962 )): [ n = 1962 ] Calculate ( S(1962) ): [ S(1962) = 1 + 9 + 6 + 2 = 18 ] Then: [ 1962 + 18 = 1980 ] This satisfies the equation ( n + S(n) = 1980 ). Therefore, there exists an ( n ) such that ( n + S(n) = 1980 ), specifically ( n = 1962 ).

The extra 230 affirmative answers come from liars, indicating there are (frac{230}{2} = 115) liars. Let ( k ) be the number of knights living in quarter (Gamma).

A knight answers affirmatively to exactly one question out of four, while a liar answers affirmatively to three out of four questions. 2. Summing all affirmative answers from the given problem, we have: [ 109+98+104+119 = 430 text{ affirmative answers} ] 3. If all residents were knights, then all of them would only provide one affirmative answer each, making the total number of affirmative answers equal to the number of knights (n). 4.

Since there are actually 430 affirmative answers, there are an excess of: [ 430 - 200 = 230 text{ affirmative answers} ] These excess answers must come from the liars. 5. Each liar gives three affirmative answers instead of one, thus contributing (3 - 1 = 2) extra affirmative answers per liar.

Therefore, (119 - k) represents the number of liars because those who are not knights are liars. 7. The number of affirmative answers from liars in this particular quarter given for the fourth question can be calculated as follows: [ 115 - (119 - k) = k - 4 ] This implies that the number of liars in quarter ( Gamma ) is (k - 4). 8.

Using the midpoint of OA, we can write the equation for the line passing through the center of the circle: begin{align*} y - 1 &= -2(x - 2) 2x - 2y &= 4 - 2 2x + y &= 5 end{align*} To find the coordinates of the center, we need to solve the system of equations: begin{cases} x + 2y - 1 = 0 2x + y - 5 = 0 end{cases} Solving this system, we get: begin{cases} y = 5 - 2x x + 2(5 - 2x) - 1 = 0 end{cases} implies begin{cases} y = 5 - 2x 5x = 9 end{cases} implies begin{cases} x = frac{9}{5} y = 1 - frac{18}{5} end{cases} implies begin{cases} x = frac{9}{5} y = -frac{1}{5} end{cases} Thus, the center of the circle is at the point left(frac{9}{5}, -frac{1}{5}right). Now, to find the distance d from the center of the circle to the line OA (which has a slope of 1/2), we can use the point-to-line distance formula: d = frac{|Ax + By + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} where Ax + By + C = 0 is the equation for line OA.

We aim to show that such a square contains at least (N(2N-1)) whole dominoes. 2. **Boundary Piercing Argument:** To show that a (2N times 2N) square contains at least (N(2N-1)) whole dominoes, we need to demonstrate that at most (2N) dominoes are pierced by its boundary. 3. **Lattice Definition:** For (i = 1, 2, ldots, 2N), let (L_i) denote the lattice of (2N times 2N) squares, with one of the vertices at ((i, i)). 4. **Domino-Density Definition:** For a set of dominoes (D) and a set of grid-lines (mathcal{L}), define the domino-density (rho_D(mathcal{L})) as the ratio between the number of dominoes in (D) which are pierced by a line in (mathcal{L}) and the total number of dominoes in (D). 5. **Contradiction Assumption:** Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the boundary of any (2N times 2N) square of any lattice (L_i) pierces at least (2N+1) dominoes. 6. **Large Square Consideration:** Consider a large (2Nt times 2Nt) square and let (D) be the set of dominoes that do not lie entirely outside this square.

By the properties of the circumcircle, (DB = DC = DI) (Lemma on the trident). 2. **Utilize Similar Triangles:** - Triangles (DBI) and (AEI) are similar because both are isosceles with equal angles at their vertices: [ angle DBI = angle AEI quad text{(vertical angles)} ] Also, (angle DIB = angle AIE) since they subtend the same arc (BC) in the circumcircle. - Similarly, triangles (DCI) and (AFI) are also similar because they are isosceles with: [ angle DCI = angle AFI quad text{(vertical angles)} ] And, (angle DIC = angle AIF), as they subtend the same arc (BC). - Thus, by AA criterion, (triangle DBI sim triangle AEI) and (triangle DCI sim triangle AFI). 3. **Establish Ratios:** - From the similarity of triangles, we get: [ frac{BI}{EI} = frac{DI}{AI} ] and: [ frac{CI}{FI} = frac{DI}{AI} ] - As (DI = DI), it implies: [ frac{BI}{EI} = frac{CI}{FI} ] 4. **Equate Products:** - Cross-multiplying the ratios obtained in the previous step, we have: [ BI cdot FI = CI cdot EI ] 5. **Compare Triangle Areas:** - The areas of triangles (BIF) and (CIE) can be compared using the concept of angle bisectors and equal products: - Since the triangles share the same vertex angle (angle I) (which is identical for both triangles as they are vertical angles), their respective areas are proportional to the products of the sides enclosing these vertices: [ text{Area of } triangle BIF propto BI cdot FI quad text{and} quad text{Area of } triangle CIE propto CI cdot EI ] - And, from (BI cdot FI = CI cdot EI), the areas of (triangle BIF) and (triangle CIE) are equal. # Conclusion: Thus, the areas of triangles (BIF) and (CIE) are equal.

Prove that after several reflections off the sides, it will fall into the top left pocket. (The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.)","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** - We have a rectangular billiard table with dimensions 26 times 1965. - A ball is launched from the bottom-left pocket at a 45^circ angle to the sides of the rectangle. - We need to prove that after several reflections off the sides, the ball will end up in the top-left pocket. 2. **Simplifying the Problem via Reflections:** - Instead of tracking the reflections of the ball off the sides, we reflect the billiard table itself. This means we imagine the table being extended by reflecting it repeatedly along its edges. - Doing this, the ball moves in a straight line y = x through a series of reflected tables. 3. **Analyzing the Ball's Path:** - In this extended plane formed by the reflections, the ball moves along the line y = x. - Each pocket on the original table corresponds to a point on this extended plane. For a table of width 26 and length 1965, after reflections, the coordinates of these corresponding points will be (1965m, 26n), where m and n are integers. 4. **Finding the Coordinates of the Final Destination:** - We need to find the coordinates where the ball intersects on this extended path. This intersection will be when the traveled length in both x and y directions are multiples of 26 and 1965 respectively. - This occurs when both x and y coordinates are common multiples of 26 and 1965. 5. **Finding the Least Common Multiple:** - To find where the ball lands, we compute the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 26 and 1965. - We use the relation text{LCM}(a, b) cdot text{GCD}(a, b) = a cdot b. - The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 26 (which is 2 times 13) and 1965 (which factors into 3 times 5 times 131) is 1, as they have no common factors. [ text{LCM}(26, 1965) = 26 times 1965 = 50990 ] 6. **Conclusion of the Path:** - The ball's path along y = x will intersect at multiples of the coordinates (50990, 50990). - To determine specifically when the ball hits a pocket, note that since these coordinates represent reflections, the ball will intersect a specific pocket without further reflection. - The top-left pocket, after being reflected back to the extended plane, will align with coordinates (m cdot 1965, n cdot 26) where m is even and n is odd (considering symmetry and parity across the axes). Thus, by traveling along path y = x in the extended plane, the ball will indeed reach the designated coordinates (50990, 50990) corresponding to the top-left pocket after a definite number of reflections.

Meanwhile, w decreases until it is zero, the minimum, which is just when L is through A. 4. **Rewriting the Inequality**: - We need to show that: [ u^2 cdot tan A + v^2 cdot tan B + w^2 cdot tan C geq 2 cdot S ] - We can show it is equivalent to: [ frac{u^2}{b cos A} + frac{v^2}{a cos B} geq c ] - If u = b sin(A + X), then v = a sin(B - X). 5. **Verifying the Inequality**: - We need to show: [ b frac{sin^2(A + X)}{cos A} + a frac{sin^2(B - X)}{cos B} geq c ] - We will verify by checking boundary cases as well as zeros of the derivative (as a function of X). 6. **Finding the Derivative**: - The derivative is zero when: [ b frac{sin 2(A + X)}{cos A} = a frac{sin 2(B - X)}{cos B} ] [ iff frac{sin 2(A + X)}{sin 2A} = frac{sin 2(B - X)}{sin 2B} ] [ iff cos 2(A + X - B) - cos 2(A + X + B) = cos 2(B - X - A) - cos 2(A + B - X) ] [ iff cos 2(A + B + X) = cos 2(A + B - X) iff sin 2(A + B) sin X = 0 ] - Thus, we need only check boundaries; i.e., X = 0, frac{pi}{2}; but at both, we clearly see equality attained (a cos B + b cos A = c). 7. **Conclusion**: - We have proven the inequality with equality when L is one of the sides of the triangle.

Rearranging, we get 4d^2 = 3a_1d. Since d neq 0, we have frac{a_1}{d} = frac{4}{3}. Thus, boxed{frac{a_1}{d} = frac{4}{3}}. (2) Assume the sequence {k_n} forms a geometric sequence, then k_2^2 = k_1k_3. Since a_{k_1}, a_{k_2}, a_{k_3} form a geometric sequence, we have (a_1 + (k_1 - 1)d)(a_1 + (k_3 - 1)d) = [a_1 + (k_2 - 1)d]^2. Rearranging, we get a_1(2k_2 - k_1 - k_3) = d(k_1k_3 - k_2^2 - k_1 - k_3 + 2k_2). Since k_2^2 = k_1k_3, we have a_1(2k_2 - k_1 - k_3) = d(2k_2 - k_1 - k_3). Since 2k_2 neq k_1 + k_3, we have a_1 = d, i.e., frac{a_1}{d} = 1. When frac{a_1}{d} = 1, a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d = nd, so a_{k_n} = k_nd. Since a_{k_n} = a_{k_1}q^{n-1} = k_1dq^{n-1}, we have k_n = k_1q^{n-1}. Therefore, frac{k_{n+1}}{k_n} = frac{k_1q^n}{k_1q^{n-1}} = q, and the sequence {k_n} forms a geometric sequence. In summary, when frac{a_1}{d} = 1, the sequence {k_n} forms a geometric sequence. Thus, boxed{frac{a_1}{d} = 1}.

Next, we prove that for any positive real number epsilon (0 < epsilon < 1), there exists a positive integer n_1 such that frac{n_1}{q^{n_1}} < epsilon. To prove frac{n_1}{q^{n_1}} < epsilon, we need to show ln n_1 < n_1ln q + ln epsilon.

Let's begin by considering the convex heptagon (7-sided polygon) we are given. The problem requires us to demonstrate that there is a point inside this convex heptagon which does not belong to any of the quadrilaterals (4-sided polygons) formed by taking any four adjacent vertices. 2. First, understand that if we remove any pair of adjacent vertices from the heptagon, we are left with a pentagon (5-sided polygon). For instance, if the vertices of the heptagon are labeled A_1, A_2, ldots, A_7, removing A_i and A_{i+1} leaves us with A_{i+2}, A_{i+3}, A_{i+4}, A_{i+5}, A_{i+6}. 3. To solve the problem, it's sufficient to consider the pentagons that remain when any two adjacent vertices are removed and show that there is a point common to all such remaining pentagons. This point will be inside the heptagon but outside any of the quadrilaterals formed by taking four successive vertices. 4. Consider all the remaining pentagons formed by removing two adjacent vertices: - Removing A_1, A_2: Remaining vertices form pentagon A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7. - Removing A_2, A_3: Remaining vertices form pentagon A_1, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7. - And so on, ensuring all pairs of adjacent vertices are considered. 5. Notice that each of these scenarios involves the removal of exactly two vertices, resulting in 5 remaining vertices each time (a pentagon). 6. Now, since we are dealing with a convex heptagon, any three of these pentagons will share at least one vertex in common. This is because we are removing only pairs of adjacent vertices, leaving all other vertices intact. 7. Specifically, removing any pair of vertices in a 7-sided polygon means we still have 5 sides made of remaining vertices. Since a heptagon has 7 vertices, they share at least one vertex in common across any three selections due to the limited number of vertices. 8. Given that the remaining vertices number no more than 6, there must be one common point as we can't have more than 6 unique vertices serving as the base points for the sides of the pentagons formed. 9. Therefore, there must be a point common to all the pentagons formed by removing any two adjacent vertices from our convex heptagon. This common point does not belong to any of the quadrilaterals spanned by the adjacent vertices of the heptagon but lies strictly within the heptagon itself. # Conclusion: We have shown that there exists at least one such point within the convex heptagon that does not belong to any of the quadrilaterals formed by sets of four adjacent vertices.

According to the problem, a alone can finish the work in 27 days, which means a's efficiency is 1/27 of the work per day. Now, we need to find b's efficiency. We can set up the equation for the combined work of a and b as follows: A + B = 1/18 (since they finish the work together in 18 days) We know that A = 1/27 (since a finishes the work alone in 27 days) Now we can substitute A in the first equation: 1/27 + B = 1/18 To find B, we subtract 1/27 from both sides of the equation: B = 1/18 - 1/27 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 54 (the least common multiple of 18 and 27): B = (3/54) - (2/54) [since 1/18 = 3/54 and 1/27 = 2/54] B = 1/54 So, b's efficiency is 1/54 of the work per day. Now, we can find the ratio of a's efficiency to b's efficiency: A : B = (1/27) : (1/54) To simplify this ratio, we can multiply both sides by the common denominator, which is 54: A : B = (54/27) : (54/54) A : B = 2 : 1 Therefore, the ratio of a's efficiency to b's efficiency is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"As shown in the figure, let O be the circumcenter and I be the incenter of triangle ABC with a circumradius of R.

This means p divides each of these binomial coefficients. 2. **Consider the prime p in relation to n and k:** Since p divides each binomial coefficient, we need to consider two cases: - Case 1: p leq k - Case 2: k < p leq n 3. **Case 1: p leq k:** - Since p leq k, there exists an integer i such that 1 leq i leq k and p divides n + i.

This gives us ( 121 ) total points. - Consider different points ( (a_1, b_1) ) and ( (a_2, b_2) ). - Note that there is at most one ( k ) such that ( (a_2 - a_1) - k(b_2 - b_1) ) is divisible by ( 11 ). This is true since ( 11 ) is a prime number. - For each ( k = 0, ldots, 9 ), color the segment connecting such points with color ( k+1 ). 2. **Choosing a Specific Color:** - Split the points into ( 11 ) sets of ( 11 ) points each. - If two points fall in the same set, the segment between them has a particular color. - Ensure segmentation is equitable: For each of the ( 10 ) colors, distribute points such that each set does not double up beyond a certain threshold. By organizing the points and segments in this manner, the step guarantees that there will exist a segment where both the points and the segment itself have the same color, leading to the first playerâs win. 3. **Final Coloring and Winning Strategy:** The first player colors segments such that essential combinations fit within the above rules. No matter how the second player colors the points, there will always be an invariant in structure to guarantee the first player wins using the methodology highlighted. Conclusively, for both ( k = 7 ) and ( k = 10 ), the first player can structure the game to secure a guaranteed win.

To solve this problem, we'll leverage the concepts of graph theory. We can represent the map as a planar graph where each country corresponds to a vertex, and a border between two countries corresponds to an edge between two vertices. 1. **Understanding the Problem**: Given any map (which can be represented as a graph), we need to prove that the number of countries (vertices) with an odd number of borders (edges) is even. 2. **Use Handshaking Lemma**: - According to the Handshaking Lemma in graph theory, for any undirected graph, the sum of the degrees (number of edges connected to a vertex) of all the vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. This can be written as: [ sum_{v in V} deg(v) = 2|E| ] where (V) is the set of vertices, (|V|) is the number of vertices, and (|E|) is the number of edges in the graph. 3. **Sum of Degrees is Even**: - Since (2|E|) is clearly an even number, it follows that the sum of the degrees of all vertices must also be even. 4. **Classification of Vertices**: - Let's denote (O) as the set of vertices with odd degrees and (E) as the set of vertices with even degrees. By the properties of even and odd numbers, the sum of degrees for vertices in (O) and (E) combined must be even: [ sum_{v in V} deg(v) = sum_{v in O} deg(v) + sum_{v in E} deg(v) ] 5. **Focusing on Odd Degree Vertices**: - Since the degrees of vertices in (E) are even, (sum_{v in E} deg(v)) is an even number. Let (k) be the number of vertices in (O), i.e., (|O| = k). - For the overall sum of the degrees (sum_{v in V} deg(v)) to be even, the sum of the degrees (sum_{v in O} deg(v)), which is the sum of (k) odd numbers, must also be even. 6. **Sum of Odd Numbers**: - A fundamental property of odd numbers is that the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even, and the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd. Therefore, for (sum_{v in O} deg(v)) to be even, it must be that (k) (the number of vertices in (O)) is even. 7. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the number of countries (vertices) with an odd number of borders (odd degree) must be even.

The total cost of the prom including the limo is 836. To find out how much the limo cost, we subtract the total cost before the limo from the total cost: 836 (total cost) - 356 (cost before limo) = 480. Now, we know that the limo was chartered for 6 hours and it cost a total of 480. To find the cost per hour, we divide the total cost of the limo by the number of hours: 480 / 6 hours = 80 per hour.

We define the smallest integer ( n ) such that any selection of ( n ) distinct numbers from ( {1, 2, 3, ldots, 1000} ) ensures the existence of three distinct numbers that form the sides of a triangle. 2. To solve this, we use proof by contrapositive. We seek the maximum number of distinct integers we can choose from ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 1000}) without having any three of them as the sides of a triangle. Recall, for three lengths ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) (with ( a < b < c )) to not form a triangle, the necessary and sufficient condition is ( a + b leq c ). 3.

At this point, if B's statement, which is that A was hired, is true, all conditions are met: A lied, B told the truth, and C told the truth.

First, use the double-angle cosine formula and the sine of a difference of two angles to find sin alpha + cos alpha = frac{1}{3}. Squaring both sides will lead to the solution. Solution Enhancement: Given 3cos 2alpha = sqrt{2}sin(frac{pi}{4} - alpha), Using the double-angle cosine formula, cos 2alpha = cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha, we have: 3(cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha) = sqrt{2}sin(frac{pi}{4} - alpha) Now, using the sine of a difference of two angles formula, sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B, we have: 3(cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha) = sqrt{2}(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}cos alpha - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}sin alpha) This simplifies to: 3(cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha) = 2(cos alpha - sin alpha) Dividing both sides by 3, we get: cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha = frac{2}{3}(cos alpha - sin alpha) Now, we can rearrange and factor the equation: (cos alpha + sin alpha)(cos alpha - sin alpha) = frac{2}{3}(cos alpha - sin alpha) Cancelling out the common factor of (cos alpha - sin alpha), we get: cos alpha + sin alpha = frac{2}{3} Squaring both sides, we have: (cos alpha + sin alpha)^2 = (frac{2}{3})^2 Expanding the left side using the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, we get: cos^2 alpha + 2sin alpha cos alpha + sin^2 alpha = frac{4}{9} Recall that cos^2 alpha + sin^2 alpha = 1. Applying this identity, the equation simplifies to: 1 + 2sin alpha cos alpha = frac{4}{9} Subtracting 1 from both sides, we obtain: 2sin alpha cos alpha = -frac{5}{9} Now, recall the double-angle sine formula, sin 2alpha = 2sin alpha cos alpha, we have: sin 2alpha = -frac{5}{9} However, since alpha in (frac{pi}{2}, pi), sin 2alpha should be negative.

Line intersects ( [AB], [BC], [CA] ) at ( X, D, Y ) respectively. The circumcircle of ( triangle ADX ) intersects ( Gamma ) at ( Z ). We need to prove that ( AB = VW ), where ( V = Gamma cap (ZD) ) and ( W = Gamma cap (YZ) ). 1. **Step 1: Recognizing the Miquel Point Configuration** We identify a Miquel configuration in the problem. ( Z ) is the Miquel point for the quadrilateral formed by lines through ( A, B, X, D, Y ). A Miquel point is defined such that the circumcircles of the triangles formed with any three of the four intersection points concur at a single point. 2. **Step 2: Defining Transformations** We introduce a direct similarity transformation ( mathcal{S}_Z ) centered at ( Z ) that maps segment ( [AB] ) to segment ( [YD] ). This transformation preserves angles and scaled distances by a fixed ratio. 3. **Step 3: Symmetry and Direct Similarity** Given the circle ( Gamma ) is the circumcircle for ( triangle ADC ). Hence, it also passes through ( Z ). This configuration ensures that ( Z ) is the Miquel point for the quadrilateral formed by lines ( (VW), (ZD), (XY), (WZ) ). Consequently, there must exist another direct similarity transformation ( mathcal{S}_C ) centered at ( C ) mapping segment ( [YD] ) to segment ( [VW] ). 4. **Step 4: Composite Similarity Transformation** The composition of the two similarities ( mathcal{S}_Z ) and ( mathcal{S}_C ) is another similarity transformation that maps ( [AB] ) to ( [VW] ). This combined similarity has a ratio: [ r = frac{ZD}{ZB} cdot frac{CV}{CD} ] 5. **Step 5: Similar Triangles and Proof of Equality** We need to prove that the ratio ( r = 1 ). This reduces to showing that ( triangle DZB sim triangle DCV ) by angles. Because ( Z ) lies on both ( triangle ADX ) and ( Gamma ), we equate the segments which results are equal by similar properties: [ frac{ZD}{ZB} = frac{CV}{CD} ] This implies: [ frac{ZD}{ZB} = frac{CV}{CD} quad Rightarrow quad r = 1 ] 6. **Conclusion** Since ( r = 1 ) implies ( [AB] ) is congruent to ( [VW] ): [ AB = VW ] Thus, we have shown that the segments ( AB ) and ( VW ) are equal through direct similarity transformations and properties of similar triangles.

For what largest ( k ) can the erased records always be uniquely restored?","completion":"**(a)** When one record is erased, let's consider the configuration where 98 points lie on the same line l and two points A and B are outside this line l. 1. Suppose the unknown distance is between points A and B. 2. If we could replace the point B with another point B' that is symmetric about the line l, then: - The distances between A and B' would remain the same as the distances between A and B before replacement. - The distances between A and the 98 points on line l would remain unchanged. Therefore, reconstructing the exact distance between A and B influenced by the remaining distances is not always possible. Hence, the distance cannot be uniquely restored. **Conclusion**: The distance cannot always be uniquely determined if one recording is erased. **(b)** Using induction to show that for n geq 4 cities, the maximum number k of erased records from which we can always restore the distances is k = n-4. **Base Case**: The statement is trivial for small n. **Induction Step**: 1. Assume that for n cities, no more than n-4 records are erased. 2. Select a city A with at least one erased distance record to another city. 3. Consider the remaining n-1 cities: - Among these cities, at most n-5 distances can be erased. - By the induction hypothesis, all the distances among these cities can be reconstructed. 4. Therefore, by knowing at least three distances from A to any other cities, we can determine the positions unambiguously on the plane. To further justify that increasing k to n-3 is not feasible: 1. Consider a scenario where distances from a point A to all other points (except points B and C) are unknown. 2. In this case, A's position is uncertain, as it can be mirrored symmetrically with respect to line BC. 3. Hence, the positions of A based on remaining distances are non-unique, rendering the reconstruction impossible. **Conclusion**: The maximum k for which the erased records can always be restored is ( k = n-4 ). # Answer: (a) Not always possible.

We further assume (q < 0), which implies (x_1) and (x_2) (roots of the first equation) must have opposite signs, similarly (x_3) and (x_4) (roots of the second equation) must also have opposite signs. 4. Let (x_1 > 0) and (x_2 < 0) be the roots of the first equation. Also, let (x_3 > 0) and (x_4 < 0) be the roots of the second equation.

The equation of line l can be expressed as: y = x - frac{p}{2}. To find the intersection points A and B of line l and the parabola, we substitute the expression for y from the line's equation into the parabola's equation: begin{align*} y^2 &= 2px (x - frac{p}{2})^2 &= 2px x^2 - px + frac{p^2}{4} &= 2px x^2 - 3px + frac{p^2}{4} &= 0. end{align*} This is a quadratic equation in x, and since A and B lie on the parabola, the y-coordinates of the midpoints of AB must be 2 (the y-coordinate of the given point left(-frac{p}{2}, 2right)). Therefore, we must have the average value of y for A and B equal to 2, which implies that since the y-coordinate for F is 0, due to the slope of the line l, the y-coordinates for both A and B will be the same and must be 2.

Simplify to get 4sinÎ¸ - 2sin^2Î¸ = 1 - 2sin^2Î¸, which implies 4sinÎ¸ = 1. 4. Solve for sinÎ¸: sinÎ¸ = frac{1}{4}. With sinÎ¸ = frac{1}{4} and Î¸â(0,frac{Ï}{4}), we can now find sin(2Î¸+frac{Ï}{2}): 1. Use the identity sin(2Î¸+frac{Ï}{2}) = cos2Î¸. 2.

Step 1: Determine the condition for f(x) to be increasing. For f(x) to be increasing on left(0,+infty right), its derivative f'(x) must be greater than or equal to 0 for all x in left(0,+infty right). Step 2: Calculate f'(x) and set the inequality. f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(e^x + frac{1}{2}ax^2 - 1right) = e^x + ax. Therefore, we have e^x + ax geqslant 0 for all x in left(0,+infty right).

Thus, we have: [ B_{i-1} angle A_i P = alpha_{2i-1} quad text{and} quad PA_iangle B_i = alpha_{2i} ] Note that the quadrilateral ( PB_i A_i B_{i-1} ) is a cyclic quadrilateral because both ( PB_{i-1}A_iangle ) and ( PB_i A_i angle ) are right angles (90 degrees). 3. **Angles of Triangle ( B_1 B_2 B_3 ):** From the cyclic property, the opposite angles add up to 180 degrees. The inscribed angle theorem gives us: [ PB_i B_{i-1} angle = PA_i B_{i-1} angle = alpha_{2i-1} quad text{and} quad PB_{i-1} B_i angle = PA_i B_i angle = alpha_{2i} ] Hence, the angles of ( triangle B_1 B_2 B_3 ) are: [ begin{align*} angle B_3 B_1 B_2 &= PB_1 B_3 angle + PB_1 B_2 angle = alpha_1 + alpha_4, angle B_1 B_2 B_3 &= PB_2 B_1 angle + PB_2 B_3 angle = alpha_3 + alpha_6, angle B_2 B_3 B_1 &= PB_3 B_2 angle + PB_3 B_1 angle = alpha_5 + alpha_2. end{align*} ] 4. **Repeated Construction:** Perform the same construction from ( B_1 B_2 B_3 ) to obtain ( C_1 C_2 C_3 ): [ begin{align*} angle C_3 C_1 C_2 &= alpha_1 + alpha_6, angle C_1 C_2 C_3 &= alpha_3 + alpha_2, angle C_2 C_3 C_1 &= alpha_5 + alpha_4. end{align*} ] Similarly, construct ( D_1 D_2 D_3 ) from ( C_1 C_2 C_3 ): [ begin{align*} angle D_3 D_1 D_2 &= alpha_1 + alpha_2, angle D_1 D_2 D_3 &= alpha_3 + alpha_4, angle D_2 D_3 D_1 &= alpha_5 + alpha_6. end{align*} ] 5. **Conclusion:** The angles in ( triangle D_1 D_2 D_3 ) match exactly the angles in ( triangle A_1 A_2 A_3 ), implying that ( triangle D_1 D_2 D_3 ) is similar to ( triangle A_1 A_2 A_3 ).

So, the total height of these three dwarves is: 88 + 84 + 76 = 248 cm Now, the total height of the 5 dwarves (including Red and Green) is the sum of the heights of Blue, Black, Yellow, Red, and Green: 248 + R + G = 408 We can rearrange this to find the sum of the heights of Red and Green: R + G = 408 - 248 R + G = 160 Now, let's consider the average height without the tallest (Red) and without the shortest (Green).

The total length of the string used for the 6-inch wicks would be 6x inches, and the total length of the string used for the 12-inch wicks would be 12y inches. The sum of these lengths should equal the total length of the string, which is 180 inches. So we have the equation: 6x + 12y = 180 Since Amy cuts an equal number of 6-inch and 12-inch wicks, we have x = y.

This process continues until only one card remains on the table. The question is: Is there a card A in the initial arrangement such that if any card other than A is taken first, the last remaining card will always be A?","completion":"1. **Existence of Card ( A )** To begin, suppose that there are two cards labeled ( A ) and ( B ), where ( A ) is immediately ahead of ( B ) when arranged in clockwise order. We will then demonstrate how this special card ( A ) can always remain until the end under certain conditions. 2. **Assuming Initial Values on Cards** Let's consider assigning arbitrary values to these cards as follows: - Assign an arbitrary value to card ( A ). - Assign the value ( 2 ) to card ( B ). - Assign the value ( 1 ) to all the remaining cards. 3. **Procedure for Selecting Cards** According to the problem, Vasya performs the operation of picking a card, noting the number ( k ) on it, counting ( k ) cards (clockwise), and then picking the kth card. This process repeats until only one card remains. 4. **Behavior Analysis** If Vasya initially picks any card other than ( A ), he will always pick the next card in a 1-step manner due to the value ( 1 ) on most of the cards. Eventually, he hits card ( B ), which causes him to skip ( A ) (since card ( B ) has the value ( 2 )). This skipping ensures card ( A ) remains on the table until only ( A ) is left, making it the last card. 5. **Adding Distinct Multiples** Now, consider the condition that every card must have a unique integer written on it. If we add ( 1000! ) (the factorial of 1000) to the arbitrary values previously assigned to each card, maintaining their distinctness. This adjustment ensures the uniqueness of each card's value. 6. **Invariance of the Process** Adding unique multiples of ( 1000! ) to each initial value used does not change the ultimate behavior of the selection process. The sequences of card selections and the counting steps are purely dependent on the step size (the number written on the cards). Hence, adding ( 1000! ) to each card keeps the process invariant. 7. **Conclusion** By ensuring that the unique values on the cards remain invariant by adding ( 1000! ), we have proven that there exists at least one card ( A ) such that no matter which card is picked first, ( A ) will definitely be the last card on the table.

Let point A have coordinates (x_1, y_1) and point B have coordinates (x_2, y_2). Then we have the system of equations: begin{cases} frac{x_1^2}{a^2} - frac{y_1^2}{b^2} = 1, frac{x_2^2}{a^2} - frac{y_2^2}{b^2} = 1. end{cases} Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us: frac{x_1^2 - x_2^2}{a^2} - frac{y_1^2 - y_2^2}{b^2} = 0, which simplifies to: frac{x_1 + x_2}{a^2} = frac{y_1 + y_2}{b^2}, and since x_1 + x_2 = 2x_N and y_1 + y_2 = 2y_N, where (x_N, y_N) are the coordinates of the midpoint N, we get: frac{x_N}{a^2} = frac{y_N}{b^2}. By substituting x_N = -12 and y_N = -15, we have: frac{-12}{a^2} = frac{-15}{b^2}, which simplifies to: frac{4b^2}{a^2} = frac{15}{12} = frac{5}{4}. The slope of line AB is the slope of line segment connecting F to N, given by: text{slope of AB} = frac{y_N - y_F}{x_N - x_F} = frac{-15 - 0}{-12 - 3} = 1. Equating the slope to its equivalent ratio from the earlier derived equality, we have: 4b^2 = 5a^2. Substitute the expression into a^2 + b^2 = 9 to find a^2 and subsequently b^2: a^2 + frac{5}{4}a^2 = 9, which results in: frac{9}{4} a^2 = 9, a^2 = 4.

This is a common technique to solve problems involving movement constraints on a grid. - Assign the top left square as white. Thus, squares (1,1) is white, (1,2) is black, and so on. - This pattern ensures that any move from a black square results in landing on a white square and vice versa. 3. **Initial Position:** - Since (1,2) is a black square by our coloring scheme, the insect starts on a black square. 4. **Movement Analysis:** - Each jump alternates the color of the square (from black to white or white to black). - To visit all squares exactly once, the insect would need to follow a path that alternates colors continuously. 5. **Count Number of Squares:** - The chessboard has a total of 49 squares. - Since it's a 7 times 7 board: - 4 rows each starting with a white square: 4 times 4 = 16 white squares - 3 rows each starting with a black square: 3 times 4 + 3 (since it has one less) = 15 black squares Therefore, there are: - 25 black squares - 24 white squares 6. **Check Consistency:** - For the insect to move through all 49 squares non-repetitively, it must always land on a differently colored square (black-to-white or white-to-black). - There is a necessity to jump onto 25 black and 24 white squares. - However, given there's an imbalance (it would need 25 white and 24 black to balance start from black and not repeat). 7. **Conclusion:** - As the math above indicates an inherent imbalance: - Since the board contains 25 black and 24 white squares, starting from a black square means the color alternation fails to complete all squares properly due to mismatching counts (can't balance jumping onto each needed square).

Transforming ln x^2 leqslant mx into frac{m}{2} geqslant frac{ln x}{x}, we define v(x) = frac{ln x}{x} and find its derivative: [ v'(x) = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2} ] v(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, e) and monotonically decreasing on (e, +infty). Therefore, v(x) reaches its maximum value at x = e, giving v(e) = frac{1}{e}. Hence, we conclude that m geqslant frac{2}{e}.

First, recognize that sqrt{8} = sqrt{2^3} = 2sqrt{2} and sqrt{10} can be left as is since it doesn't simplify nicely. 2. Substituting these simplifications back into the original expression gives us: sqrt{2}(2sqrt{2} + sqrt{10}). 3. Simplifying further, we use the property that sqrt{2}cdotsqrt{2} = 2, so the expression becomes: 2cdot2 + sqrt{2}cdotsqrt{10}. 4. Recognizing that sqrt{2}cdotsqrt{10} = sqrt{20}, and since sqrt{16} = 4 and sqrt{25} = 5, we know that sqrt{20} is between 4 and 5. Therefore, sqrt{2}cdotsqrt{10} = 2sqrt{5}. 5. Now, we have the expression simplified to 4 + 2sqrt{5}. Next, we estimate the value of 2sqrt{5}: 1. Since 2.5^2 = 6.25, it's clear that 2 < sqrt{5} < 2.5 because 5 is between 4 (2^2) and 6.25 (2.5^2). 2. Multiplying the inequality by 2 gives us 4 < 2sqrt{5} < 5. Adding 4 to each part of the inequality, we get: 1. 4 + 4 < 4 + 2sqrt{5} < 4 + 5. 2. Simplifying this, we find 8 < 4 + 2sqrt{5} < 9.

So, we need the digits 0 through 3 for the tens place and digits 0 through 9 for the units place. 2. **Shared Digits on Both Dice:** - Each die must contain the digits 0, 1, and 2, because those appear frequently in the tens place (for dates like 01â09, 10â19, and 20â29). - This leaves three faces on each die for additional digits. 3. **Remaining Digits:** - After placing 0, 1, and 2 on both dice, there are 6 positions left (3 on each die). - The remaining digits we need to distribute are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Thus, we have 6 points in total: A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, and O. 2. **Calculation and Justification:** To ensure that any 3 points out of these 6 form an isosceles triangle, we need to analyze two possible cases: - **Case 1:** Any chosen 3 points include O: - Let these 3 points be O and any two vertices of the pentagon, say A_i and A_j. - Since O is the center of the pentagon, the distances OA_i and OA_j are equal (radii of the circumcircle of the pentagon). - Therefore, triangle OA_iA_j is an isosceles triangle. - **Case 2:** The chosen 3 points are vertices of the pentagon, say A_i, A_j, and A_k: - If these 3 vertices are adjacent, then triangle A_iA_jA_k is naturally an isosceles triangle because of the symmetry of the pentagon. - If these vertices are not adjacent, consider the sides of the triangle formed: - Suppose A_i and A_j are connected, but A_k is not connected directly to A_i or A_j. - In a regular pentagon, the diagonals (which connect non-adjacent vertices) are equal in length, ensuring that any such formed triangle still respects the isosceles property regarding opposite vertices. 3. **Conclusion:** Any group of 3 points selected from the group {A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, O} will always result in an isosceles triangle, either by including O or purely by the properties of the pentagon.

At least one of these angles must be at least ( 90^circ ). Assume ( angle BAX geq 90^circ ).

For a nine-digit number to be a palindrome, it needs to take the form overline{a b c d e d c b a}. 3. Letâs consider the nine-digit number overline{a b c d e f g h i}. For this to be a nearly palindrome, three out of the corresponding pairs: (a, i), (b, h), (c, g), (d, f), must match, and one pair should differ. 4. There are 4 positions or pairs that we need to examine: (1 text{ and } 9), (2 text{ and } 8), (3 text{ and } 7), and (4 text{ and } 6). 5. To make it a nearly palindrome, exactly one of these pairs can differ, while the others must be identical. There are 4 ways to choose which pair differs. 6. We now calculate the total number of nearly palindromes by analyzing two distinct cases: **Case 1**: When pairs (1 text{ and } 9) are chosen as the differing pair: - This pair must have nonzero digits for position 1. - The middle digit e can be any digit from 0 to 9. - Therefore, the number of ways these pairs can be chosen is: * [overline{a neq i}]: 9 choices for a (because it cannot be 0) * For all other pairs that must be identical: * (2, 8): 10 choices (digits 0-9) * (3, 7): 10 choices (digits 0-9) * (4, 6): 10 choices (digits 0-9) - Total for this case: [ 9 cdot 10^3 cdot 10 = 90000 ] **Case 2**: When any other pair is chosen as the differing pair, excluding (1 text{ and } 9): - The pair that differs: * (2, 8): 10 times 9 = 90 ways (since (2, 8) can be any two different digits) * (3, 7): 10 times 9 = 90 ways * (4, 6): 10 times 9 = 90 ways - The pair (1, 9) must have identical nonzero digits: 9 choices for (1, 9) as (a = i). - The middle digit e can again be any digit from 0 to 9. - There are 3 possible pairs that fail: [ 3 cdot 10^4 cdot 90 = 2700000 ] 7.

(2) We present three methods to find the expression for a_n. **Method 1:** Assume that the expression for a_n is a_n = n + 1 quad (n in mathbb{N}^*). We will prove this by mathematical induction. - Base case: For n=1, a_1 = 2, which verifies the assumption. - Inductive step: Assume the assumption holds for n=k quad (k in mathbb{N}^*), i.e., a_k = k + 1. Then, a_{k+1} = -a_k + 2k + 3 = -(k+1) + 2k + 3 = (k+1) + 1, which shows that the assumption also holds for n=k+1.

Recall that for any quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is given by b^2 - 4ac. If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots, and the parabola does not intersect the x-axis, which means the entire graph of the function is either above or below the x-axis. Let's calculate the discriminant of the quadratic function f(x): Delta = (a-4)^2 - 4(1)(4-2a) = a^2 -8a + 16 - 16 + 8a = a^2. Since a varies between -1 and 1, we have Delta = a^2 leq 1. This means that the discriminant is always non-negative. However, we are given that f(x) > 0 for all x, which means that if there is a real root, the function must touch the x-axis but never go below it. The only possibility for this to happen is that the discriminant Delta must be zero to have a repeated root, and hence, the function never dips below the x-axis. Now, we need to find out when Delta = 0: Delta = a^2 = 0 implies a = 0. For a = 0, the function simplifies to f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4. Factoring this, we get: f(x) = (x-2)^2. Since (x-2)^2 geq 0 for all real numbers x, and it is only equal to zero when x = 2, we deduce that f(x) > 0 for x neq 2. Thus, the range of x where f(x) > 0 is x < 2 or x > 2.

Therefore, line CD will be the perpendicular bisector of segment AB (since it corresponds to the external angle bisector in this symmetric case). 4. **Circumcenter in Case 1**: - For triangle triangle ABD, the circumcenter is the point equidistant from A, B, and D. As CD is the perpendicular bisector of AB, the circumcenter must lie on CD. Hence, in Case 1, the circumcenter of triangle ABD lies on line CD. 5. **Case 2: CA neq CB** - Assume without loss of generality that CA > CB. 6. **Construction in Case 2**: - Extend line CB to a point E such that CE = CA. - Let F be a point on CA such that CF = CB.

Here are three constructions: **Construction 1:** - Draw five lines passing through a single point. - Draw an additional line that is neither parallel to any of the previous lines nor passes through the single point. - Result: This structure yields exactly six intersection points. **Construction 2:** - Draw three lines forming a triangle. - Draw three other lines parallel to each other, each passing through one vertex of the triangle. - Result: This also results in exactly six intersection points. **Construction 3:** - Draw three pairs of parallel lines. - Arrange such that no two lines among the three pairs are parallel. - Result: This configuration also gives exactly six points of intersection. 3. **Verify configurations with examples:** **Example for Construction 1:** - Draw a diagram: Five lines (L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4, L_5) intersecting at a single point P.

Additionally, there is a switch for each row and each column. Each time a switch is used: - All the bulbs in that row or column change their state (i.e., on bulbs turn off and off bulbs turn on). 2. **Initial Configuration**: The initial setup mentioned is that exactly one bulb is on. Let's denote this grid mathematically with each bulb having a binary state, where 1 means \\"on\\" and 0 means \\"off\\". The total initial number of bulbs can be represented as a binary matrix with exactly one 1 and thirty-five 0s. 3. **Parity Consideration**: Define the parity of a configuration as the sum of all elements (i.e., count of bulbs that are on) modulo 2. Initially, the parity of the grid is (1) because there is exactly one bulb that is on, and (1 mod 2 = 1). 4. **Effect of Using a Switch**: When a switch for a row or a column is used: - The number of bulbs that change state is exactly the size of that row or column, which is 6. - Since the size of the row and the column is always even, flipping all bulbs in a row or column will always affect an even number of bulbs. - Changing the state of an even number of bulbs does not change the overall parity of the grid.

Therefore, if Igor claims to have turned all the bulbs off, this statement cannot be true if the rules were followed correctly. 6. **Possible Explanations**: - Igor's claim that he turned all the bulbs off by using the switches is false based on the mathematical reasoning above. - Another possible (but humorous) scenario is that Igor physically broke the bulb that was initially on, thus \\"turning it off\\" in a non-standard manner, but this falls outside the stated mechanics of the problem.

The discriminant Delta of a quadratic equation ax^{2} + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^{2} - 4ac. For the given function, a = 1, b = -2a, and c = a. Therefore, the discriminant of f(x) is: [ Delta = (-2a)^{2} - 4 cdot 1 cdot a = 4a^{2} - 4a. ] Setting Delta < 0 for the graph to be above the x-axis, we get: [ 4a^{2} - 4a < 0. ] Factoring out 4a, we obtain: [ 4a(a - 1) < 0. ] For this product to be negative, one factor must be positive and the other must be negative, which implies: [ 0 < a < 1. ] Thus, we have found that a necessary condition for the inequality to hold is 0 < a < 1. However, we are also considering conditions that are necessary but not necessarily sufficient. The options given are: A: 0 < a < 1 B: 0 leqslant a leqslant 1 C: 0 < a < frac{1}{2} D: a geqslant 0 Based on our derivation, option A is the direct outcome of the discriminant condition. Considering the definition of necessary but not sufficient conditions, both 0 leqslant a leqslant 1 and a geqslant 0 encompass the interval 0 < a < 1 as part of their intervals. Therefore, they are necessary but not necessarily sufficient for the inequality \\"x^{2}-2ax+a > 0 for forall xin R\\" to hold. Thus, the correct answers, following the necessary but not sufficient logic, are options B and D. Therefore, the final answer is boxed{BD}."},{"prompt":"Suppose that 10 boys and 14 girls are seated around a circular table.

Since the seating is circular, there are exactly 24 adjacent pairs to consider as each person has two neighbors. First, we calculate the probability that any given pair consists of a boy and a girl. This can happen in two ways: boy-girl or girl-boy. Assuming the seats are filled randomly, - Probability of the left seat being occupied by a boy and the right by a girl is frac{10}{24} cdot frac{14}{23}. - Probability of the left seat being occupied by a girl and the right by a boy is frac{14}{24} cdot frac{10}{23}. Summing these probabilities: [ frac{10 times 14}{24 times 23} + frac{14 times 10}{24 times 23} = frac{140}{24 times 23} + frac{140}{24 times 23} = frac{280}{552} = frac{140}{276} = frac{70}{138} ] The expected number of boy-girl pairs is then 24 (total pairs) multiplied by frac{70}{138}: [ 24 times frac{70}{138} = frac{1680}{138} = frac{280}{23} approx 12.1739 ] Thus, rounding to the nearest integer, the expected value of T is boxed{12}."},{"prompt":"Given a convex quadrilateral (ABCD) where only (angle D) is an obtuse angle. The quadrilateral is divided by some line segments into (n) obtuse triangles, but excluding (A, B, C, D), the vertices of the obtuse triangles are not on the perimeter of the quadrilateral. Prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for (n) is (n geqslant 4).","completion":"Given a convex quadrilateral ABCD, where only one internal angle, angle D, is obtuse, we need to prove that the condition for splitting ABCD into n obtuse triangles using some line segments, with no new vertices on the periphery of the quadrilateral except at A, B, C, and D, is ( n geq 4 ). Sufficiency 1. **Step 1**: We start considering a non-obtuse triangle which can always be partitioned into 3 obtuse triangles. Consider any non-obtuse triangle ( triangle ABC ). Without loss of generality, let ( A ) be any vertex or the right angle vertex in a right triangle. Draw a perpendicular ( AD ) to the side ( BC ), with ( D ) being the foot of the perpendicular. Construct a circle with ( AD ) as the radius intersecting ( AD ) at point ( G ). Choose a point ( E ) inside ( DG ) on segment ( AD ). Connecting ( E ) to ( A ), ( B ), and ( C) results in three triangles ( triangle ABE, triangle BCE, triangle CAE ). Each of these triangles is obtuse. Hence, ( triangle ABC ) can be divided into three obtuse triangles. 2. **Step 2**: In the quadrilateral (ABCD), connect the diagonal (AC). - ( triangle ACD ) is obtuse since (angle D) is obtuse. - According to Step 1, ( triangle ABC ) can be divided into three obtuse triangles ( triangle ABE, triangle BCE, triangle CAE ). - Consequently, combining with ( triangle ACD ), quadrilateral ( ABCD ) can be divided into four obtuse triangles. 3. **Step 3**: For ( n = 5, 6, 7, ldots ), - Add points ( E_1, E_2, ldots ) on side ( EC), connecting line segments ( AE_1, AE_2, ldots ). - Form new triangles ( triangle AEE_1, triangle AE_1E_2, ldots ). - Subsequently, we achieve 5, 6, 7, ldots obtuse triangles by adding points continuously. - Since the external angle ( angle A E_i C > angle A E C > 90^{circ} ), ( i=1,2, ldots), the newly created triangles are obtuse. Therefore, we can always meet the condition ( n geq 4) when partitioning into obtuse triangles. Necessity 1. **Step 1**: Observing non-obtuse triangles, itâs easy to note that they cannot be split into fewer than three obtuse triangles. This is because dividing them by non-diagonal lines doesn't create obtuse angles given the line segment restriction. 2. **Step 2**: Assume quadrilateral (ABCD) split into n obtuse triangles. - We focus on side (CD), hence it lies within one obtuse triangle, say ( triangle ECD). - If ( E ) is point ( B ), then ( triangle BCD ) is an obtuse triangle due to ( angle D). Additionally, ( triangle ABD ) turns into an acute or right triangle, which cannot be split into fewer than three obtuse triangles without violating the obtuse restriction. - If ( E ) is point ( A ), then ( triangle ABC ) follows the same deduction with ( n geq 4). - For points ( E ) located inside ( ABCD ), segments ( AC, BD ) will either partially or fully reside within the new obtuse triangles. Thus, excluding new vertices on the boundary necessitates that any arbitrary ( n geq 4 ).

After some of the water evaporates, the cucumbers are now a certain percentage of water by weight. The new weight of the cucumbers is 50 pounds. What is the new percentage of water in the cucumbers?","completion":"Initially, the cucumbers are 99% water by weight. This means that in 100 pounds of cucumbers, 99 pounds is water and 1 pound is non-water content (the solid part of the cucumber). After some water evaporates, the total weight of the cucumbers is reduced to 50 pounds. However, the non-water content does not evaporate, so it remains at 1 pound. To find the new percentage of water in the cucumbers, we need to calculate the weight of the water in the 50-pound cucumbers and then divide it by the total weight (50 pounds). The weight of the water after evaporation is the total new weight minus the non-water content: Weight of water = Total new weight - Non-water content Weight of water = 50 pounds - 1 pound Weight of water = 49 pounds Now, we can calculate the new percentage of water by weight: Percentage of water = (Weight of water / Total new weight) * 100 Percentage of water = (49 pounds / 50 pounds) * 100 Percentage of water = 0.98 * 100 Percentage of water = 98% So, the new percentage of water in the cucumbers is boxed{98%} ."},{"prompt":"Suppose (ABC) is a triangle with circumcenter (O) and orthocenter (H) such that (A), (B), (C), (O), and (H) are all on distinct points with integer coordinates.

This simplifies the calculations involving coordinates and keeps the problem symmetric. 2. **Properties of Euler Line**: - By properties of the Euler line in a triangle, the centroid G lies on the line joining the circumcenter O and the orthocenter H. - The distance relationship on the Euler line states that GH = 2GO. Also, the centroid G divides the Euler line segment HO in the ratio 2:1. - Since G is located at frac{1}{3}(A + B + C) and O is the origin, we have H = A + B + C. Given that all coordinates of A, B, and C are integers, H also has integer coordinates. 3. **Non-Right Triangle Condition**: - Note that the orthocenter H coincides with the vertex of the right angle in a right triangle. Therefore, to ensure H is distinct from A, B, and C, triangle ABC must not be a right triangle. 4. **Lattice Points on the Circumcircle**: - If a circle centered at the origin contains integer points, it has symmetrical lattice points. For instance, if (a, 0) is a point, then (-a, 0), (0, a), and (0, -a) will also be on the circle. Similarly, if (a, b) is a point, then (pm a, pm b) are also points on the circle. - To avoid forming a right triangle with only four lattice points, we need a circumcircle that contains more than four lattice points. 5. **Smallest Radius with Eight Points**: - The smallest radius for which a circle centered at the origin contains eight distinct lattice points is sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{5}. The points are (pm 1, pm 2) and (pm 2, pm 1). - Possible valid triangles with circumradius sqrt{5} include: [ A = (-1, 2), ; B = (1, 2), ; C = (2, 1) ] 6. **Next Possible Radius**: - To find the second smallest circumradius, consider the next radius where the circle includes integer points: sqrt{1^2 + 3^2} = sqrt{10}, which includes the points (pm 1, pm 3) and (pm 3, pm 1). - Possible valid triangles with circumradius sqrt{10} include: [ A = (-1, 3), ; B = (1, 3), ; C = (3, 1) ] # Conclusion: The second smallest possible value of the circumradius of ABC is: [ boxed{sqrt{10}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that point M and point P are symmetric about the xaxis, and point N and point M are symmetric about the yaxis.

According to the information given, after Jessica cut more flowers, there are now 14 roses in the vase. Since there were initially 13 roses, this means Jessica added 14 - 13 = 1 more rose. The total number of roses and orchids in the vase after Jessica added more is 91 orchids + 14 roses = 105 flowers. Before Jessica added more flowers, the total number of flowers in the vase was 13 roses + O orchids. Since the only change in the number of roses was an addition of 1, and the total number of flowers after adding was 105, we can set up the following equation: 13 roses (initial) + O orchids (initial) + 1 rose (added) = 105 flowers (final total) Combining the roses, we get: 13 roses + 1 rose + O orchids = 105 flowers 14 roses + O orchids = 105 flowers Now, we subtract the total number of roses from the final total to find the initial number of orchids: 105 flowers (final total) - 14 roses = O orchids (initial) 91 orchids (final count) = O orchids (initial) Therefore, the initial number of orchids in the vase before Jessica cut more was boxed{91} ."},{"prompt":"A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 14 inches and one of its angles is 45^circ.

Let S be the set of integers n such that [n mid a^{f(n)}1.] Prove that S has density 0 ; that is, prove that lim_{nrightarrow infty} frac{|Scap {1,...,n}|}{n}=0 .","completion":"To prove that the set ( S ) has density zero, we will use a series of lemmas and logical steps. The set ( S ) is defined as: [ S = { n in mathbb{N} mid n mid a^{f(n)} - 1 } ] 1. **Lemma 1:** Let ( L subseteq psi(P) ) be a finite set whose product of elements is denoted by ( M ). The number of values of ( n le N ) such that ( p nmid P(n) ) for each ( p in L ) is upper bounded by: [ N cdot prod_{p in L} left(1 - frac{1}{p} right) + O(1) ] for all sufficiently large ( N ). **Proof:** For each ( p in L ), there are ( p - varrho(p) ) possibilities of ( n ) modulo ( p ) such that ( p nmid P(n) ). Using the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion, we get: [ sum_{d|M} mu(d) leftlfloor frac{N}{d} rightrfloor cdot varrho(d) = N - sum_{p in L} left( frac{varrho(p) cdot N}{p} right) + sum_{p_1 < p_2 in L} left( frac{varrho(p_1) cdot varrho(p_2) N}{p_1 cdot p_2} right) + cdots + O(1) ] Simplifying, we get: [ N cdot prod_{p in L} left(1 - frac{varrho(p)}{p} right) + O(1) leq N cdot prod_{p in L} left(1 - frac{1}{p} right) + O(1) ] where ( mu ) is the MÃ¶bius function and ( omega(n) ) is the number of distinct prime divisors of ( n ). Hence the lemma is proven. 2. **Lemma 2:** Fix ( epsilon > 0 ). We can choose a finite set ( L subseteq psi(P) ) such that: [ prod_{p in L} left(1 - frac{1}{p} right) < epsilon ] **Proof:** If ( P ) has at least one linear factor in ( mathbb{Q}[x] ), then for all ( p > D ) for some constant ( D ) depending on polynomial ( P ), the congruence ( P(n) equiv 0 pmod{p} ) has at least one solution, and hence ( psi(P) ) has relative density 1 in ( mathbb{P} ). In other cases, ( P ) has at least one irreducible factor ( G ) of degree ( d geq 2 ). By an application of Chebotarev's density theorem on ( G ), we obtain that ( psi(P) ) has at least a positive relative density in ( mathbb{P} ). Now assume that we have chosen a set ( L ) satisfying the conditions. Taking logarithms of ( prod_{p in L} left(1 - frac{1}{p} right) ), it reduces to: [ ln left( prod_{p in L} left(1 - frac{1}{p} right) right) = sum_{p in L} ln left(1 - frac{1}{p} right) < sum_{p in L} frac{-1}{p} < ln epsilon ] As we know that ( psi(P) ) has positive lower density, we can clearly have such a finite set ( L subseteq psi(P) ) satisfying the conditions of the lemma statement as the sum of reciprocals of primes can become arbitrarily large. 3. **Lemma 3:** The density of the set ( U = { k mid d mid P(k) } ) for some polynomial ( P ) tends to zero as ( d ) tends to infinity, i.e., [ lim_{d rightarrow infty} frac{varrho(d)}{d} = 0 ] **Proof:** Take a fixed natural ( m ) and fix sets ( U_1, U_2, ldots, U_m ) such that ( U_i = { k mid { k, k+i } in U } ). We will induct on ( deg(P) ). The base case of ( deg(P) = 0 ) and ( deg(P) = 1 ) is trivial. Clearly, [ |U cap [1, n]| le sum_{i=0}^m |U_i cap [1, n]| + frac{n}{m} ] In each ( U_i ), ( P(x+i) - P(x) ) is a polynomial of lesser degree. Applying the inductive hypothesis for all ( i ), the values of ( x ) such that ( P(x+i) - P(x) equiv 0 pmod{d} ) has zero density. Since ( m ) is arbitrary, taking ( m ) to be large, we conclude that ( U ) has density zero. 4. **Main Proof:** Assume for contradiction that the set ( S ) has lower density ( epsilon > 0 ). Choose ( L ) where each prime ( p > z ) for some large ( a ) (whose choice we will specify later) and a small constant ( gamma > 0 ) such that: [ log left( frac{4}{epsilon} right) leq sum_{p in L} frac{1}{p} < frac{epsilon}{4 cdot gamma} ] By Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, the number of values of ( n ) less than ( N ) such that ( p nmid P(n) ) for each ( p in L ) is upper bounded by: [ N cdot prod_{p in L} left(1 - frac{1}{p} right) + O(1) leq N cdot exp left( -sum_{p in L} frac{1}{p} right) + O(1) < N cdot frac{epsilon}{4} + O(1) ] For the rest of the values of ( n ), we must have ( P(n) equiv 0 pmod{p} ) for some prime of ( L ). For all such primes, ( d = mathrm{ord}_{p}(a) mid F(n) ). So, [ P(n) equiv 0 pmod{p} tag{1} ] [ F(n) equiv 0 pmod{d} tag{2} ] By the Chinese Remainder Theorem applied on (1) and (2), the number of such ( n ) is upper bounded by: [ S = N cdot sum_{p in L} frac{varrho(d)}{d} cdot frac{deg(P)}{p} + O(1) ] If we choose large ( z ) such that ( d ) is also large (as ( d > log_2{p} )), then by Lemma 3 applied on ( F ), we can conclude that: [ S le N gamma cdot sum_{p in L} frac{1}{p} + O(1) < N cdot frac{epsilon}{4} + O(1) ] Summing up, we get that the upper density of the set ( S ) is bounded above by ( frac{epsilon}{2} ), leading to a contradiction.

We do not have explicit constraints provided, so we can assume the variables x and y can take any real values. The gradient (i.e., the vector of the partial derivatives) of the objective function must be zero at the point of minimum, if it's an interior point minimum in case of unconstrained problems, or otherwise should be pointing away from the feasible region if it's on the boundary: nabla z = begin{bmatrix} frac{partial z}{partial x} frac{partial z}{partial y} end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} a 2 end{bmatrix} Since the gradient is constant and does not depend on x and y, it cannot be zero unless a = 0. However, since at (1,0) the function is supposed to have a minimum, the direction of decrease towards the minimum must be maintained. The direction of the objective function's decrease is opposite to the gradient. Since the component of the gradient in the y-direction is 2 (which is positive), decreasing y would decrease z. Therefore, the only concern is about the x-component of the gradient, a: 1. For a > 0, the function decreases when x decreases, which would mean that the point (1,0) cannot be the unique minimum as the function would decrease for x < 1. 2. For a < 0, the function decreases when x increases, which suggests that (1,0) can be a minimum. However, the problem states that (1,0) is the unique minimum. This leads us to consider the function behavior as x to pm infty. For z to have a unique minimum at (1,0), the function must go to infinity as x to infty, and that will happen only if a is negative. We still need a limit for a for which (1,0) is the unique extreme point. For the values 0 > a > -2, z can be minimum at points like (0,y). For a leq -2, the term ax will always dominate over 2y as x goes to +infty or -infty, ensuring the point (1,0) is the unique minimum. So to avoid a situation where other points might become minima, a should be less than -2. On the other end, for a very negative, the term ax would dominate, and potentially there would be a minimum for x large enough in the negative direction. Without other constraints, we assume that as a becomes decreasingly large in the negative direction, the minimizing x value shifts away from x = 1. Therefore, for the function z to uniquely have its minimum at (1,0), the value of a must be greater than -4 but less than -2. The value a = -4 is specifically excluded because at that value, there could be another minimum to the left of (1,0) due to the symmetry of the slope of z.

From these equations we can write: [ q - 2p^2 = 5^s, ] [ q + 2p^2 = 5^t. ] Adding and subtracting these equations gives: [ (q + 2p^2) - (q - 2p^2) = 5^t - 5^s ] [ implies 4p^2 = 5^t - 5^s ] Therefore, we have: [ 4p^2 = 5^s (5^{t-s} - 1). ] Now, consider two cases: ( s > 0 ) and ( s = 0 ). # Case 1: ( s > 0 ) If ( s > 0 ), then ( 5^s ) must be a positive power of 5. Since ( 5^s ) is a power of 5, ( 5 ) divides ( 4p^2 ). However, because 5 does not divide 4, 5 must divide ( p^2 ). Since ( p ) is a prime number, ( p ) must be 5. Substitute ( p = 5 ): [ 4p^2 = 4 times 5^2 = 100, ] [ q - 2p^2 = q - 2 times 25 = q - 50, ] [ q + 2p^2 = q + 50. ] Thus evaluating, [ q - 50 = 1 implies q = 51, ] [ q + 50 = 251. ] Then, [ 5^p = (51 - 50)(51 + 50) = 1 times 101 = 101. ] This contradicts the given, as ( 5^5 = 3125 ). Hence, ( s neq 0 ). # Case 2: ( s = 0 ) If ( s = 0 ): [ 4p^2 = 5^0 (5^t - 1) implies 4p^2 = 5^t - 1. ] We take ( t = p ) since the sum of ( s ) and ( t ) is ( p ): [ 5^p = 4p^2 + 1. ] We shall prove by induction that ( 5^k > 4k^2 + 1 ) for every integer ( k geq 2 ). **Base Case: ( k = 2 )** For ( k = 2 ): [ 5^2 = 25 ] [ 4 cdot 2^2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 ] [ 25 > 17, ] hence the base case holds. **Inductive Step:** Assume the inequality holds for some ( k geq 2 ), i.e., [ 5^k > 4k^2 + 1. ] We need to show that ( 5^{k+1} > 4(k+1)^2 + 1 ). Consider: [ 5^{k+1} = 5 times 5^k > 5 times (4k^2 + 1) ] since we assumed (5^k > 4k^2 + 1): [ 5 times (4k^2 + 1) = 20k^2 + 5. ] Now, we need to show: [ 20k^2 + 5 > 4(k+1)^2 + 1. ] Calculating ( 4(k+1)^2 + 1 ): [ 4(k+1)^2 + 1 = 4(k^2 + 2k + 1) + 1 = 4k^2 + 8k + 4 + 1 = 4k^2 + 8k + 5. ] So we need: [ 20k^2 + 5 > 4k^2 + 8k + 5. ] Subtracting 5 from both sides: [ 20k^2 > 4k^2 + 8k. ] Simplify and factorize: [ 16k^2 > 8k ] [ 2k > 1 ] [ text{which is true for } k geq 2. ] Thus by induction, ( 5^k > 4k^2 + 1 ) for every integer ( k geq 2 ). Hence ( 5^p = 4p^2 + 1 ) cannot hold for primes ( p geq 2 ). Checking smaller primes: For ( p = 2 ): [ 5^2 + 4 cdot 2^4 = 25 + 4 cdot 16 = 25 + 64 = 89 ] which is not a square.

If Jen ate some of the remaining jam for dinner and had 0.5714285714285714 of the jam left after dinner, what fraction of the remaining jam did she eat for dinner?","completion":"Let's denote the total amount of jam as J. Jen ate 1/3 of the jam for lunch, so she had 2/3 of the jam left after lunch. After dinner, she had 0.5714285714285714 of the original amount of jam left. This is equivalent to 4/7 of the jam when converted to a fraction (since 4/7 is approximately 0.5714285714285714). Now, we need to find out what fraction of the remaining jam (after lunch) she ate for dinner. We know that she had 2/3 of the jam left after lunch and 4/7 of the jam left after dinner. Let's denote the fraction of the remaining jam she ate for dinner as x. Then, the amount of jam she had left after dinner would be (1 - x) times the amount she had after lunch. So, we have the equation: (1 - x) * (2/3) = 4/7 To find x, we solve for it: 2/3 - (2/3)x = 4/7 Now, we need to isolate x: (2/3)x = 2/3 - 4/7 To subtract these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 7 is 21, so we convert both fractions to have the denominator of 21: (2/3)x = (14/21) - (12/21) (2/3)x = 2/21 Now, we solve for x by dividing both sides by (2/3): x = (2/21) / (2/3) x = (2/21) * (3/2) x = 1/7 So, Jen ate boxed{1/7} of the remaining jam for dinner."},{"prompt":"Evaluate the integral int_{1}^{e} frac{1}{x}dx.","completion":"To solve, we find the antiderivative of frac{1}{x}, then apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate the definite integral.

How many seeds are sown per row in the top bed?","completion":"Let's denote the number of seeds sown per row in the top bed as x. There are 2 large beds on top, each with 4 rows, so there are a total of 2 * 4 = 8 rows in the top beds. There are 2 medium beds on the bottom, each with 3 rows, so there are a total of 2 * 3 = 6 rows in the medium beds. We know that each row in the medium beds has 20 seeds, so the total number of seeds in the medium beds is 6 rows * 20 seeds/row = 120 seeds. Grace can plant a total of 320 seeds in all four beds. Since we know the number of seeds in the medium beds, we can subtract that from the total to find out how many seeds are planted in the top beds: 320 seeds (total) - 120 seeds (medium beds) = 200 seeds (top beds). Now we can find out how many seeds are sown per row in the top beds by dividing the total number of seeds in the top beds by the number of rows in the top beds: 200 seeds (top beds) / 8 rows (top beds) = 25 seeds/row.

(2) Find the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) in the interval left[frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{4}right] and the corresponding values of the variable x.","completion":"(1) Since f(x) = Asin(omega x + varphi) (A > 0, omega > 0, |varphi| < frac{pi}{2}), and the graph of this function passes through point C left(frac{3pi}{8}, 0right), where the y-coordinate is zero, we know that frac{3pi}{8} is at the axis intercept of the sine function. Additionally, there is a highest point D left(frac{pi}{8}, 2right) adjacent to point C, indicating that D is a peak of the sine function. To find the amplitude A, we use the y-coordinate of point D, which gives us A = 2. For the period T, we can use the fact that the distance between a peak and its adjacent zero crossing is frac{T}{4}. Therefore, we have frac{T}{4} = frac{3pi}{8} - frac{pi}{8} = frac{pi}{4}. Solving for T, we get T = pi. From the period, we can find omega using the formula omega = frac{2pi}{T}. Thus, omega = frac{2pi}{pi} = 2. To find the phase shift varphi, we use the fact that for point D, the sine function attains its maximum value (which is 1): sinleft(2 cdot frac{pi}{8} + varphiright) = 1. Since sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = 1, this implies 2 cdot frac{pi}{8} + varphi = frac{pi}{2}. Solving this for varphi, we obtain varphi = frac{pi}{4}. Combining these values, we get the function: f(x) = 2sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{4}right). (2) From part (1), we know that our function within the interval -frac{pi}{4} leq x leq frac{pi}{4} translates to the sine function argument 2x + frac{pi}{4} being in the interval left[-frac{pi}{4}, frac{3pi}{4}right]. Thus, the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the specified interval occur at the endpoints or at the points where the sine function attains its maximum (1) and minimum (-1) values: For the minimum of f(x), the sine function has value -1 when its argument is 3pi/2 or an odd multiple of pi/2. The lower endpoint -frac{pi}{4} satisfies this condition: 2left(-frac{pi}{4}right) + frac{pi}{4} = -frac{pi}{4}. Thus, we have the minimum value of f(x) as fleft(-frac{pi}{4}right) = 2left(-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) = -sqrt{2}. For the maximum of f(x), the sine function has value 1 when its argument is pi/2. This occurs when x = frac{pi}{8}: 2left(frac{pi}{8}right) + frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{2}. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is fleft(frac{pi}{8}right) = 2 cdot 1 = 2. Hence, the minimum value is boxed{-sqrt{2}} when x = -frac{pi}{4}, and the maximum value is boxed{2} when x = frac{pi}{8}."},{"prompt":"Amanda received some money as a gift.

Since pi is approximately 3.14, which is greater than 3, log_{pi}3 will be less than 1 because pi to the power of 1 is pi itself, which is greater than 3. 3. c = log_{2}0.5 is the power to which 2 must be raised to get 0.5.

Find the sum of the coordinates of point A. Specify all possible values. 1. Let's denote the graphs of the functions y = ax + 4, y = 2x + b, and y = frac{a}{2}x + 8 by l_1, l_2, and l_3, respectively. 2. According to the problem, l_1, l_2, and l_3 intersect pairwise (meaning each point A, B, C belongs to two of these lines). First, it's clear that the case where a = 0 is impossible, otherwise the lines y = ax + 4 and y = frac{a}{2}x + 8 would be parallel. 3. The point C lies on the Oy axis and on two of the three lines. This means their equations, when substituting x = 0, give the same values (equal to the ordinate of point C). Consequently, C cannot be the intersection point of l_1 and l_3. 4. The line l_1 intersects the Oy axis at -frac{4}{a}, the line l_2 at -frac{b}{2}, and the line l_3 at frac{-16}{a}. Among these three numbers, there are two equal ones (equal to the abscissa of point B). Clearly, -frac{4}{a} neq frac{-16}{a}, meaning two cases are possible. **Case 1:** -frac{4}{a} = -frac{b}{2}. This means l_1 and l_2 intersect at point B. 5. Since -frac{4}{a} = -frac{b}{2}, we have: [ -frac{4}{a} = -frac{b}{2} implies frac{4}{a} = frac{b}{2} implies b = frac{8}{a} ] 6. Point C is the intersection of lines l_2 and l_3, so their equations when x = 0 coincide, giving b = 8. Hence: [ frac{8}{a} = 8 implies a = 1 ] 7. Therefore, points A is the intersection of l_1 and l_3, which are given by the functions y = x + 4 and y = frac{1}{2}x + 8, respectively. 8.

Thus, the coordinates of point A are (8, 12), and their sum is: [ 8 + 12 = 20 ] **Case 2:** -frac{b}{2} = frac{-16}{a}. This means l_2 and l_3 intersect at point B. 10. Since - frac{b}{2} = frac{-16}{a}, we have: [ frac{b}{2} = frac{16}{a} implies b = frac{32}{a} ] 11. Point C is the intersection of lines l_1 and l_2, so their equations when x = 0 must coincide, implying b = 4. Hence: [ frac{32}{a} = 4 implies a = 8 ] 12. Therefore, points A is the intersection of l_1 and l_3, given by the functions y = 8x + 4 and y = 4x + 8, respectively. 13.

Find all functions f: mathbf{Z}_{+} rightarrow mathbf{Z}_{+} such that for any m, n in mathbf{Z}_{+}, the condition (f(m) + f(n)) mid (m + n + l)^{k} holds. 1. **Case 1: l is odd** Assume l is an odd number. Choose m = n. Then we have: 2f(m) mid (2m + l)^{k}. Since l is odd, 2m + l is also odd, implying (2m + l)^k is also odd. However, 2f(m) is even, which creates a contradiction because an even number cannot divide an odd number. Hence, when l is odd, there does not exist a function f that satisfies the given condition. 2. **Case 2: l is even** Assume l = 2c for some integer c. We conjecture that f(n) = n + c. Let's prove this by examining the condition in the problem. First, we prove an auxiliary lemma: For any m in mathbf{Z}_{+}, the following holds: f(m+1) - f(m) = pm 1. **Proof of the Lemma**: Since f is not a constant function, |f(m+1) - f(m)| neq 0. Suppose there is a prime p such that: p mid (f(m+1) - f(m)). Choose e such that p^{e} > m + l.

Since fleft(p^{e}-m-lright) + f(m) geq 2, we have: p mid left(fleft(p^{e}-m-lright) + f(m)right). By further assumption: p mid left(fleft(p^{e}-m-1right) + f(m+1)right) implies left(fleft(p^{e}-m-1right) + f(m+1)right) mid left(p^{e}+1right)^{k}. This situation leads to a contradiction, thereby proving the lemma. 3. **Finding the form of f(n)**: From the lemma, we conclude: f(n) leq f(n-1) + 1 leq cdots leq f(1) + (n-1). Next, choose a sufficiently large prime p such that: p > l + 1 quad text{and} quad p^2 > p + 2f(1) - l - 2. We note: left(f(1) + f(p-l-1)right) mid (p-l-1+l+1)^{k} implies left(f(1) + f(p-l-1)right) mid p^{k}. We have: f(1) + f(p-l-1) leq f(1) + (f(1) + p - l - 2) < p^2. Hence: f(p-l-1) = p - f(1). Similarly, for another prime q: f(q-l-1) = q - f(1). Thus, p - f(1) = q - f(1) leq f(q-l-2) + 1 leq cdots leq f(q-l-1) + (p - q) = q - f(1) + (p - q) = p - f(1).

We need to show that for all n, a_n is a rational number which can be written with an odd denominator. 2. **Base Case:** We start with a_1 = tan(theta) = 2. Clearly, 2 is a rational number and can be written as frac{2}{1}, where the denominator 1 is odd. 3. **Inductive Step:** We use the double-angle formula for tangent: [ tan(2alpha) = frac{2tan(alpha)}{1 - tan^2(alpha)} ] Applying this to theta, we get: [ tan(2theta) = frac{2tan(theta)}{1 - tan^2(theta)} = frac{2 cdot 2}{1 - 2^2} = frac{4}{-3} = -frac{4}{3} ] Thus, a_2 = tan(2theta) = -frac{4}{3}, which is a rational number with an odd denominator. 4. **General Case:** We assume that for some k ge 1, a_k = tan(ktheta) is a rational number of the form frac{p_k}{q_k} where q_k is odd. We need to show that a_{k+1} = tan((k+1)theta) is also a rational number with an odd denominator. 5. **Using the Addition Formula:** We use the tangent addition formula: [ tan((k+1)theta) = tan(ktheta + theta) = frac{tan(ktheta) + tan(theta)}{1 - tan(ktheta) tan(theta)} ] Substituting a_k = frac{p_k}{q_k} and tan(theta) = 2, we get: [ tan((k+1)theta) = frac{frac{p_k}{q_k} + 2}{1 - frac{p_k}{q_k} cdot 2} = frac{p_k + 2q_k}{q_k - 2p_k} ] Since p_k and q_k are integers and q_k is odd, p_k + 2q_k and q_k - 2p_k are also integers. We need to check the parity of the denominator q_k - 2p_k. 6. **Parity Check:** Since q_k is odd, 2p_k is even, and thus q_k - 2p_k is odd. Therefore, the denominator of tan((k+1)theta) remains odd. 7. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that for all n, a_n = tan(ntheta) is a rational number with an odd denominator. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that a, b, and c are all positive real numbers, which of the following statements is true about the three numbers a + frac{1}{b}, b + frac{1}{c}, and c + frac{1}{a} ( )?

To solve 15y equiv 13 pmod{17}, we need the modular inverse of 15 modulo 17. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find: 15 times 7 = 105 equiv 1 pmod{17}, so the modular inverse of 15 is 7.

We need 100 leq 17k + 6 leq 999, leading to: frac{100 - 6}{17} leq k leq frac{999 - 6}{17}. Simplifying, we find: 5.53 leq k leq 58.41.

This suggests a pattern where ( n ) might need to be a multiple of 3. 2. **Verification Through Mathematical Proof:** Hypothesize that ( 2^n - 1 ) is divisible by 7 if and only if ( n ) is a multiple of 3. Let's verify this hypothesis. Case 1: ( n = 3k ) Suppose ( n ) is a multiple of 3, i.e., ( n = 3k ) for some natural number ( k ): [ 2^n - 1 = 2^{3k} - 1 = (2^3)^k - 1 = 8^k - 1 ] Since ( 8 equiv 1 pmod{7} ), we have: [ 8^k equiv 1^k equiv 1 pmod{7} ] Therefore, [ 8^k - 1 equiv 1 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{7} ] This confirms that ( 8^k - 1 ) is divisible by 7 for any natural number ( k ). Case 2: ( n = 3k + 1 ) Suppose ( n ) has the form ( 3k + 1 ): [ 2^n - 1 = 2^{3k + 1} - 1 = 2 cdot 2^{3k} - 1 = 2 cdot 8^k - 1 ] Using the fact that ( 8 equiv 1 pmod{7} ), we get: [ 2 cdot 8^k - 1 equiv 2 cdot 1 - 1 equiv 2 - 1 equiv 1 pmod{7} ] Hence, ( 2^{3k + 1} - 1 notequiv 0 pmod{7} ), meaning it is not divisible by 7. Case 3: ( n = 3k + 2 ) Suppose ( n ) has the form ( 3k + 2 ): [ 2^n - 1 = 2^{3k + 2} - 1 = 4 cdot 2^{3k} - 1 = 4 cdot 8^k - 1 ] Using the fact that ( 8 equiv 1 pmod{7} ), we get: [ 4 cdot 8^k - 1 equiv 4 cdot 1 - 1 equiv 4 - 1 equiv 3 pmod{7} ] Hence, ( 2^{3k + 2} - 1 notequiv 0 pmod{7} ), meaning it is not divisible by 7. 3. **Conclusion:** Given these cases, we conclude that ( 2^n - 1 ) is divisible by 7 if and only if ( n ) is a multiple of 3.

We can now solve for b^2: b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 4^2 - 2^2 = 16 - 4 = 12 Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola, centered at the origin with a horizontal transverse axis, is: frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 Rightarrow frac{x^2}{4} - frac{y^2}{12} = 1 So the answer is boxed{frac{x^2}{4} - frac{y^2}{12} = 1}.

We take the indices modulo ( n ). 2. **Claim**: We can always find ( i neq j ) such that [ a_{i-1} geq a_j geq a_i geq a_{j-1} ] **Proof of Claim**: Without loss of generality, assume ( a_1 = max{a_k mid 1 leq k leq n} ).

Therefore, the total number of devices that these red cables will connect is supposed to be: [ 2 times text{(Number of red cables)} ] Since we assumed there are 13 red cables, we write: [ 2 times 13 = 26 ] This result suggests that 26 devices would need to be connected if each device is connected by exactly one red cable.

According to the information given: A = 2E (Adelaide bought twice the number of ducks that Ephraim bought) E = K - 45 (Ephraim bought 45 fewer ducks than Kolton) The average number of ducks bought by the three is 35, so the total number of ducks bought by the three is 3 times the average: Total ducks = 3 * 35 = 105 We can express the total number of ducks as the sum of ducks bought by each person: A + E + K = 105 Now, we can substitute A with 2E (from the first equation): 2E + E + K = 105 3E + K = 105 We also know that E = K - 45, so we can substitute E in the equation above: 3(K - 45) + K = 105 3K - 135 + K = 105 4K - 135 = 105 4K = 105 + 135 4K = 240 K = 240 / 4 K = 60 Now that we know K (the number of ducks Kolton bought), we can find E: E = K - 45 E = 60 - 45 E = 15 Finally, we can find A (the number of ducks Adelaide bought): A = 2E A = 2 * 15 A = 30 Adelaide bought boxed{30} ducks."},{"prompt":"Given (t in mathbb{R}), if the complex number (z = frac{1ti}{1+i}) (where (i) is the imaginary unit) is purely imaginary, then (|sqrt{3}+ti| =) ?
