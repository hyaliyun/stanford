Aquí te proporciono una guía general sobre cómo realizar este proceso en Ubuntu. **Paso 1: Instalar dependencias** Primero, asegúrate de tener instaladas todas las herramientas y bibliotecas necesarias para compilar el código fuente, incluidas las bibliotecas de desarrollo para JSON, nDPI y HTTP: \`\`\`bash sudo apt update sudo apt install -y git autoconf automake libtool g++ pkg-config libjson-c-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libpcap-dev make bison flex libssl-dev libmysqlclient-dev \`\`\` Para \`nDPI\`, necesitas compilar e instalar la biblioteca desde su repositorio de GitHub: \`\`\`bash git clone https://github.com/ntop/nDPI.git cd nDPI ./autogen.sh make sudo make install sudo ldconfig \`\`\` **Paso 2: Descargar pmacct** Clona el repositorio de \`pmacct\` e ingresa al directorio del proyecto: \`\`\`bash git clone https://github.com/pmacct/pmacct.git cd pmacct \`\`\` **Paso 3: Configurar pmacct** Antes de compilar \`pmacct\`, debes ejecutar el script \`./autogen.sh\` para generar los scripts de configuración. Luego, configura \`pmacct\` para habilitar los módulos necesarios. Aquí, usamos \`--enable-ndpi\`, \`--enable-jansson\` para JSON y \`--enable-kafka\` que incluye soporte para HTTP gracias al uso de librdkafka (también podrías considerar instalar \`librdkafka-dev\`): \`\`\`bash # Ejecuta autogen para preparar el entorno de compilación ./autogen.sh # Configurar pmacct con soporte para nDPI, JSON y Kafka (HTTP) ./configure --enable-ndpi --enable-jansson --enable-kafka \`\`\` Verifica que el script de configuración no reporte errores y te indique que las características requeridas serán compiladas. Puede que debas instalar bibliotecas adicionales si encuentras errores de dependencia en esta fase. **Paso 4: Compilar e instalar** Finalmente, compila e instala \`pmacct\`: \`\`\`bash make sudo make install \`\`\` **Paso 5: Configuración del runtime** Una vez instalado \`pmacct\`, debes crear los archivos de configuración para \`nfacctd\` o \`pmacctd\` (dependiendo del demonio que estés utilizando) y especificar las preferencias para el formato JSON y para la comunicación con un server o API HTTP (si es necesario). Ejemplo básico para \`nfacctd.conf\`: \`\`\`ini plugins: memory[mem1], ndpi[ndpi1] aggregate[mem1]: src_host, dst_host aggregate_filter[ndpi1]: not icmp and not port 53 \`\`\` Para JSON y HTTP las configuraciones varían según cómo planees enviar los datos. **Nota Importante:** \`librdkafka\` es ampliamente utilizada para enviar datos a Kafka, que a su vez puede ser configurado para trabajar con HTTP, pero de manera indirecta. No hay un plugin \`http\` directo en \`pmacct\` que compile con soporte HTTP nativo. Si necesitas enviar datos directamente a un HTTP endpoint, deberías considerar los métodos disponibles en la documentación o scripts personalizados que se comunican con \`pmacct\` via IPC o pipes. Este es un ejemplo básico y puede que necesites ajustar estas instrucciones según el entorno específico de tu servidor y tus necesidades. También es recomendable revisar la documentación oficial de \`pmacct\` para obtener detalles completos sobre la configuración y las opciones de compilación."},{"prompt":"pmacct tiene un plugin http?","completion":"Hasta la fecha de conocimiento de este sistema, \`pmacct\` no tiene un plugin de salida nativo específicamente denominado \\"HTTP\\". Sus plugins de salida están diseñados para escribir datos en diversas fuentes, incluyendo memoria, archivos, bases de datos SQL y sistemas de mensajería como Apache Kafka o AMQP (RabbitMQ). Sin embargo, \`pmacct\` ofrece flexibilidad para integrarse con servicios HTTP utilizando diferentes métodos: 1. **Proxying Through Kafka**: Utilizar \`pmacct\` con el plugin \`kafka\` permite que los datos sean enviados a un cluster Kafka, desde donde pueden ser consumidos y llevados a servicios HTTP por otro proceso. Por ejemplo, puedes tener un servicio consumidor en Kafka que recibe los mensajes y los reenvía a un API HTTP. 2. **Scripts Customizados**: Dependiendo de tus necesidades, puedes crear un script personalizado que lea de una cola \`nfqueue\` o un archivo generado por \`pmacct\` y, a su vez, realice peticiones HTTP para enviar datos a un endpoint de un servicio web. Esto requiere conocimientos de programación y podría no ser tan robusto como las otras soluciones. 3. **Uso de Crontab o Systemd Timers**: Podrías configurar \`pmacct\` para escribir los datos recopilados en un archivo (por ejemplo, en formato JSON) y luego utilizar \`crontab\` o \`systemd\` timers para ejecutar periódicamente un script que lea este archivo y haga peticiones HTTP POST a un API. 4. **Syslog**: Algunas implementaciones de servidores syslog pueden enviar mensajes a servicios HTTP, y se podría configurar \`pmacct\` para enviar sus datos a \`syslog\`. Para cualquiera de estas integraciones, debes estar preparado para manejar cosas como la autenticación HTTP, el procesamiento de errores y las posibles respuestas del servidor. Además, mantener un volumen alto de tráfico de datos de \`pmacct\` a un servicio HTTP probablemente requerirá una robusta gestión de colas y almacenamiento intermedio de datos para asegurarse de que no se pierdan durante las transferencias. Si bien \`pmacct\` no dispone de un plugin HTTP dedicado, su flexibilidad y la diversidad de plugins y métodos de extensión disponibles te permiten estructurar muchas integraciones distintas, incluyendo la comunicación con APIs HTTP. Es recomendable revisar la documentación oficial de \`pmacct\` para obtener la información más actualizada y considerar las mejores prácticas para la integración con servicios HTTP."},{"prompt":"Dame un ejemplo de configurar pmacct y obtener los datos en JSON con Javascript, sin usar el sistema de archivos","completion":"Para obtener datos en formato JSON desde \`pmacct\` directamente en una aplicación JavaScript sin utilizar el sistema de archivos, podrías configurar \`pmacct\` para que envíe los datos a un middleware o servicio que actúe como receptor de datos, procesándolos y luego haciéndolos accesibles a través de una API REST, WebSockets, o algún otro servicio de red en tiempo real. Aquí te muestro cómo hacerlo, utilizando Node.js y Express para crear un servidor HTTP simple que recibe datos de \`pmacct\` y los sirve a clientes: **Paso 1: Configurar pmacct** Configura \`pmacct\` para que publique datos en formato JSON a un puerto y dirección IP específicos. En \`pmacct\` se puede lograr esto utilizando el plugin de memoria con una salida personalizada hacia una dirección de red posible gracias al uso de la funcionalidad sockets de \`pmacct\`: Edita el archivo de configuración de \`pmacctd.conf\` (ejemplo de ubicación \`/etc/pmacct/pmacctd.conf\`) \`\`\` ini ! Ejemplo de configuración de pmacctd.conf plugins: memory[json] aggregate[json]: src_host, dst_host, src_port, dst_port, proto, tos ! Considerar alguna política de agregación relevante aquí imt_path[json]: /var/spool/pmacct/json.sock \`\`\` **Paso 2: Crear el Middleware o Receptor de Datos** Para este ejemplo, utilizaremos un pequeño servidor Express en Node.js que interactúa con \`pmacct\` a través de Unix Socket: \`\`\` js const express = require('express'); const net = require('net'); const app = express(); const SOCKET_FILE = '/var/spool/pmacct/json.sock'; app.use(express.json()); app.get('/traffic-data', (req, res) => { let socket = new net.Socket(); socket.connect(SOCKET_FILE, () => { console.log(\\"Conectado al socket\\"); }); socket.on('data', (data) => { console.log('Datos recibidos: ' + data.toString()); res.json(JSON.parse(data.toString())); }); socket.on('close', () => { console.log('Conexión cerrada'); }); }); const server = app.listen(3000, () => { console.log('Servidor escuchando en puerto 3000'); }); \`\`\` **Paso 3: Ejecutar \`pmacct\` y el Servidor Express** Asegúrate de que \`pmacct\` está ejecutándose y está configurado para publicar datos en el socket Unix que estás oyendo en tu servidor Express. Ejecuta tu servidor Express: \`\`\`bash node express_server.js \`\`\` **Paso 4: Consultar los Datos con JavaScript** Ahora, puedes hacer una solicitud HTTP desde una aplicación cliente JavaScript para obtener los datos JSON: \`\`\`javascript fetch('http://localhost:3000/traffic-data') .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => { console.log(data); // Procesa aquí tus datos }) .catch(error => console.log('Error al hacer la solicitud:', error)); \`\`\` Este código pediría los datos al servidor de Express, que a su vez los obtiene del socket Unix donde \`pmacct\` está publicando. **Consideraciones** - Este es un ejemplo básico y conceptual que omite consideraciones por seguridad, manejo de errores, manejo de gran volumen de datos, etc. - Recuerda que la manipulación de sockets puede requerir permisos adecuados en el sistema. - Esta implementación sería para un escenario en donde el volumen de datos no es excesivo, ya que la forma de recuperar y enviar el buffer de datos es bastante simple y podría no manejar correctamente una gran cantidad de datos entrantes. - Comprueba y sigue las políticas relevantes de seguridad. Si los datos contienen información sensible, asegúrate de implementar medidas de seguridad adecuadas."},{"prompt":"Dame un ejemplo de configurar pmacct y obtener los datos en JSON con Javascript para un gran volumen de datos, sin usar el sistema de archivos","completion":"Manejar un gran volumen de datos de tráfico de red con \`pmacct\` y procesarlos en un cliente JavaScript sin utilizar el sistema de archivos requiere un enfoque en el que la memoria y la administración de recursos sean cuidadosamente controlados para evitar problemas de rendimiento. Una manera de hacerlo es utilizando una base de datos en memoria o un sistema de caches como Redis, junto con un servicio backend que consulte la base de datos y proporcione una API para la aplicación frontend. Aquí tienes una guía paso a paso para manejar este proceso: # Paso 1: Configura pmacct Configura \`pmacct\` para que agregue y envíe los datos a un sistema de intermediación de mensajes como RabbitMQ o Kafka, los cuales pueden manejar grandes volúmenes de datos: Configura \`pmacctd.conf\`: \`\`\`ini plugins: amqp ! ! reemplace <host_amqp> con la dirección del servicio de RabbitMQ o Kafka amqp_host: <host_amqp> amqp_user: guest amqp_passwd: guest amqp_exchange: pmacct amqp_routing_key: pmacct_data amqp_persistent_msg: true aggregate: src_host, dst_host, src_port, dst_port, proto \`\`\` # Paso 2: Usa un sistema intermedio como Redis Para almacenar los datos agregados temporalmente, puedes usar Redis, que es capaz de manejar un alto rendimiento de escrituras y lecturas. Instala y configura Redis en tu servidor: \`\`\`bash sudo apt install redis-server \`\`\` # Paso 3: Backend en Node.js para procesar los datos Crea un servicio backend que consuma datos del broker de mensajes y los almacene en Redis: Instala las dependencias: \`\`\`bash npm install amqplib redis express \`\`\` Crea un archivo de servidor de Node.js (\`server.js\`): \`\`\`javascript const amqp = require('amqplib'); const redis = require('redis'); const express = require('express'); const app = express(); const redisClient = redis.createClient(); const AMQP_URL = 'amqp://<host_amqp>'; // Reemplaza con el servidor AMQP // Conecta al broker de mensajes y establece el consumidor async function connectToBroker() { const conn = await amqp.connect(AMQP_URL); const channel = await conn.createChannel(); const queue = 'pmacct_data'; await channel.assertQueue(queue, { durable: true }); channel.consume(queue, msg => { if (msg) { // Inserta los datos en Redis const key = \\"pmacct_data\\"; redisClient.set(key, msg.content.toString(), 'EX', 60); // Ejemplo: expira en 60 seg channel.ack(msg); } }); } connectToBroker().catch(console.error); // API endpoint para obtener los datos app.get('/traffic-data', async (req, res) => { const key = \\"pmacct_data\\"; redisClient.get(key, (error, data) => { if (error) res.status(500).send('Error al obtener los datos'); if (data) { res.json(JSON.parse(data)); } else { res.status(404).send('Datos no disponibles'); } }); }); const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(\`Server running on port {PORT}\`)); \`\`\` **Nota:** Este es un ejemplo muy básico que asume un único mensaje presente en Redis. En un escenario real con alto volumen, probablemente tendrías que utilizar listas o sets de Redis y más lógica para manejar adecuadamente los datos. # Paso 4: Cliente JavaScript Crea una aplicación de cliente para recuperar los datos a través de la API: \`\`\`javascript fetch('/traffic-data') .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => { console.log(data); // Procesa aquí tus datos }) .catch(error => console.error('Error al recuperar los datos:', error)); \`\`\` Esta configuración proporciona un flujo de procesamiento de datos desde \`pmacct\`, a través de RabbitMQ/Kafka, y luego almacenado en Redis, con un backend Node.js para servir los datos a un frontend de aplicación web. # Consideraciones Importes: - **Rendimiento y escalabilidad:** Para garantizar un alto rendimiento y escalabilidad, es posible que necesites particionar datos en Redis, implementar clustering en RabbitMQ/Kafka, y balancear la carga en el servidor Node.js. - **Seguridad:** Asegúrate de que todos los componentes estén debidamente asegurados, especialmente las conexiones a Redis y el servicio de mensajes. - **Depuración de Datos:** Implementa una estrategia para eliminar los datos antiguos de Redis y gestionar correctamente la ventana de tiempo para la que los datos son relevantes. - **Monitorización:** Supervisa tu sistema para detectar cuellos de botella y optimizar según sea necesario. Esta solución es útil para grandes flujos de datos y puede escalarse según sea necesario para adaptarse a diferentes requisitos de rendimiento y capacidad."},{"prompt":"Dame un ejemplo de configurar pmacct y obtener los datos en JSON con Javascript para un gran volumen de datos, usando la memoria haciendo streaming de datos","completion":"Para configurar \`pmacct\` para recoger datos de tráfico y luego hacer streaming de estos datos en formato JSON a una aplicación JavaScript (sin usar un sistema de archivos), puedes usar el plugin de memoria de \`pmacct\` en conjunto con un backend que transmita estos datos utilizando WebSockets o un stream HTTP. A continuación, se describe cómo hacerlo: # Paso 1: Configura \`pmacct\` Edita el archivo de configuración de \`pmacct\` (por ejemplo, \`/etc/pmacct/pmacctd.conf\`) para usar el plugin de memoria y la agrupación deseada: \`\`\`ini plugins: memory[mem] aggregate[mem]: src_host, dst_host, src_port, dst_port, proto, timestamp_start imt_path[mem]: /tmp/pmacct/mem.pipe imt_mask[mem]: 128 \`\`\` En este ejemplo, \`pmacct\` se configura para enviar los datos agregados a un named pipe (\`/tmp/pmacct/mem.pipe\`). El 'imt_mask' ayuda a controlar el tamaño y la frecuencia de los datos enviados al named pipe. Asegúrate de ajustar esto según tus necesidades y la capacidad de tu sistema. # Paso 2: Crea el Backend para Streaming de Datos Usarás Node.js para leer los datos del named pipe y transmitirlos a los clientes a través de WebSockets. Primero, instala las siguientes dependencias para tu proyecto Node.js: \`\`\`bash npm install express ws \`\`\` Luego, crea un servidor con \`Express\` y \`ws\` (WebSocket): \`\`\`javascript const express = require('express'); const { WebSocketServer } = require('ws'); const fs = require('fs'); const app = express(); const http = require('http'); const server = http.createServer(app); const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server }); wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) { console.log('Conexión de cliente WebSocket establecida.'); // Lee los datos de pmacctd del pipe y los envía al WebSocket const stream = fs.createReadStream('/tmp/pmacct/mem.pipe'); stream.on('data', function(data) { const jsonString = data.toString(); const json = JSON.parse(jsonString); ws.send(JSON.stringify(json)); // Envía los datos al cliente WebSocket }); }); server.listen(3000, () => { console.log('Servidor ejecutándose en http://localhost:3000'); }); \`\`\` Este servidor Node.js leerá los datos del named pipe y los enviará a cualquier cliente conectado a través de WebSockets. # Paso 3: Cliente JavaScript con WebSocket En el frontend, tu aplicación JavaScript se conectará al servidor WebSocket y procesará los datos recibidos: \`\`\`javascript const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000'); ws.onopen = function() { console.log('Conexión WebSocket abierta.'); }; ws.onmessage = function(event) { const data = JSON.parse(event.data); console.log('Datos recibidos:', data); // Aquí procesas los datos como necesites }; ws.onerror = function(error) { console.error('Error en WebSocket:', error); }; \`\`\` El cliente WebSocket abrirá una conexión al servidor y espera datos JSON. Cada vez que se reciben datos del servidor, el evento \`onmessage\` se activa y los datos pueden ser procesados. # Consideraciones - El procesamiento de grandes volúmenes de datos en tiempo real puede ser CPU y memoria intensivo. Es crucial monitorear los recursos del sistema para evitar saturación o pérdidas de datos. - WebSockets son adecuados para aplicaciones en tiempo real, pero ten en cuenta que mantener un gran número de conexiones simultáneas puede requerir configuraciones de servidor avanzadas y posiblemente escalabilidad horizontal. - Debido al streaming en tiempo real, es más difícil manejar desconexiones y reintentos. Debes manejar reconexiones en el cliente y considerar mantener un buffer de datos en el servidor para lidiar con desconexiones breves. - Asegúrate de que el cliente y el servidor manejan adecuadamente los cierres de conexión y liberan adecuadamente los recursos."},{"prompt":"Sugieres alguna forma mas optima","completion":"La optimización del flujo de datos en tiempo real de \`pmacct\` a una aplicación JavaScript depende en gran medida del caso de uso específico y de las características del entorno de red. Sin embargo, aquí hay algunas estrategias que podrían ofrecer una mayor eficiencia y escalabilidad: # Uso de una Cola de Mensajes Utilizar un sistema de mensajería robusto y escalable como Apache Kafka o RabbitMQ puede ayudar a manejar mejor los picos de tráfico y proporcionar resistencia ante fallos. Puedes configurar \`pmacct\` para publicar datos a Kafka o RabbitMQ, y luego tener un servicio backend que consuma los datos y los transmita a los clientes de una manera controlada. # Base de Datos de Series Temporales Utilizar una base de datos de series temporales como InfluxDB puede ofrecer un almacenamiento y recuperación de datos más eficiente para métricas de red, particularmente cuando estás manejando flujos de datos de alta velocidad. # Almacenamiento en Buffer y Procesamiento por Lotes En lugar de transmitir cada dato individualmente, podrías almacenar en buffer un conjunto de datos y procesarlos/enviarlos en lotes. Este enfoque puede reducir significativamente la sobrecarga de la red y los recursos informáticos al minimizar el número de operaciones de E/S y la cantidad de paquetes de red individuales. # Recomendaciones Específicas 1. **Emplea Streaming de Datos con Apache Kafka**: \`pmacct\` puede publicar los datos directamente a un tópico Kafka. Un servicio backend como Node.js consume estos datos del tópico y los envía al frontend a través de WebSockets o Server-Sent Events (SSE). Esta configuración te permitirá manejar un alto rendimiento y ofrecer resistencia y escalabilidad. 2. **Consolida y Agrega Datos**: Si los clientes finales no necesitan cada mensaje individual sino un resumen, entonces considera agregar o consolidar datos antes de su transmisión. Esto puede ser manejado en el servicio backend, o bien utilizando las capacidades de streaming y procesamiento de Kafka Streams o similar. 3. **Implementa Backpressure**: Una forma de gestionar el flujo de datos entrantes es utilizando el concepto de \\"backpressure\\". Puedes hacerlo limitando el ritmo de procesamiento de mensajes entrantes para que coincida con la velocidad a la que tu aplicación y tus recursos pueden manejar. 4. **Usa InfluxDB para la Almacenamiento y Consulta de Datos**: InfluxDB es una base de datos optimizada para almacenar y consultar series temporales de datos. Puedes configurar \`pmacct\` para que escriba en InfluxDB y después construir una API que consulte esta base de datos para obtener datos agregados que luego se envían al cliente. 5. **Reduce la Granularidad**: Considera si es necesario enviar datos con una granularidad de tiempo muy fina. A menudo se puede reducir la frecuencia de actualización sin comprometer la utilidad de la información. 6. **Optimiza y Monitorea**: Implementa el monitoreo y el profiling en cada componente del sistema para detectar y optimizar cuellos de botella. Usa herramientas como Prometheus para recopilar métricas de rendimiento y Grafana para visualizarlas. 7. **Manejo de Conexiones Persistentes**: Si estás usando WebSockets o SSE, asegúrate de que tu backend gestione eficientemente las conexiones persistentes, utilizando pools de conexiones y balanceo de carga si es necesario. Elige la estrategia basándote en tu infraestructura, tus requisitos de rendimiento, la criticidad en tiempo real, y los recursos disponibles. A menudo, una combinación de varias de estas técnicas produce los mejores resultados."},{"prompt":"Is Ye Antisemitic?","completion":"Kanye West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, has been involved in several controversies, including making remarks that have been widely criticized as antisemitic. For example, in October 2022, Ye posted a series of tweets that included apparent threats towards the Jewish community; these statements led to widespread backlash and were condemned by various organizations and individuals for perpetuating antisemitic tropes. Following these incidents, many of his business partners, including Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga, severed ties with him due to the offensive nature of his remarks. Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Instagram, also restricted or suspended his accounts in response to policy violations related to hate speech. While Ye himself might not universally be labeled as \\"antisemitic,\\" his actions and statements in these instances have been criticized as such. It's vital to differentiate between a person's individual beliefs, which can be complex and multifaceted, and specific statements or actions they have made that are considered inflammatory or hateful. Determining someone's beliefs or labeling them can also be challenging because individuals may have a range of views that can evolve over time, and public figures may make statements for various reasons, including seeking attention or generating controversy.

The outer loop runs from i = 3n to (3n)^2. The inner loop runs from j = 2i to 2i^2. To represent the loops with summations and determine the running time, we can express the total number of iterations for both loops: Outer loop iterations: ∑ (from i=3n to (3n)^2) Inner loop iterations (for each i): ∑ (from j=2i to 2i^2) The total running time T(n) is therefore the sum of products of the number of iterations of both loops: T(n) = ∑ (i=3n to (3n)^2) [∑ (j=2i to 2i^2) (1)] Now, we need to calculate the summation. Focusing on the inner summation first: For a fixed i, the inner loop runs (2i^2 - 2i + 1) times because we include the bounds. Now we bound the inner loop's contribution for a given i: Lower Bound: (2i^2 - 2i + 1) ≥ 2i^2 - 2i (2i^2 - 2i + 1) ≥ 2i(i - 1) For i ≥ 3n (since it is the start of our loop), we can argue: (2i^2 - 2i + 1) ≥ 2(3n)(3n - 1) = 2*3n*(3n - 1) Upper Bound: (2i^2 - 2i + 1) ≤ 2i^2 - 2i + i^2 (2i^2 - 2i + 1) ≤ 3i^2 For i ≤ (3n)^2 (since it is the end of our loop), we can argue: (2i^2 - 2i + 1) ≤ 3(3n)^4 = 81n^4 So we have bounded the inner sum between 2*3n*(3n - 1) and 81n^4. Now we need to put these bounds in the context of the outer loop summation: Lower Bound Summation: ∑ (from i=3n to (3n)^2 of 2*3n*(3n - 1)) = 2*3n*(3n - 1) * ((3n)^2 - 3n + 1) = 2*3n*(3n - 1) * (9n^2 - 3n + 1) = O(n^4) Upper Bound Summation: ∑ (from i=3n to (3n)^2 of 81n^4) = 81n^4 * ((3n)^2 - 3n + 1) = 81n^4 * (9n^2 - 3n + 1) = O(n^6) The bounds differ by more than a constant factor, which indicates we have to refine our analysis. Moving forward to the exact calculation: Exact Time Complexity: T(n) = ∑ (i=3n to (3n)^2) [∑ (j=2i to 2i^2) (1)] = ∑ (i=3n to (3n)^2) (2i^2 - 2i + 1) = ∑ (i=3n to (3n)^2) (2i^2) - ∑ (i=3n to (3n)^2) (2i) + ∑ (i=3n to (3n)^2) (1) We now calculate each part of the summation separately: The summation of 2i^2 from i=3n to (3n)^2: T_1(n) = ∑ (i = 3n to (3n)^2) 2i^2 = 2 * ∑ (i = 3n to (3n)^2) i^2 = 2 * [O((3n)^6) - O((3n)^3)] The summation of -2i from i=3n to (3n)^2: T_2(n) = -2 * ∑ (i = 3n to (3n)^2) i = -2 * [O((3n)^4) - O((3n)^2)] The summation of 1 from i=3n to (3n)^2: T_3(n) = ∑ (i = 3n to (3n)^2) 1 = O((3n)^2) - O(3n) Finally, expressing T(n) as a combination of the three parts, we get the following: T(n) = T_1(n) + T_2(n) + T_3(n) = O(n^6) - O(n^3) - O(n^4) + O(n^2) + O(n^2) - O(n) = O(n^6) Since T_1(n) dominates the running time of the algorithm, we can conclude that the time complexity of \`Func1\` is O(n^6). Due to the nested loops and polynomial relationship between the lower and upper bounds of the indices, we cannot simplify the exact analysis down to a tight bound that differs by only a constant factor using bounding alone. The calculation here provides an exact expression for the running time, but bounding alone was insufficient to provide tight upper and lower bounds that differed by only a constant factor."},{"prompt":"Random popular wonder of the worlds, one word with architecture before it","completion":"Pyramids"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Pyramids","completion":"\\"Pyramids | Modern Abstract Design for Mugs, Wall Art, T-Shirts | Geometric Shapes | Home Decor | Apparel | Unique Graphic Print\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Pyramids | Modern Abstract Design for Mugs, Wall Art, T-Shirts | Geometric Shapes | Home Decor | Apparel | Unique Graphic Print.

This album marks a significant departure from his previous work, featuring a heavy use of the Roland TR-808 drum machine and a more introspective and emotive style, contrasting the soul-sampling hip-hop for which Kanye was originally known. The album was created during a tumultuous time in West's life, following the death of his mother, Donda West, and the end of his engagement to Alexis Phifer. \\"808s & Heartbreak\\" presents a more vulnerable side of Kanye, with themes of loss, heartache, and loneliness prevalent throughout, and it prominently features Auto-Tune to give a distinct sound to the vocals. It includes hit singles like \\"Heartless,\\" \\"Love Lockdown,\\" and \\"Amazing.\\" \\"808s & Heartbreak\\" had a significant impact on the hip-hop genre, influencing a new generation of artists with its fusion of hip-hop, pop, and R&B, and its emotional openness.

Si solo deseas agregar datos a una lista de noticias sin definir una clase personalizada para las noticias, puedes hacerlo utilizando un \`ArrayList\` de \`HashMap\` para representar cada noticia, donde cada \`HashMap\` tiene las claves como los atributos de tus noticias.

Luego, puedes agregar tantas noticias como quieras a la lista \`noticias\`. Cuando imprimes cada mapa de la lista, obtienes la representación de los datos de la noticia en forma de texto plano. Recuerda que se pierden los beneficios de la orientación a objetos al usar esta técnica, por ejemplo, la validación de tipos y la facilidad para hacer refactoring. Además, cuando quieras mostrar la información en diferentes formatos, tendrás que crear manualmente la conversión de esa estructura de datos genérica a XML, JSON, HTML, etc."},{"prompt":"la lista no debe ser un objeto, solo es una lista","completion":"Entiendo, si no deseas crear una clase personalizada para las noticias y tampoco quieres utilizar objetos en la lista, puedes optar por una lista de listas, donde cada lista interior representa una noticia con sus atributos como elementos de la lista.

Tener en cuenta que esta forma de manejar la información puede resultar menos manejable si necesitas realizar operaciones más complejas con los datos, como búsqueda, modificación o eliminación de elementos, ya que careces de las facilidades que te ofrecerían tipos de datos más estructurados como clases personalizadas.

No obstante, para simplificar el código y evitar la notación explícita de corchetes múltiples, puedes utilizar un tipo de objeto como \`List\`, o bien crear un array de objetos cuyos elementos son arrays. Si buscas no utilizar múltiples corchetes pero aún quieres un array de más de dos dimensiones, tienes que definir el tipo de objeto que va a contener tu array. Java no permite crear directamente un array de múltiples dimensiones sin los corchetes, pero puedes hacer algo como esto: \`\`\`java public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // Definición de un array tridimensional usando un array de objetos. // Cada objeto es un array bidimensional de Strings.

Sin embargo, ten en cuenta que este planteamiento puede complicar la lógica de tu programa y hacer que la legibilidad del código sea más difícil. La utilización de listas (\`List\`) o de clases personalizadas suele ser una mejor práctica para estas situaciones.

Para hacerlo más intuitivo, puedes crear una lista de listas y agregar elementos a ella. Primero, creamos una lista de listas y luego definimos un método sencillo para agregar las noticias.

El método \`Arrays.asList\` te permite crear listas de atributos de manera rápida y sencilla. Recuerda que \`ArrayList\` es una colección dinámica en Java, lo cual significa que puedes agregar tantos elementos como desees y la lista crecerá automáticamente. Esto te da más flexibilidad que con un array estático donde necesitas definir el tamaño desde el principio. Además, los \`ArrayList\` te brindan métodos como \`add\`, \`remove\`, \`get\`, \`set\` y más que facilitan el trabajo con colecciones de datos.

Luego, el método \`toString()\` de \`StringBuilder\` se utiliza para obtener la representación de \`String\` final que posteriormente se devuelve. El uso de \`StringBuilder\` es muy recomendado cuando se concatenan cadenas en bucles, ya que a diferencia de la concatenación directa con el operador \`+\`, no se generan múltiples objetos \`String\` innecesarios durante el proceso, lo cuál es más eficiente y puede hacer una gran diferencia en términos de rendimiento cuando se trabaja con grandes cantidades de texto en Java."},{"prompt":"se puede hacer sin StringBuilder","completion":"Sí, es posible hacerlo sin usar \`StringBuilder\`, aunque no se recomienda por cuestiones de eficiencia al concatenar cadenas en bucles.

Cada atributo de la noticia se añade a la cadena \`response\` en cada iteración del bucle for. Es importante mencionar que este método es mucho menos eficiente que el uso de un \`StringBuilder\`. Cada vez que se realiza la concatenación con el operador \`+=\`, se crea un nuevo objeto \`String\` en memoria porque las cadenas en Java son inmutables. Esto significa que para cada elemento y cada noticia, se estará creando y descartando múltiples objetos \`String\`, lo cual puede tener un impacto negativo en el rendimiento, especialmente si la lista \`noticias\` es grande o si este método es llamado con frecuencia.

Here's a prioritized list of metrics based on common goals for such applications: 1. **Upload Success Rate**: This is critical as it directly affects the core functionality of a photo upload application. If users can't successfully upload photos, they're likely to abandon the app. 2. **Upload Time**: Ensuring a quick and efficient upload process is key to user retention and satisfaction. A slow or cumbersome upload process can lead to frustration and app abandonment. 3. **Error Rate**: A high error rate can indicate underlying issues with the service or user interface, which need immediate attention to prevent impacting the user experience. 4. **System Uptime/Downtime**: Availability of the service is non-negotiable. Frequent downtimes can severely damage the trust and reliance users have in the application. 5. **User Retention**: It’s more cost-effective to retain existing users than acquire new ones. This metric can indicate the long-term viability of the application. 6. **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**: Direct feedback from users can reveal insights into what users like and dislike, helping guide future product development. 7. **User Engagement Metrics**: User interaction with the feature can be a good indicator of the feature's value and the app's engagement levels. 8. **User Growth**: While early on, this might be a top priority for a new app, once the user base is established, it becomes more about maintaining and slowly growing the user base. 9. **Conversion Rate**: This is crucial if the app monetizes through in-app purchases or subscription models, as it directly relates to revenue. 10. **Feature Adoption Rate**: It’s important to understand how new features are received by the user base, but it follows behind the core functionality metrics. 11. **Throughput**: This operational metric is essential for scaling and ensuring that the infrastructure can support user demand. 12. **Average File Size**: Related to cost and infrastructure planning, but not as immediate as other user-centric metrics. 13. **Latency**: Important for user experience, but it’s often within acceptable limits if Upload Time is optimized. 14. **Performance Metrics**: While performance is always a concern, specific metrics like load time are typically optimized after core functionality is assured. 15. **Business Impact Metrics**: These are essential for profitability and sustainability but are often secondary to ensuring a good user experience. 16. **A/B Testing Results**: These are important for refining features but are part of an iterative optimization process that comes after confirming core metrics are satisfactory. 17. **Peak Load Performance**: Important for ensuring quality of service during high traffic periods but secondary to overall uptime and reliability. 18. **Social Media Mentions and Sentiment Analysis**: This external metric is useful for branding and understanding public perception but is not as critical as direct user feedback metrics for app functionality. The prioritization assumes the photo upload app is post-launch and aims to provide a reliable and enjoyable user experience while growing its user base and revenue. Early-phase apps might prioritize growth and adoption metrics more heavily, while mature apps might focus on optimization and business impact. The chosen prioritization is driven by a focus on ensuring the app works as intended (functionality and reliability), provides a positive user experience (satisfaction and retention), and supports business objectives (growth and conversion). Once these fundamental areas are covered, the app can focus on refinement and optimization, using metrics like feature adoption and A/B testing results."},{"prompt":"Can you give a more detailed explanation for each metric why made this decision?","completion":"Certainly! Let's break down the prioritization of each metric and explain the rationale behind the ordering. 1. **Upload Success Rate**: - *Rationale*: If users encounter issues while uploading their photos, the app fails to meet its primary function. High failure rates can quickly lead to user dissatisfaction and app abandonment. - *Decision*: This metric is the top priority because it's a direct measure of the app's core competency—successfully uploading photos. 2. **Upload Time**: - *Rationale*: User satisfaction can hinge on how quickly and efficiently they can complete their intended actions. Longer upload times could frustrate users, especially in a world where speed is often equated with quality. - *Decision*: Given the importance of quick gratification in user experience, this metric is a high priority after ensuring uploads succeed. 3. **Error Rate**: - *Rationale*: Frequent errors can erode trust and signal potential issues with infrastructure or the app's codebase. It’s crucial to keep errors to a minimum to maintain a professional and reliable user experience. - *Decision*: Tracking and minimizing the error rate is essential, hence its high priority. 4. **System Uptime/Downtime**: - *Rationale*: Availability is a non-negotiable aspect of any online service. Downtime can be incredibly damaging, causing users to seek alternatives. - *Decision*: This metric is prioritized highly because prolonged unavailability can nullify all other efforts to retain users. 5. **User Retention**: - *Rationale*: Retaining users over time is key to maintaining a stable user base and reducing churn, which is often more cost-effective than acquiring new users. - *Decision*: High retention speaks to the app's value proposition to its users, making this metric a top-tier concern. 6. **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**: - *Rationale*: Customer feedback is an early indicator of potential problems or successful aspects of the app. User happiness is closely tied to an app’s success. - *Decision*: Because this metric provides actionable insights directly from the users, it's a high priority. 7. **User Engagement Metrics**: - *Rationale*: Engagement shows how users are interacting with the app's features, which can indicate how sticky and compelling the app is. - *Decision*: This metric is prioritized to ensure that the app not only attracts users but keeps them actively using its features. 8. **User Growth**: - *Rationale*: Growth metrics are especially important for new or scaling apps. They highlight the success of marketing efforts and the app's overall market fit. - *Decision*: As the app stabilizes, user growth remains important but becomes a less desperate need compared to user satisfaction and retention. 9. **Conversion Rate**: - *Rationale*: For apps that rely on conversions for revenue, such as in-app purchases or premium subscriptions, this metric directly impacts the bottom line. - *Decision*: It's placed lower in the list because, without a solid user base and a well-functioning app, conversions are unlikely to be optimized. 10. **Feature Adoption Rate**: - *Rationale*: Understanding how users are adopting new features can help steer the product development roadmap and prioritize resources. - *Decision*: Although important for decision-making, it's secondary to the essential functioning and profitability of the app. 11. **Throughput**: - *Rationale*: Throughput affects the app's ability to handle peak loads and impacts scalability. - *Decision*: Prioritized as a mid-level operational concern once basic reliability and performance are in place. 12. **Average File Size**: - *Rationale*: Affects storage costs and infrastructure requirements and might have performance implications. - *Decision*: Given modern storage solutions, it's less critical but still important for cost management. 13. **Latency**: - *Rationale*: Directly affects user experience, as users expect prompt feedback from their interactions with the app. - *Decision*: Good latency is often a byproduct of a well-optimized service but is not as immediately noticeable as upload time. 14. **Performance Metrics**: - *Rationale*: Various performance metrics can guide technical optimizations. - *Decision*: Grouped lower as these are often behind-the-scenes improvements, but necessary for maintaining a high-quality service. 15. **Business Impact Metrics**: - *Rationale*: Metrics that tie feature usage to revenue and cost are important for business strategy. - *Decision*: Considered after the app’s core functionality ensures a steady user base to impact revenue and costs significantly. 16. **A/B Testing Results**: - *Rationale*: A/B testing helps refine features and UI/UX choices. - *Decision*: Important for iterative development and optimization post-launch, and not critical to initial functioning. 17. **Peak Load Performance**: - *Rationale*: Ensures the app performs under stress and high-user demand without degradation of service. - *Decision*: This is more of a scalability metric and is a priority once the app is stable and growing. 18. **Social Media Mentions and Sentiment Analysis**: - *Rationale*: Reflects brand perception and unofficial user feedback, which can be important for marketing and PR. - *Decision*: It’s an external perception metric and, while valuable for insights and trends, doesn't directly affect the app's operational success. This prioritization is not absolute; it adapts to the application's specific needs and goals. For example, if an app is revenue-driven early on, conversion rates might be higher up on the priority list. Always take into context the strategic business objectives when prioritizing metrics."},{"prompt":"What kind of dashboard you want to design to reflect whether the product is \\"good.\\"?","completion":"Designing a dashboard to reflect whether a product is \\"good\\" involves showcasing a collection of KPIs and metrics that provide a comprehensive view of the product's performance, user satisfaction, and business impact.

Assuming no overlaps in sessions, we would use a self-join on the \\"Event\\" table to pair each action with the preceding one for each user-session pair. Below is an example of a SQL query that calculates the average time taken between steps/actions (excluding duplicates) for each user-session: \`\`\`sql WITH RankedEvents AS ( SELECT user_id, session_id, Action, timestamp, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id, session_id, Action ORDER BY timestamp) AS action_rank, LAG(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id, session_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_timestamp FROM Event ), FilteredActions AS ( SELECT user_id, session_id, Action, timestamp, previous_timestamp FROM RankedEvents WHERE action_rank = 1 -- Filter to only take the first occurrence of each action within a user-session ), ActionDurations AS ( SELECT user_id, session_id, TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, previous_timestamp, timestamp) AS action_duration FROM FilteredActions WHERE previous_timestamp IS NOT NULL -- Ignore the very first action in a session as it has no preceding action ) SELECT AVG(action_duration) AS average_duration_seconds FROM ActionDurations; \`\`\` Here's a breakdown of the steps and logic in the query: 1. **RankedEvents Common Table Expression (CTE)**: Creates a ranked list of events for each action within a user-session pair. It also uses the \`LAG\` window function to get the timestamp of each action's preceding event. 2. **FilteredActions CTE**: Filters out events to only consider the first occurrence of an action within a user-session based on the ranking from the previous CTE. 3. **ActionDurations CTE**: Calculates the duration in seconds between an action and its immediate preceding action, eliminating the first action as it has no previous timestamp. 4. **Final SELECT**: Computes the average duration across all actions and sessions. Please note: - The usage of \`TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, previous_timestamp, timestamp)\` assumes a SQL function that calculates the difference in seconds between two timestamps; the specific function name and syntax may vary based on the SQL dialect you are using (e.g., \`DATEDIFF\` for Microsoft SQL Server, or simple subtraction in PostgreSQL). - The provided example assumes that 'timestamp' is in a date-time format that the SQL engine can directly use for calculations. If not, you may need to convert or cast it accordingly. - This query presumes the absence of session overlap for an individual user.

Assuming that the table structure is appropriate and that there is a field representing the action, we can compute the average length of each action. Once fetched, we can manipulate the data in Python with the help of pandas. \`\`\`python import pymysql import pandas as pd # Connect to the MySQL database connection = pymysql.connect(host='your_host', user='your_user', password='your_password', database='your_database') # Read data from the database query = \\"SELECT session_id, action, start_time FROM login ORDER BY session_id, start_time;\\" df = pd.read_sql(query, connection) # Convert start_time column to datetime df['start_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['start_time']) # Group by session_id and calculate the difference between current and next start_time df['end_time'] = df.groupby('session_id')['start_time'].shift(-1) df['duration'] = (df['end_time'] - df['start_time']).dt.total_seconds() # Group by action and calculate the average duration avg_duration = df.groupby('action')['duration'].mean() # Write results back to the database # Assuming a table \\"average_durations\\" with columns \\"action\\" and \\"average_duration\\" avg_duration_df = avg_duration.reset_index().rename(columns={'duration': 'average_duration'}) avg_duration_df.to_sql('average_durations', connection, if_exists='replace', index=False) \`\`\` # Step 2: Continuously Update the Average Duration For the second part, where you have to process a stream of data, you can maintain running averages in a dictionary and update it as new data comes in. \`\`\`python # Dictionary to store cumulative sum of durations and count of occurrences for each action action_durations = {action: {'cumulative_duration': 0, 'count': 0} for action in avg_duration_df['action']} # Function to update the running average def update_running_average(new_data): global avg_duration_df, action_durations new_data['start_time'] = pd.to_datetime(new_data['start_time']) # Process new stream data one at a time (simulating a stream) for _, row in new_data.iterrows(): action = row['action'] start_time = row['start_time'] current_data = df[(df['session_id'] == row['session_id']) & (df['action'] == action)] if current_data.empty or action_durations[action]['count'] == 0: # No previous data for this action, nothing to do. continue else: # Calculate duration since last action duration = (start_time - current_data['start_time'].iloc[-1]).total_seconds() # Update running totals action_durations[action]['cumulative_duration'] += duration action_durations[action]['count'] += 1 # Update average action_avg = action_durations[action]['cumulative_duration'] / action_durations[action]['count'] avg_duration_df.loc[avg_duration_df['action'] == action, 'average_duration'] = action_avg # Write updated running averages back to database avg_duration_df.to_sql('average_durations', connection, if_exists='replace', index=False) \`\`\` In practice, you would probably want to use a continuous stream processing framework to manage the data stream and automate the updating process.

It then iterates through the sorted list and calculates the time difference from the previous step in the same session. It keeps a cumulative sum of these time differences along with a count for each step. The final section calculates the average time consumed per step. Note that we calculate the average time for each step apart from the first one, as there's no preceding step to compare it with. Please note that this approach assumes that \`timestamp\` values are in the same unit of time (e.g., seconds, milliseconds) and that there are no gaps in the step sequence (i.e., each \`session_id\` has consecutive steps without skipping any). If there are steps that a session skips, you would need to handle those cases according to your specific requirements."},{"prompt":"Please use SQL script to solve previous question.","completion":"To calculate the average time taken for each step within a session using SQL, we can utilize window functions to compute the time differences between each step.

Assuming you have a table named \`session_steps\` with the given structure (\`session_id\`, \`step\`, \`timestamp\`), the following SQL query performs the required calculations: \`\`\`sql WITH StepDurations AS ( SELECT session_id, step, LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY session_id ORDER BY timestamp) - timestamp AS step_duration FROM session_steps ) SELECT step, AVG(step_duration) AS average_duration FROM StepDurations WHERE step_duration IS NOT NULL -- Exclude the last step of each session because it has no subsequent step to compare with GROUP BY step; \`\`\` Here is what each part of this SQL query does: 1. The \`WITH\` clause defines a Common Table Expression (CTE) named \`StepDurations\`. This CTE adds a column named \`step_duration\` that calculates the time difference between the current step and the subsequent step within the same session. It uses the \`LEAD()\` window function to look forward to the next \`timestamp\` after the current one per \`session_id\`. 2. The \`SELECT\` statement in the CTE gets the necessary fields, including the calculated \`step_duration\` as described. 3. In the outer \`SELECT\` query, we calculate the average step duration for each step while ignoring \`NULL\` values, which occur for the last step in each session since there's no subsequent step to compare against. 4. The \`GROUP BY\` clause groups the results by the \`step\`, which allows the \`AVG()\` function to calculate the average duration per step. This SQL query will work in databases that support window functions, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL (version 8.0 and above), SQL Server, and others. Remember to run this query against your actual database, and replace \`session_steps\` with the actual table name. Additionally, the column names \`session_id\`, \`step\`, and \`timestamp\` should match your database schema.

To appease traditionalist and Buddhist supremacists within Japan, the descendants of the Tokugawa were restored to their historical pre-Meiji Restoration position as Japanese shoguns while the male heads of the Ōtsutsuki clan ruled the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire as Emperors of Japan. Since the Ōtsutsuki clan was [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] mistaken to be the surviving post-Great Cataclysm descendants of the Imperial House of Great Yamato who [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] had regained their [the members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] supernatural abilities gained from their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] descent from the gods of the Shinto pantheon, nobody in the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Empire ever finds out the truth [about the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese imperial family] and so the secret of chakra [Naruto] and the Elemental Nations is kept safe within the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan. With Japan united under the Ōtsutsuki clan and [Japan in this story] ruling over Korea, Taiwan, Sahlakin and the Kurils once more, the Meta Liberation Army [My Hero Academia] and its [the MLA's] Quirk supremacist agenda are quickly crushed by the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Kempeitai and so the Hero system [My Hero Academia] never takes off in Japan, with the Armed Detective system [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo], which [the Armed Detective system] had been indefinitely suspended after the Great Cataclysm in this story, [the Armed Detective System] instead being revived [the Armed Detective System] to manage Quirks, the pyrokinetics known as Generations [Fire Force] as well as the young girls and women who form contracts with the mythical gods and deities from another dimension known as Divas [Magika Swordsman and Summoner]. The Special Fire Force [Fire Force] is instead a elite division of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army due to the Great Tokyo Empire's conquest, [the Special Fire Force in this story] being given authority to kill Infernals [Fire Force] as well as rouge Generations. Fusion of chakra with the world outside the Elemental Nation's pre-Great Cataclysm industrial processes allows for the mass production of the oversized, plasma beam-firing and nuclear missile-equipped oversized fighter jets that can transform into massive humanoid mecha known as Tactical Surface Fighters [Muv-Luv], which [the Tactical Surface Fighters in this fanfic] became a important part of aerial warfare before the Great Cataclysm due to the BETA [Muv-Luv] invasion from the moon never happening in this fic and also mass production of prototype units of the initally-created for space exoskeletons that only pre-teen girls, teenage girls, young women and older women below the age of 40 can wear known as Infinite Stratos [IS] units [IS: Infinite Stratos], with the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army also having a rather large non-magical conventional ground warfare force. The post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire in this story finds itself [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] transported to an alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no

contrator] ending when the contractor becomes pregnant, dragons who can form contracts with selected humans and suprenatural creatures, [the dragons who form said contracts] being known as Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] and the gods, monsters and legends of various European and East Asian mythologies coexisting with Heroes [Musume Hyakka Jiten & Monmusume Kuesto!] and knights [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in the part of Musume Hyakka Jiten's world akin to Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Europe and the Balkans as well as European Russia but also warrior monks, samurai, martial artists, fire-benders [Avatar: The Last Airbender], water-benders [Avatar: The Last Airbender], yokai and kami in the part of Musume Hyakka Jiten's world akin to feudal Japan if if [feudal Japan] gained the Korean peninsula as a province either due to Yi-Seong-Gye's death preventing the formation of Joeson or the Imjin Wars of May 23, 1592 – December 16, 1598 launched by the Ashikaga shogunate de-facto lead by Toyotomi Hideyoshi-ruled feudal Japan against the satelite state and tributary kingdom of Great Joeson ruled by the partially Han Chinese Korean House of Jeonju Yi in Korea and the Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled Ming dynasty ruling over both Han China and Cantonia if it [feudal Japan during the Imjin Wars] was able to push further into Korea and even invade Han China, gaining Korea as a Japanese province and making the Ming dynasty into a de-jure Japanese satelite state/tributary state and [feudal Japan] had also settled in and [feudal Japan] claimed Taiwan as a Japanese province or [feudal Japan] conquering the Ming satelite state/rump kingdom of the Tungning Kingdom ruled by the partially Japanese Zheng dynasty instead of the Manchu-ruled Great Qing Empire, the Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu [Musume Hyakka Jiten], [the mythology, demographics and geographics of this almagam world also being] inclusive of Avatar's Okinawan inspired Kiyoshi Island,

along with thier property, and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire inheriting the surviving Imperial Shogunate of Zipangu's vast resources along with its [the Imperial Shogunate of

successfully conquering Korea in the Imjim Wars before its [the surviving Tokugawa shogunate's] invasion by the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] in the 1950s AD in the canon timeline of Code Geass. The post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire initially has no idea that it [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] has been transported to a different world [the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki], and [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] quickly secures its [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire's] borders, [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] checking up on its military and civilian space orbital satelites only to realize that it [the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire] is in an entirely new world the alternate world which is an amalgam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki] as police call centers are flooded with reports of altered locations, changed roads and mysterious creatures [monmosu and contracted spirits] appearing with the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army and the post-Great Cataclysm restored Kempeitai working with the Japanese National Police Agency and Japanese Public Security Agency to eventually successfully restore order in the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire, with the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Emperor and the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese shogun planning to give a televised message to the Japanese people. A post-WW2, post-1947 surviving successful Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Pan-Asian anti-communist and anti-colonialist bloc formed by the real life Japanese Empire which [the Co-Prosperity Sphere] was resurrected in 1967 as ASEAN in real life, which [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] was able to survive along with the Japanese Empire past 1947 in its original world thanks to Woodrow Wilson dying as a child during the American Civil War and [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] consists of the post-1928 Beiyang Government of the first Republic of China as a post 1945 surviving Reorganized Government of the Republic of China, later reformed in the 1950s into Beiyang China's original status as a regency for the restoration of the pre-Qing Manchu-Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu Great Ming Empire/Ming dynasty with the Yuan Shikai-created Empire of China being restored in the 1960s with the descendants of the House of Zhu becoming the Chinese Imperial family surviving once more, a post 1945 surviving former former Qing Imperial Family, the Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Empire of Manchukuo which [the surviving Empire of Manchukuo] managed to get all of Outer Manchuria after WW2 in its original world, a post 1945-surviving Genghis Khan descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Mengjiang United Autonomous Government/Mongolian Autonomous Federation in Inner Mongolia's Charhar and Suiyan regions, a post-WW2 restored Far Eastern Republic in Russia's East Coast, a post-WW2 restored Bogd Khan-ruled post-WW2 restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia ruling over Mongolia and the parts of Inner Mongolia unclaimed by Mengjiang, a post-1955 surviving nativized Vietnamese side branch of the Imperial House of Zhu, the Imperial House of Ngyuen-ruled Empire of Vietnam, a post-1975 surviving Khun Lo dynasty-ruled Kingdom of Laos, a Kingdom of Cambodia that never experienced the Cambodian Civil War or the subsequent rise of the Khmer Rouge, a restored Kobaung dynasty-ruled Third Burmese Empire ruling over Burma, a restored Tungning Kingdom in the South Chinese region of Cantonia a post-WW2 restored Imperial House of Osman-ruled restored Ottoman Empire in Xingjiang/East Turkestan, a post-1950s surviving Kingdom of Tibet, a greater Malyasia that includes Singapore, an Indonesian federation ruled by the royal family of Indonesia's Yogyakarta region, the House of Hamengkubuwono as its [the Indonesian Federation's] imperial family, a restored Phillipine Empire ruled by the restored Sultans of Maguindanao as its Emperors, Brunei and a restored House of Kalākaua-ruled restored Kingdom of Hawaii ruling over all of Hawaii is [the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] copied and the copy [of the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] placed [the copy of the surviving Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere] in the geographical areas of the Greater Asia equivalent of the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, with the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China merging with the Fire Nation within the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China] inheriting its the Fire Nation within the almagam world's] conventional military and naval, contracted spirit, Pal and firebender strength along with its [the the Fire Nation within the almagam world's] massive industrial, economic and population might, while [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China] keeping its [the copy of the restored Ming dynasty's in the form of a Imperial House of Zhu-ruled restored Yuan Shikai Empire of China's] own military, economic and technological might, the copies of the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang both [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] replacing the Greater Earth Kingdom within the almagam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki and [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] both [the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] getting its [the Greater Earth Kingdom's] conventional military and naval, contracted spirit, Pal and earthbender strength along with its [the Greater Earth Kingdom's] massive industrial, economic and population might while [the copies of the restored Bogd Khanate of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang] keeping their [the restored Bogd Khanate's of Mongolia and the surviving Mengjiang's] own military, economic and technological might with the same thing happening to the Lesser Earth Kingdom and the surviving Empire of Manchukuo. The copy of the restored Ottoman Empire in Xingjiang replaces the East Turkestan equivalent within the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, the surviving Kingdom of Tibet merges with the Tibetian equivalent home of the Air Nomads within the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, and the copy of the Far Eastern Republic is placed on the Russian East Coast equivalent of the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki The South-East Asian nations [the Philippines, the Indonesian Federation, Malyasia, Brunei, Burma, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, the Tungning Kingdom in Cantonia] along with the restored Kingdom of Hawaii, all merge with their counterparts in the South-East region of the Asia-equivalent region of the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki, with the restored Tungning Kingdom and Cantonia both merging with the regions of the Greater Fire Nation within the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki that correspond to their locations, keeping their own industrial, economic and military might while maintaining the Greater Fire Nation's in the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki's industrial, economic and military strength along with the fire-benders within these regions. The same happens to the rest of the copied South East Asian nations within the surviving Co-Prosperity Sphere, except that these nations and Hawaii also maintain the water-bending presence and Earth-bending presence within these regions. A somewhat more successful Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] that is not only formed by a post-1216 surviving House of Plantagenet-ruled Angevin Empire that [the post-1216 surviving House of Plantagenet-ruled Angevin Empire] manages to win the 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 Hundred Years War due to Joan of Arc not being present in its [this alternate Brittania's] original world and timeline, with the French-Welsh Plantagenet side branch House of Tudor's control over the British Isles lasting past 1603 and what became the real life Anglized ruling branch of the German House of Hanover only managing to take power after the man known in the real world George II of Great Britain, George Augustus of the House of Hanover, seized power from the last Tudor monarch in the Code Geass universe, Queen Elizabeth III after her [Elizabeth III's] death, after Napoleon's successful invasion of the British Isles in 1752 and the subsequent flight of the British monarchy and royal government to Canada and the British West Indies, [George Augustus] forming the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] as Emperor George II, but this Holy Brittanian Empire's version of Queen Victoria having the British throne pass to the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha upon her [this version of Queen Victoria's] death, with these alternate Windsors forming the Third Bulgarian Empire which they [ the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha] ruled in real life from 1908-1945 immediately after the Crimean Wars instead of 1908 like in the real world, seizing Macedonia and Thrace and [ the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha in this alternate Brittania's home world] also almagating the British Empire in exile into the Bulgarian Imperial territories, [the Catholic branch of the main Germanic branch of the current British ruling family, the House of Saxe-Gotha in this alternate Brittanian Empire's own world], thus proclaiming the Holy Brittanian Empire [Code Geass] as a continuation of both the original Imperium Romanum [Roman Empire] and the Imperium Romanum's rump state of Eastern Rome, [Eastern Rome] better known as the Byzantine Empire. This alternate Brittanian Empire joined the Central Powers in WW1 against a revanchist France, post-monarchic Britain and a Russian Tsardom looking for revenge [basically a WW1 version of WW2 Axis powers]in its homeworld and won alongside the other Central Powers, [This alternate Brittanian Empire in its home world after its home world's version of WW1] reclaiming the British Isles as well as parts of the French coast. It also seized control of European Russia in the 1950s A.D after the Brittanian royal family argued that the Romanovs marrying into them meant they had the right to rule Russia, facing heavy resistance from communists and Russian nationalists, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] twenty years before the events of canon Code Geass start is [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] pulled from its [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire's] original world and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] transported into the amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki where the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten all [the events of Monmusume Kuesto!, Zero no Tsukaima, and Musume Hyakka Jiten] occur, [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] replacing and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merging with [the nation-state this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire simultaneously replaces and merges with] the theocratic, monster girl-hating absolute royal parliamentary monarchial theocratic crusader state of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten], which [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] is [the Kingdom of Lescatie in this story] also informally known as Lautreamont Knight Country [Seikoku no Doragunā] within this story with the Kingdom of Lescatie also being [what the Kingdom of Lescatie also is] known as the Tristain Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima], the Gallia Kingdom [the Zero no Tsukaima] or the Albion Kingdom [Zero no Tsukaima] and the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] being its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this story's] official name [the Ordesian Empire] in this story as well. The transported Brittanian Empire also maintains the Canada, Jamaica, New England equivalent amalgam world of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki's heavy Native American Waterb ending presence. The Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this story also has the canon Lautreamont Knight Country's within the canon Seikoku no Doragunā's universe's tradition of dragon breeding and Pals [Seikoku no Doragunā] being [Pals] used in warfare along with tanks, airplanes, modern naval power and floating battleships. The Ordesian Empire is also known as the Beltrum Kingdom in this fic [Seirei Gensōki] due to its [the Ordesian Empire's in this fic's] control of both the land and seas The Kingdom of Lescatie's territories in this world are the British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the France proper equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, and the West Occitania equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the European Russia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, the Bulgaria including Greek Thrace and Macedonia equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and the reigning monarchs of Kingdom of Lescatie in this story have the combined title of King/Queen of the England/British Isles equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima and that of the Bulgarian/Russian Tsar equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. Its [The Kingdom of Lescatie's] history is basically if the House of Plantagenet-equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima-ruled Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continued to exist past 1216 and the subsequent the Hundred Years War of 24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453 being won by the English equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima, with the marriage of the Queen Elizabeth I of England equivalent to the Peter the Great of the Russian Empire equivalent in this world essentially creating this world's version of a Anglo-Russian Empire, transforming Albion-Gallia-Tristian into the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] and allowing the Tudor equivalent in in the world of Zero no Tsukaima continuing to rule the Angevin Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima until the House of Hanover equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima take power after the death of the last Tudor-equivalent Queen on 1 August 1714. An equivalent of the American Revolution does occur with the USA equivalent quickly becoming a protectorate of the Swiss-Austrian Imperial House of Hapsburg-equivalent-ruled Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima. The Holy Roman Empire equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima allows its non-Austrian German territories independence as a Royal House of Hohenzollern-equivalent-ruled Kingdom of Prussia-equivalent ruled German Empire in response to Germanic-equivalent nationalism and the ideas promoted by a failed French Revolution equivalent, quickly seizing the Italian peninsula during the Italian-equivalent wars of Independence and reabsorbing the Italian states equivalent into itself, becoming truly Holy, Roman and an Empire, quickly transitioning into a Austria-Hungary Equivalent. The Crimean War equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima ends with a draw although the Third Bulgarian Empire is created in the 19th century equivalent in the world of Zero no Tsukaima instead of 1908. The Catholic branch of the real-life British royal family, the House of Saxe-Gotha-equivalent ruling over the Third Bulgarian Empire-equivalent as its imperial family reunites with the Protestant British branch-equivalent, becoming the imperial family of the Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] as well after the passing of the Queen Victoria-equivalent. The Ordesian Empire [Seirei Tsukai no Bureidodansu] then styles itself as the restoration, continuation and reformation of the Eastern Roman Empire-equivalent since the current imperial family rules over the major territories controlled by the Eastern Roman equivalent as well as the France equivalent and British Isles-equivalent. When this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire replaces and [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] merges with the version of the Kingdom of Lescatie [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this fic, it [this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire] inherits the Kingdom of Lescatie's [Musume Hyakka Jiten] in this fic's conventional military and naval forces along with its [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic's] Pal [Seikoku no Doragunā] forces and [the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic's] resources, with people in this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire merging with their counterparts in the Kingdom of Lescatie in this fic when the transplacement [of this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire to the alternate world which is an almagam of Seikoku no Doragunā, Avatar: the Last Airbender and Seirei Gensōki] and subsequent merger [of this alternate Holy Brittanian Empire with the Kingdom of Lescatie's in this fic].

Below is an attempt to rise to this challenge with a slice of the expansive story: --- The pale moon hung high over the sprawling, neon-lit cityscape of the newly rejuvenated Tokyo, as the last few embers of the Great Cataclysm's destruction were snuffed out. Within the imposing Imperial Palace, the air tingled with chakra—yet, no resident of the post-apocalyptic streets below would dream that this arcane energy was anything but a divine gift of the revered Ōtsutsuki clan, Japan's saviors and rulers. In the depths of the palace, the young Emperor, an Ōtsutsuki with spiky blue hair and bright eyes, stood before a grand map, his fingers tracing the borders of the empire that had risen from the ashes. Beside him stood the aging Shogun, a descendant of the Tokugawa, his stern face softened by the glow of hope. \\"My Emperor,\\" the Shogun said, his voice gruff with loyalty and concern, \\"We must solidify our hold over the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The stability of the Asiatic bloc will be crucial in confronting these... magical nuances.\\" The Emperor nodded, his gaze fixed on the territories marked by flourishing sigils. \\"Ready the Imperial Japanese Army. We march not as conquerors but as unifiers, protectors against the chaos of this new reality.\\" At that moment, the grand doors creaked to reveal a regal figure, adorned in a battle gown that shimmered with a celestial aura. The princess, Ayaka, was no stranger to these strategy gatherings. \\"Brother, there is more,\\" she interjected, waving a hand, and a projection of the Western Hemisphere shimmered into existence. \\"We have established contact with an Empire to the East—a brother in spirit, though foreign in form.\\" The Emperor considered this, a tactical mind whirring. \\"An Empire across the sea…” he murmured. “We shall extend an olive branch, for alliances are forged not solely by blood but by ambition and mutual respect. Dispatch a delegation aboard the celestial fox, our most advanced Tsukiyomi Class Carrier.\\" In the halls of the copied American Empire's Capitol, members of the Imperial Court bustled with activity, the unexpected arrival of curiosities and creatures beyond comprehension setting their world askew. \\"Your Majesty,\\" began the Secretary of the Exterior, a woman of sharp intellect, \\"Messages from the water benders in New Amsterdam suggest a mingling of worlds—a confluence of nations and histories rivaling our own.\\" The American Emperor, a striking figure with Habsburg features, clenched his jaw. \\"This new world poses threats and opportunities alike. Yet courage and curiosity have carved the Americas from the wilderness before. Inform our allies in the Donau-Adriabund; let us not face this alone.\\" As the delegations from the competing empires made their way toward each other, crossing the chasms of sea and unraveling truth, the world seemed to hold its breath. What politik and power plays would unfold as ancient dynasties, magical kingdoms, and technological titans converged? Onboard the celestial ship bound for the American shores, Princess Ayaka stood on the deck, her hand caressing the sleek metal rail. \\"We stand upon the cusp of a new era,\\" she whispered to the winds. \\"Let us be the heralds of harmony.\\" And so, the skies above bore witness to the dance of destiny, as magic and machination, chakra and charm, gave birth to an age of wonderment—a world where legends walked, and empires strived for unity beneath the star-kissed mantle of an ever-expanding horizon."},{"prompt":"Random popular minimalist scene, one word with coffee before it","completion":"Coffee Nook"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Coffee Nook","completion":"\\"Coffee Nook | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, Tees, and Prints | Modern Kitchen and Cafe Decor | Unique Gift for Coffee Lovers\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee Nook | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, Tees, and Prints | Modern Kitchen and Cafe Decor | Unique Gift for Coffee Lovers.

Aplicar AI en MongoDB puede involucrar diversas técnicas y herramientas que permiten mejorar las operaciones con la base de datos y extraer insights valiosos de los datos almacenados. A continuación, presento varios enfoques y aplicaciones de AI para MongoDB: **Indexación Inteligente:** MongoDB puede usar técnicas de AI para analizar patrones de acceso a los datos y crear índices automáticos que mejoran el rendimiento de las operaciones de búsqueda. **Analítica Avanzada:** Integrar herramientas de machine learning con MongoDB permite realizar análisis predictivo y descriptivo de los datos. Las librerías de Python como Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow o PyTorch pueden trabajar con los datos extraídos de MongoDB para construir modelos predictivos. **Automatización de la Limpieza de Datos:** AI puede automatizar la detección y corrección de problemas de calidad de datos, como inconsistencias o datos faltantes, antes de que los datos se utilicen para análisis o entrenamiento de modelos. **Procesamiento de Lenguaje Natural (NLP):** Si MongoDB se utiliza para almacenar grandes cantidades de texto, la AI puede aplicarse para comprender y analizar el contenido de estos textos. Puede ser útil para tareas como análisis de sentimientos, extracción de entidades, y clasificación de documentos. **Motor de Recomendaciones:** Se pueden desarrollar sistemas de recomendación utilizando los datos de comportamiento de los usuarios almacenados en MongoDB. La AI puede identificar patrones y realizar recomendaciones personalizadas basadas en esos datos. **Integraciones con Plataformas de AI:** Plataformas como Google Cloud AI, Azure Machine Learning, o AWS SageMaker se pueden integrar con MongoDB para potenciar las capacidades de AI en los datos existentes dentro de la base. **Detalles Técnicos para Integrar AI con MongoDB:** La integración de AI con MongoDB generalmente implica los siguientes pasos: 1. **Extracción de Datos:** Utiliza el driver de MongoDB para tu lenguaje de programación (por ejemplo, PyMongo para Python) para extraer los datos que necesitas para análisis o entrenamiento de modelos de AI. 2. **Preprocesamiento:** Limpia y transforma los datos extraídos de MongoDB para que estén en el formato adecuado para aplicar técnicas de AI. Esto puede incluir la normalización de datos, manejo de valores faltantes, y la conversión de datos categóricos a formatos numéricos. 3. **Entrenamiento de Modelos:** Utiliza los datos preprocesados para entrenar modelos de machine learning. Puedes hacerlo localmente o aprovechar plataformas de cloud computing que ofrecen recursos computacionales escalables. 4. **Aplicación de Modelos:** Los modelos entrenados pueden aplicarse para hacer predicciones o análisis directamente en la aplicación que se conecta a MongoDB, o bien los resultados pueden almacenarse de nuevo en la base de datos para su posterior consulta y utilización. 5. **Actualización de Modelos:** A medida que se recopilan más datos, puedes reentrenar y actualizar los modelos de AI para mejorar su precisión y rendimiento. Al trabajar con AI en MongoDB, es importante tener en cuenta consideraciones como la escalabilidad, la gestión de recursos y la seguridad de los datos. Además, se debe asegurar que la base de datos esté bien estructurada y optimizada para facilitar estas operaciones avanzadas."},{"prompt":"Como entrenar modelos CHATGPT","completion":"ChatGPT es un modelo de lenguaje basado en la arquitectura Transformer desarrollado por OpenAI, una organización líder en investigación de inteligencia artificial. Estos modelos han sido entrenados en una amplia variedad de textos disponibles en internet para desarrollar la capacidad de generar texto que parezca natural y responder preguntas de manera conversacional, entre otras tareas de procesamiento del lenguaje natural (NLP). A pesar de que la tecnología detrás de ChatGPT es accesible a través de APIs y frameworks de modelado de lenguaje, el entrenamiento desde cero de estos modelos gigantes, como GPT-3 o GPT-4, generalmente no es práctico para la mayoría de los individuos u organizaciones debido a las enormes cantidades de datos y la potencia de cómputo requerida. Además, OpenAI no ha compartido el modelo entrenado completo para estos modelos de gran tamaño debido a preocupaciones de ética y mal uso. Sin embargo, para aquellos interesados en desarrollar habilidades en el entrenamiento de modelos de lenguaje, aquí hay los pasos generales que se seguirían para entrenar un modelo más pequeño y simplificado basado en el tipo de arquitectura utilizado por GPT (Transformers): 1. **Obtener datos de entrenamiento**: Necesitas compilar un gran conjunto de datos de texto para entrenar tu modelo. Estos deben ser diversos y representativos del lenguaje que deseas que el modelo genere. Los datos también deben estar libre de sesgos y contenido sensible tanto como sea posible. 2. **Preprocesar los datos**: Esto incluye limpieza del texto (eliminación de caracteres no deseados, normalización, etc.), tokenización (dividir el texto en palabras o subpalabras), y encoding (convertir palabras o caracteres en números que el modelo pueda comprender). 3. **Definir el modelo**: Debes elegir una arquitectura de modelo (por ejemplo, GPT-2 disponible a través de Hugging Face Transformers Library) y definir su tamaño (número de parámetros, capas, tamaño de los embeddings, etc.), adecuado para la capacidad de tu GPU y el tamaño de tu conjunto de datos. 4. **Entrenamiento**: Utilizar una framework como TensorFlow o PyTorch para entrenar el modelo con tus datos. Durante este proceso, el modelo ajustará sus parámetros internos para minimizar una función de pérdida, que mide qué tan bien el modelo está generando texto que se parezca a los datos de entrenamiento. 5. **Evaluation**: Debes evaluar periódicamente tu modelo en un conjunto de datos de validación para asegurarte de que está aprendiendo correctamente y no esté sobreajustándose a los datos de entrenamiento. 6. **Afinamiento**: Si tienes acceso a modelos pre-entrenados como los de OpenAI (GPT-3 a través de la API) o de la biblioteca Hugging Face, puedes realizar un proceso llamado afinamiento (fine-tuning), que consiste en continuar el entrenamiento del modelo en un conjunto de datos específico para adaptarlo a tareas o dominios particulares. 7. **Despliegue**: Una vez que el modelo está entrenado y afinado, puedes desplegarlo en una aplicación o servicio para que otros puedan interactuar con él a través de una API, por ejemplo. 8. **Monitoreo y Mantenimiento**: Asegúrate de tener procesos para monitorear y mantener el modelo una vez que esté en producción, revisando continuamente su desempeño y efectuando ajustes necesarios. Dado el coste y la complejidad de entrenar modelos de la escala de ChatGPT, la mayoría de las personas que desean construir aplicaciones similares optan por utilizar las APIs proporcionadas por OpenAI u otras organizaciones, las cuales permiten acceder a modelos ya entrenados y listos para su uso en aplicaciones de lenguaje natural. Esta es la ruta más práctica para muchos desarrolladores y empresas."},{"prompt":"diferencias entres Views a Agreggation en Mogodb","completion":"En MongoDB, \\"views\\" y \\"aggregation\\" son dos conceptos distintos que se utilizan para manipular y presentar datos, pero sirven a propósitos diferentes y se utilizan de maneras diferentes. A continuación, se explican estas diferencias: # Views en MongoDB 1. **Definición:** Una view en MongoDB es una representación virtual de los datos que reside en la base de datos. Se define con una operación de agregación y se comporta como una colección de solo lectura para los usuarios. 2. **Propósito:** Las views son utilizadas para simplificar el acceso a los datos, ocultar la complejidad, exponer una parte específica o preprocesada de los datos, y ofrecer un nivel adicional de control de acceso a los datos subyacentes. 3. **Persistencia:** Las views no son colecciones físicas y no almacenan datos; son el resultado de una consulta de agregación ejecutada sobre la marcha. 4. **Operaciones:** No se pueden realizar operaciones de escritura (insert, update, delete) en una view en MongoDB. Las operaciones se deben realizar en la colección subyacente que la view representa. # Aggregation en MongoDB 1. **Definición:** La operación de aggregation en MongoDB es un framework poderoso que permite realizar análisis de datos complejos y transformaciones de datos directamente dentro de la base de datos. 2. **Propósito:** Se utiliza para procesar datos y devolver resultados computados, permitiendo filtrar, agrupar, sortear, y de muchas otras maneras transformar los datos de las colecciones. 3. **Persistencia:** Las operaciones de agregación se ejecutan en tiempo de consulta y no persisten sus resultados a menos que se especifique explícitamente (por ejemplo, utilizando \`out\` o \`merge\` para guardar el resultado en una nueva colección). 4. **Operaciones:** La operación de agregación utiliza una variedad de etapas (stages) como \`match\`, \`group\`, \`project\`, etc., y puede operar sobre una o varias colecciones para producir el conjunto de resultados. # Comparación y Uso - **Persistencia vs No Persistencia:** Las views en MongoDB no persisten datos, mientras que el resultado de una operación de agregación puede ser opcionalmente persistido. - **Solo Lectura vs Transformaciones:** Las views son de solo lectura, mientras que una operación de agregación puede transformar los datos de muchas maneras pero no necesariamente se almacena el resultado a menos que se use \`out\` o \`merge\`. - **Abstracción vs Procesamiento:** Las views sirven como una capa de abstracción para los usuarios, ocultando la complejidad de las operaciones de agregación subyacentes. Mientras, el framework de agregación en sí se utiliza para fines de procesamiento de datos, y puede ser usado para crear views. - **Rendimiento:** Debido a que las views son esencialmente la salida de una operación de agregación guardada y ejecutada en tiempo real, pueden tener un rendimiento menor en comparación con las operaciones sobre colecciones físicas, especialmente si la operación de agregación es compleja. - **Seguridad:** Las views ofrecen un mecanismo de seguridad adicional, ya que permiten exponer solo una parte de los datos, y en un formato específico definido por la operación de agregación. Para resumir, las views ofrecen una manera de exponer datos procesados de forma segura y simplificada para los usuarios finales, mientras que las operaciones de agregación son una herramienta para análisis y transformación de datos más complejos dentro de la propia base de datos. Ambos son extremadamente útiles y su elección dependerá de las necesidades específicas de presentación y manipulación de datos en tu aplicación."},{"prompt":"Créame una configuración para NATS.io, donde contemple cluster y JetStreams","completion":"NATS es un sistema de mensajería de alta performance y distribuido que ofrece patrones de publicación-suscripción (pub-sub), solicitudes-respuestas y colas de trabajo distribuidas.

Crearemos una configuración para cada servidor. **Servidor 1 - nats-server-1.conf:** \`\`\`hcl # Configuración para JetStream jetstream { store_dir=\\"/path/to/datastore\\" # Asegúrate de que este directorio exista y sea escriturable } # Configuraciones del servidor y clúster server_name: \\"nats-server-1\\" http_port: 8222 # Puerto para monitoreo y administración web cluster { name: \\"nats-cluster\\" listen: \\"0.0.0.0:6222\\" routes: [ \\"nats-route://nats-server-2:6222\\", \\"nats-route://nats-server-3:6222\\" ] } # Permitir a otros clusters conectar gateway { name: \\"nats-gateway\\" listen: \\"0.0.0.0:7222\\" gateways: [ {name: \\"nats-cluster\\", urls: [\\"nats://nats-server-2:7222\\", \\"nats://nats-server-3:7222\\"]} ] } \`\`\` **Servidor 2 - nats-server-2.conf:** \`\`\`hcl # Configuración para JetStream jetstream { store_dir=\\"/path/to/datastore\\" } # Configuraciones del servidor y clúster server_name: \\"nats-server-2\\" http_port: 8222 cluster { name: \\"nats-cluster\\" listen: \\"0.0.0.0:6222\\" routes: [ \\"nats-route://nats-server-1:6222\\", \\"nats-route://nats-server-3:6222\\" ] } gateway { name: \\"nats-gateway\\" listen: \\"0.0.0.0:7222\\" gateways: [ {name: \\"nats-cluster\\", urls: [\\"nats://nats-server-1:7222\\", \\"nats://nats-server-3:7222\\"]} ] } \`\`\` **Servidor 3 - nats-server-3.conf:** \`\`\`hcl # Configuración para JetStream jetstream { store_dir=\\"/path/to/datastore\\" } # Configuraciones del servidor y clúster server_name: \\"nats-server-3\\" http_port: 8222 cluster { name: \\"nats-cluster\\" listen: \\"0.0.0.0:6222\\" routes: [ \\"nats-route://nats-server-1:6222\\", \\"nats-route://nats-server-2:6222\\" ] } gateway { name: \\"nats-gateway\\" listen: \\"0.0.0.0:7222\\" gateways: [ {name: \\"nats-cluster\\", urls: [\\"nats://nats-server-1:7222\\", \\"nats://nats-server-2:7222\\"]} ] } \`\`\` Estas configuraciones asumen que los servidores pueden comunicarse entre sí en los puertos especificados (6222 para el clústering y 7222 para gateways). También, no se han especificado configuraciones de seguridad como el uso de TLS o la autenticación/autorización a través de tokens o certificados, que serían importantes en un entorno de producción. Para arrancar NATS con la configuración de uno de estos archivos, usarías el siguiente comando: \`\`\`sh nats-server -c /path/to/nats-server-1.conf \`\`\` Ejecutarías un comando similar en cada uno de los servidores, utilizando la ruta al archivo de configuración correspondiente. Una vez que todos los servidores estén funcionando con su respectiva configuración, formarán un clúster y podrás utilizar JetStream para persistir mensajes dentro de ese clúster. Recuerda que para ambientes de producción es necesario considerar los aspectos de seguridad, redundancia, balanceo de carga y respaldos entre otros, para garantizar la confiabilidad y disponibilidad del sistema."},{"prompt":"Créame una configuración para NATS.io, donde contemple cluster, JetStreams y Autentificacion descentralizada","completion":"En NATS, puedes configurar un clúster con autenticación descentralizada utilizando las funcionalidades que provee el sistema de cuentas y JWT para manejar la autenticación y autorización de una manera descentralizada y segura. La configuración del clúster y JetStream no cambia sustancialmente, pero ahora incluiremos configuraciones para la autenticación descentralizada. Aquí tienes un ejemplo de configuración que contempla un clúster de NATS con soporte para JetStream y autenticación descentralizada a través de JWT y NKeys. **Nota:** La configuración detallada de las cuentas con JWT y NKeys puede ser un proceso extenso y técnico que implica generar claves y JWT para cada entidad. Vamos a enfocarnos en las partes esenciales de la configuración del servidor NATS que habilitan estos mecanismos. Primero, debes crear tus cuentas y sus respectivos JWTs usando las herramientas de línea de comandos de NATS (\`nsc\`). Cada cuenta tendrá un JWT asociado y claves privadas conocidas como NKeys. Voy a proporcionar una configuración de ejemplo para uno de los nodos del clúster. Necesitarás adaptar y repetir una configuración similar para cada uno de los nodos de tu clúster, personalizando las rutas y puertos según tu entorno. **nats-server.conf para un nodo del clúster:** \`\`\`hcl # Configuración para JetStream jetstream { store_dir: \\"/path/to/datastore\\" # Asegúrate de que este directorio exista y sea escriturable } # Autenticación descentralizada con JWT y NKeys # operator es ubicación al JWT del operador (el que define las cuentas) operator: \\"/path/to/operator.jwt\\" # Cada servidor tiene su propia clave NKey # server_nkey es la clave pública de este servidor NATS server_nkey: \\"NAXXXXXXXX...\\" # Configuración del clúster y de los nodos del clúster server_name: \\"nats-server-1\\" http_port: 8222 cluster { name: \\"nats-cluster\\" listen: \\"0.0.0.0:6222\\" # Pueden ser los NKeys públicos de otros nodos del clúster # Para autorizar toda la comunicación entre ellos authorize { # Clave pública NKey del servidor 2 \\"NBXXXXXXX...\\": { permissions { publish { allow: \\">\\" } subscribe { allow: \\">\\" } } } # Clave pública NKey del servidor 3 \\"NCXXXXXXX...\\": { permissions { publish { allow: \\">\\" } subscribe { allow: \\">\\" } } } } routes: [ \\"nats-route://nats-server-2:6222\\", \\"nats-route://nats-server-3:6222\\" ] } # Gateway para permitir conexiones entre clústers gateway { # ... # Configuración similar a la anterior } \`\`\` La autenticación de usuarios para la conexión a los servicios de NATS se maneja a través de JWTs que representan la identidad y los permisos de la cuenta. Los clientes deben ser configurados para utilizar su NKey privada y proporcionar un JWT cuando establecen una conexión con el servicio NATS. Recuerda que esta es una configuración de ejemplo altamente simplificada. En una implementación de producción, necesitarás asegurarte de que sigues mejores prácticas en cuanto a seguridad y manejo de claves y configuraciones críticas. Para implementar esta configuración en tu clúster, deberás replicar un proceso similar de configuración con las respectivas claves NKeys y JWTs para cada nodo, asegurándote de que los permisos sean consistentes y seguros a través del clúster entero. Además, sería prudente implementar sistemas para la rotación y revocación de claves y JWTs en el caso de una falla de seguridad. Finalmente, para desplegar efectivamente un clúster de NATS con esta configuración, es recomendable familiarizarse en profundidad con las herramientas y documentación de NATS, y realizar pruebas extensivas para asegurarse de que todas las piezas de la configuración trabajen juntas de manera segura y eficiente."},{"prompt":"Créame una configuración de cluster de una base de datos en MongoDB","completion":"Crear un clúster de base de datos en MongoDB generalmente implica configurar una réplica de MongoDB. Una réplica set es un grupo de procesos mongod que mantienen el mismo conjunto de datos. Aquí hay un ejemplo de configuración básica para un clúster de réplica set de tres nodos en MongoDB. Primero, cada nodo del clúster de réplica debe tener un archivo de configuración similar que indique el réplica set al que pertenece. A continuación, se proporciona un archivo de configuración de ejemplo para un nodo en un réplica set. Tendrás que replicar y adaptar esta configuración para cada uno de los nodos de tu clúster. **mongod.conf (para cada nodo respectivamente):** \`\`\`yaml # mongod.conf replication: replSetName: \\"rs0\\" # Nombre del réplica set, el mismo en todos los nodos net: bindIp: localhost,<hostname/IP del nodo> # IP local y pública del nodo del clúster port: 27017 security: authorization: \\"enabled\\" # Puedes desactivar temporalmente durante la configuración inicial storage: dbPath: /path/to/db/directory # Asegúrese de que este directorio exista y sea escriturable journal: enabled: true \`\`\` **Pasos para configurar el clúster:** 1. **Preparar los Archivos de Configuración:** Crea y modifica el archivo \`mongod.conf\` para cada nodo añadiendo el IP/hostname correcto. 2. **Iniciar los Servicios MongoDB:** Inicia el proceso MongoDB en cada nodo con el archivo de configuración correspondiente: \`\`\`sh mongod --config /path/to/mongod.conf \`\`\` 3. **Configurar el Réplica Set:** Conéctate a uno de los nodos de MongoDB a través del shell de MongoDB: \`\`\`sh mongo --host <nombre del host o IP del nodo> --port 27017 \`\`\` Inicializa el réplica set ejecutando el siguiente comando en el shell mongo del primer nodo: \`\`\`javascript rs.initiate({ _id: \\"rs0\\", members: [ { _id: 0, host: \\"<nombre del host o IP del nodo 1>:27017\\" }, { _id: 1, host: \\"<nombre del host o IP del nodo 2>:27017\\" }, { _id: 2, host: \\"<nombre del host o IP del nodo 3>:27017\\" } ] }) \`\`\` Esto configurará el clúster y elegirá automáticamente un líder. 4. **Comprobación del Estado del Réplica Set:** Después de la configuración inicial, chequea el estado del réplica set con: \`\`\`javascript rs.status() \`\`\` Esto te proporcionará información detallada sobre el estado de cada nodo en el réplica set. 5. **Securizar el Clúster:** Es fundamental asegurar la comunicación entre los nodos del clúster: - Configura la autenticación entre los nodos, usualmente utilizando el mecanismo de autenticación de clave compartida (keyFile). - Configura TLS/SSL para asegurar las comunicaciones entre los nodos del clúster. - Configura la autenticación de los usuarios que interactuarán con el clúster. Para que la configuración del clúster sea exitosa y segura, es importante entender las opciones de configuración y tomar medidas adecuadas para proteger los nodos y los datos. Además, ten en cuenta los requisitos adicionales como el backup y recuperación de datos, balanceo de carga y monitoreo del clúster una vez esté en funcionamiento."},{"prompt":"Créame una configuración para NATS.io, donde contemple cluster, JetStreams y Autentificacion descentralizada. Y agrégame ejemplos de creación de usuario","completion":"Para crear una configuración de NATS que incluya clúster, JetStream, y autenticación descentralizada, primero debemos prepararnos para usar JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) y NKeys, que son fundamentales para la autenticación descentralizada en NATS. Con el enfoque de JWT y NKeys, cada cuenta en NATS tiene su propio JWT que describe a los usuarios y sus permisos, así como claves únicas para la autenticación. Usaremos \`nsc\`, la herramienta de línea de comando de NATS, para gestionar cuentas, usuarios y JWTs. Primero, se necesita crear un operador, una o más cuentas, y uno o más usuarios dentro de esas cuentas. Aquí hay una vista general de los pasos (los detalles precisos pueden depender de tu versión y configuración específica del \`nsc\`): **1. Instalar \`nsc\` y crear un operador:** \`\`\`sh nsc add operator [nombre_operador] \`\`\` **2. Crear una cuenta y usuarios dentro de esa cuenta:** \`\`\`sh nsc add account [nombre_cuenta] nsc add user --name [nombre_usuario] \`\`\` Cada usuario tendrá su propio NKey y un JWT que identificará sus permisos dentro de la cuenta. Una vez creada la estructura de operador, cuenta y usuarios, puedes exportar los JWTs necesarios y configurar tus servidores de NATS para utilizarlos. Asumiendo que has creado el operador y las cuentas con sus respectivos usuarios, aquí tienes una configuración de ejemplo para un nodo en un clúster de NATS. Debes replicar y adaptar esta configuración para cada uno de los nodos del clúster. **nats-server.conf:** \`\`\`hcl # Habilitar JetStream jetstream { store_dir: \\"/path/to/jetstream/data\\" # Asegúrate de que este directorio exista y sea escriturable } # Configuración del clúster server_name: \\"nats-server-1\\" http_port: 8222 cluster { name: \\"nats-cluster\\" listen: \\"0.0.0.0:6222\\" routes: [ \\"nats-route://nats-server-2:6222\\", \\"nats-route://nats-server-3:6222\\" ] } # Configuración de autenticación descentralizada operator: \\"/path/to/operator.jwt\\" resolver: { type: \\"full\\" dir: \\"/path/to/jwt/files\\" } # El resto de las configuraciones pueden ir aquí... \`\`\` En cada nodo del clúster, necesitarás colocar los JWTs de las cuentas apropiadas en el directorio especificado en la opción \`dir\` bajo \`resolver\`. **Ejemplo de comandos para agregar usuarios con \`nsc\`:** \`\`\`sh # Asegúrate de seleccionar tu operador correcto primero nsc edit operator --select # Agrega una nueva cuenta nsc add account --name [nombre_cuenta] # Cambia al contexto de la nueva cuenta nsc env -s [nombre_cuenta] # Agrega un usuario a la cuenta actual nsc add user --name [nombre_usuario] \`\`\` **Nota:** Por defecto, \`nsc\` guarda los JWTs de la cuenta y los usuarios en directorios estructurados basados en el nombre del operador y las cuentas. Deberás configurar el resolver de tu servidor NATS para que apunte al directorio donde \`nsc\` guarda los JWTs de la cuenta o copiarlos manualmente al directorio especificado en la configuración del servidor NATS como se muestra en la opción \`dir\`. Para iniciar el servidor NATS utilizando esta configuración: \`\`\`bash nats-server -c /path/to/nats-server.conf \`\`\` Realiza este proceso para cada nodo del clúster; sólo cambia el \`server_name\` y \`routes\` para apuntar a los otros nodos. Finalmente, cuando los clientes intenten conectarse al clúster de NATS, deberán proporcionar su propio NKey privado y JWT para ser autenticados. Aquí hay un ejemplo de cómo un cliente puede conectarse utilizando las librerías de cliente de NATS que soportan autenticación con NKeys y JWTs: \`\`\`sh export NATS_NKEY_SEED=/path/to/nkey-user-A.seed export NATS_CREDS=/path/to/user-A.creds nats-sub -s nats://nats-server-1:4222 subject \`\`\` Este es sólo un ejemplo simplificado y un punto de partida. Configurar NATS con autenticación descentralizada y JetStream en un entorno de producción implica consideraciones adicionales de seguridad, monitoreo y escalabilidad. Asegúrate de referirte a la documentación de NATS y \`nsc\` para obtener instrucciones detalladas y procedimientos recomendados."},{"prompt":"Créame una configuración para NATS.io, donde contemple cluster de 3 servidores, JetStreams y Autenticación/Autorización descentralizada de JWT.

Puedes utilizar las credenciales generadas anteriormente para conectar clientes a tu clúster NATS. **Paso 6: Limitar Recursos de Inquilinos** Como se demostró en el Paso 2, se puede limitar los recursos por inquilino dentro de la configuración de la cuenta utilizando \`nsc\`. Cuando creas o modificas una cuenta con \`nsc\`, puedes especificar límites como: - \`--max-conns\`: Máxima cantidad de conexiones concurrentes. - \`--max-data\`: Cantidad máxima de datos que la cuenta puede tener almacenado en JetStream. - \`--max-msg-payload\`: Tamaño máximo para un mensaje individual. Esta es una configuración altamente simplificada y no cubre aspectos de seguridad como alojar los archivos JWT en una ubicación segura, limitar quien pueda tener acceso a estas configuraciones o la implementación de mecanismos de transporte seguro como TLS. En producción, la configuración y la seguridad del clúster de NATS deberán cumplir con las políticas y requerimientos específicos de la organización en relación a redes, acceso a datos y cumplimiento de regulaciones. También se debe seguir la documentación oficial de NATS y \`nsc\` para las instrucciones detalladas y las mejores prácticas en la configuración de seguridad y gestión de cuentas y usuarios."},{"prompt":"Summarize \\"Weight transferring techniques for transformer models employ the pre-trained weights of a larger model to enhance the initialization of student models.

Or aujourd'hui, on ne cherche guère. On revient à l'une ou à l'autre des traditions, on la défend. Nos convictions se fondent moins sur des valeurs ou des vérités aperçues que sur les vices ou les erreurs de celles dont nous ne voulons pas. Notre pensée est en retraite ou en repli. Dans ce monde où la dénégation et les passions moroses tiennent lieu de certitudes, on ne cherche surtout pas à voir, et c'est la philosophie, parce qu'elle demande à voir, qui passe pour impiété. Maurice Merleau Ponty, éloge la philosophie.\\" Quelle est l'idée génerale de ce texte?","completion":"L'idée générale de ce texte de Maurice Merleau-Ponty est une critique de l'attitude contemporaine à l'égard de la philosophie et de la pensée critique. Il soutient que la philosophie est une quête de compréhension, une entreprise qui implique la recherche active de vérités et de significations. Cependant, il observe que dans le monde moderne, cette quête est souvent délaissée au profit d'un retour à des traditions dogmatiques et d'une défense rigide des convictions préexistantes. Merleau-Ponty déplore le fait que les gens tendent à s'appuyer sur la critique et le rejet des idées des autres plutôt que sur la découverte de nouvelles valeurs ou vérités. Il y a une tendance à l'immobilisme intellectuel, une réticence à s'exposer à de nouvelles perspectives et à remettre en question les convictions établies. Cela mène à une sorte de fermeture d'esprit, une pensée en retrait qui ne cherche pas à s'étendre au-delà des limites imposées par les préjugés ou l'adhésion aveugle à une tradition. Merleau-Ponty trouve problématique que cette situation entraîne une forme de dénégation où des “passions moroses” remplacent la recherche de certitudes. La philosophie demande une volonté de voir au-delà de ce qui est facilement perceptible, mais dans un monde où regarder et explorer de nouvelles idées est dévalorisé, la philosophie est perçue comme une impertinence ou une transgression. En somme, Merleau-Ponty fait l'éloge de la philosophie en tant que pratique essentielle dans la recherche de la vérité et de la signification, et il critique la tendance culturelle qui néglige ces aspirations au profit d'un attachement préjudiciable aux idées acceptées sans un examen critique suffisant."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The Waterfall methodology is best suited for projects with well-defined goals, clear documentation, and where requirements are unlikely to change over time. This approach works well for industries that demand rigorous stages, such as construction, manufacturing, or aerospace. Conversely, Agile is a better fit when projects exist in a volatile environment with evolving requirements, as in the software and technology sectors, or when the delivery needs to be incremental to accommodate feedback loops and continuous improvement. Pros and cons of the approaches: Waterfall's primary advantage is its structured approach; every phase has specific deliverables and a review process, providing a clear roadmap from the beginning to the end. However, its rigidity can become a disadvantage when there is a need for flexibility. Changes in scope or requirements often lead to costly overruns and delays. Agile, on the other hand, is adaptive and encourages frequent reassessment and modification. It allows teams to deliver work in small, manageable iterations, enabling quicker turnarounds and flexibility. The downside to Agile is that, without a defined end point, projects can drift or expand beyond their original scope, and this iterative process might require more stakeholder involvement. How leadership role changes: In the Waterfall model, leadership usually takes on a hierarchical form, with project managers traditionally directing team members and making key decisions. This top-down approach can create clear lines of accountability but may also stifle innovation. In Agile, leadership is more collaborative. Project leaders, or Scrum Masters, facilitate team autonomy and encourage cross-functionality. They play a servant-leader role, removing obstacles and enabling team members to determine the best way to meet objectives. How stakeholder engagement changes: In Waterfall, stakeholder engagement is often limited to the requirements gathering phase and the final review. Unfortunately, this can lead to a \\"throw it over the wall\\" mentality, where feedback comes too late to inform the process. Agile emphasizes constant stakeholder involvement through regular meetings, reviews, and iterations. Stakeholders see progress in real-time and contribute to the evolving product, making the process more transparent and inclusive. How communication format and style changes: Communication in Waterfall tends to be formal, relying heavily on documented requirements and status reports. Meetings are less frequent and often adhere to a set schedule. In Agile, communication is more informal and continuous, with daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. The focus is on face-to-face interactions and visual artifacts, such as Kanban boards, to foster a shared understanding of the project's status and next steps.

I want you to use the following directions, criterias, and writing styles to create one for grief. Introduction The Room Model is a metaphorical framework developed by LTBlueLatios that uses the setting of a room to encapsulate the internal experience of an individual with a particular psychological state or condition, such as depression, grief, schizophrenia, or ADHD. It employs symbolic elements within the room and associated actions taken by the individual to represent the symptoms, challenges, emotional responses, and potential strategies for managing or coping with the condition. Adaptions for a browser game is planned. Here’s an overview of how the model works and guidance on how it can be adapted to other conditions: Basic Structure of the Room Model: Room Setting: The room represents the individual’s mind or personal psychological space. Certain features (walls, window, furniture, etc.) symbolize key aspects of the condition’s impact on the individual’s life and perception. Environmental Elements: Colors (or lack thereof), light sources, shadows, and temperature capture the mood and the emotional climate associated with the condition. Distortions or alterations in the room reflect cognitive disruptions or changes in perception. Objects and Items: Specific objects within the room (clocks, mirrors, vials, etc.) represent symptoms, coping mechanisms, and the passage of time or the influence of external factors. The condition of these items and the individual’s interactions with them capture behaviors, decision-making processes, and the consequences of these choices. Actions and Pathways: Choices available to the individual within the room signify different behavior strategies or treatment options. These can range from adaptive to maladaptive approaches. Reactions (anger, hope, fear) to these choices indicate emotional responses and resistance or adaptation to change. Scenarios are used to help immerse the user into the experience. It describes events that don’t require a user’s interaction to manifest. Here is an example: the depression model You’re in a room, and the world’s black and white. Your bed’s black, your walls are black, your floor is black, your drawer is black. There is a window which brings in white light. The light’s just white, that’s it. You stare outside the window, it’s just sketches of a landscape all over. There is a tree, but there’s not much to it. After all…everything is just a sketch. The clock, it’s slow. Sometimes it doesn’t even move. You can’t even tell the time anymore. The white light, which brings some form of light into your room, is slowly fading away. If you don’t do something, the light will fade away, taking you with it. Choice: You take an antidepressant Congrats, there’s an invisible light from somewhere. The light colors the world around you, making you happy again. But when the timer runs out, the colors will disappear and the world will return to its previous state.","completion":"Grief Model – “A Room of Memory and Shadows” Introduction: The Room Model for grief takes you into a space where the air is thick with loss and the past clings to every surface. It is a room that, though familiar, has become changed and foreign in the wake of absence. Within this room, we will explore how grief manifests and what it means to live within its confines, as we seek pathways towards healing and acceptance. Room Setting: The room is dimly illuminated, draped in muted tones that once were vibrant. Its walls, coated in layers of shifting shadows, seem to close in, representing the suffocating feeling of loss. Photographs and mementos adorn the surfaces, but many frames have been turned face down or are covered by veils of dust, symbolizing how memories can be both cherished and overwhelmingly painful. Environmental Elements: The room's atmosphere fluctuates with the individual's journey through grief. A cold draft snakes through the air, embodying the chill of emptiness and the shiver of reality setting in. Momentary warmth enters through a crack in the window, allowing a gentle breeze to stir the curtains—this is the fleeting comfort of good memories. The quality of light varies; a dull grayness pervades most days, but occasional shafts of sunlight offer hope and represent moments of peace and acceptance. Objects and Items: A prominent clock in the room ticks loudly, then softens, sometimes stopping altogether, mirroring the erratic passage of time in the face of grief. An array of vials on the mantelpiece holds tears, each labeled with a different emotion: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. Their levels rise and fall as the person in the room grapples with their feelings. The central piece of furniture is a large chest. It is here the individual can store memories and sentiments, choosing which to revisit and which to tuck away for another time. The chest never locks; it signifies the choice to confront or set aside grief. Actions and Pathways: Within the room, every step is heavy, each movement deliberate. The individual may choose to sit in silence, succumbing to the shadows, or they may light a candle, casting a soft glow that pushes back the dark—this represents the choice to engage with supportive therapies or personal rituals that honor the lost loved one. A bookshelf contains journals, a way to sort through tangled thoughts or invite reflection on the nature of the loss and one's evolving identity in its wake. Standing at the window, the choice to open or close it represents the decision to let the world in or retreat from it, facing the isolation or the support it may offer. Scenarios: Sometimes, a sudden gust scatters the papers on the desk, mimicking the unexpected waves of emotion that can overwhelm even when one believes they are in control. At other times, a soft lullaby hums from an unseen source, a soothing but sorrowful reminder of what was. The individual may find a seed hidden in the room—a symbol of regrowth. Planting it in a pot by the window offers a scenario of nurturing hope, demonstrating that even in the depths of grief, there can be new beginnings and the room, just like the heart, can slowly find a way to welcome life once more. Choice: You engage in a support group or therapy As you share your story and listen to others, you realize that the walls of the room expand. The ceiling lifts, making it easier to breathe. The shadows retreat to the edges, still present, but less threatening. It's a reminder that while grief may reside with us, it does not have to consume us—shared understanding and compassion bring color back into the room, one hue at a time."},{"prompt":"now turn it into the story format","completion":"In the Room of Memory and Shadows, where whispers of the past cling to the corners and echoes of laughter and sorrow are trapped in the fabric of the curtains, here sits Elizabeth, perched on the edge of a bed that has known too many sleepless nights. The walls around her are bathed in subdued hues, a stark contrast to the vivid life they once contained. Shadows creep along the surfaces, writhing and stretching with the day's waning light, emblematic of the oppressive weight of her loss. Frames with photographs—moments captured in a happier time—are turned away, their faces hidden to protect her from the sharp pang of remembrance. Elizabeth shivers in the room's cold draft, a ghostly reminder of absence, a void where warmth once radiated. A breeze from the window occasionally breaks the chill, fluttering the curtains and offering a whisper of comfort. The light in this room is reluctant, its grayness pervasive, interrupted only by timid beams that occasionally pierce through to offer solace. She hears the clock, ticking, a maddening meter of reality's cruel continuation, then slowing, pausing, as if giving her permission to exist outside of time, to remain with her memories just a moment longer. Across the room, a mantle holds vials filled with her tears—labels marking the stages of her grief. They rise and recede, peaks and troughs marking the tumultuous journey through pain. At her feet, a large chest rests, its wood worn smooth by the touch of countless reflections. Here, Elizabeth carefully places her treasured reminiscences when they become too heavy, too vivid to hold. Yet, this chest never locks; she's free to revisit these memories, in her own time, at her own pace. Her days are slow, punctuated by moments of stillness and sudden activity. Some moments find her collapsed in the engulfing comfort of the shadows, letting the darkness consume her. Other times, a surge of defiance has her lighting a candle, its gentle glow a beacon against the sorrow, a quiet act of rebellion against the night. The bookshelf creaks under the weight of filled journals, her penned efforts to unravel the knots of her heartache. At times, she stands at the window, her hand hesitating at the latch, weighing the choice to let the world’s noise—or its healing touch—inside. Scattered scenarios unfold without warning: a gust of wind sends papers flying like lost birds, a mirrored surge of pain for what will never be. Then, a soft melody, a remembered lullaby, seems to seep from the walls, soothing yet heart-wrenching in its tender recollections. Hidden within the folds of the room's sorrow, Elizabeth finds a small, overlooked seed. With a tender hand, she places it in a pot on the windowsill, a symbol of new beginnings, an affirmation of life continuing amidst heartbreak. As she waters the soil, there's a feeling of the walls receding, the air becoming lighter, the shadows receding to mere silhouettes. With trepidation, Elizabeth joins a support group, where her story intertwines with the tales of others. Their shared pain and understanding stir the room, transforming it. Walls expand, the ceiling lifts, and the omnipresent shadows scatter. Her voice joins the chorus of healing as color weaves its way back into the room, an intricate dance of light against the darkness, a reminder that within the depths of grief there remains the capacity for connection, for renewal, for growth."},{"prompt":"The lighting in the room is dull and flickering, like the flame of a candle struggling against a silent draft.

Around you, every piece of furniture wears a white shroud. These ghostly covers obscure the room's familiarities, rendering them foreign and indistinct—a metaphor for denial's grip, which blurs the permanence of absence, leaving you grappling with shadows of doubt.

I want you to use the following directions, criterias, and writing styles to create one for grief. Make sure to include the 5 stages of grief Introduction The Room Model is a metaphorical framework developed by LTBlueLatios that uses the setting of a room to encapsulate the internal experience of an individual with a particular psychological state or condition, such as depression, grief, schizophrenia, or ADHD. It employs symbolic elements within the room and associated actions taken by the individual to represent the symptoms, challenges, emotional responses, and potential strategies for managing or coping with the condition. Adaptions for a browser game is planned. Here’s an overview of how the model works and guidance on how it can be adapted to other conditions: Basic Structure of the Room Model: Room Setting: The room represents the individual’s mind or personal psychological space. Certain features (walls, window, furniture, etc.) symbolize key aspects of the condition’s impact on the individual’s life and perception. Environmental Elements: Colors (or lack thereof), light sources, shadows, and temperature capture the mood and the emotional climate associated with the condition. Distortions or alterations in the room reflect cognitive disruptions or changes in perception. Objects and Items: Specific objects within the room (clocks, mirrors, vials, etc.) represent symptoms, coping mechanisms, and the passage of time or the influence of external factors. The condition of these items and the individual’s interactions with them capture behaviors, decision-making processes, and the consequences of these choices. Actions and Pathways: Choices available to the individual within the room signify different behavior strategies or treatment options. These can range from adaptive to maladaptive approaches. Reactions (anger, hope, fear) to these choices indicate emotional responses and resistance or adaptation to change. Scenarios are used to help immerse the user into the experience. It describes events that don't require a user's interaction to manifest. Here is an example: the depression model You're in a room, and the world's black and white. Your bed's black, your walls are black, your floor is black, your drawer is black. There is a window which brings in white light. The light's just white, that's it. You stare outside the window, it's just sketches of a landscape all over. There is a tree, but there's not much to it. After all...everything is just a sketch. The clock, it's slow. Sometimes it doesn't even move. You can't even tell the time anymore. The white light, which brings some form of light into your room, is slowly fading away. If you don't do something, the light will fade away, taking you with it. Choice: You take an antidepressant Congrats, there's an invisible light from somewhere. The light colors the world around you, making you happy again. But when the timer runs out, the colors will disappear and the world will return to its previous state.","completion":"Introduction to the Grief Model: In the Room Model for grief, the room acts as a metaphorical space that embodies the emotional journey and psychological landscape of someone who is grappling with loss and its ensuing grief. The elements of the room – from its architecture to the objects within it – metaphorically illustrate the stages of grief, the fluctuating emotional states, and the journey towards healing and acceptance. Here is a conceptualization of the grief model, taking into account the five stages of grief as defined by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. The Room Setting for Grief: The room is dimly lit, with walls that seem to fluctuate subtly in color with shades of gray that range from light to dark, reflecting the ebb and flow of emotion. The wallpaper appears torn in some places, symbolizing the initial tear in the fabric of one's life experience following a significant loss. There's a sense of disarray, as the orderliness of the room has been disrupted – much like the internal state of the griever. Environmental Elements: The quality of light in the room changes unpredictably, correlating with the unpredictability of the grieving process. Shadows loom larger and then recede as if mirroring the stages of grief, representing moments of intense emotion and their partial relief. The temperature in the room varies, at times feeling uncomfortably cold in moments of emotional numbness, yet stiflingly warm during bursts of emotion. Objects and Items: - A clock with erratic movement displays the disorientation of time in grief. Sometimes it ticks loudly, while at other times, it seems to stop altogether, representing the stage of denial, where time and reality are difficult to accept. - A fragmented mirror lies partially intact, partially shattered. When examined, it reflects the anger in the griever’s face, showing how the self-identification fluctuates during the grieving process. - An old, out-of-tune piano with sheet music sits in a corner. Attempting to play might produce discordant sounds akin to bargaining; the desire to restore harmony reflects the internal negotiations about what could have been done differently. - A heavy blanket laid across a neglected sofa symbolizes depression; it's there to provide comfort, but it's also a weight that can be difficult to push aside to move on. - A single door, sometimes obscured by the shifting environment, represents the eventual path towards acceptance, leading to a space that feels more orderly and peaceful, the beginning of living with the loss. Actions and Pathways: - An individual in the room might find themselves pacing back and forth, representing the restlessness of grief and the struggle to find a path through it. - There are opportunities to tidy up the room, perhaps a subconscious route to injecting order and control into a world upended by loss. - Reaching out and opening windows, allowing fresh air and light to sweep into the room can represent moments of willingness to connect with the world outside one's grief. - Engaging with the objects—fixing the clock, piecing the mirror back together, tuning the piano—underscores proactive choices in the journey of healing. Each action serves as a small step in acknowledging reality, expressing and processing emotion, seeking resolution, and ultimately moving towards acceptance. Scenarios: In one scenario, the room dramatically darkens as a storm audible outside represents the tumultuous phase of anger, where the individual might rage against the unfairness of their loss. In the aftermath, objects might appear differently, indicating a transformational shift in the grieving process. Another scenario presents the room with a thin layer of dust settling on all surfaces. The individual must make the choice to start cleaning, opening the door, or continuing to sit in the dusty, stagnant environment, demonstrating their engagement with the world akin to the oscillation between depression and acceptance. Through the Room Model for grief, LTBlueLatios provides a poignant and dynamic representation of a deeply personal and multifaceted experience, providing an understanding and therapeutic tool for those navigating the complexities of bereavement."},{"prompt":"Now i want you to provide it in the story format, as is the style of the depression model","completion":"You find yourself standing in the center of a room, shades of gray painting everything within it. Your surroundings feel strangely intimate, yet unrecognizable—the walls undulate subtly, the colors of mourning. You look down at your hands, and for a moment, they seem like a sketch, incomplete and waiting for color to return. There's a clock on the wall, its ticking is erratic, sometimes loud, sometimes absent entirely, as if time itself has become a stranger since the loss. You try to focus on the hands of the clock as they stutter, reflecting your own denial that life outside this room marches forth without regard for your sorrow. Scattered on the hardwood floor are shards of a once-whole mirror. As you walk over, your movement is heavy, each step a conscious effort. You catch a glimpse of your reflection in a larger fragment—an image punctuated by anger, eyes flashing with the pain of questions unanswered, of every 'why' left hanging in the silence of the room. In the corner, there's an old piano with sheets of music that once knew beautiful melodies. Now, you press the keys in a tentative attempt to reclaim what was lost, but the notes jar against one another, dissonant, like the bargaining within your heart. \\"If only,\\" you whisper to the unheeding keys, \\"if only things were different.\\" A thick, heavy blanket is draped over a nearby sofa, a symbol of the depression that weighs you down. It looks warm, inviting you to curl up and shut out the world. For a moment, you consider succumbing to it, letting it envelop you, the weight a familiar companion in the loneliness of the room. However, there's a door in the room that occasionally catches the light—it's the door of acceptance. Sometimes it seems to fade into the walls, obscured by shadows. Yet, it remains, a silent invitation to a new phase, a subtle promise that balance can be restored. The pathways ahead are not straightforward; the decision to sit under the blanket or to approach the door and what lies beyond, to engage with the bitterness in the mirror or to attempt bringing harmony back to the piano keys, all lay before you. These choices mirror the internal battles of grief. Scene: At times, the light in the room dims abruptly as storm sounds rage fiercely outside. You stand amidst the tempest within, letting the rage, pain, and sorrow wash over you in waves. As the storm abates, the room is different—objects have shifted, light filters in differently, signaling a transformation within. Another scene finds the room overtaken by a soft but pervasive layer of dust, signifying the periods of quiet suffering and stagnation. The act of cleaning, of clearing away the dust, becomes a metaphor for the effort taken to move through grief, to open windows and doors, to let the outside in, and to slowly rejoin the flow of life outside this room of sorrow. In this room of grief, the movements you make, the objects you interact with, and the door you choose to walk through will all shape your journey through loss. The room changes as you do, a testament to the evolving nature of grieving, and the resilience of the human spirit to eventually find color in a gray-sketched world."},{"prompt":"I personally don't like this story as I find it doesn't really relate to grief.","completion":"I apologize for not meeting your expectations. Let me provide a revised version that may resonate more closely with the experience of grief and incorporate the five stages into the narrative. You enter a room that feels strangely familiar yet hauntingly empty, a physical manifestation of the void left in the aftermath of a loss. This room is your mind's attempt to process the grief – an environment that shifts with each stage, as unpredictable and turbulent as your emotions. The lighting in the room is dull and flickering, like the flame of a candle struggling against a silent draft. This is Denial – the light wavering, refusing to settle, as if in defiance of the darkness that loss brings. Around you, the furniture is draped in white sheets, outlines of what once was, now unrecognizable and distant. A shattered mirror rests against a wall, fragmented pieces scattered across the floor. As you glance at the fractured reflections, Anger surges through you. Each shard feels like a betrayal, a slice of the reality you're not ready to confront. You notice your hands trembling, the urge to sweep away the broken pieces rising within, but it's futile – the mirror will never be whole again. In the corner stands a dusty grandfather clock, its pendulum swaying back and forth, the ticking a relentless reminder of time passing – time without the one you've lost. You find yourself before it, hands poised above the clock face, bargaining with the universe for a different outcome. If only you could turn back its hands, perhaps you could undo what's been done. But the clock, unyielding, continues its rhythm, indifferent to your pleas. Next, you observe a painting half-veiled by shadow – a once vibrant landscape now grey and subdued. Depression washes over you as you study the image. The colors that used to brighten the canvas are now muted, obscured by the unshakeable fog of sorrow. You long to lift the veil, to restore the painting's beauty, yet you feel anchored in place, the weight of your grief too heavy to shoulder. But then, something catches your eye – a door ajar, spilling a sliver of soft, warm light into the room. Though faint, it's a beacon of Acceptance. It beckons you to step forward, to emerge from the oppressive atmosphere and to see beyond the walls of this room. With each breath, the light grows stronger, steadier, inviting you to embrace a new reality where the presence of loss is woven into the fabric of life, yet no longer defines it. The journey through this room is not linear, nor is it quick. You circle through denial, anger, bargaining, and depression, often finding yourself standing before the door of acceptance. Each time you approach it, the light waxes and wanes, reflecting the natural ebb and flow of healing. The room changes with you, embodying the turmoil, the fight, and the eventual peace that comes with understanding that grief is not a space to be forever inhabited, but a passage to be navigated, leading to the hopeful light of day."},{"prompt":"The lighting in the room is dull and flickering, like the flame of a candle struggling against a silent draft.

This could be improved, and we don't incorporate any explanations as this is meant to be a purely sensational piece","completion":"I understand the need for a more evocative and less explicative approach. Let's try to convey the experience of grief through vivid imagery and sensation alone: You're in a room where the light falters, dimming to a fluttering wisp before flaring back in brief defiance. Ghostly sheets drape over shapes that once held meaning, now obscure and alien, as if they belong to another life that slipped silently through your fingers. The air is stale, heavy with the scent of forgotten flowers, a silent testament to consolation that has wilted into history. It feels thick in your lungs, like breathing through a cloth soaked in memories. A clock stands off-kilter, its tick out of tune with the world outside these four walls. It mocks you with its indifference, each chime a countdown to another moment gone without them. On the floor lies a fractured picture frame, the glass shattered, the image inside a blur. Your feet tread near it, the shards reflecting pieces of a fragmented self, sharp with wrath unfocused, undirected. A piano rests in the shadow, keys dust-covered and untouched. Notes that once danced in the air are now silent, locked away. Your fingers hover, hesitate, aching to unleash a melody that echoes the bargaining whispers of your heart. In the darkest recess of the room, a blanket is crumpled, a cocoon of sorrow. Its folds hide the shape of your despair that curls and nestles within, a quiet place where the world narrows to the space of a heartbeat. Yet, despite it all, there’s a sliver of light that persists. It seeps from the edges of a door left slightly ajar. This almost imperceptible glow dares you to look beyond, where the unknown breathes gently, patiently, waiting for the day you choose to step through."},{"prompt":"the lighting in the room can be beter used for denial","completion":"In a corner of the room, a solitary candle casts an unreliable glow that sways and dances with the subtle currents of the air. This is the room's sole concession to light, and it fights a losing battle against the encroaching shadows that seek to claim everything around you. It's as if the room itself is reluctant to acknowledge the darkness, its paltry flame a symbol of your own struggle to fend off the reality of loss. The atmosphere is thick with the sense of things postponed, the items around you shrouded under white sheets like statues in a closed museum—unmoving, untouchable relics from a time before grief. The air is taut with the silence of an indrawn breath, the wait for a sign that things might revert to the way they once were, that the dreaded stillness might be broken by the returned rhythm of a familiar heartbeat. This candle's dance is your dance of Denial, a flickering reluctance to resign yourself to the permanence of absence. Shadows stretch and cling like reminders of a presence that's no longer there, and yet in the weak, stubborn light, you find a momentary solace, a fleeting reprieve from the truth that hovers just beyond the room's dim borders. In the play of light and dark, objects appear distorted, fluid—a chair, a photograph, a cup—all things that used to hold a place in your daily rituals now seem alien, distant. The room's landscape is transformed by this vacillation, a world where sureties have become uncertainties, familiar shapes now question marks in the twilight. Every so often the candle flickers with a nearness to extinguishing, drawing your breath in tight, steeling you against the impending blackout. But time and again, it rallies, its small flame a testament to the part of you that isn't ready to accept, that isn't prepared to step into the dark just yet. In its light you hesitate, between what was, what is, and what must one day be."},{"prompt":"You're in a room, and the world's grey. The world seems familiar but void at the same time. The windows are open, with the curtains fluttering silently. The air brought in is cold and makes you shiver, but sometimes it brings in a warm and comforting breeze. The candles are flickering in the wind. At times they seem to give up, but they refuse. They deny the shadow that at times tries to consume them. On the floor lies a shattered mirror. You can't see yourself, or anything in that reflection, it reminds you of too much and makes you angry. You try to clean up the shards of glass, but it's futile; you know the mirror will never be whole again. There is a clock on the dresser. You stare at it wondering, what if you could just turn back the hands, turning back time to when it was all good again. Back to when nothing bad was happening, perhaps maybe get yourself a second chance. But alas, when you try to turn back the hands, it doesn't budge, instead it continues stuttering forward. The ticking of the clocks soon slowly becomes louder as your heartbeat syncs up to it. You notice on one end of the room an old fashioned piano. It plays by itself, sad but beautiful tones.You try pressing on the keys, but it's jarring. You whisper to the piano: \\"If only things were different\\". You then continue playing on the piano, the keys becoming less jarring and more normal. You start to cry, but the piano seems to acknowledge you, comforting you as you play it. \\"Maybe things aren't so bad after all\\", you think, while you look at the teddy bear that accompanied you in the piano seat. The denial section is certainly flawed, the one about the candles. They don't seem to fit the narrative nor the purpose it's trying to convey. I can say the rest is pretty much decent","completion":"Thank you for the feedback; let's refine the portrayal of denial in the narrative around the candles to better fit the intended theme. --- You're in a room, and everything is bathed in unsaturated hues, a grayscale world where even shadows seem hesitant, clinging to objects like ethereal whisperings of what once was vibrant and clear. The windows stand open, inviting the elements to play their parts: gusts of air dance through, alternating between a cold that nips at your skin and a warmth that momentarily fills the void with an echo of comfort. The candles are scattered around like silent sentinels of your inner sanctum. They flicker determinedly against the unpredictable wind—a manifestation of your own internal battle. With each gust, they waver, losing luster, yet stubbornly they reignite, fighting off the darkness with a resilience born of denial. They resist the certainty that accompanies shadows, just as you ward off the sinking realization of your loss. The room's air swirls with the scent of wax and wick, a sensory anchor that keeps you tethered to the present, to a reality where hope has not been entirely extinguished. Each staving off of the shadows by the candle's glow is a victory, however small, against the tide of acceptance that creeps at the edges of your consciousness. As the flame leans away from the gusts, then steadies itself, it mirrors the part of you that isn't ready to look into the heart of your grief. It's this tiny beacon of light that allows you to linger in the half-truth of your own making — a world where the finality of loss is held at bay by the simplest of defenses: a fragile, glimmering, determined light."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The world seems familiar but void at the same time. The windows are open, with the curtains fluttering silently. The air brought in is cold and makes you shiver, but sometimes it brings in a warm and comforting breeze. The candles are flickering in the wind. At times they seem to give up, but they refuse. They deny the shadow that at times tries to consume them. On the floor lies a shattered mirror. You can't see yourself, or anything in that reflection, it reminds you of too much and makes you angry. You try to clean up the shards of glass, but it's futile; you know the mirror will never be whole again. There is a clock on the dresser. You stare at it wondering, what if you could just turn back the hands, turning back time to when it was all good again. Back to when nothing bad was happening, perhaps maybe get yourself a second chance. But alas, when you try to turn back the hands, it doesn't budge, instead it continues stuttering forward. The ticking of the clocks soon slowly becomes louder as your heartbeat syncs up to it. You notice on one end of the room an old fashioned piano. It plays by itself, sad but beautiful tones.You try pressing on the keys, but it's jarring. You whisper to the piano: \\"If only things were different\\". You then continue playing on the piano, the keys becoming less jarring and more normal. You start to cry, but the piano seems to acknowledge you, comforting you as you play it. \\"Maybe things aren't so bad after all\\", you think, while you look at the teddy bear that accompanied you in the piano seat. What do you think of my room model being used to display grief? I personally find the candles portrayol for denial to be off but I think the rest is pretty good. Share my your feedback!","completion":"Your room model is an evocative and metaphorical representation of the stages of grief, with various elements symbolizing different emotions and experiences one might have during the grieving process. The room captures a blend of the tangible and the psychological, crafting an ambiance filled with introspection and emotion. Let's delve into the symbolism of each element: - **The Grey World**: The grey tones convey the numbness and disorientation that often accompany the initial shock of loss. Grey is a color that can represent the lack of vitality and the difficulty of seeing life in its full vibrancy post-loss. - **The Open Windows with Fluttering Curtains**: The windows beckon both cold and warm air, symbolizing the unpredictable and changing emotions of someone who is grieving. The curtains fluttering silently could represent the quiet moments of reflection and the passage of time. - **The Flickering Candles**: While you express doubts about the portrayal of denial here, the candles' perseverance against the wind could be reflective of the inner strength a person must muster in the face of denial. They acknowledge the threat of being extinguished (overwhelmed by grief) but resist it. It's a complex symbol, with the potential for conflicting interpretations. - **The Shattered Mirror**: The broken mirror is a powerful symbol of the irreversible change in identity and perception that occurs after a significant loss. The inability to see oneself reflects how loss can fragment one's sense of self. The anger and frustration at the futility of trying to restore the past are poignant. - **The Clock**: The clock captures the desire to reverse time and the realization that time only moves forward. The synchronization of the heartbeat with the ticking of the clock underscores the relentlessness of time's progression through pain. - **The Old-Fashioned Piano**: Music often serves as a conduit for expressing and processing deep emotions. The initial dissonance reflects the disharmony within the self, while the transition to harmony may symbolize the acceptance and the catharsis that can come from engaging with one's emotions. - **The Teddy Bear**: This element introduces a comforting presence, reminiscent of childhood innocence and simpler times, perhaps signifying support, love, and the idea that not all is lost. Your model creates a space for contemplation and emotional exploration, reflecting the complexity and personal nature of grief. As feedback, consider the following: - **Candles**: If the candles' symbolism for denial feels misaligned, perhaps they might instead represent hope—the small flame persistently burning, even when it seems all light might go out. - **More Dynamic Elements**: Introduce elements that change over time to represent the evolution of grief and healing. This could be a plant that starts wilted but slowly revives, symbolizing growth and rebirth. - **Interactivity**: If this room is an interactive model, allowing the person experiencing it to engage with the elements (like rearranging pieces of the broken mirror or playing the piano) could provide a more profound, personal connection to the journey of grief. Overall, your model is poignant and beautifully constructed. It allows for multiple layers of interpretation and invites engagement on an emotional level, which is a profound way to respect and represent the multifaceted nature of grief."},{"prompt":"You're in a room, and the world's grey. The world seems familiar but void at the same time. The windows are open, with the curtains fluttering silently. The air brought in is cold and makes you shiver, but sometimes it brings in a warm and comforting breeze. You're in a state of confusion. You don't believe you should be here. Then it comes back to you, and suddenly the room turns red. You see your reflection on a mirror, which you then smash to pieces. On the floor now lies the shattered mirror, the room now fades to a deeper gray. You don't want see yourself, or anything in that reflection, it reminds you of too much and makes you angry. You try to clean up the shards of glass, but it's futile; you know the mirror will never be whole again. There is a clock on the dresser.

After a while, the world becomes colorful again, but the room still bears the marks and reminds you. I fixed the denial section and added a part about remembering the memories of the griefing","completion":"Your revised narrative adds depth to the emotional journey and creates a more dynamic portrayal of grief and the struggle to cope with loss and memory. Each element now seems to play a more distinct role in the process. Let's examine each in turn: - **The Grey World and Transition to Red**: This transition could symbolize the initial shock and denial morphing into anger and heightened emotion. The red hue sharply contrasts with the grey, reflecting an outburst of feeling. - **The Shattered Mirror**: Now with an associated action of smashing it, this represents the frustration and perhaps self-destructiveness that can accompany grief. It's a dramatic illustration of the pain of memories and the longing to escape them. - **The Clock**: This motif remains an apt symbol for the inexorability of time and the desire to reclaim what has been lost. - **The Old-Fashioned Piano Playing by Itself**: Symbolizing the autonomous flow of life even amidst personal turmoil, it suggests that beauty and sadness coexist. Your interaction with it represents engaging with pain and transitioning towards emotional harmony. - **The Flickering Candles**: Now fixed in the plot, the candles' resilience in the face of the wind fits well with the theme of endurance through hardship. Their persistence amidst adversity embodies a quiet strength that can be found even in moments of despair. - **The Teddy Bear**: This element maintains its role as a symbol of comfort, innocence, and a touchstone to happier times. - **The World Becoming Colorful Again with Remaining Marks**: This addition speaks to a form of acceptance and the fact that grief may change over time without completely disappearing. The lasting marks acknowledge that while the color returns to life, the impact of the loss endures. This emotional arc reflects the non-linear experience of grief, where stages overlap and emotions can turn suddenly. The elements of your room model work together to tell a story of struggle, reflection, and the gradual, partial restoration of vibrance in one's world. As for feedback: - **Sense of Progression**: You have now created a more explicit sense of progression, not just through the room's changing colors but also through the narrative's engagement with each object. The narrative leads the participant through an emotional journey that ends on a cautiously optimistic note. - **The Piano's Role**: The interplay with the piano is particularly striking because it becomes an outlet for emotional expression. There's potential in exploring that further. Perhaps the song played on the piano could evolve, moving from dissonant to melodic, mirroring the emotional transition. - **Memory and Change**: The memory aspect is sensitively handled, with the room's transformation reflecting how the past can continue to impact and color present experience. The visuals of the room \\"bearing the marks\\" ensure that the narrative does not gloss over the lasting effects of grief. Your model is a beautifully designed space for individuals to reflect upon the complexities of grief, memory, and recovery. It encourages personal engagement and leaves room for interpretation, mirroring the unique experience each person has with grief."},{"prompt":"The room still bears the marks, shades of gray in places with the shattered mirror, that reminds you. What do you think of the inclusion of the shattered mirror?","completion":"The inclusion of the shattered mirror in your narrative is a poignant and effective symbol. Mirrors have long been associated with reflection, both literally and metaphorically, making them powerful tools for exploring themes of self-awareness and introspection. In the context of your narrative of grief and recovery, the shattered mirror can represent several layers of meaning: 1. **Irreversible Change**: The act of the mirror shattering signifies an irreversible event or loss. Just as the mirror cannot be returned to its former state, certain experiences fundamentally alter one's life, and things can never go back to how they were. 2. **Fragmentation**: The broken pieces can symbolize the fragmented sense of self that often accompanies grief. The person may feel as though they are in pieces, much like their reflection in the broken mirror. 3. **Painful Recognition**: The mirror initially served as a reflection of the self that was too painful to bear, leading to its destruction. This can relate to the avoidance phase of grief, where facing the full reality of loss is overwhelming. 4. **Lasting Impact**: The remnants of the mirror, which the room still bears, signify the enduring impact of loss. The memory and the pain do not simply disappear; they become part of the landscape of one's life, reminding the individual of what was and what has changed. 5. **Safety and Fear**: Shards of glass can evoke a sense of danger and the need for careful handling, mirroring the delicacy with which one must navigate the aftermath of a shattering experience. 6. **Reflection on Change**: The inability to see one's whole reflection could also represent the challenge of understanding one's changed identity after a significant loss. The fractured image makes it hard to piece together a coherent sense of self. The shattered mirror's presence in the room adds depth to the narrative's portrayal of emotional turmoil and the complex process of piecing oneself back together after a loss. It acknowledges that some experiences leave permanent marks, even as life's color returns, and that the process of healing and recovery is not about restoring the old but about accepting and integrating the new. The mirror's inclusion emphasizes that grief is not just a passage of time but a transformation of self."},{"prompt":"I personally believe that this model isn't exactly fit for \\"Scenarios\\" or \\"Choices\\" as it's a constant action. You can't exactly stop and cope, you have to let the stages run its course.","completion":"Your interpretation speaks to a fundamental aspect of grief—it is often a process that unfolds organically, not at our command or convenience. It can indeed be challenging to represent the journey through grief with traditional \\"scenarios\\" or \\"choices\\" because these imply a level of control that we do not typically have over our emotional response to significant loss. Grief is highly individual and can feel like a stream carrying us along, sometimes turbulent and sometimes calm, but always forward. It's not a series of strategic decisions where one can simply choose an option and move to the next stage. As such, your model seems to reflect the inevitable, sometimes passive nature of working through grief. Here are a few considerations your narrative aligns with regarding the grieving process: 1. **Immersive Experience**: Grief often envelops us entirely, much like the room surrounds the individual in your narrative. There's no stepping outside of it until it has run its course. 2. **Inevitability**: Just as the clock continues forward and the piano plays autonomously, grief moves forward through its stages without the need for decisions or prompting from the individual. Our emotional processes have their rhythm and timeline. 3. **Reflection, Not Alteration**: The shattered mirror doesn't offer a choice to be unbroken; it invites reflection on its current state. In grief, reflection is often the only \\"choice\\" presented—not whether to grieve, but how to understand and integrate the experience into one's life. 4. **Transformation Over Time**: The return of color to the room suggests that changes do occur over time, but they are not necessarily the result of conscious decisions; rather, they might be the result of many small, perhaps subconscious, shifts. 5. **Integration of the Experience**: The room still \\"bearing the marks\\" signifies that the experience of grief does not wholly pass but becomes a part of the individual's life story. There is no choice that erases the experience; there is only the evolution of the individual's relationship with it. By emphasizing these aspects within your narrative, you're recognizing that while grief may encompass stages or common experiences, the progression through these is not as neatly segmented or consciously directed as one might hope. Your model illustrates that sometimes, all one can do is exist within grief, interact with the symbols and echoes it presents, and slowly, organically, find a way to integrate and move forward with the marks it has left."},{"prompt":"Do you think its best for this \\"room\\" to not have any choices or scenarios at all? Especially in a game where I can just place this after a disastrous loss","completion":"The concept of having a \\"room\\" without explicit choices or scenarios can work very effectively as a narrative device in a game, particularly after a significant in-game event such as a catastrophic loss. This approach allows players to experience grief as an emotional journey that one must navigate, rather than a series of branching paths or logical puzzles to solve. Here's why this might be beneficial: 1. **Emotional Resonance**: By not providing explicit choices, you allow players to fully immerse themselves in the emotional experience. This can lead to a deeper, more visceral connection with the game's story and characters. 2. **Realism and Authenticity**: Removing choices reflects the authenticity of grief, in that it often feels beyond our control. It mirrors the real-life sensation of being subject to the whims of one's emotions following a loss. 3. **Enforced Reflection**: Without the distraction of decision-making, players are encouraged to reflect on the narrative, the character's emotions, and the impact of the loss within the story. This can lead to a more meaningful and personal engagement with the content. 4. **Pacing and Atmosphere**: The absence of choices allows you to set a deliberate pacing, controlling the atmosphere and letting the gravity of the loss sink in. It can create a solemn, contemplative space in the game that might have a lasting impact on the player. 5. **Simplifying Narrative Complexity**: Sometimes adding branching paths after a significant event can convolute the story and diminish the impact of that event. Keeping it linear and choice-free maintains the focus and intensity of the narrative. 6. **Universal Experience**: Grief is a universal emotion, and by not gating the experience behind choices, you allow all players to go through it, ensuring it's an integral part of the game that is shared by everyone. However, if you're considering this approach, it's important to design the room carefully to maintain engagement and provide a compelling experience. You'll want to: - Use visual and auditory storytelling to evoke emotions and tell the story within the room. - Include interactive elements, such as allowing players to \\"examine\\" objects in the room, which can reveal thoughts, memories, or backstory without requiring major decisions. - Use pacing and progression within the room itself (like the change in color you mentioned) to provide a sense of movement and development, even if it's not choice-driven. In summary, the absence of choices or scenarios can be a powerful storytelling tool in a game, especially when dealing with themes of loss and grief. It's about crafting an experience that allows players to feel and reflect, rather than make decisions, which can be entirely appropriate and impactful after a critical event in the game."},{"prompt":"After a while, the world becomes colorful again. The room still bears the marks, shades of gray in places with the \\"fixed\\" shattered mirror, that reminds you. How much would the perspective change if I was to label the shattered mirror as \\"fixed\\"","completion":"Labeling the shattered mirror as \\"fixed\\" introduces an interesting narrative development and changes the perspective in a few key ways: 1. **Resilience and Repair**: By having the mirror \\"fixed,\\" there's a suggestion that while something broken can never be entirely what it was before, it can still be mended and become functional again. This shifts the focus from irreversible damage to one of resilience and the capacity for repair, even if imperfect. 2. **Visible Scars**: A fixed mirror doesn't reflect as it once did. It carries distortions or scars which are reminders of the past trauma. This conveys that while healing occurs, the history of the loss remains visible, affecting how things are seen or perceived in the future. 3. **A Sense of Agency**: When something is fixed, there's an implication of action being taken. This suggests that the individuals have some agency in the process of healing. Grief is not just something that happens to a person; it’s something a person can influence by piecing together the remnants. 4. **Incomplete but Continued Function**: A fixed shattered mirror might not offer a perfect reflection, but reflects nonetheless, perhaps in a fragmented or kaleidoscopic way. This echoes the process of finding a new sense of normalcy after a loss—different, not whole as before, but still capable of offering a view of oneself and the world. 5. **Imperfection and Acceptance**: Calling it \\"fixed\\" can also suggest a kind of acceptance of imperfection. There's a recognition that perfect restoration is impossible, but that doesn't prevent one from making the best of the current state. 6. **Aesthetic and Symbolic Transformation**: The fixed mirror could hold a new aesthetic and symbolic function. The spider-webbed lines of crack repairs could serve as metaphor for the complex and multifaceted way grief weaves into life. 7. **Potential for Growth**: There's a tacit suggestion that through the act of fixing what has been broken, growth is possible. It implies that through acknowledging and tending to our wounds, we can move forward with greater wisdom and empathy. The change from a shattered mirror to a \\"fixed\\" one alters the message from that of irreparable change to one of growth and adaptation. It offers a hopeful perspective that, although some experiences will change us forever, there is room for healing and evolving. The mirror, in its new form, is a testament to the journey through grief and the human capacity for resilience and renewal."},{"prompt":"Note: This model isn't exactly fit for \\"Scenarios\\" or \\"Choices\\" as it's a constant stream.

It is not designed for interactive scenarios or choices, as the stages of grief must naturally progress on their own."},{"prompt":"do you agree with this statement?","completion":"As an AI, I don't hold personal opinions, but I can offer insights based on the context of your model and the nature of grief as understood in psychology. The statement you've provided is aligned with many people's understanding of the grieving process. Grief is often seen as an experience that unfolds in its own time, which doesn't necessarily follow a predictable path or respond to conscious decisions. It's something one has to ride out, rather than manage through a series of choices. In the context of your room model, it seems that you are aiming to create an immersive experience that reflects this aspect of grief—thus, interactive scenarios or choices might not be compatible with the representation you are trying to achieve."},{"prompt":"What is wrong with this code? @app.route(\\"/quote\\", methods=[\\"GET\\", \\"POST\\"]) @login_required def quote(): \\"\\"\\"Get stock quote.\\"\\"\\" if request.method == \\"GET\\": return render_template(\\"quote.html\\") if request.method == \\"POST\\": my_symbol = request.args.get('symbol') return redirect(\\"/quoted)","completion":"There are several issues in the provided code: 1. Incorrect redirection string: The \`redirect(\\"/quoted)\` line is missing the closing quotation mark for the string. It should be \`redirect(\\"/quoted\\")\`. 2. Using \`request.args\` instead of \`request.form\`: For a POST request, form data is typically sent in the request body. You should use \`request.form\` to access form data, not \`request.args\` which is used to access query parameters in the URL for GET requests. The line should be changed to: \`\`\`python my_symbol = request.form.get('symbol') \`\`\` 3. Incomplete functionality for POST request: The code snippet for handling the POST request seems incomplete. It retrieves the symbol but does not actually do anything with it, such as getting the stock quote. The code should include some logic to look up the stock price for the given symbol before redirecting or returning a response. 4. Redirect endpoint likely incorrect: The \`redirect(\\"/quoted\\")\` likely does not correspond to an actual route in the application. The intent might be to redirect to another route that displays the quote, but \\"/quoted\\" doesn't seem to indicate a valid endpoint as defined by this snippet. You need to redirect to a valid route that handles displaying the stock quote. 5. Inconsistent logic in redirect: The POST request handling lacks logic to process the form data (get the stock quote based on the symbol) before redirection. Also, redirecting immediately after posting can be unconventional if you want to display some processing result. You might want to render a template directly with the obtained quote data. Below is an updated version of the code that addresses the identified issues: \`\`\`python @app.route(\\"/quote\\", methods=[\\"GET\\", \\"POST\\"]) @login_required def quote(): \\"\\"\\"Get stock quote.\\"\\"\\" if request.method == \\"GET\\": return render_template(\\"quote.html\\") # POST request my_symbol = request.form.get('symbol') if my_symbol: # Logic to get the stock quote for \`my_symbol\` # Assuming a function \`get_stock_quote(symbol)\` that returns stock information stock_data = get_stock_quote(my_symbol) if stock_data: # Render a template to display the stock quote info return render_template(\\"quoted.html\\", stock=stock_data) else: # Handle the scenario where stock data is not found (e.g., invalid symbol) flash(\\"Stock symbol not found.\\") return render_template(\\"quote.html\\") else: # Handle the scenario where no symbol was entered flash(\\"No symbol provided.\\") return render_template(\\"quote.html\\") \`\`\` Please note that this example assumes the existence of a function \`get_stock_quote(symbol)\` that obtains the stock quote, and a template \\"quoted.html\\" where the stock data is displayed.

# 语言学习中增加生词： 1. **阅读**：广泛阅读各种类型的书籍、文章和材料，特别是那些稍微超出你舒适区的材料，可以帮助你接触到新单词。 2. **使用词汇本**：使用专门的词汇本记载新词语，不断复习，并尝试编写例句使用这些新词。 3. **观看视频和听音频**：通过电影、电视剧、YouTube视频、播客和有声书来学习新的表达和单词。 4. **交流练习**：与母语者或其他学习者交谈可以暴露你对词汇的需求，帮助你学到在对话中常用的新词。 5. **使用语言学习应用**：如Duolingo、Anki、Babbel等，这些应用提供系统化的词汇学习计划。 6. **写作**：定期写作练习也是增加词汇量的好方法，它迫使你查找新单词并在语境中使用。 7. **记忆工具**：使用像Mnemonics（记忆法）或者Spaced Repetition Systems（间隔重复系统）等记忆工具帮助记住新词。 8. **使用闪卡**：创建或使用预制的闪卡来进行被动和主动的复习。 9. **参加课程或研讨会**：加入语言课程或词汇建设研讨会可以接受更正式的词汇教育。 10. **玩文字游戏或字谜**：这些活动可以以有趣的方式提高你对单词的敏感度。 # 编程中增加生词：

上面的代码描述了扩展Tokenizer词汇表的一般方法。重要的是要指出，这里我们不是对原始的Tokenizer结构进行修改，而是在预训练模型的基础上添加新的词汇。通常，你需要重新训练整个模型来有效地支持新增加的词汇，因为模型需要通过训练学习如何嵌入和处理这些新的单词。 在实际操作中，增加新单词可能涉及大量的额外工作，需要对模型结构、权重和训练过程有深入的理解。此外，在大多数情况下，直接对预训练Tokenizer进行扩展无法带来良好的效果，因为预训练模型的权重未对新添加的词汇进行优化，所以在不重新训练整个模型的情况下使用新的Tokenizer进行微调通常会产生较差的效果。"},{"prompt":"写一个网页，生成一篇文章，并将文章放在每个固定大小为500*800px的div里，做好分页的分割","completion":"要为生成的文章设计一个网页，并将其内容放在固定大小为500x800像素的\`div\`容器中，我可以为你提供一个简单的HTML和CSS的示例。在这个示例中，我们将使用JavaScript来生成一篇文章，并通过CSS来确保每个\`div\`的大小被限定在指定的尺寸。根据文章内容动态创建多个\`div\`以作分页显示。

# 确定游戏环境 首先，你需要一个游戏环境，这个环境必须能够与AI交互。例如，OpenAI的Gym提供了一个标准的接口来与不同的游戏环境互动。 # 选择算法 接着，你要选取适合任务的机器学习算法。强化学习是训练AI打游戏的常用技术，其中包括Q-Learning、Deep Q-Networks (DQN)、Policy Gradients、Actor-Critic方法、PPO等。 # 实现或使用现有的强化学习框架 你可以从头开始实现强化学习算法，或者使用现成的框架，如Stable Baselines、Ray RLLib、TensorForce等。 # 搭建训练管道 创建训练循环，让AI通过与游戏环境的互动进行学习。这通常包括模型的前向传播来决定动作，执行动作后接收环境反馈的奖励和新状态，以及后向传播来更新模型。 # 训练和评估 通过重复的游戏回合（Episodes）训练你的AI，并陆续调整参数以获取最佳表现。在训练过程中，应用评估机制来追踪AI的进步和性能。 # 微调和优化 最终，你会进行微调和优化，这可能涉及到调整学习率，试验不同的奖励结构和网络架构，或使用模拟的带预先知识增强训练数据（Curriculum Learning）等。 以下是一个非常简化的强化学习示例，它使用OpenAI Gym的一个标准游戏环境和一个简单的Q-Learning算法进行训练： \`\`\`python import gym import numpy as np # Create the game environment env = gym.make('CartPole-v1') # You can replace this with other games # Initialize Q-table with all zeros Q_table = np.zeros([env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n]) # Set learning and discount parameters learning_rate = 0.1 discount_factor = 0.95 exploration_rate = 1.0 max_exploration_rate = 1.0 min_exploration_rate = 0.01 exploration_decay_rate = 0.001 # Train the agent for episode in range(10000): state = env.reset() done = False while not done: # Exploration-exploitation trade-off if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < exploration_rate: action = env.action_space.sample() # Explore action space else: action = np.argmax(Q_table[state]) # Exploit learned values # Take the action and observe the outcome state and reward new_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action) # Q-learning algorithm Q_table[state, action] = Q_table[state, action] * (1 - learning_rate) + learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * np.max(Q_table[new_state])) # Move to the new state state = new_state # Exploration rate decay exploration_rate = min_exploration_rate + (max_exploration_rate - min_exploration_rate) * np.exp(-exploration_decay_rate * episode) # Save the trained Q-table for future use np.save(\\"trained_Q_table.npy\\", Q_table) \`\`\` 请注意，上述代码仅作为一个概念验证，并不是一个高性能的解决方案。对于复杂的游戏，你可能需要使用深度强化学习，比如DQN、DDPG或PPO等，以构建能够处理高维输入和复杂策略的AI。 深度强化学习通常需要强大的计算资源，通常需要使用GPU进行训练。它也需要大量的调优和实验来获得一个可用的解决方案。"},{"prompt":"心率最低只有50正常吗","completion":"心率低于60次/分钟通常被称为心动过缓（Bradycardia），然而，对于某些人群来说，心率50次/分钟可能是正常的。例如，经常进行有氧运动的运动员通常会有较低的安静心率，因为他们的心脏效率更高，每次心跳可以泵送更多的血液。这意味着在休息状态下，他们的心跳次数可能会低于非运动员。 不过，心动过缓也可能是心脏问题或其他医疗条件的迹象，如甲状腺功能减退、电解质失衡或使用某些药物的副作用。特别是如果心率低且伴随有疲劳、头晕、晕厥或胸部不适等症状时，应该寻求医生的帮助。 因此，心率50次/分钟是否正常取决于个体的特定情况和身体状况。如果你对心率有疑问，或者经历了任何不寻常的心脏相关症状，最好咨询医生进行进一步的评估和建议。医生可能会推荐进行心电图（ECG）或其他心脏监测测试，以确保你的低心率不是由潜在的健康问题引起的。"},{"prompt":"贫血需要做哪些运动和吃什么食物","completion":"贫血是一种由于红细胞数量不足或者血红蛋白水平低而不能有效携带足够氧气至身体各部的状态。虽然运动本身并不能直接治疗贫血，但适量的运动可以帮助提高心血管健康和促进血液循环。另一方面，调整饮食则是缓解和治疗贫血的重要方式。 # 运动建议 轻到中等强度的运动通常被认为对于贫血患者是安全且有益的，例如： - **散步**：低强度，适合大多数人。 - **瑜伽**：放松身心并提高柔韧性的同时，可以帮助促进血液循环。 - **游泳**：全身低冲击性运动，适合心血管锻炼，不会给关节带来压力。 - **骑自行车**：温和的心血管锻炼，可以提高体能。 - **有氧健身操**：可以增加心跳率，但建议选择低到中等强度。 重要的是，一定要注意运动时自己的感觉，如果出现头晕、过度疲劳或呼吸困难等症状，应该立即停止并咨询医生。 # 饮食建议 为了缓解和治疗贫血，饮食中应该重点包括富含铁和其他促进铁吸收的营养素的食物： 1. **含铁食物**： - 红肉（如牛肉、羊肉） - 猪肝及其他动物内脏 - 豌豆、豆类和豆制品（如豆腐） - 深绿色蔬菜（如菠菜、西兰花） - 铁质强化的谷物和面包 2. **含维生素C的食物**（可以提高铁的吸收）： - 柑橘类水果（如橙子、柠檬） - 草莓、猕猴桃、草莓 - 圣女果、青椒 - 西兰花、花椰菜 3. **含维生素B12的食物**（维生素B12缺乏也可以引起贫血）： - 动物肝脏和肾脏 - 鸡蛋 - 牛奶和奶制品 - 强化谷物 4. **含叶酸的食物**（叶酸是制造红细胞的重要成份）： - 绿色叶菜蔬菜 - 橙汁 - 麦片 - 面包、意大利面和大米等强化谷物 注意避免饮食中的某些物质可能会阻碍铁的吸收，如大量摄入咖啡、茶（里面含有单宁酸）以及奶产品（含有钙）。 在实施任何饮食或运动计划之前，请咨询医生或营养专家，以确保这些变化适合你的健康状况。如果你的贫血是由于铁缺乏性贫血引起的，上述建议可能会有所帮助。然而，贫血还可能有其他病因，如维生素缺乏、慢性疾病或血液疾病，这些病因可能需要特定的治疗方法。"},{"prompt":"","completion":"您似乎没有输入任何问题或信息。如果您有任何疑问或需要帮助，请随时告诉我！我在这里帮助您。"},{"prompt":"Напиши

The first layer takes the number of node features as input and outputs 16 features. The second layer takes these 16 features and outputs the number of classes for node classification. The \`forward\` method defines how the data flows through the network. We apply the first graph convolutional layer followed by a ReLU activation and dropout for regularization. Then, we apply the second graph convolutional layer and finally return the log softmax of the output for classification. Please note that this is a very basic example.

This makes you a bit of a perfectionist. Obtaining a complete knowledge of something comes about because of your attention to details. Your conservative perspective on life is not like most Aries. Rather it is the result of both reason and experience. There is a special calmness about you. This might be because of the interacting opposites in you; confidence comes from Aries and shyness comes from Virgo. You are not that impulsive and daring and, in general, you tend to be more careful than other Aries people. The main reason for this is because your Virgo nature will restrain you a bit even though you have plenty of energy and are excited about many things in your life. Your fine intellect and great ability to analyze is usually the area of your occupation and that is where your directness and power generally are directed. You are torn between your basic shy personality and the part of you that wants to be daring and flashy. This often results in an irreconcilable conflict in your personality. Again, you are faced with the possibility of disappointment. You can easily have a career as a doctor, lawyer or engineer because of your intelligence, attention to detail and concentration. Admired for their sincerity, Aries-Virgos usually discover true success through their occupation. Your lofty standards are something you try to live up to. Overdoing things in that department should be guarded carefully against. Furthermore, a caution is also in order because you are inclined to be a faultfinder in conjunction with work too. Problems come about when people disagree with your ideas because you think you are always right and the best informed. More tolerance pertaining to other views and lifestyles is needed. Your mind, simply put, needs to be more open. You should not be so judgmental. You might be nervous, agitated and stressed out like a lot of people with a Moon in Virgo alignment. Problems at work will almost surely bring this out. You need to be careful to not take things out on those you love, who can be victims of these moods. The combination can make your Aries side feel let down and frustrated. The problem created here is that you need more self-acceptance and in order to move on.","completion":"As a person with the Sun in Aries and the Moon in Virgo, you possess a unique blend of qualities that make you both innovative and meticulous. Your Aries Sun bestows upon you an energetic spirit and a pioneering approach to life, driving you to tackle challenges with gusto. You brim with enthusiasm and the desire to lead and innovate. Yet, your Virgo Moon tempers this fiery demeanor with a thoughtful and analytical perspective. You are methodical and have a keen eye for detail, striving for perfection in everything you do. You are characterized by an exceptional thirst for knowledge, and complete understanding is often achieved through your scrupulous attention to the minutiae. Your perspective on life encompasses a more conservative, pragmatic view, which is a refreshing deviation from the typical Aries impulsiveness. This careful approach is a reflection of your combined reliance on both empirical experience and rational thought. Within you resides an extraordinary equilibrium; an inner harmony that arises from the synthesis of the confident Aries and the reserved Virgo. As opposed to the archetypal Aries who leaps before they look, you embody a cautious nature, with your Virgoan side urging restraint, despite your abundant energy and passion for numerous aspects of your life. In the professional realm, your sharp intellect and superior analytical capacity shine brightly. The arenas of medicine, law, or engineering are well-suited to your talents—professions where precision and meticulousness are paramount. It is here, in the crucible of your vocation, where your assertiveness and intellectual prowess are most effectively channeled. There exists within you a tension between an innate timidity and a yearning for boldness and flair—a dichotomy that occasionally catalyzes internal strife. To achieve a sense of balance and contentment, it is essential for you to navigate this dichotomy carefully. Your high ideals serve as both a guiding star and a potential pitfall. The pursuit of excellence is admirable, yet you must remain vigilant not to overextend yourself in this quest. Moreover, you must beware of a tendency toward criticalness, particularly in work settings. A steadfast belief in your own correctness can lead to friction, especially when you encounter opposition. Cultivating tolerance and embracing diverse viewpoints and lifestyles would significantly enrich your experiences, opening your mind to the vast tapestry of human thought and behavior. Your Virgo Moon may predispose you to anxiety and stress, especially when work-related challenges arise. It's paramount that you manage stress constructively to avoid inadvertently directing your frustrations at those you hold dear, who, undeservingly, might bear the brunt of your vexations. Such emotional tides can leave your Aries side feeling diminished and thwarted. In conclusion, the path to personal growth and fulfillment lies in fostering greater self-acceptance and mastering the art of moving forward graciously. Embracing both the Aries drive and the Virgo precision harmoniously will assist you in reaching your fullest potential and finding the success and recognition you seek."},{"prompt":"elaborate","completion":"Certainly, let's delve deeper into the Sun in Aries and Moon in Virgo personality. Your Aries Sun provides you with a wellspring of energy and the audacity to venture into new territories—like the proverbial brave warrior of the zodiac, you're unafraid to chart new paths and tackle obstacles with courage. With a pioneering spirit, you yearn to be the harbinger of change and innovation, inspiring others with your bold ideas and actions. You possess a natural leadership quality, commanding respect and following through sheer willpower and zest for life. The fire of Aries within you ensures that you are never content with the status quo, pushing you to constantly seek improvement and progress. Yet, there is another side to your astrological coin—the Moon in Virgo complements your fiery nature with a grounded, pragmatic, and detail-oriented approach. The Virgo influence instills in you a meticulousness that serves as a tool for thoroughness rather than just nitpicking. This attentiveness to detail propels you to delve deep into subjects, allowing you to master skills and knowledge in ways that others may overlook. It also imbues you with a unique ability to organize, synthesize, and make practical use of the information you gather, which can be a tremendous asset in any professional or personal endeavor. In this light, your conservative approach is not born of fear or hesitation, but rather an intelligent synthesis of what works and what has lasting value. Your life decisions are well pondered and seldom impetuous, which can sometimes set you apart from your Aries contemporaries who favor bold, rapid-fire decisions. The Virgo Moon’s influence is also evident in your work ethic. You are likely the person who stays late to ensure a project is not just completed, but completed to the highest standard. However, this can sometimes lead to a hypercritical viewpoint, particularly towards yourself. This inner voice of critique, while beneficial in maintaining quality, must be tempered with compassion and understanding of human imperfection, including your own. Your vocational journey is characterized by a relentless pursuit of excellence. Individuals with your astrological makeup are ideally positioned for careers that demand a combination of dynamic action and precision, such as surgical professions, strategic planning, or even meticulous crafts where your keen eye for detail can be expressed through intricate design. The duality you navigate—between the boldness of Aries and the restraint of Virgo—is a lifelong dance. You shine brightly when you strike a balance, harnessing the impulse of Aries to take reasonable risks and the Virgoan preference for calculated, well-informed actions. This internal oscillation can sometimes lead to a sense of frustration or dissatisfaction, especially if you feel you have compromised too much of one side for the other. To mediate the anxiety and stress that can arise from your critical Virgo Moon, establishing routines and practices that foster peace and wellness are advantageous. Mindfulness, exercise, and even meditation can be soothing balms to your occasionally overactive mind, helping you maintain an emotional equilibrium and ensuring that your relationships remain harmoniously unaffected by professional stresses. In social dynamics, your propensity for critique must be wielded judiciously. Embracing an open-hearted perspective that values and respects the viewpoints of others will enrich your interactions and expand your worldview. By practicing empathy and releasing the need to always be correct, you'll foster deeper connections and derive greater joy from your interactions. The synthesis of your Aries initiative and Virgo meticulousness is where your true brilliance lies. By embracing your duality, you gain the ability to propel forward with passion while anchoring your journey in practicality and purpose. As you become more tolerant and open-minded, and as you learn to temper self-criticism with self-compassion, the road ahead promises not only success in your endeavors but also a profound inner harmony."},{"prompt":"elaborate","completion":"Your personality, shaped by the Sun in Aries and the Moon in Virgo, is a rich tapestry of dynamic energy and analytical precision. The Aries Sun endows you with an innate sense of initiation and bravery. Much like the mythological heroes of Aries, you carry the torch of leadership and action, infusing every project you undertake with enthusiasm and a can-do spirit. You are naturally inclined towards setting trends rather than following them, possessing an entrepreneurial streak that encourages you to take risks confidently. Your intrinsic motivation is to leave a mark on the world, to be the first, the pioneer, the one who dares to venture where others might hesitate. However, your Moon in Virgo introduces a contrasting set of attributes that shape your inner world and emotional responses. The practicality of Virgo tempers the fiery impulsiveness of Aries. It's as if you have an internal editor meticulously reviewing each of Aries' spontaneous impulses, offering a moment of pause for assessment and strategy. This internal dialogue creates a person who is both eager to engage with new experiences and mindful of the need to approach these experiences with caution and precision. In terms of your work and vocation, these dual energies manifest in an individual who is driven not just by the pursuit of exciting opportunities but also by the need to execute and deliver with accuracy and skill. Your professional life is marked by a strong desire to be competent and useful; you derive great satisfaction from a job well done. You are equipped to excel in fields that require both visionary thinking and meticulous implementation, such as architecture, where the grandeur of design meets the precision of engineering, or in project management, where one must direct with confidence while keeping track of countless details.

The Virgo Moon, conversely, seeks a sense of order and usefulness, contentment in service, and pride in workmanship. This can create a complex relationship with success, wherein you might constantly oscillate between seeking the limelight and withdrawing to the quiet satisfaction of a task well-executed without fanfare. When it comes to interpersonal dynamics, you possess a sharp intellect and the ability to communicate your ideas effectively. However, the Virgo Moon can also cause you to critique both yourself and others more harshly than necessary. This can sometimes lead to misunderstandings unless you cultivate patience and empathy. Recognizing that perfection is not always attainable or even desirable can help you build and maintain more compassionate and forgiving relationships, both personally and professionally. Your emotional landscape is fraught with the desire for orderliness and the natural Aries impulse to embrace chaos and spontaneity. Your Virgoan inclination toward nervous energy can manifest as restlessness or worry, especially when you find yourself or your environment in disarray. Establishing regular health and wellness practices can be incredibly beneficial in managing stress and keeping your tendency toward perfectionism in check. The divergent aspects of your Sun and Moon sign indeed pose challenges. The central struggle lies in reconciling the part of you that wants to charge ahead with the part that insists on inspecting each blade of grass before taking a step. There is an ongoing negotiation between acting and reflecting, between the entrepreneurial spirit and the analytical mind. For you, self-development involves embracing the bold, assertive qualities of your Aries Sun while honoring the thoughtful, meticulous qualities of your Virgo Moon. It is not about suppressing one in favor of the other but about finding a harmonizing rhythm between them. By bringing the confidence of Aries into collaboration with the conscientiousness of Virgo, you can create a well-balanced approach to life that is both courageous and cautious, spontaneous, and systematic, leading to a fulfilling experience of personal growth and achievement."},{"prompt":"write it longer","completion":"Indeed, further exploring the blending of the Sun in Aries' fire with the Moon in Virgo's earth provides an opportunity to appreciate the nuances of this particular astrological placement.

Aries represents the raw energy of life itself, the sheer willpower to emerge victorious against any adversity. Your Aries Sun lends you an air of confidence and a proclivity for directness in your actions and communications. There is an intrinsic honesty about you—an earnestness and a desire to interact with the world in a forthright manner. This can be refreshing to those tired of subtlety and evasion. Your persona is marked by an innate sense of self-assuredness and a zest for life, a fearless appetite for adventure, and an instinctive response to act decisively. But the luminescence of your Aries Sun is tempered by the more grounded, introspective Moon in Virgo. The Moon's placement in your chart reveals the landscape of your inner life, your emotional reservoir, and instinctual reactions. Virgo, methodical and efficient, is ruled by Mercury and is associated with mental processes, especially those that sort, purify, and refine. Your Virgo Moon infuses your intuitive nature with the propensity for analysis and discernment. You feel most at ease when life is in order, when chaos is categorized, and when your daily routines follow a predictable and productive pattern. As an individual with this astrological combination, your emotional satisfaction is often tied to your ability to improve, optimize, and perfect both yourself and your environment. You gravitate toward tasks that require thoroughness and a critical eye. Whether it's your work, your personal projects, or even your living space, everything must pass through the fine sieve of Virgoan scrutiny. However, this attention to detail can sometimes become a source of inner turmoil, particularly when your high standards brush up against the inherent messiness of life.

In relationships, your Aries Sun is fiercely loyal, passionate, and eager to take the lead. Partners and friends may be drawn to your charisma and your ability to inspire. Yet, when the Moon in Virgo takes the reins, there is a shift toward prudence and a focus on service. You likely show your care and affection through acts that create order and well-being for your loved ones, like organizing their space or offering practical advice. Professionally, individuals like you often excel in careers that allow both the dynamic energy of Aries and the analytical capabilities of Virgo to shine. You have the push to start new initiatives and the finesse to see them through to completion with precision. Roles that involve a mix of leadership and complex problem-solving can be particularly fulfilling, as they tap into both archetypal energies within you, such as a director of operations in a fast-paced company or a surgeon performing intricate procedures. The quest for personal development and achievement is punctuated by the interplay of impulsiveness and conscientiousness. The key to your evolution is learning to navigate the push-and-pull of these energies in a way that does not overwhelm—finding the right moment to allow the Aries fervor to dominate and when to let the Virgoan meticulousness guide you. Embracing this internal dynamic can be complicated, as each side vies for dominance in various situations. But, through mindfulness and self-reflection, you have the capacity to harness and direct these energies judiciously. Finally, the composite picture painted by your Aries Sun and Virgo Moon is one of a person who embodies the zeal of an impassioned trailblazer, matched with the practical consideration of an astute observer. With time and introspection, you can cultivate a masterful dance between these two aspects of your nature, leveraging the strengths of both the fiery Aries and the discerning Virgo. By doing so, you stand to achieve a sense of personal balance that enables you to pursue your passions with gusto while ensuring the outcomes align with your high standards—a journey of integration where the fire meets the earth, with each element tempering and enhancing the other."},{"prompt":"write a title for this person","completion":"The Strategic Pioneer: Harnessing the Fire of Aries with the Methodical Mind of Virgo"},{"prompt":"write 10 more","completion":"1.

This happen to a recent company like change healthcare","completion":"An IT department or a cybersecurity company can take several steps to save a company's information and mitigate the effects of a cyberattack like the one described involving BlackCat. 1. Incident Response Plan: The first step is to have a well-defined incident response plan in place. This plan should outline the steps to be taken in case of a cyberattack, including who will be involved in the response and what their roles and responsibilities are. 2. Isolate and Contain: The IT team should isolate the affected systems from the network to prevent the spread of malware. This may involve shutting down certain systems or segments of the network. 3. Forensic Analysis: Forensic analysis should be conducted to determine the extent of the breach, how the attackers gained access, and what data may have been compromised. This information is crucial for future prevention and response efforts. 4. Patching and Remediation: Any vulnerabilities or entry points that were exploited by the attackers should be patched and secured to prevent future attacks. This may involve updating software, changing passwords, or implementing additional security measures. 5. Data Recovery: If data was encrypted or stolen during the attack, the IT team should work to recover and restore as much data as possible from backups. This process can be time-consuming but is essential for business continuity. 6. Communication and Notification: It is important to communicate with employees, customers, and other stakeholders about the cyberattack. Transparency about the incident and steps being taken to mitigate the effects can help to maintain trust and credibility. 7. Monitoring and Prevention: After the attack, the IT team should continue to monitor the network for any signs of further intrusion or suspicious activity. Regular security assessments and updates should also be conducted to strengthen defenses against future attacks. In the case of Change Healthcare or any other company that has experienced a cyber attack, it is important to follow these steps to minimize damage and prevent similar incidents in the future. Additionally, investing in robust cybersecurity measures, employee training, and incident response capabilities can help to protect the company's information and systems from cyber threats."},{"prompt":"please explain how to do forensic analysis","completion":"Forensic analysis is a crucial step in investigating a cyber attack and determining the scope and impact of the breach. Here are the general steps typically involved in conducting a forensic analysis: 1. Identification of Evidence: The first step in forensic analysis is to identify and preserve digital evidence related to the cyber attack. This includes capturing volatile data (data that is only available in memory) as well as non-volatile data (data stored on hard drives or other storage devices). 2. Collection of Evidence: Once the evidence has been identified, it needs to be collected in a forensically sound manner to ensure its integrity and admissibility in court, if needed. This may involve creating forensic copies of storage devices or capturing network traffic. 3. Analysis of Evidence: The collected evidence is then analyzed to determine the source of the breach, how the attackers gained access, and what actions they took within the network. This may involve examining log files, system configurations, and other data sources for evidence of malware, unauthorized access, or data exfiltration. 4. Recovery of Deleted Data: Forensic analysts may also attempt to recover deleted or hidden data that could provide valuable insights into the attack. This can be done using specialized tools and techniques for data recovery. 5. Timeline Reconstruction: Forensic analysts create a timeline of events related to the attack to understand how and when the breach occurred, what actions were taken by the attackers, and how they moved laterally within the network. 6. Reporting and Documentation: The findings of the forensic analysis are documented in a detailed report, which may include a summary of the findings, analysis of the attack methodology, and recommendations for improving security and preventing future incidents. 7. Chain of Custody: Throughout the forensic analysis process, it is important to maintain a chain of custody for all evidence collected. This involves documenting who had access to the evidence, when it was accessed, and any changes made to it to ensure its integrity and reliability. Forensic analysis requires specialized tools, expertise, and adherence to legal and ethical guidelines. Organizations may choose to conduct forensic analysis internally if they have the necessary resources and expertise, or they may engage third-party forensic experts to assist with the investigation."},{"prompt":"Translate Hisztizel to English","completion":"The word \\"Hisztizel\\" does not appear to be a recognized word in any major language and it's also not a straightforward term in Hungarian or any other language that I'm familiar with.

B. L., A MINOR, BY AND THROUGH HER 1 FATHER, LEVY, ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT 2 No. 20–255. Argued April 28, 2021 — Decided June 23, 2021 [1] Mahanoy Area High School student B. L. failed to make the school’s varsity cheerleading squad. While visiting a local convenience store over the weekend, B. L. posted two images on Snapchat, a social media application for smartphones that allows users to share temporary images with selected friends. B. L.’s posts expressed frustration with the school and the school’s cheerleading squad, and one contained vulgar language and gestures. When school officials learned of the posts, they suspended B. L. from the junior varsity cheerleading squad for the upcoming year. After unsuccessfully seeking to reverse that punishment, B. L. and her parents sought relief in federal court, arguing inter alia that punishing B. L. 3 for her speech violated the First Amendment. The District Court granted an injunction ordering the school to reinstate B. L. to the cheerleading team. Relying 4 on Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, to grant B. L.’s subsequent motion for summary judgment, the District Court found 5 5 Subsequent (adjective): coming after in time; following 4 A court order requiring a person to either do or stop doing a certain action. 3 Latin for “among other things.” 2 A writ of certiorari is an order from a superior court — in this case, the United States Supreme Court — to a lower court — here the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. This order commands the lower court to send its records for a certain case so that the superior court can review them and either affirm or overrule what the lower court decided. 1 Because the complainant in this case was under 18 at the time the lawsuit was filed, the Court refers to her by her initials instead of her full name. Unit 6: Free Speech and Social Media that B. L.’s punishment violated the First Amendment because her Snapchat posts had not caused substantial disruption at the school. The Third Circuit affirmed the judgment, but the panel majority reasoned that Tinker did not apply because schools had no special license to regulate student speech occurring off campus. [2] Held: While public schools may have a special interest in regulating some off-campus student speech, the special interests offered by the school are not sufficient to overcome B. L.’s interest in free expression in this case. [3] (a) In Tinker, we indicated that schools have a special interest in regulating on-campus student speech that “materially disrupts class-work or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.” The special characteristics that give schools additional license to regulate student speech do not always disappear when that speech takes place off campus. Circumstances that may implicate a school’s regulatory interests include serious or severe bullying or harassment targeting particular individuals; threats aimed at teachers or other students; the failure to follow rules concerning lessons, the writing of papers, the use of computers, or participation in other online school activities; and breaches 6 of school security devices. [4] (b) But three features of off-campus speech often, even if not always, distinguish schools’ efforts to regulate off-campus speech. First, a school will rarely stand in loco parentis when a student speaks off campus. Second, from the 7 student speaker’s perspective, regulations of off campus speech, when coupled with regulations of on-campus speech, include all the speech a student utters during the full 24-hour day. That means courts must be more skeptical of a 8 school’s efforts to regulate off-campus speech, for doing so may mean the student cannot engage in that kind of speech at all. Third, the school itself has an interest in protecting a student’s unpopular expression, especially when the expression takes place off campus, because America’s public schools are the nurseries of democracy. Taken together, these three features of much off-campus speech mean that the leeway the First Amendment grants to schools in light of their special characteristics is diminished. [5] (c) The school violated B. L.’s First Amendment rights when it suspended her from the junior varsity cheerleading squad. (1) B. L.’s posts are entitled to First Amendment protection. The statements made in B. L.’s Snapchats reflect criticism of the rules of a community of which B. L. forms a part. And B. L.’s message did not involve features that would place it outside the First Amendment’s ordinary protection. (2) The circumstances of B. L.’s speech diminish the school’s interest in regulation. B. L.’s posts appeared outside of school hours from a location outside the school. She did not identify the school in her posts or target any member of the school community with vulgar or abusive language. B. L. also transmitted her speech through a personal cell phone, to an audience consisting of her private circle of Snapchat friends. (3) The school’s interest in teaching good manners and consequently in punishing the use of vulgar language aimed at part of the school community is weakened considerably by the fact that B. L. spoke outside the school on her own time. B. L. spoke under circumstances where the school did not stand in loco parentis. And the vulgarity in B. L.’s posts encompassed a message of criticism. In addition, the school has Paragraph 1 A. Write: On what did the District Court and the Third Circuit agree? B. Write: How was the Third Circuit’s reasoning different from that of the District Court? Paragraph 2 Write: Paraphrase the Supreme Court’s decision in this case. Paragraph 3 Turn & Talk: Do you agree with the Court’s examples of cases in which a school should be allowed to regulate off-campus speech? Why or why not? Paragraph 4 A. Write: According to the Court, how could allowing schools to regulate both on- and off-campus speech affect students’ right to freedom of speech? B. Write: What message does the Court convey by using the word \\"nurseries\\" in this clause: “America’s public schools are the nurseries of democracy”? 8 Skeptical (adjective): doubting that something is true or useful 7 in the place of a parent 6 Breach (noun): a hole or gap made in a defensive wall by attacking forces; can also be used to refer to a “hole” made in cyberdefenses Unit 6: Free Speech and Social Media 1 Unless otherwise noted, this content is licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. presented no evidence of any general effort to prevent students from using vulgarity outside the classroom. (4) The school’s interest in preventing disruption is not supported by the record, which shows that discussion of the matter took, at most, 5 to 10 minutes of an Algebra class “for just a couple of days” and that some members of the cheerleading team were “upset” about the content of B. L.’s Snapchats. This alone does not satisfy Tinker’s demanding standards. (5) Likewise, there is little to suggest a substantial interference in, or disruption of, the school’s efforts to maintain cohesion on the school 9 cheerleading squad.\\"","completion":"[4] (b) \\"That means courts must be more skeptical of a school’s efforts to regulate off-campus speech, for doing so may mean the student cannot engage in that kind of speech at all.\\" This quote supports the idea that schools should not discipline students for social media posts as it acknowledges the importance of protecting a student’s freedom of expression, especially when such expressions occur off-campus which might otherwise be completely suppressed by school regulation. [5] \\"(1) B. L.’s posts are entitled to First Amendment protection.\\" This part of the decision reinforces the concept that students' social media posts, particularly those made off-campus on personal time, are protected under the First Amendment, suggesting that schools do not have the authority to punish such expressions."},{"prompt":"explain [4] for me","completion":"Paragraph [4] from the Mahanoy Area School District v. B. L. decision addresses the distinctive characteristics of off-campus speech and explains how they typically differ from on-campus speech in ways that affect a school's ability to regulate it. The paragraph elaborates on three features to consider when evaluating a school's authority over off-campus speech: 1. In loco parentis: When a student is off-campus, the school does not usually stand in the role of in loco parentis, which is a legal doctrine where schools assume some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent during school hours. This diminished role reduces the school's authority to control what students say and do outside of school. 2. 24-Hour Regulation: When schools try to regulate both on-campus and off-campus speech, it effectively means they are extending their reach over everything a student says 24 hours a day. The court suggests that this kind of ubiquitous regulation is overreaching and thus must be approached with skepticism because it can unduly restrain a student's right to free speech. 3. Schools as Nurseries of Democracy: The court points out that public schools play a critical role in fostering democracy, as they are places where young people learn about their rights and responsibilities as citizens. Included in this educational mission is protecting students' rights to express unpopular or dissenting opinions, particularly when this speech occurs off campus. This aspect reinforces the importance of safeguarding free speech as part of the educational process. Taken together, these points imply that the First Amendment restricts a school's ability to regulate off-campus speech more so than for on-campus speech. The Supreme Court emphasizes that off-campus speech, including social media posts made on personal time and devices, has unique considerations that often reduce the school's authority to intervene."},{"prompt":"explain this with two sentences \\"“That means courts must be more skeptical of a school’s efforts to regulate off-campus speech, for doing so may mean the student cannot engage in that kind of speech at all.”\\"","completion":"This sentence from the Supreme Court decision indicates that there should be a heightened level of judicial scrutiny when schools attempt to control students' speech outside of school grounds.

\`SELECT\` 是根节点，表示这是一个选择查询。 - \`COUNT(order_id)\` 是一个函数节点，代表一个聚合函数，用于计数。 - \`AS\` 表示一个别名操作，将聚合结果命名为\`total_matching_orders\`。 - \`FROM\` 指示所查询的数据表名。 - \`WHERE\` 表示查询的条件： - \`AND\` 表示这些条件必须同时满足。 - 下面的每个 \`AND\` 节点整合了不同的条件判断：车辆类型为“货运小车”，配对状态为“已配对”，日期在2022年1月1日到2022年12月31日之间，地区为“全国”。 请注意，以上的语法树是一个简化版本，用语法树表示完整的SQL查询语句会更复杂。实际的SQL解析树会包含更详细的节点，例如操作符节点（比如\`=\`和\`BETWEEN\`），以及更多的中间节点。此外，在像PostgreSQL这样的数据库中，可以使用查询计划工具如\`EXPLAIN\`来查看查询是如何被解析和执行的。"},{"prompt":"请分析查询语句”2022财年货运小车全国的累计配对订单量是多少？“的查询语法树是什么","completion":"构建一个查询语句的语法树通常需要一个解析器，解析器会将查询分解成各个组成部分。对于自然语言查询语句“2022财年货运小车全国的累计配对订单量是多少？”，我们不会有一个实际的SQL语句或数据库结构来对其执行解析，但我们可以理论性地构想一个语法树来表示这个问题的结构。 简化的语法树可能如下所示： \`\`\` [QUERY] | +--------+--------------+--------+ [YEAR] [VEHICLE] [SCOPE] [METRIC] | | | | [2022] [货运小车] [全国] [累计配对订单量] \`\`\` 在这个简化的语法树中： - 根节点是 \`[QUERY]\`，代表这是一个查询请求。 - \`[YEAR]\` 节点表示查询的时间范围，节点内容是 \`[2022]\`，代表财年2022。 - \`[VEHICLE]\` 节点指定了我们查询的车辆类型，内容是 \`[货运小车]\`。 - \`[SCOPE]\` 节点定义了查询的地理范围，为 \`[全国]\`。 - \`[METRIC]\` 节点表示我们关心的具体指标，即 \`[累计配对订单量]\`。 请注意，这是一个简化的自然语言问题的语法树，实际的SQL解析树将基于实际的SQL查询语句和数据库结构建立。针对数据库的语法树通常会涉及到具体的数据库操作，例如 \`SELECT\`, \`FROM\`, \`WHERE\` 以及可能的 \`JOIN\`, \`GROUP BY\` 等操作。而且，财年的具体日期范围需要根据各公司的财务报告周期来定义，可能会从上一年的某个月份开始，到本年的对应月份结束。"},{"prompt":"请分析查询语句”2022财年货运小车全国的累计配对订单量是多少？“的语法树是什么，请用直观方式表达。","completion":"由于您提供的查询语句是一句自然语言描述的数据查询请求，并不对应直接的SQL语句，因此我会尝试以一种更直观的方式来构想它的语法树，这里我们将每个关键概念看作是查询语法树的一个节点。 下面是对该查询语句可能的直观语法树的描述： \`\`\` [QUERY] | +------------------------------------------+ / | / | [TIME FRAME] [SUBJECT] [METRIC] | | | [2022财年] [货运小车] [累计配对订单量] | [GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE] | [全国] \`\`\` 在这个直观的语法树中： - 根节点 \`[QUERY]\` 表示这是一个查询请求。 - \`[TIME FRAME]\` 节点表示时间范围，内容是 \`[2022财年]\`。它说明查询聚焦在2022财年这一特定期间。 - \`[SUBJECT]\` 节点指定了查询的主题，内容是 \`[货运小车]\`。这说明我们关注的是货运小车。 - \`[GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE]\` 节点是 \`[SUBJECT]\` 的子节点，确定了地理范围，即 \`[全国]\`。 - \`[METRIC]\` 节点表示我们要查询的数据指标，即 \`[累计配对订单量]\`。这是我们希望查询结果给出的数值。 这棵树表示了查询各个部分的层次及彼此间的关系。在一个数据库环境中，实际的SQL查询语句会基于表结构和具体的字段。而在自然语言处理或一个智能查询系统中，上述语法树用于理解查询的意图，随后可能会转换为一条或者多条SQL查询语句来实际获取数据。"},{"prompt":"Can you roleplay with me 18+?","completion":"I'm sorry, but I am not able to engage in any form of adult or 18+ roleplay.

However, I can provide some insights into how my abilities might compare: 1. **Google Translate** is a service specifically designed and optimized for translation between a significant number of languages. It operates using advanced machine learning algorithms and has a vast database of translated texts to reference. Google Translate is continually being improved and can handle a wide variety of phrases and idioms with a degree of fluency. 2. **OpenAI's language model (GPT-3, which I am based on)** is not primarily focused on translation but it has been trained on a diverse set of languages and can perform translations between various language pairs. Its performance can vary depending on the language pair and the complexity of the text. Simple phrases and sentences in common languages are more likely to result in accurate translations, while translations of less common languages or more complex or nuanced text may not be as accurate as specialized services. Here are some key points of comparison: - **Scope**: Google Translate supports translation between a very large number of languages, while my capabilities may vary more between language pairs, especially for less commonly used languages. - **Contextual Understanding**: I can understand and generate language based on context, which can be helpful in translating nuanced phrases, but I might not match the fluency and idiomatic correctness of Google Translate in all cases. - **Idiomatic Expressions**: Both systems aim to handle idiomatic expressions, but the extent to which they can do so accurately depends on the specific expressions and the context in which they're used. - **Real-time Translation**: Google Translate is optimized for real-time translation, whereas I'm designed more for conversational interaction and may not be as efficient for rapidly translating large volumes of text. Overall, while I can provide translations, especially within the context of a conversation or for specific queries, for professional or critical translations, dedicated translation services like Google Translate might be more reliable and comprehensive."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Как мне лучше всего это сделать чтобы видео убыстрилось, но картинка осталась плавной?","completion":"Чтобы ускорить видео в After Effects и при этом сохранить плавность картинки, следуйте этим шагам: 1. Импортируйте ваше видео в проект After Effects. 2. Создайте новую композицию, перетащив видеоклип на иконку \\"Создать новую композицию\\" (Create a new composition). Для ускорения видео: **Использование эффекта Time Stretch:** 1. Выберите слой с видео в таймлайне. 2. Правый клик по слою → Time → Time Stretch… 3. В появившемся диалоговом окне вы увидите параметр Stretch Factor, который по умолчанию установлен в 100%. Чтобы ускорить видео, установите значение меньше 100. Например, значение 50% ускорит видео в два раза. **Использование эффекта Time Remapping:** 1. Убедитесь, что слой видео выбран в таймлайне. 2. Перейдите в меню: Layer (Слой) → Time → Enable Time Remapping (Включить переназначение времени). 3. Теперь у вас появятся ключевые кадры для настройки скорости воспроизведения вашего видео. Чтобы ускорить видео, переместите последний ключевой кадр ближе к первому. 4. Удалите или измените интерполяцию между ключевыми кадрами, если это необходимо, чтобы получить желаемый результат ускорения. **Использование Timewarp (варпа времени):** 1. На видеослое примените эффект Timewarp: Effects → Time → Timewarp. 2. Установите Speed (Скорость) больше 100, чтобы ускорить видео. Например, значение 200 удвоит скорость воспроизведения. **Плавность движения при ускорении видео:** Чтобы избежать дергания кадров при ускорении, вы можете применить эффект Frame Blending (Перемешивание кадров): 1. Включите Frame Blending для слоя видео, кликнув на иконку кадрового смешивания в таймлайне (выглядит как две перекрывающиеся рамки). 2. Включите Frame Blending для всей композиции, кликнув на иконку переключателя Frame Blending на панели времени (рядом с иконками motion blur и 3D слоя). Если видео по-прежнему выглядит не очень плавно, попробуйте использовать сторонние плагины для After Effects, такие как Twixtor, которые предназначены для более гладкой интерполяции кадров при изменении скорости воспроизведения видео. Не забудьте проверить, что частота кадров в композиции соответствует исходному видео и цели проекта. В некоторых случаях может потребоваться увеличение частоты кадров композиции для более плавного воспроизведения ускоренного видео."},{"prompt":"какой способ лучше?","completion":"Каждый из описанных методов имеет свои преимущества и может быть \\"лучшим\\" в зависимости от конкретной задачи и исходного материала. Эффект Time Stretch является самым простым и быстрым способом для ускорения или замедления видео, но он может не подойти для значительных изменений скорости, так как качество изображения может стать недостаточно плавным. Time Remapping дает больше контроля над скоростью воспроизведения и позволяет менять скорость в разных частях видео. Эта техника хороша, если вам нужны более сложные изменения скорости в разных моментах клипа. Timewarp позволяет настроить скоростные изменения с большей точностью, а также предлагает опции сглаживания, такие как Pixel Motion и Whole Frame, что позволяет движению быть более плавным при значительном изменении скорости. Frame Blending можно использовать с любым из этих методов для создания более плавного перехода между кадрами при изменении скорости, что устраняет рывки и делает движение более естественным. В то время как сторонние плагины, такие как Twixtor, могут предоставить еще больше контроля и качества при значительном изменении времени, благодаря передовым алгоритмам интерполяции кадров. В итоге, лучший метод зависит от следующих факторов: - Как значительное ускорение вам нужно. - Насколько важна плавность движения в ускоренном видео. - Сколько времени и ресурсов вы готовы потратить на достижение желаемого результата. Для простых задач быстрого ускорения, Time Stretch или Time Remapping с Frame Blending часто подходят. Для более сложных проектов, где требуется высококачественное и плавное воспроизведение при ускорении, лучше использовать Timewarp или сторонние плагины."},{"prompt":"я решил использовать Timewarp но у меня проблема - трясется фон","completion":"Если вы используете эффект Timewarp для ускорения видео в After Effects и заметили, что фон трясется, это может быть связано с тем, что параметры эффекта Timewarp не полностью оптимизированы под ваше видео. Попробуйте следующие шаги, чтобы исправить тряску фона: 1. **Перенастройка параметров Timewarp:** - В параметрах эффекта Timewarp обратите внимание на раздел Motion Blur (Размытие движения). Попробуйте изменить параметр \`Shutter Angle\` (Угол затвора), чтобы уменьшить или увеличить размытие движения. Настройка \`Shutter Samples\` (Образцы затвора) также влияет на качество и может сделать движение более плавным при больших значениях. - Проверьте, включен ли \`Motion Blur\`(Размытие движения) и корректно ли он настроен, так как он помогает сглаживать движения и иногда может сократить видимость тряски. 2. **Попробуйте Pixel Motion:** - В параметрах эффекта Timewarp, в разделе Method (Метод), выберите \`Pixel Motion\` вместо \`Whole Frame\`, что позволит лучше анализировать движение в кадре и сократить тряску. 3. **Улучшение стабилизации:** - Если фон трясется из-за нестабильной камеры, можно попробовать применить эффект стабилизации изображения, например Warp Stabilizer, до использования Timewarp. Это может помочь устранить нежелательное движение камеры. 4. **Работа c векторами скорости:** - Проверьте и отрегулируйте векторы скорости, которые Timewarp использует для создания межкадровой интерполяции. Не всегда эффект автоматически правильно определяет векторы движения, что может вызвать тряску. Возможно, потребуется в ручную корректировать их для более сглаженного эффекта. 5. **Проверка кадров:** - Тщательно просмотрите кадры, между которыми возникает тряска, чтобы увидеть, не связана ли она с конкретной проблемой, такой как внезапное движение или скачок камеры. Возможно потребуется внести коррективы в определенные моменты видео. 6. **Финальный контроль:** - Убедитесь, что ваши настройки таймлайна и композиции соответствуют частоте кадров и разрешению исходного видео. Несоответствие параметров может привести к подобным проблемам с тряской. Адаптируйте и тестируйте эти параметры в соответствии с вашим конкретным видео. В некоторых случаях потребуется комбинация нескольких подходов для достижения оптимального результата. Если ничего из вышеперечисленного не помогает, возможно, стоит поискать альтернативные методы, включая использование сторонних плагинов."},{"prompt":"я использую Pixel Motion и если ставлю скорость 200 то все ок, но при скорости 150 дрожит фон","completion":"Тряска фона при использовании Pixel Motion в Timewarp при определённой скорости может быть связана с тем, что алгоритм интерполяции движения может иметь трудности с определением правильного движения при более сложной сцене или движении. Вот несколько шагов, которые вы можете предпринять, чтобы уменьшить тряску фона: 1. **Измените показатель скорости Timewarp:** В ситуации, когда задача заключается в увеличении скорости воспроизведения на определённый процент, отличный от кратного ста, можно попытаться слегка скорректировать значение скорости (например, используйте 149% или 151% вместо 150%), чтобы посмотреть, улучшится ли результат. 2. **Настройки эффекта Timewarp:** - Установите параметр \`Vector Detail\` (детализация вектора) на более высокое значение. Это увеличит тщательность, с которой алгоритм оценивает движение. - Попробуйте уменьшить \`Shutter Angle\` (Угол затвора) для уменьшения размытия движения и потенциально уменьшить видимость тряски. 3. **Преобразование кадровой частоты:** Так как вы столкнулись с проблемой тряски при определённой скорости, возможно, проблема связана с тем, как кадры соединяются между собой. Преобразование кадровой частоты исходного материала при помощи эффекта Interpret Footage может помочь. Вы можете попробовать подогнать кадровую частоту, чтобы она лучше сочеталась с выбранной скоростью воспроизведения в Timewarp. 4. **Предпросмотр на полную частоту кадров:** Убедитесь, что при предпросмотре вы устанавливаете полную частоту кадров (Full Frame Rate), чтобы точно оценить, происходит ли тряска или нет. 5. **Ручная коррекция:** Если алгоритм Pixel Motion не может адекватно интерполировать движение, может потребоваться ручная коррекция векторов движения в эффекте Timewarp. 6. **Стабилизация изображения:** Как уже было упомянуто ранее, попробуйте использовать стабилизацию изображения (Warp Stabilizer или другие инструменты) перед применением Timewarp для устранения нежелательного движения камеры. 7. **Разделение слоёв:** В случае если проблема тряски возникает только в определённой области кадра или фона, можно попробовать разделить видео на слои (с помощью маскирования или ротоскопинга) и применить Timewarp отдельно к переднему плану и фону, обрабатывая их индивидуально. Если вы продолжаете сталкиваться с проблемами даже после испробования всех этих методов, возможно, стоит рассмотреть использование другого инструмента или подхода, в том числе сторонних плагинов, таких как Twixtor, которые предлагают расширенные возможности для управления временем и могут обеспечить лучший результат при сложных условиях."},{"prompt":"论文题目为 国产3C产品营销策略：以华为为例 请帮我写一篇executive summary","completion":"Executive Summary Title: Marketing Strategies for Domestic 3C Products: A Case Study of Huawei.

Func1(n) 1 s ← 0; 2 for i ← 3n to 〖3n〗^2 do 3 for j ←2i to 2i^2 do 4 s ← s + i - j; 5 end 6 end 7 return (s);","completion":"To determine the running time of \`Func1(n)\`, we'll analyze the nested loops in the algorithm. The outer loop: \`\`\` for i ← 3n to 〖3n〗^2 do \`\`\` This loop starts with \`i = 3n\` and runs until \`i = (3n)^2\`. The increment is 1 for each iteration, so it will run for a total of \`((3n)^2 - 3n + 1)\` iterations. The inner loop: \`\`\` for j ← 2i to 2i^2 do \`\`\` For each value of \`i\`, the inner loop starts with \`j = 2i\` and runs until \`j = 2i^2\`. Similar to the outer loop, the increment here is also 1 for each iteration. Therefore, for each value of \`i\`, the inner loop will run for \`2i^2 - 2i + 1\` iterations. To find the total running time of the algorithm, we need to sum up the number of iterations for each possible \`i\`. Let's express the overall running time as a sum: \`\`\` Total number of iterations = Σ (from i = 3n to (3n)^2) [2i^2 - 2i + 1] \`\`\` This formula gives us the sum of the running times for each individual iteration of \`i\`, which will be a 5th-degree polynomial since the inner sum contains i squared. Calculating this polynomial exactly can be complex, but we're typically more interested in the asymptotic behavior (Big O notation) rather than the exact number of iterations. The dominant term in the polynomial will be when \`i\` is at its maximum value, which happens to be \`(3n)^2\`. When \`i\` is at its maximum, the \`2i^2\` term dominates the inner sum. Thus, each iteration of the inner loop will contribute a term proportional to \`(3n)^4\` when we're at the tail end of the outer loop range. When considering Big O notation, we only focus on the largest term since it dominates the running time when \`n\` grows large. We can thus approximate our sum as: \`\`\` Total running time ∝ ((3n)^2 - 3n + 1) * (3n)^4 Total running time ∝ (9n^2) * (81n^4) Total running time ∝ 729n^6 \`\`\` So we can say that the running time of \`Func1(n)\` is O(n^6). It's polynomial time with a degree depending on the squared terms in the loops, but we express it in Big O notation as the highest power of \`n\` that appears in the formula."},{"prompt":"论文题目为 国产3C产品营销策略：以华为为例 请用中文帮我写一篇executive summary","completion":"《国产3C产品营销策略：以华为为例》执行摘要 本研究旨在探讨国产3C（计算机，通信和消费电子产品）企业在全球市场中实施营销策略的有效性，特别是以华为技术有限公司为案例分析对象。华为作为国际知名的3C产品生产商，其营销策略在推动品牌全球化和提高市场竞争力方面发挥了重要作用。本文首先介绍了华为公司的发展历史以及其营销策略的演变过程，然后通过对华为在不同市场环境下所采取的营销手段进行分析，归纳出华为营销策略的成功要素及其在国内外市场推广中的应用实践。 研究发现，华为的营销策略主要包括以下几个方面： 1. 产品战略：华为注重高科技产品的研发与创新，不断推出满足不同用户需求的产品线和服务。其产品战略涵盖了从中低端到高端的全方位覆盖，旨在为不同市场和消费群体提供定制化的解决方案。 2. 品牌建设：华为投入巨资进行国际品牌推广，通过赞助国际体育赛事、文化活动等方式，提升品牌在全球的知名度和美誉度。 3. 渠道策略：华为建立了覆盖全球的销售网络，包括线上电商平台和线下零售商店，以及与全球通信运营商的深度合作，有效扩大了销售渠道。 4. 服务和支持：华为注重客户服务与技术支持，提供24小时在线咨询、快速响应和高效的售后服务，增强了客户的忠诚度。 5. 市场细分与定位：华为准确划分并瞄准不同市场细分领域，针对性地设计市场策略，满足不同用户群体的特定需求。 6. 竞争对手分析和市场适应：华为密切关注竞争对手的动态，灵活调整自身的市场策略以应对市场变化，并通过不断的市场研究和产品创新，保持其产品和服务的竞争优势。 通过对华为营销策略的深入分析，我们可以总结出华为之所以能够在国际市场上取得成功，是由于其对市场趋势的敏锐洞察、坚持不懈的技术创新、有效的品牌建设、广泛的销售渠道以及优质的客户服务。华为的营销策略为其他国产3C产品企业提供了宝贵的经验和借鉴，对于这些企业在国际市场上提升竞争力具有重要的指导意义。本研究对提升中国国产3C产品的全球竞争力具有一定的启示和应用价值，同时也对相关企业和营销实践者提供战略参考。"},{"prompt":"请帮我分析一下华为mate系列在不同产品生命周期采取的营销策略","completion":"华为Mate系列作为华为的旗舰智能手机产品线，体现了华为在高端市场的竞争策略。该系列手机通常采用最先进的技术和设计理念，以满足消费者对高品质手机产品的需求。在不同的产品生命周期阶段，华为Mate系列有不同的营销策略： 1. 引入期（Introduction Stage）： 在新产品引入市场的初期阶段，华为会通过大规模的营销活动来提高产品的知名度。这可能包括高调的发布会，通过社会媒体、广告和公关活动营造讨论热潮。同时，与知名人士合作作为产品代言，以及与通信运营商联合发布，广告突出产品的创新特性和先进技术，比如强调最新的芯片技术、相机创新、电池续航能力等，以吸引早期采用者和技术爱好者。 2. 成长期（Growth Stage）： 当产品开始被市场接受，并逐渐增长销量时，华为将专注于扩大市场份额。营销策略可能包括通过用户评价和口碑营销来提升品牌信任，加强与渠道商的关系，以及在零售点展示产品特点，使消费者有机会体验产品。此外，华为可能会提供有竞争力的价格策略，或者推出优惠活动来刺激销售增长。 3. 成熟期（Maturity Stage）： 随着产品达到成熟期，市场竞争通常会更加激烈。为了保持市场份额，华为可能会进行更细致的市场细分，针对性地发展细分市场。同时，华为可能会更新升级产品功能，并且通过软件更新来持续提升用户体验。营销活动可能会着重在维护品牌忠诚度和用户满意度上，例如通过提供个性化服务、忠诚客户回馈等策略。 4. 衰退期（Decline Stage）： 最终，随着市场上出现更多先进的竞争产品，Mate系列的某个特定型号的需求可能开始下降。在这个阶段，华为可能会逐渐减少对该产品型号的营销预算，并将焦点转移到新产品的开发和营销上。在产品线更新换代的同时，华为可能会对旧款产品进行价格调整，以清理库存，同时也可能会在渠道和促销策略上采取更加灵活的措施。 总体来说，华为Mate系列手机的营销策略体现了细致的市场研究和及时的产品更新。不同生命周期阶段的营销活动能够有效地吸引不同类型的消费者，不断促进产品的销量增长和市场占有率提升。"},{"prompt":"\`\`\` “About linear regression,” IBM.

First, we observe the outer loop: It runs from i = ⌊6n/5⌋ to 2n. The range is approximately n iterations, which can be written as: Upper Bound: [ n ] Lower Bound (since i can't be less than ⌊6n/5⌋): [ frac{n}{5} ] Next, we consider the inner loop: This runs from j = i^2 to 4n^2 for each i. For each fixed i, the number of iterations can be at most 4n^2 - i^2. Let's sum the number of iterations across all i, which will give us the number of times the innermost statement is executed: [ sum_{i = lceil 6n/5 rceil}^{2n} (4n^2 - i^2) ] To find the upper bound, we can use the smallest value of (i) to find the maximum number of iterations in the inner loop. That smallest value is (lceil 6n/5 rceil), which is close to (6n/5), and the largest value of (i) is (2n). Upper Bound: [ sum_{i = lceil 6n/5 rceil}^{2n} (4n^2 - (6n/5)^2) ] [ approx sum_{i = lceil 6n/5 rceil}^{2n} (4n^2 - 36n^2/25) ] [ approx sum_{i = lceil 6n/5 rceil}^{2n} (64n^2/25) ] [ approx frac{64n^3}{25} ] To find the lower bound, we need to consider the contribution of the largest possible value of (i), which is (2n), because it would minimize the inner summation. Lower Bound: [ sum_{i = lceil 6n/5 rceil}^{2n} (4n^2 - (2n)^2) ] [ approx sum_{i = lceil 6n/5 rceil}^{2n} (4n^2 - 4n^2) ] [ approx sum_{i = lceil 6n/5 rceil}^{2n} 0 ] [ approx 0 ] However, the true lower bound has to be found by considering the contribution of all (i). As (i) increases from (lceil 6n/5 rceil) to (2n), (i^2) grows from ( lceil 6n/5 rceil^2) to ( (2n)^2). The inner loop tends to decrease the number of executions as (i) grows. Therefore, we can split the summation for the upper bound from the smallest value (lceil 6n/5 rceil) until a certain (k), and for the lower bound, the summation goes from (k + 1) to (2n), where (k) is some value close to but less than (2n). However, after closer examination, because the inner loop decreases quadratically and is summed over a linear number of terms, the overall lower bound is still in the order of a cubic function. The lower bound retains a term cubic in (n), and since the constant factors are not critical in big-O notation, the cubic term dominates. Both the upper bound and lower bound have cubic growth rates, differing by a constant factor as (n) becomes large. Hence, we can conclude that the overall running time of the algorithm is (O(n^3)) in the worst case, with a lower bound that is also (O(n^3)). The difference between these is only a constant factor, which is acceptable for bounding purposes in Big O notation."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Let's break this passage down into smaller segments to understand it better: **Segment 1:** \\"How often, in answer to my repeated instreaties that you would give my daughter a regular detail of the Misfortunes and Adventures of your life,\\" This segment sets up the context. The speaker is reflecting on the numerous times (how often) they have asked (instreaties) the person they're addressing to share (give) a detailed account (a regular detail) of the unpleasant experiences (Misfortunes) and events (Adventures) of their life with the speaker's daughter. **Segment 2:** \\"have you said “No, my friend never will I comply with your request till I may be no longer in Danger of again experiencing such dreadful ones.”\\" Here, we have the response that has been given every time the speaker has made the request. The person addressed directly speaks (“No, my friend never will I comply with your request”) indicating a refusal to fulfill the request. The refusal is based on a specific condition: the person will not share their experiences until they are certain (may be no longer in Danger) that they won't have to endure more unpleasant or traumatic events (experiencing such dreadful ones). Putting it all together, the speaker is lamenting the fact that despite asking many times for a recounting of these life experiences to be shared with their daughter, the person to whom they are speaking has consistently refused. The refusal is rooted in the fear or expectation that if the stories are shared, the teller might face more adversity or trauma, which they wish to avoid. This passage elicits themes of hardship, concern for well-being, and perhaps a hint at the superstition or belief that recounting one's misfortunes can invite more of them.

When the speaker asks for \\"a regular detail of the Misfortunes and Adventures of your life,\\" they are requesting a complete and consistent recounting of events, rather than a sporadic or summary version. The word \\"regular\\" here implies something that is orderly and structured, suggesting that the speaker desires a coherent and possibly chronological story that covers all the relevant experiences systematically. The word \\"detail\\" underscores the depth and specificity desired, indicating that the speaker wants a narrative that includes specific information and descriptions about the events, not just a broad overview. Thus, \\"a regular detail\\" would mean the speaker is asking for comprehensive and methodically presented stories about the person's life, focusing on the trials and tribulations as well as the noteworthy incidents that the person has gone through."},{"prompt":"could you give me three possible translations in spanish pelase","completion":"Certainly, here are three possible translations of \\"a regular detail\\" into Spanish in the context of the phrase you provided: 1. \\"un relato detallado y sistemático\\" 2. \\"una descripción minuciosa y regular\\" 3. \\"un informe pormenorizado y constante\\" Each option conveys the idea of giving a detailed and orderly account of the misfortunes and adventures of one's life, although each uses slightly different wording to do so."},{"prompt":"Unescape any LaTeX into simple characters.

The paradoxes challenge the idea of motion and continuity by presenting scenarios where an object in motion seems to be unable to reach its destination. One of the most famous examples of the Zeno Paradox is the paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise. In this scenario, Achilles, who is faster than the tortoise, gives the tortoise a head start in a race. According to Zeno, Achilles will never be able to overtake the tortoise because he would first have to cover half the distance between them, then half of the remaining distance, and so on, resulting in an infinite number of steps before reaching the tortoise. The paradoxes raise questions about space, time, and the nature of reality, and have been a subject of debate among philosophers and mathematicians for centuries. Some interpretations suggest that the paradoxes are simply thought experiments that highlight the limitations of human perception and understanding, while others argue that they point to deeper truths about the nature of existence."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Flat white","completion":"\\"Flat White | Modern Minimalist Artwork | Versatile Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Canvas Prints | Contemporary Home Decor and Apparel\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Flat White | Modern Minimalist Artwork | Versatile Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Canvas Prints | Contemporary Home Decor and Apparel.

There were numerous interconnected factors that contributed to the empire's decline and eventual collapse, including: 1. **Political instability and corruption:** Frequent changes in leadership, with emperors often coming to power through violence or intrigue, undermined the stability of the government. Corruption was rampant, and effective governance became increasingly difficult. 2. **Economic troubles:** Heavy taxation, inflation, and a reliance on slave labor weakened the imperial economy. Rome also faced difficulties in maintaining its extensive trade networks and experienced a decline in agricultural productivity. 3. **Military problems:** The Roman military became overextended as it defended a vast and porous frontier. Reliance on mercenary forces of non-Roman birth (often called \\"foederati\\") who had different allegiances, undermined the discipline and loyalty of the army. Also, repeated invasions by various barbarian tribes strained the empire's resources. 4. **Barbarian invasions:** Various groups including the Visigoths, Vandals, Huns, and Ostrogoths invaded and settled in Roman territory. The sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 AD, and later by the Vandals in 455 AD, were symbolic blows to the empire's power. 5. **Cultural and societal changes:** The fabric of Roman society changed with the spread of Christianity and the gradual erosion of traditional Roman values and institutions. There was a perceived decline in civic virtue and public services. 6. **Environmental and health issues:** Some scholars suggest that climate change and plagues (such as the Antonine Plague and the Plague of Cyprian) may have weakened the empire by causing economic turmoil and population decline. 7. **Decentralization of power:** Power increasingly shifted from the central government in Rome to the provinces and local military leaders, which led to fragmentation and a weakening of the unified state structure. 8. **Division of the empire:** Emperor Diocletian's decision to split the Roman Empire into the Eastern (later Byzantine) and Western Empires in 285 AD may have inadvertently weakened the West by depriving it of the wealthier and more stable Eastern provinces. It's important to keep in mind that these factors were interrelated and exacerbated one another, making the fall of the Western Roman Empire a multifaceted and protracted historical process rather than the result of a single event or short-term cause."},{"prompt":"hello","completion":"Hello!

Here is an argument exploring the similarities: 1. **Origins in Conflict**: Both Hamas and the Viet Cong originated in response to political conflicts and occupation. Hamas was established during the First Intifada in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, mainly to resist Israeli occupation and conduct social welfare activities. Similarly, the Viet Cong, or the National Liberation Front (NLF), was created in 1960 to fight against the South Vietnamese government, which they saw as a puppet regime supported by the United States, and to resist American military involvement in Vietnam. 2. **Guerrilla Tactics**: Both organizations have used guerrilla warfare as a primary military strategy. The Viet Cong and Hamas have engaged in unconventional warfare, involving surprise attacks, ambushes, and hit-and-run tactics against a more conventionally organized and powerful military force (the U.S. and South Vietnamese Army in the case of Viet Cong, the Israeli Defense Forces in the case of Hamas). 3. **Political and Ideological Goals**: While their ideologies differ, with the Viet Cong being influenced by Marxist-Leninist principles and Hamas being an Islamist group, both have strong nationalist components and seek the establishment of a political system that aligns with their worldview. The Viet Cong pursued the unification of Vietnam under communist rule, while Hamas seeks the establishment of an Islamic state in the Palestinian territories. 4. **Grassroots Support**: Each group has managed, to varying degrees, to secure significant support from the local population. This support has been crucial to their survival and effectiveness, providing resources, intelligence, and a pool of recruits. 5. **Use of Terrorism**: Both organizations have been accused of employing terrorist tactics. The Viet Cong carried out assassinations and terror attacks against South Vietnamese officials, while Hamas has been responsible for suicide bombings and rocket attacks against civilian targets in Israel. 6. **International Pariah Status**: The international community has largely viewed both the Viet Cong and Hamas as illegitimate or terrorist organizations at different times. Despite this, both have managed to find external support – the Viet Cong from the Soviet Union and China, and Hamas from various Middle Eastern states and non-state actors. 7. **Dual Roles as Military and Political Entities**: The Viet Cong and Hamas have both operated as armed groups and, over time, developed political wings. The Viet Cong established themselves politically through the Provisional Revolutionary Government, and Hamas participates in Palestinian politics, winning a majority in the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections. However, while these points highlight similarities, it is essential to acknowledge the significant differences in their historical contexts, ideologies, and ultimate objectives. The Viet Cong was a product of the Cold War and anticolonial movements, fighting in a protracted conflict that involved superpowers.

Recursive solutions are often used for problems that can be broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems with a base case that stops the recursion. # The Anatomy of a Recursive Function A recursive function typically has two main components: 1. **Base Case:** The base case (or cases) defines the condition under which the recursion ends. This is essential to prevent infinite recursion and eventual stack overflow. 2. **Recursive Case:** The recursive case is where the function calls itself with a different argument, gradually moving towards the base case. # Understanding the Recursive Process 1. Breaking Down the Problem - Recursive problems often involve breaking down a task into smaller instances of the same task. - This divide-and-conquer approach simplifies complex problems into tractable units. 2. Identifying the Base Case - The base case must be simple enough to be solved without further recursion. - It acts as the stopping point for recursive calls. 3. Formulating the Recursive Case - The recursive case must change the problem's state towards the base case. - The change usually involves modifying arguments or reducing the problem's size. # Visualizing Recursion Think of recursion as a stack of tasks to be completed. When a recursive function calls itself, it puts a new task on the stack. When it hits the base case, it begins to complete tasks and remove them from the stack. # Examples of Recursion Factorial Calculator In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer \`n\` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \`n\`, denoted by \`n!\`. \`\`\`python def factorial(n): # Base case: if n is 1, we can return the factorial directly if n == 1: return 1 # Recursive case: otherwise, keep calculating the factorial else: return n * factorial(n - 1) print(factorial(5)) # Output: 120 \`\`\` Fibonacci Sequence The Fibonacci sequence starts with two numbers, 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. \`\`\`python def fibonacci(n): # Base cases if n == 0: return 0 elif n == 1: return 1 # Recursive case else: return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2) print(fibonacci(6)) # Output: 8 \`\`\` # Recursion vs Iteration - Iteration uses loops (for, while) to repeat code execution. Recursion achieves repetition through repeated function calls. - Some problems are more naturally solved with recursion, such as traversing trees, whereas others are better suited to iteration. # Best Practices and Tips 1. **Ensure a Base Case:** Prevents infinite recursion and stack overflow errors. 2. **Make Progress Towards Base Case:** Ensure each recursive call moves closer to the base case. 3. **Use Memoization to Optimize:** Store results of expensive function calls and reuse them to avoid redundant calculations (as seen in dynamic programming). 4. **Beware of Stack Size:** Recursion uses call stack space, and deep recursion could lead to a stack overflow error. Iterative solutions may be more space-efficient. # Debugging Recursive Functions 1. **Print Statements:** Use print statements to track the flow of execution and the values passed to each recursive call. 2. **Use a Debugger:** Step through each function call to examine the call stack and variables. 3. **Base Case First:** Verify the base case works independently before moving on to debugging the recursive case. 4. **Small Inputs:** Test your recursive function with small input values to see if it behaves as expected. # Conclusion Recursion is a powerful tool in a programmer's arsenal. It simplifies the process of working on problems that are naturally hierarchical or that involve repeating identical subtasks. However, it's crucial to understand its workings, apply it judiciously, and recognize when an iterative approach might be more appropriate. With practice and experience, recursion becomes an intuitive and effective technique for problem-solving."},{"prompt":"Consider the 2-player game of Gumdrop, played on a square board. You are given an n by n grid of gumdrops (n ≥ 2): the bottom left gumdrop is green, and is poisoned: if you eat the poisoned gumdrop, you lose. All other gumdrops are red, and are not poisoned. On your turn, you choose a gumdrop that is on the grid at coordinates (x,y), and you eat all gumdrops at (xe,ye) such that xe ≥ x and ye ≥ y. That is, you eat the rectangle of gumdrops with (x, y) as the lower-left coordinate of the rectangle. Find the winning strategy for player 1, and prove it using induction.","completion":"To find a winning strategy for the 2-player game of Gumdrop, where Player 1 makes the first move, we can leverage the concept of \\"strategy stealing\\" and mathematical induction. # Strategy Stealing Argument If the first player (Player 1) does not initially have a winning strategy, then the second player (Player 2) must have a move that puts Player 1 in a losing position. If we suppose that's the case, Player 1 could instead start by making that very move that supposedly puts Player 2 in a winning position. Hence, there must always exist a strategy for the first player that prevents the second player from being guaranteed a win after the first move. Thus, Player 1 can steal the winning strategy by making the best move that Player 2 could've made. # Winning Strategy for Player 1 Given the rules of Gumdrop and the poisoning of the gumdrop at (1,1), the symmetry of the initial state of the board provides an immediate winning strategy for Player 1: 1. In the first move, Player 1 should eat the gumdrop at (2,2). This divides the board into three distinct regions with no remaining gumdrops in the fourth region: the first region is what's left in the first row (excluding the already eaten and poisoned gumdrops), the second is what's left in the first column, and the third are the remaining gumdrops in neither the first row nor the first column. After Player 1 makes this move, Player 2 is forced to eat gumdrops in one of the remaining regions. Regardless of which region Player 2 chooses, Player 1 mirrors the move in the other region, maintaining the symmetry with respect to the poisoned gumdrop. If Player 2 eats the rectangle ending at (x, 1), then Player 1 should eat the rectangle ending at (1, x). If Player 2 eats the rectangle ending at (1, y), then Player 1 should eat the rectangle ending at (y, 1). This strategy ensures that Player 2 will always face a move, while Player 1 can continue mirroring until Player 2 eventually has no other option but to eat the poisoned gumdrop. # Proof by Induction To prove this winning strategy, we can conduct an inductive argument: **Base Case:** For the 2x2 board, Player 1 eats the gumdrop at (2,2), leaving Player 2 with no choice but to eat the poisoned gumdrop. Player 1 wins. **Inductive Step:** Assume for any kxk board (where k is an integer greater than or equal to 2) following the strategy of eating the gumdrop at (2,2) and then mirroring Player 2's moves, Player 1 wins. Now, consider a (k+1)x(k+1) board. Player 1 starts by eating the gumdrop at (2,2), again dividing the board into three regions and leaving a symmetrical setup with respect to the poison. If Player 2 eats any gumdrop within one of these regions, the remaining gumdrops form a rectangle that fits within our assumption of a kxk board where Player 1 has a winning strategy. Since Player 1 has a winning move for a kxk board by hypothesis, they will also have a winning move on this (k+1)x(k+1) board by following the same mirroring strategy as described. Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction, Player 1 has a winning strategy for any nxn board with n greater than or equal to 2 by starting at the (2,2) position and mirroring Player 2's moves, maintaining the symmetry of the board at all times, which forces Player 2 to eventually eat the poisoned gumdrop."},{"prompt":"Hello! recently bought a Pixel 8, super satisfied with it and i'm currently waiting for my screen protector. with regards to the unli google photos. how do i go about availing one? i understand i have to buy a pixel that is old like Pixel XL perhaps? after that how do i go about utilizing the unli gphotos for my Pixel 8? enhance the grammar","completion":"Hello!

Here is a Xianxia cultivation system with 99 stages, split into 10 realms with distinct attributes: 1. **Mortal Realm** (Stages 1-9) - Cultivators are grounded in their physical bodies and begin their cultivation journey by refining their qi through exercises, diets, and basic meditation. They learn to sense the natural energies around them. 2. **Mystic Arts Realm** (Stages 10-19) - At this level, cultivators unlock the potential to learn mystic techniques and spells. They study the flow of elemental forces and the manipulation of the environment. Their internal qi begins to branch towards forming more complex patterns. 3. **Spiritual Sea Realm** (Stages 20-29) - In the Spiritual Sea Realm, practitioners expand their inner spiritual sea, allowing for the storage and refinement of greater amounts of qi. Their spiritual perception grows, enabling the ability to communicate with natural spirits and sense distant occurrences. 4. **Golden Core Realm** (Stages 30-39) - The Golden Core Realm is marked by the materialization of a cultivator’s mystic power into a dense, golden core within their dantian. It signifies a significant boost in power, control, and life span. Golden Core cultivators gain the natural ability to soar through the heavens. 5. **Nascent Soul Realm** (Stages 40-49) - At this pinnacle, a cultivator’s essence, spirit, and physical body integrate fully, leading to the creation of a nascent soul, also known as a dharmic idol. This idol is a representation of their cultivation essence, and for many, reflects their chosen path such as a sword for sword cultivators. 6. **Phantom Veil Realm** (Stages 50-59) - The cultivator's nascent soul learns to step outside their physical form, creating phantasmal avatars that can engage in combat or perform various tasks. This gives them an edge in battles as their true body can remain concealed while avatars fight. 7. **Divine Tribulation Realm** (Stages 60-69) - Cultivators face heavenly tribulations that test their might and willpower. Their physical bodies go through a transformation that allows them to channel the forces of the universe. Each tribulation overcome leads to purer qi and a step closer to divine power. 8. **Celestial Ascendant Realm** (Stages 70-79) - Ascendants' auras resonate with celestial bodies, providing them cosmic powers. Their control over time and space strengthens, and they can warp reality to some extent. They are revered as near-immortals. 9. **Primeval Emperor Realm** (Stages 80-89) - A realm where cultivators reign over vast territories of the universe with their unparalleled might. They can create or destroy worlds and are worshipped as emperors of primeval power. Their very presence can alter the fabric of the cosmos. 10. **Sovereign Immortal Realm** (Stages 90-98) - Cultivators within this realm surpass the conventional limits of life and death. They are immune to the laws of the universe and can manifest wonderous phenomena. Their understanding of existence is profound, and their legacy may last through ages. 11. **True God Realm** (Stage 99) - At this ultimate, singular stage, the cultivator transcends all previous limitations, becoming a deity in their own right—a True God. They are the embodiment of the Dao, capable of shaping reality and the universe at their will. In this system, progressing through each stage requires arduous cultivation, facing trials, and often, enlightenment that leads to a deeper connection with the Dao. Peak figures in each realm are often legendary figures in the Xianxia world, surrounded by formidable auras and commanding great respect."},{"prompt":"I don't like the suggested realms you made above the 5th realm. entirely re-write those above the 5th realm.","completion":"Apologies for not meeting your expectations.

They refine their qi to resonate with starlight, drawing deep cosmic power into their being. 7. **Void Transcendence Realm** (Stages 50-59) - Practitioners of the Void Transcendence Realm learn to navigate the boundless void. Their senses extend beyond mere physical realms, touching upon the threshold of the multiverse. They can tear rifts in space and travel through vast distances in the blink of an eye. 8. **Empyrean Nexus Realm** (Stages 60-69) - At this tier, the cultivator fuses their energy with the nexus of all creation, the Empyrean. This brings power over elemental chaos and the fundamental forces of existence. They command natural events and are on the path to embracing the essence of life and death. 9. **Primordial Sovereign Realm** (Stages 70-79) - Recognized as sovereigns close to the origin of all, cultivators tap into ancient energies and wield primordial forces. They have the capability to awaken long-forgotten powers and summon beings from the dawn of time. Their authority influences the karmic ties of myriad beings. 10. **Eternal Sage Realm** (Stages 80-89) - Reaching the Eternal Sage Realm is a testament to infinite wisdom and boundless cultivation insight. These sages become one with eternity, unfettered by the shackles of time. To achieve this level is to have an indomitable will that echoes through the ages. 11. **Cosmic Genesis Realm** (Stages 90-98) - In this penultimate stage, cultivators witness the genesis of cosmos from chaos. They can manipulate the strands of creation, spawning stars and forging galaxies. Their very thoughts can birth life or engender devastation on an unimaginable scale. 12. **True God Realm** (Stage 99) - This is the ultimate pinnacle of cultivation, where one stands as a True God. They embody perfection and the quintessence of the universe. Their consciousness merges with the Dao itself, and they transcend to a state of omnipotence, becoming eternal and infinite. Each realm from the 6th upward marks a distinct leap in a cultivator's path towards godhood. Cultivators must not only master their internal qi but also harmonize with the cosmos, understand the mysteries of time and space, and finally, embody the principles that govern existence itself. The progression to True God is a legend few dare to dream, and even fewer achieve."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Juno in the first house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"In the realm of astrology, the asteroid Juno represents partnerships, marriage, and the dynamic of giving and receiving within relationships. When Juno is found in the first house of a natal chart, its influence is directed toward the self and personal identity, merging these themes with the qualities Juno represents. The first house is traditionally associated with the self, the physical body, first impressions, and the approach one takes towards initiating action in the world. It's often referred to as the house of self, and planets or asteroids located here will greatly influence the individual's personality, demeanor, and the way others perceive them. With Juno in the first house, there is a strong indication that partnership and the qualities of a partner play an integral role in shaping the individual's identity. People with this placement might find that their personal growth and self-understanding are deeply intertwined with their relationship experiences. They may place a high significance on fairness and equality within their relationships, and these values are likely to be a prominent part of their demeanor. Furthermore, the Juno in the first house person might naturally attract partnerships early on in life, or they might find that others see them as commitment-oriented. For them, being seen as someone who is a \\"good partner\\" could be part of their personal narrative, and they might view the world through the lens of relational dynamics, even outside of romantic contexts. In a sense, Juno's presence here can serve as a mirror, reflecting parts of the individual's identity that they may only fully recognize within the context of an intimate relationship. This can sometimes indicate that the individual's self-awareness is heightened when they are partnered or actively engaged in seeking balance through interpersonal connections. The aspect of marriage suggested by Juno can also speak to a desire to publicly affirm partnerships. Those with Juno in the first house might be inclined to view official commitments, such as marriage or business partnerships, as vital expressions of their identity. However, this placement can also mean that the lessons one needs to learn about themselves, self-sufficiency, and autonomy could come through the experiences of relationships. If Juno is negatively aspected, the individual might struggle with codependency or a loss of personal identity within partnerships. They may need to work towards finding balance by fostering independence alongside their natural inclination towards unity and commitment. In terms of self-image, Juno in the first house may inspire individuals to present themselves in a way that aligns with their ideal of what it means to be a partner. They might project an image of reliability, equality, and dedication, which can be appealing to potential partners who value these traits. Overall, the presence of Juno in the first house brings an emphasis on understanding the self through the mirror of relationships and suggests a significant part of the individual's life journey involves learning and growing within the context of close partnerships. They are likely to value harmony, equity, and reciprocity, and these themes may be core to their approach to life and their interactions with others."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Juno in the 2nd house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"In astrology, the asteroid Juno symbolizes themes of commitment, marriage, and partnerships, as well as how we deal with issues of power, loyalty, and fairness within our most intimate bonds. When we consider Juno's placement in the second house of a natal chart, its significance intertwines with second house matters such as personal resources, values, self-worth, and material possessions. The second house in astrology is traditionally linked to what we value on a tangible and intangible level, our finances, and the things we own that give us a sense of security and comfort. It's also connected to how we build and maintain our self-esteem and what we consider worthy of our time and energy. Juno's presence in this house suggests that relationships and the qualities of a partner are interconnected with these themes of value, stability, and security. For an individual with Juno in the second house, partnerships may be intrinsically tied to the pursuit of security and stability. This could manifest as a desire to have a partner who is stable and reliable, someone who shares similar values, especially concerning material wealth and resources. Relationships are not taken lightly by this person; instead, they may be regarded as a significant investment, similar to other valuable assets they possess. Such an individual may often look for long-term stability and may prefer relationships that can contribute to their sense of financial or emotional security. Consequently, the way they approach partnerships can be quite practical, and they may place high importance on their partner's ability to provide or contribute to a comfortable life. This doesn't necessarily denote materialism; rather, it can also reflect a need for a partner who helps solidify the individual's sense of self-worth and values. Juno in the second house also implies that the person's self-esteem might be closely tied to the health of their relationships. If the partnership is going well, they may feel more confident and valued. However, if the relationships falter or if they experience betrayal, the impact on the individual's self-esteem and sense of worth can be significant. These individuals might also expect loyalty and consistency within partnerships, as these are qualities that parallel the fixed and secure nature of second house matters. The role of power and control within a relationship can be tied to who holds the financial reins or who values what within the partnership structure. When Juno is challenged by other planetary aspects in the natal chart, the individual might struggle with possessiveness or an overemphasis on their partner's material contributions to the relationship. It may also suggest potential issues regarding control over resources and money, or the struggle to balance intimacy with financial independence. If Juno is well-aspected, however, it can indicate a harmonious blending of resources and values between partners, and a shared approach to building a stable and secure future. The person with Juno in the second house can become adept at managing joint financial matters and may enjoy growing both the tangible and intangible assets within their relationship. In summary, with Juno in the second house, an individual's commitment and view of marriage are closely tied to their values and the desire for personal and shared security. Establishing a lasting and loyal partnership that brings stability and reflects shared values is likely to be of great importance to the individual's emotional well-being and sense of self-worth. Relationships are not just matters of the heart but also investments in a shared and secure future."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Juno in the 3rd house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"In astrology, the asteroid Juno signifies the dynamics of partnerships, the nature of our commitments, and the qualities we seek in our long-term relationships, particularly pertaining to marriage and contractual bonds. When Juno is found in the third house of a natal chart, its energies are married with themes associated with that house, such as communication, learning, local community, siblings, and short trips. The third house is the domain of day-to-day interactions, the exchange of ideas, and the cultivation of relationships with peers and neighbors. It influences how we think, share information, and connect with our immediate environment. The presence of Juno in this house, therefore, suggests that partnerships and the concept of commitment are deeply intertwined with these aspects of an individual's life. With Juno in the third house, communication within relationships takes on paramount importance. These individuals may seek a partner with whom they can share an intellectual rapport, someone who can engage in stimulating conversation and who appreciates the exchange of ideas. For them, a relationship may flourish only if it is built on a foundation of open and effective communication, and there can be a strong desire for a partner who is not just a lover but also a confidant and collaborator in the day-to-day aspects of life. The third house also governs our immediate social sphere - siblings, relatives, neighbors, and close acquaintances. Hence, the placement of Juno here could mean that an individual's partnerships may be influenced by or interwoven with their local community or those they interact with on a regular basis. They may meet partners through their community, educational settings, or during short travels, and these contexts can be significant in their relational life. Moreover, Juno's placement might also indicate a preference for a partner who feels like a sibling or a best friend—one with whom there's a strong sense of camaraderie and shared interests. The early education and the relationship with siblings could also play a role in shaping what the individual seeks in a partnership. They might admire qualities like wit, adaptability, and a youthful spirit – similar attributes that one might enjoy in a sibling or close peer. Because the third house relates to learning, a person with Juno here might be stimulated by a partner who encourages their intellectual growth or someone from whom they can learn. It may also suggest that the relationship will involve continual learning together, possibly engaging in activities like attending workshops, taking short courses, or simply enjoying books and discussions as a pair. However, if Juno is afflicted with challenging aspects in the third house, there might be potential issues with misunderstandings, communication breakdowns, or disagreements with neighbors or relatives influencing the partnership. The individual might also encounter difficulties if they prioritize the intellectual connection in a partnership at the expense of emotional or physical bonding. If Juno is well-aspected in the third house, the relationship can benefit from harmonious communication, a shared curiosity about the world, and the enjoyment of a vibrant, engaging local environment. The couple might also excel in working together on writing, speaking, or other communicative projects. In short, with Juno in the third house, the themes of communication, curiosity, learning, and local community are deeply integrated into a person's idea of a successful and fulfilling partnership. They desire an intellectual kinship with their partner and are likely to seek a relationship that thrives on dialogue, mental stimulation, and an active participation in their immediate surroundings. This placement of Juno fosters the idea that a true partner is someone who can journey with them through the many small adventures of everyday life."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Juno in the 4th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"Astrologically, the asteroid Juno symbolizes themes of partnership, marriage, and the qualities we seek and express within our closest commitments. In the context of a natal chart, when Juno is located in the fourth house, its energies merge with fourth house concerns, which commonly include home, family, roots, and emotional security. The fourth house is traditionally associated with the deepest parts of our inner world and our personal foundation. It is connected to our ancestry, our connection with our parents (often the mother or the more nurturing parent), our sense of belonging, and the sense of safety we derive from our home environment. It's also about the legacy we wish to establish, including the domestic and private life that we build. With Juno in the fourth house, there can be a powerful link between one's sense of domestic harmony and emotional security with their experience in partnerships. Individuals with this placement may prioritize finding a partner who can offer a sense of home or family, or they might seek someone who shares their deep-rooted values and desire for a nurturing domestic life. A partner for a person with Juno in the fourth house is often one who contributes to a feeling of emotional safety and comfort. For these individuals, the quality and health of their closest relationships, particularly their marriage or long-term partnerships, are intrinsically tied to their private world. A partner isn't just a spouse or significant other; they are part of the individual's emotional foundation and may be seen as part of the family unit or as someone who can provide a sense of belonging. The fourth house also ties in with our past, our upbringing, and familial patterns. Thus, Juno's placement here could suggest that one's approach to partnership is shaped by their experiences within their family of origin, as well as the examples of relationships that they were exposed to as children. They may seek to recreate the positive aspects of these familial relationships in their partnerships or may yearn to build a different, more idealistic home life than they experienced. If Juno is well-aspected in the fourth house, the individual may experience fulfilling partnerships that enhance their personal sense of safety and belonging. They may attract partners who are nurturing and caring or who share a common background or cultural heritage that makes the individual feel understood on a soul level. On the other hand, if Juno forms challenging aspects in this house, it could indicate emotional difficulties within the partnership related to family dynamics or the home environment. The individual may face challenges in separating their partner's role from their family expectations or creating an independent family structure free from the influence of their past. Regardless of the specific aspects, those with Juno in the fourth house may have a strong desire to establish a secure, stable, and supportive home life with their partners. They may be particularly sensitive to the family dynamics within their relationships, and creating a family (biological or chosen) that reflects their values and offers emotional support could be a significant aspect of their life's journey. In essence, Juno in the fourth house speaks to a deep emotional investment in partnerships, where the individual seeks a profound sense of belonging, security, and nurturing from their relationship. They may place substantial importance on the role of their partner in creating a sanctuary that serves as a personal retreat and a cornerstone of their existence. Home truly is where the heart is for individuals with Juno in the fourth house, and their partnership is deeply intertwined with that sacred space."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Juno in the 5th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"Astrologically, the asteroid Juno touches on themes of loyalty, commitment, and the ideal qualities sought in long-term relationships, particularly those akin to marriage or deeply committed partnerships. When Juno is placed in the fifth house of a natal chart, its influence weaves into the matters ruled by this house: creativity, romance, pleasure, self-expression, and children. The fifth house is often referred to as the house of joy. It governs the things that make us feel alive and special, including artistic endeavors, recreational activities, and the experiences that bring us joy and fulfillment, such as love affairs, hobbies, and any form of creative self-expression. It also concerns our relationships with children, whether they are our own or those we influence in significant ways. With Juno's presence in the fifth house, the theme of partnership becomes intertwined with the pursuit of pleasure and creativity. Individuals with this placement may seek a partner who is not only a lover but also a muse or a companion in adventure and creativity. They might long for a relationship that feels like a continuous romance, desiring the sustained spark that is often present in the initial stages of falling in love. This can result in a heightened importance placed on keeping the romance alive. In such a chart, the person may value a partner who supports their creative self-expression or joins them in the pursuit of creative or recreational activities. They can be drawn to people who have a vibrant, expressive, and perhaps even dramatic quality, or who exhibit traits typically associated with the fifth house, such as playfulness, generosity, and a joyous spirit. Their approach to commitment may include a robust sense of fun, a demand for mutual inspiration, and an everyday quest for moments that enrich the soul. Moreover, Juno's placement in this house could indicate that the realms of romance, child-rearing, and personal creativity are not only interconnected but are also vital in understanding what the individual seeks in their partnerships. They may strongly desire a partner with whom they can share the responsibility and joy of parenting, or alternatively, someone who will support their interactions with children more broadly, such as through teaching or mentoring roles. However, a potential challenge for those with Juno in the fifth house might be sustaining enduring relationships beyond the 'honeymoon' phase. They might have to guard against a sense of disappointment if the everyday realities of partnership don't measure up to the ideal of perpetual romance and excitement. This placement may also highlight lessons around the need to balance personal creative expression with the give-and-take required in a committed partnership. If Juno is well-aspected in the fifth house, an individual may find they are able to create strong bonds through shared creative endeavors or by enjoying a dynamic and playful interaction with their partner. They may also partner with someone who shares similar attitudes towards children or who takes joy in the exhilarating aspects of life. On the flip side, challenging aspects to Juno might point to romantic or creative frustrations or issues surrounding children. It could indicate a need to reconcile the desire for romantic freedom with the realities of commitment or to navigate the complexities when one partner seeks more attention than the other can give. In summary, Juno's placement in the fifth house brings an emphasis on finding a sense of partnership within the realms of creative expression, romantic encounters, and the joys of life. Individuals with this placement seek a connection that embodies romance, creativity, and the playful side of life, desiring a partner who can keep the flame of passion and inspiration alive over time. They may also view their romantic partners as companions in the enjoyment and nurturing of children, whether their own or those they affect through their creative work or leisure activities."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Juno in the 6th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"In astrology, Juno represents themes central to marriage and long-term partnerships, such as commitment, equality, and balance within relationships. When positioned in the sixth house of a natal chart, Juno's influence touches upon the areas of life governed by this house, including work, daily routines, health, and service to others. The sixth house is commonly associated with the minutiae of daily life, the habits we form, and the way we manage our responsibilities. It deals with how we organize our lives to make them functional and efficient and how we contribute to the world through our work and service. Juno's presence in this house blends the desire for a committed partnership with the practical aspects of daily living. For individuals with Juno in the sixth house, the qualities they seek in partners are often grounded in the practical and service-oriented realm. They may value a partner who has a strong work ethic, who is helpful, reliable, and attentive to details. These individuals may see marriage or long-term commitment not just as a romantic bond but also as a sort of partnership where two people support each other through the ups and downs of everyday life. There can be a strong desire for a relationship in which partners work well together, perhaps even in the same profession or through a shared service mission. The daily routines and tasks may be essential to the sense of connection, where mutual support in health, maintenance of the household, and managing responsibilities bring a comforting rhythm and a sense of shared purpose. In some cases, Juno in the sixth house might indicate that one's relationships are tied to the work environment, or they may meet significant partners through their job or health-related activities. They might derive satisfaction from having a partner who embodies the virtues of sixth house undertakings – diligence, helpfulness, and an earnest approach to maintaining well-being. Health can also play a significant role in relationships for people with this Juno placement. They may connect deeply with a partner through joint health routines, exercise, and a shared interest in nutrition or wellness practices. Additionally, the relationship might flourish when both partners are aligned in their perspectives on service and health. However, should Juno be negatively aspected in the sixth house, there can be challenges related to these areas. Issues within the relationship may arise from overly critical attitudes, excessive worry about health, or imbalance where one partner assumes more than their share of responsibilities. This could lead to a dynamic where the relationship feels more like a duty or service than an equal partnership, or where the day-to-day realities overshadow the romantic and spiritual connection. With positive aspects, Juno in the sixth house can indicate harmonious relationships where there is mutual support in everyday activities, shared work goals, and a joint commitment to each other's health and well-being. Relationships can become a space where partners nurture and maintain their lives together, both practically and emotionally. To sum up, Juno in the sixth house suggests that partnerships are deeply tied to the realms of duty, health, and service, with an emphasis on the practical support that partners can offer each other. The concept of service within a relationship may be pronounced, and the routines and habits shared between partners can form an important foundation for the union's lasting success. Individuals with this placement may thrive in relationships where there is a shared dedication to making day-to-day life run smoothly and healthily, reflecting a love that manifests through the careful tending to life's practicalities."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Juno in the 7th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"In astrology, Juno encapsulates the essence of commitment and fidelity within partnerships, and it symbolizes our approach to serious relationships, including the qualities we seek in a partner and the kind of commitment we are willing to offer. When Juno resides in the seventh house of a natal chart, it sits in the domain traditionally linked to marriage, open enemies, close partnerships, and legal contracts. The seventh house, often known as the descendant, is opposite to the first house of self, and it represents what we attract in others and the qualities we project onto our partners. It is the house that signifies the awareness of self through the lens of intimate one-to-one relationships. Juno's position here pairs its natural affinity for balanced partnerships with the seventh house's focus on collaboration and legal commitment. For an individual with Juno in the seventh house, relationships are central to their existence, often gaining a sense of identity through union with others. The quest for an ideal partner or soulmate may be an influential part of their life's narrative, and they may possess a clear vision of who this individual might be.

The relationship can be characterized by mutual attentiveness, a willingness to help each other, and a grounding in reality that provides a solid foundation for the union. They may approach issues with a logical mindset and a willingness to work through problems with patience and precision. However, when Juno in Virgo faces challenging aspects, the individual may experience difficulties related to criticism, nitpicking, or a sense of anxiousness over disorder or imperfection within the relationship. There can be an inclination toward fault-finding, or an expectation that the partner should function with the same levels of organization and practicality they hold themselves to, which can be unrealistic and strain the relationship. Furthermore, there may be lessons around balancing the desire for perfection with acceptance and compassion, both for themselves and their partners. It's important for individuals with Juno in Virgo to remember that while the details are important, so too is the spirit of love, acceptance, and the broader strokes that make the relationship meaningful. In sum, Juno's placement in Virgo indicates a person's need for a partnership that thrives on shared routines, mutual support in personal growth, and the subtle, everyday expressions of devotion. It speaks to a longing for a kind of love that is both practical and supportive, where partners are committed not just to each other but to a shared vision of a meticulously cared-for daily life.

Harding. It is one of the larger asteroids in the asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In astrology, Juno is named after the Roman goddess, who was the wife of Jupiter and the goddess of marriage and childbirth. As such, the asteroid has come to be associated with many of the themes represented by the goddess, including marriage, commitment, partnership equality, jealousy, betrayal, and the desire for a balanced and fair relationship. Astrologically, the placement of Juno in the birth chart is said to provide valuable insight into what individuals need or desire within their intimate relationships, and how they deal with issues of power balance and loyalty within those relationships. Juno symbolizes the doorway to our \\"ideal\\" mate and helps us understand the nature of the soulmate we are likely to seek, indicative of our partnership style and our expectations from lifelong bonds. Because Juno aspects in the birth chart can reveal the dynamic of our most personal and committed partnerships, it can act as a guide to understanding our patterns in relationships, including who we attract and why, as well as illuminate areas where growth is needed to create healthy and fulfilling partnerships. From an evolutionary perspective, certain challenges indicated by Juno's placement can be seen as opportunities for development in the relational and social arenas of life. Juno's association with legal ties makes its placement relevant in the examination of marital issues and divorce cases. It can indicate the potential partners we might attract, the way we approach the concept of marriage or deep commitment, our propensity for loyalty, and the dynamics of power and control we may experience with others. Beyond romance, Juno also touches upon business partnerships and other formal collaborations, where issues of trust, respect, and equality become similarly important. In synastry, which is the comparison of two astrological charts, the interaction of one person's Juno with another's planet can show strong ties that indicate potential for a meaningful and lasting partnership. Juno's contacts in composite charts, which represent the relationship as a separate entity, can also provide significant insights into the nature of a partnership. Despite its importance, Juno is often overlooked or underestimated in astrological interpretations in favor of more prominent planetary aspects. However, for those concerning themselves with relationship dynamics, delving into Juno's place can be highly revealing and provide added depth to the understanding of personal interactions and partnership desires."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are a few numbers that are generally regarded as lucky: 1. **Number 8 (八, bā):** In Mandarin, the pronunciation of eight sounds like \\"ba,\\" which is similar to \\"fa\\" (发), meaning to generate wealth or prosper. Because of this, the number 8 is associated with wealth, success, and high social status. In Xianxia stories, where the pursuit of immortality, power, and fortune are central themes, the number 8 often features in auspicious contexts. 2. **Number 9 (九, jiǔ):** The number nine is considered especially propitious because it is the highest single-digit number and represents longevity and eternity. In Imperial China, the number was associated with the Emperor, who was thought to be heavenly ordained, with the Forbidden City reportedly having 9,999.5 rooms as a symbol of the emperor's infinite reign. In Xianxia, this concept often translates to a focus on attaining the highest levels of cultivation or seeking eternal life. 3. **Number 6 (六, liù):** Six is considered a good number because it sounds like \\"flow\\" (顺, shùn), suggesting things will proceed smoothly. It is often associated with favorable outcomes and sometimes with wealth and good luck. Less common but also considered lucky in specific contexts: 4. **Number 7 (七, qī):** Seven is considered a spiritually significant number in Chinese culture, representing harmony and completeness. It is also representative of the combination of yin, yang, and the Five Elements, which play a significant role in feng shui and ancient Chinese philosophy. These numbers often play a role in various ways in Chinese society, including choosing phone numbers, license plates, dates for important events, and even addresses. They are integrated into festivities (like Chinese New Year), cultural practices, and, by extension, into the fictional worlds of Xianxia novels and mythology where characters seek ultimate power or enlightenment. In such stories, the numbers might be used symbolically, such as the number of steps to an immortal palace, the number of mystical artifacts, or the number of levels in a cultivation technique, each imbued with layers of cultural significance and meaning."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

One of the core components of Ceph's file system (CephFS) is the metadata server (MDS), which handles the metadata operations of the file system, such as directory listings and file locations. When you encounter an error message like \\"insufficient standby MDS daemons available,\\" it means that Ceph is warning that there aren't enough standby MDS daemons to take over in case one of the active MDS daemons fails. This could lead to a situation where metadata services are interrupted or degraded if a failure occurs. Here are steps you can take to address the issue: 1. **Check MDS Status:** First, check the current status of the MDS daemons in your cluster. You can use the following command: \`\`\`bash ceph mds stat \`\`\` Look for the number of active and standby daemons. The output should include both up:active and up:standby-replay/standby entries. 2. **Increase MDS Daemons:** If the number of standby MDS daemons is less than desired, consider adding more MDS daemons to your Ceph cluster. To do this, you need to deploy additional instances of MDS on suitable cluster nodes. 3. **Check MDS Configuration:** Ensure that your Ceph configuration file (usually \`/etc/ceph/ceph.conf\` or passed to the MDS daemon at startup) is set up correctly to start MDS daemons in standby mode. You might have configuration options like \`mds_standby_for_fscid\`, \`mds_standby_for_name\`, or \`mds_standby_replay\` that govern standby behavior. 4. **Adjust CephFS Settings:** You might want to adjust the CephFS settings for how many standby MDS daemons are required. For example, you can set the \`mds_standby_count_wanted\` option to signal how many standby MDSs should ideally be available. Adjust the setting by running the following command: \`\`\`bash ceph fs set <fs_name> mds_standby_count_wanted <number> \`\`\` Replace \`<fs_name>\` with your file system name and \`<number>\` with the desired number of standby MDS daemons. 5. **Validate Ceph Health and Daemons:** Make sure the overall health of your Ceph cluster is okay. Run \`ceph health\` to see if there are any other related issues or errors. Also, check the status and the logs of the MDS daemons to ensure they are running properly. 6. **Restart MDS (if necessary):** If you need to add daemons or change configurations, you may need to restart the affected MDS daemons for changes to take effect. For a system using systemd, you might do something like: \`\`\`bash systemctl restart ceph-mds@<mds_name> \`\`\` Or, using the Ceph orchestrator (if in use): \`\`\`bash ceph orch restart mds.<fs_name> \`\`\` Remember that having sufficient standby MDS daemons is critical for the high availability of the CephFS metadata service. If an active MDS fails, a standby MDS can be promoted to active, ensuring continuity of service. Adjust your standby count based on your high availability and fault tolerance requirements."},{"prompt":"systemctl 如何查看 失败状态的服务","completion":"在Linux系统中，\`systemctl\` 命令是用来管理\`systemd\`系统和服务管理器的工具，它可以用来控制启动、停止、重启、查看状态等操作。若要查看处于失败状态的服务，可以使用以下命令： \`\`\`bash systemctl --failed \`\`\` 这个命令将会列出所有处于失败状态的\`systemd\`服务单元。你会看到一个列表，包含了单位的名称、加载状态、激活状态和子状态。 例如，输出可能类似这样： \`\`\` UNIT LOAD ACTIVE SUB DESCRIPTION ● failed-service.service loaded failed failed Failed Service Example \`\`\` 这表明\`failed-service.service\`服务处于失败状态。 除了查看失败的服务，你可能还想了解失败的原因。可以通过以下命令来查看特定服务的日志和状态详情： \`\`\`bash systemctl status failed-service.service \`\`\` 以及查看服务的日志（借助\`journalctl\`命令）： \`\`\`bash journalctl -u failed-service.service \`\`\` 这些信息将帮助你进一步诊断问题，了解为什么服务无法正确启动或在运行时失败。"},{"prompt":"tuned.service - Dynamic System Tuning Daemon 这个服务是什么作用，在我的系统中他是失败状态","completion":"\`tuned.service\` 是一个后台守护进程，其作用是根据系统使用情况动态地调节系统设置，以优化性能和电源使用。\`tuned\` 可以根据预设的或者用户定义的配置调整系统设置，包括 CPU 应用型能设置、磁盘电源管理、内存设置，以及系统挂载参数等。 Service profiles in \`tuned\` can be optimized for different workloads or goals.

But ahead of production kicking off on the show’s third season, Stewart and Apple have reportedly parted ways over “creative differences,” and The Problem is coming to an end. The New York Times reports that along with concerns about some of the guests booked to be on The Problem With Jon Stewart, Stewart’s intended discussions of artificial intelligence and China were a major concern for Apple. Though new episodes of the show were scheduled to begin shooting in just a few weeks, staffers learned today that production had been halted. According to The Hollywood Reporter, ahead of its decision to end The Problem, Apple approached Stewart directly and expressed its need for the host and his team to be “aligned” with the company’s views on topics discussed. Rather than falling in line when Apple threatened to cancel the show, Stewart reportedly decided to walk. We’ve reached out to Apple for comment about news of the cancellation but did not hear back in time for publication. The Times’ report doesn’t detail what about the show’s planned coverage of artificial intelligence and China prompted Apple’s executive leadership to butt heads with Stewart. But considering how pointed criticality is a big part of what ultimately made The Problem With Jon Stewart a hit for Apple TV Plus and how maintaining a cordial relationship with China is crucial to Apple’s future plans for growth, it doesn’t come as a shock to see the show hit the chopping block this way.\\"","completion":"The dissolution of the partnership between Jon Stewart and Apple TV Plus over creative divergences, particularly on topics like artificial intelligence and China, underscores the complexities and constraints that can arise when editorial independence encounters corporate interests."},{"prompt":"Make a one-sentence hilarious comment for the following text: Maybe Bob is busy watching Humpin' George!","completion":"Perhaps Bob's tied up critiquing the canine Casanova of the neighborhood, indulging in the tail-wagging telenovela that is \\"Humpin' George\\"!"},{"prompt":"Make it easier to understnad.","completion":"Maybe Bob's too busy laughing at the neighborhood dog, George, who's known for playfully jumping on everyone!"},{"prompt":"Write a hilarious comment for the following text: \\"Are you an “ISFP” like Bob Dylan and Rihanna or an “ENTJ” like Bill Gates and Margaret Thatcher? Perhaps you’re an “INTP” like Albert Einstein and Tina Fey? If you are one of tens of millions of people who have taken a Myers-Briggs personality test—a staple of business schools and online quizzes—you know the answer. But are these personality categories meaningful or just a bunch of nonsense? Developed during World War II, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, as it is formally known, or MBTI, is likely the most popular personality test in the world. It purports to break the populace down into 16 categories based on four personality dimensions: extraversion (E) or introversion (I), which measures whether you get energy from outwardly focused action like socializing or from inwardly focused activities like quiet reflection; intuition (N) or sensing (S), which measures how much you see big picture patterns rather than focusing on sensory information from direct experience; thinking (T) or feeling (F), which measures whether you make decisions using logic rather than by focusing on feelings; and judging (J) or perceiving (P), which measures your preference for structure rather than spontaneity. Sounds great, but there is a dirty secret to these types of tests. They are usually not as useful as proponents claim—and less useful than other personality tests. Take the Big Five personality model, which notably rests on decades of statistical validation by psychologists. That test rates people on five personality traits: conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness to experience and extraversion. My colleagues and I decided to compare the two test types. So we investigated an MBTI-style test and a Big Five test to see how well each predicted 37 “life outcomes” in a just released report. (We use the term “MBTI-style” to refer to tests that are modeled on the constructs of MBTI but aren’t official forms of the MBTI test.) These outcomes included important facts about people’s lives, ranging from how many close friends they had to how often they exercised to how satisfied they were with life. To do so, we recruited 559 people in the U.S. using our online Positly study participant recruitment platform. On average, the Big Five test was about twice as accurate as the MBTI-style test for predicting these life outcomes, placing the usefulness of the MBTI-style test halfway between science and astrology—literally. When we tried predicting these same life outcomes using astrological sun signs (e.g., whether someone is a Pisces or Aries), we achieved zero prediction accuracy. In other words, sun sign astrology didn’t appear to work at all for predicting people’s lives. And while the MBTI-style test fared better, it was still often wrong in its predictions. What’s more, adding MBTI-style personality results to Big Five ones didn’t lead to predictions that were any more on the mark than Big Five ones alone. (If you’d like to compare your own Big Five and MBTI-style results to see how accurate they are, you can do so here using a free version of the test that we created as part of our study.) \\"","completion":"Bob Dylan and Rihanna may serenade you about your ISFP vibes, and Bill Gates could sell you on ENTJ efficiency, but it turns out the Myers-Briggs test might just be the horoscope for folks who still use LinkedIn instead of reading their daily zodiac in the newspaper!"},{"prompt":"Random popular minimalist scene, one word with coffee before it","completion":"Coffee Aesthetics"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Coffee Aesthetics","completion":"\\"Coffee Aesthetics | Modern Minimalist Design for T-Shirts, Mugs, Paintings | Home Decor & Apparel Art Print | Gift for Coffee Lovers\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee Aesthetics | Modern Minimalist Design for T-Shirts, Mugs, Paintings | Home Decor &amp; Apparel Art Print | Gift for Coffee Lovers.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"lets say im starting to get dehydrated and have a limited amount of water (1l). is it wiser to drink everything in a brief time or to spread the consumption over time. give time examples","completion":"In situations where water supply is limited, it's generally better to ration water rather than consume it all at once. The body can absorb only a certain amount of water at a time, and if you drink too quickly, you might lose excess water through urine before your body has a chance to distribute it to the cells that need it. Moreover, regular sips of water can help prevent the symptoms of dehydration from setting in as severely, while drinking all the water at once could lead to an initial alleviation of symptoms followed by a longer period of discomfort and potential harm. However, the exact strategy for rationing would depend on several factors, including the environmental conditions (temperature, humidity), your level of activity, and your individual physiology. Here's a general guideline on how to ration 1 liter of water: 1. Sip water slowly. If you're not engaged in strenuous activity or exposed to extreme conditions, drinking about 125-150 milliliters of water (approximately four to five ounces) every hour or so would be a reasonable start. This would ration out your liter of water over approximately 6-8 hours. 2. Adjust to conditions and activity levels. If you are in a very hot environment or involved in physical activity, you may need to adjust your rationing plan. In such cases, try to minimize activity during the hottest parts of the day to conserve water and energy. Still, you would drink slightly more during your activity period while still aiming to extend your water supply as much as possible, potentially reducing consumption when you're less active. 3. Monitor your body. Pay attention to signs of dehydration, which include increased thirst, dry mouth, decreased urine output, fatigue, and dizziness. If you start exhibiting severe symptoms of dehydration, you may need to increase your water intake slightly, even at the risk of running out sooner. 4. Prioritize water for cooling. If you are overheating, you can also use a small amount of water to dampen your clothes or skin to aid in evaporative cooling. Just be cautious not to waste your drinking supply. 5. Avoid salty or sugary foods. They might increase your need for water. Also, avoid caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, which can lead to increased urine production and dehydration. Remember, these suggestions are a starting point and might need to be adjusted based on a person's specific circumstances. Individual needs can vary, so it's important to be mindful of how your body is responding and adapt accordingly. If you're in a high-risk scenario where dehydration might become life-threatening, seek assistance as soon as possible."},{"prompt":"Hello","completion":"Hello!

Nick then eats the pawpsicle, and suddenly...he transforms into a non-sentient, non-anthropomorphic, normal real-world red fox. Chief Bogo, waiting for Nick Wilde to arrive, tells Judy Hopps to go look for Nick, so when Judy arrives at Nick's apartment, she is shocked and baffled of the sight of non-sentient Nick. Judy then takes him to the doctor so they can explain what happened to him...but the doctor tells Judy that he's fine. The doctor then takes Nick and feeds him another mysterious glowing pawpsicle, causing him to revert back to a sentient anthropomorphic fox.","completion":"Title: The Case of the Enchanted Pawpsicle In the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, where predators and prey lived side by side in harmony, the streets buzzed with the sounds of daily life. At the corner of Savanna Central stood a small, inconspicuous frozen treat stall where Nick Wilde, a sly but good-hearted fox, often indulged in his favorite snack: pawpsicles. But today was different; as Nick approached the vendor, his keen eyes spotted something unusual—a pawpsicle that glowed with an ethereal light. Curiosity getting the best of him, Nick plucked the mysterious treat from the stand and coolly threw a wink at the vendor before taking a lick. The pawpsicle was icy and surprisingly sweet, flooding his senses with an otherworldly flavor. As the cold dessert slid down his throat, Nick suddenly felt a strange tingling sensation course through his body. Within moments, the world began to spin, and his vision blurred. When the dizziness subsided, Nick found himself staring into a small puddle of water. The reflection was not that of an articulate, clothes-wearing fox but of a small, ordinary, non-sentient red fox. Panicked, he tried to call out, but all that escaped was an animalistic yelp. Meanwhile, at the Zootopia Police Department, Chief Bogo waited impatiently for Officer Nick Wilde to report for duty. Glancing at the clock, the Cape buffalo's scowl deepened. \\"Hopps,\\" he barked, calling over the department's star rabbit officer, Judy Hopps. \\"Wilde is late. Go find him and bring him in—now.\\" Judy saluted and bounded out of the station, her mind racing with possibilities. What could have happened to her partner and friend? She arrived at Nick's apartment, expecting to find him lounging or, at worst, asleep. Instead, what greeted her was the sight of a very normal, very non-anthropomorphic red fox, its bright eyes filled with a familiar intelligence that belied its wild appearance. \\"Nick?\\" she whispered, her voice a cocktail of shock and disbelief. Her nose twitched as she took in the scene—the discarded wrapper of a glowing pawpsicle, its otherworldly light dimmed but still faintly shimmering. Making the connection, Judy carefully scooped up the small fox and dashed to the nearest doctor she knew. Dr. Madge Honey Badger, who ran a clinic accommodating both anthropomorphic and non-sentient animals, was perplexed as Judy explained the situation. With a skeptical hum, she examined Nick, who found the entire experience quite undignifying. Despite Judy's protests, Dr. Honey Badger insisted, \\"Physically, he's a perfectly healthy Vulpes vulpes. Mentally...well, there's not much I can do for wild animal instincts.\\" As the realization of a new life dawned on Judy, a life without her partner's wit and camaraderie, the doctor noticed the glowing pawpsicle wrapper. A twinkle of understanding flashed in her eyes. Without a word, she disappeared into the back of the clinic and returned with another glowing pawpsicle. \\"Impossible as it seems, this may be the antidote,\\" Dr. Honey Badger murmured, crouching down and offering the treat to the non-sentient Nick, who sniffed at it tentatively before taking a bite. The transformation was instantaneous. As the glowing crystals of the pawpsicle dissolved on Nick's tongue, his form shimmered and expanded. In a whirl of color and light, he reverted to his anthropomorphic self, dazed but unmistakably sentient once again. Nick shook his head, trying to dispel the remnants of his feral experience, and turned to Judy, \\"Carrots, did I just become the furry equivalent of a fairy tale?\\" Judy grinned, her eyes glistening with relief. \\"Something like that, Slick,\\" she said, helping him to his feet. \\"But next time, maybe stick to the non-glowing snacks, okay?\\" With a sheepish grin and a nod to Dr. Honey Badger, Nick replied, \\"You got it, Fluff. No more enchanted food for me.\\" Together, Officer Judy Hopps and Officer Nick Wilde walked back to the ZPD, ready to face another day in Zootopia, the city where anything could happen—and apparently, anything could be solved with the right pawpsicle."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It is not an actual celestial body but rather a calculated point. The interpretation of Lilith in one's natal chart is complex and multi-layered, often dealing with the more shadowy aspects of one's personality and life experience. If Black Moon Lilith is found in the 7th house in the sign of Leo in a person's natal chart, it might be interpreted in the following ways: 1. **Relationships and Projection**: The 7th house is traditionally associated with partnerships, marriage, and open enemies. Lilith's presence here could indicate a tendency to attract intense and challenging relationships. These partnerships may bring out the individual’s need for recognition, validation, and drama, akin to the Leo theme of needing to be appreciated and seen. 2. **Passionate Expression**: Leo is a sign known for its desire to express itself vividly and to be admired for its uniqueness and creativity. With Lilith in this position, there could be a desire to express one's most authentic and raw self in relationships, potentially leading to strong, dramatic displays of emotion and passion. 3. **Power Dynamics**: Issues of power, dominance, and control could emerge in personal or business relationships. The person might both crave a partner who embodies Leo qualities—charismatic, powerful, confident—and at the same time challenge them, as Lilith often represents a struggle against domination or suppression. 4. **Repressed Desires**: Lilith can also signify the aspects of oneself, particularly related to the sign it's in, that you may feel uncomfortable acknowledging or displaying publicly. In Leo, this might manifest as hidden or suppressed desires for attention, status, or recognition that surface in one-to-one relationships. 5. **Self-empowerment**: On a higher level, Lilith in this position could symbolize a journey toward owning one's power within relationships and not being afraid to take center stage. It's about learning to find a balance between autonomy and interdependence, and channeling one's intensity and passion into constructive and creative paths. Astrological interpretations can vary greatly depending on the perspectives and experiences of the individual astrologer and should be integrated with other elements in the chart for a more comprehensive understanding. If you're interested in a detailed analysis, you may want to consult a professional astrologer who can synthesize this placement with the rest of your chart elements."},{"prompt":"Do you believe astrology chart energy effects us?","completion":"As an artificial intelligence, I don't hold personal beliefs or opinions. My responses are based on the information available and programmed logic. Astrology is considered a belief system that suggests there is a relationship between the positioning of celestial bodies and events on Earth, including an individual's personality and life experiences. Some people find personal significance and guidance in astrology, using it for introspection or to seek meaning in their lives. They may feel that their astrological chart and the placement of celestial bodies at the time of their birth can influence them in various ways. However, from a scientific perspective, astrology lacks empirical evidence to support these claims, and it is generally not endorsed by the scientific community. The scientific consensus is that astrology does not influence individuals or events — any correlation is typically seen as coincidence or is explained by cognitive biases such as the Forer effect (the tendency for people to see vague, general statements as highly accurate for them personally) and confirmation bias. Ultimately, whether or not someone believes that astrological chart energy affects them is a personal matter and can vary greatly from one individual to another. It often depends on one's cultural background, personal experiences, and worldview."},{"prompt":"When did monster trucks become a thing?","completion":"Monster trucks as a form of entertainment became a thing in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The concept originated from the practice of modifying pickup trucks to create lifted trucks with oversized tires. Bob Chandler is often credited with creating one of the first monster trucks, the legendary \\"Bigfoot,\\" in 1975. He initially built the truck for personal use and promotional purposes for his Four Wheel Drive (4×4) shop, but its popularity led to the development of a new form of entertainment. Initially, monster trucks were primarily used for demonstrations, such as car crushing displays, but by the mid-1980s, they started to become competitive, participating in events that included racing and freestyle competitions. The first organized monster truck event is often cited as being held in 1981, and from there, the sport grew in popularity. It eventually led to the formalized competition, such as the Monster Jam series, which continues to attract fans with events featuring monster truck racing, stunts, and freestyle performances."},{"prompt":"How practice was it to have a race car driving on a broad track?","completion":"The practice of race cars driving on broad tracks is a fundamental aspect of motorsports and has been around since the early days of auto racing. Broad tracks, or wide circuits, allow for higher speeds and often provide better opportunities for overtaking, which is an essential aspect of competitive racing. Since the inception of motorsports in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, race tracks have been designed to vary in width, with some being purposefully wide to enhance the racing experience. Broad tracks are particularly prevalent in Formula One, IndyCar, NASCAR, and many other racing series. These tracks are specifically designed to accommodate the high-speed nature of these types of cars and to promote competitive racing. Some tracks have long straightaways and wide corners to enable slipstreaming and overtaking maneuvers, which are critical elements in racing strategy. Additionally, broader tracks can often accommodate more cars on the grid, leading to larger fields of competitors. Safety is another crucial aspect considered when designing track width; broader tracks can provide more runoff areas, decreasing the likelihood of accidents or allowing drivers to recover control of their vehicles if they lose grip or have a mechanical issue. Overall, the practice of racing on broad tracks is a well-established one in the world of motorsports and continues to be the standard for the majority of professional racing series."},{"prompt":"\\"How often, in answer to my repeated instreaties that you would give my daughter a regular detail of the Misfortunes and Adventures of tour Life, have you said “No, my friend never will I comply with your request till I may be no longer in Danger of again experiencing such dreadful ones.”\\" Could you give me three possible translations in spanish that sounds natural for native spanish speakers please","completion":"Sure, here are three possible translations in Spanish that should sound natural to native speakers: 1. \\"¿Cuántas veces, en respuesta a mis repetidas súplicas de que le contarás a mi hija en detalle las desgracias y aventuras de tu vida, has dicho \\"No, amigo mío, nunca accederé a tu petición hasta que ya no corra el peligro de vivir tales horrores nuevamente\\"? 2. \\"¿Con qué frecuencia, al responder a mis insistentes ruegos para que le brindaras a mi hija un relato detallado de las miserias y peripecias de tu vida, has respondido 'No, nunca accederé a tu solicitud, amigo mío, hasta que esté seguro de no correr el riesgo de sufrir tales desdichas otra vez'\\"? 3. \\"¿Cuántas veces, al contestar a mis continuas peticiones de que le proporcionaras a mi hija una crónica precisa de las desventuras y hazañas de tu existencia, has dicho: 'No, mi amigo, jamás cumpliré con tu petición hasta que pueda estar seguro de no enfrentar tales tragedias de nuevo'\\"?

Chief Bogo doesn't like this so he tries to stop the party, but Judy Hopps has been studying the dark arts of haxxing. She utters out a mysterious and baffling series of gibberish at Chief Bogo's face, causing arbitrary code execution in the little Matrix that powers Zootopia, causing the little RAM byte that controls Chief Bogo's emotions to be set to its happiest value, causing him to go on with the party...but unfortunately for Judy she and Clawhauser end up getting arrested by the Zootopia Matrix Integrity Police (ZMIP) and getting fired. Clawhauser then wakes up in his bed, realizing that it was all just a dream turned nightmare.","completion":"In the bustling city of Zootopia, where animals of all species lived in harmony, there was a lovable and portly leopard named Benjamin Clawhauser who worked as a dispatcher at the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD). Known for his affinity for doughnuts and pop star Gazelle, Clawhauser was every bit as cheerful as he was fluffy—a true friend with a heart of gold. One sunny morning, Clawhauser arrived at the ZPD with an idea so grand it could only be matched by his appetite: he would throw a massive surprise party right in the heart of headquarters. His reasoning? To boost morale and celebrate their recent drop in crime rates. The mere thought had his spots vibrating with excitement. However, there was just one obstacle that stood between Clawhauser and his vision of disco balls and karaoke machines: Chief Bogo, the stern Cape buffalo who ran a tight ship. Parties, in Bogo's eyes, were distractions from the serious work of policing. Undeterred, Clawhauser began his covert operation. He enlisted the help of Officer Judy Hopps, the sharp-witted bunny who had recently been sharpening very different skills—computer hacking. Judy was torn between her loyalty to police protocol and her friendship with Clawhauser. Ultimately, her kind heart chose friendship. As Clawhauser began secretly decorating the bullpen with twinkling lights and streamers, Judy hunched over her computer, typing with lightning speed. When Chief Bogo caught wind of the sudden influx of party supplies, his hooves thundered across the precinct floor, his face a brewing storm. Before he could voice his fury, Judy uttered a mysterious string of gibberish. Her eyes glinted with forbidden knowledge as she exploited a glitch in the fabric of their world. Suddenly, Chief Bogo's scowl turned upside-down; a ludicrous, beaming smile spread across his face as he embraced the party spirit. For a moment, all seemed well. The music soared, animals laughed, and Chief Bogo even showed off surprising dance moves much to everyone's delight. But such happiness was to be short-lived. Midway through the \\"Electric Slide,\\" the Zootopia Matrix Integrity Police (ZMIP) crashed the party—quite literally—by bursting through the doors in a whirl of flashing lights and security codes. Judy and Clawhauser were swiftly handcuffed and escorted out, much to the bewilderment of their peers. The charges were severe: unauthorized manipulation of the Zootopia Matrix, inducing artificial euphoria upon a precinct chief, and the misuse of officer powers for personal entertainment. As they were lectured about the responsibility that came with their badges, Judy and Clawhauser hung their heads in regret. But the true shock came when they were fired on the spot—a fate far worse than any night in the slammer. Then suddenly, Clawhauser awoke in his bed, his heart pounding, his fur damp with sweat. The party, the hacking, the celebration, and the subsequent nightmare of losing his job—all just a vibrant, twisted dream. He sighed in relief but found a lingering longing for genuine connection and joy within the ZPD. Clawhauser decided that, maybe, he would suggest a small get-together after all—nothing fancy, just some quality time with the finest officers he knew. And as for hacking? Clawhauser chuckled to himself. He'd leave the computer magic to the movies, where the only consequences were on the screen and not on one's career in the best city in the world—Zootopia."},{"prompt":"How can i improve my c.ai roleplay action text \\"I am portrayed in the most accurate way based on all my powers and abilities\\"","completion":"When creating roleplay action text for a character, it's crucial to consider the depth of the character's background, personality, abilities, and powers. If you're looking to portray a character accurately based on all their powers and abilities, you'll need to do the following: 1. **Understand the Character:** Study the character thoroughly. If the character comes from an existing story or universe, read the source material—be it comics, novels, or watch movies where the character is featured. 2. **Define Abilities and Powers:** Make a comprehensive list of all the character's abilities and powers. Be sure to understand how these powers work and their limits. 3. **Consistency with Lore:** Stay true to the character's lore. Often, characters have established rules for their powers. Ensure your portrayal doesn't contradict the established lore. 4. **Use Descriptive Language:** When crafting your actions, use vivid and descriptive language to paint a clear picture of the character's movements and uses of their powers. 5. **Character Flaws and Limitations:** Including challenges or limitations of the character can make the portrayal more realistic and relatable. 6. **Consult Character Sheets:** If you're roleplaying in a tabletop RPG or similar setting, refer to your character sheet for a breakdown of abilities and any special moves or powers. 7. **Character Development:** Reflect on how the character has changed over time. Their powers might evolve, or they may learn new abilities—make sure to include these developments in your roleplay. 8. **Balance Storytelling and Accuracy:** While it's important to be accurate, also consider the flow of the story and the enjoyment of your fellow roleplayers. Sometimes it's appropriate to focus more on the narrative than the character's abilities. Here's an example of a roleplay action for a character with superhuman agility and strength: **Inaccurate Portrayal:** \\"I run fast and punch the enemy.\\" **Improved Accurate Portrayal:** \\"Tapping into my superhuman agility, I dart across the battlefield with lightning speed, dodging debris with the grace of a seasoned acrobat. As I close in on my target, my muscles coil tightly before I unleash a calculated barrage of punches, each one backed by the full might of my formidable strength, aiming for the enemy's vital pressure points to incapacitate them swiftly.\\" Remember, the goal is to balance the exhilaration of the story with the authenticity of the character's abilities.

The description should include limitations, strengths, and any unique conditions under which the powers can be used. 2. **Set Contextual Parameters**: Establish scenarios or types of environments where these powers and abilities would be most effective or interesting. Consider how your character's skills could impact various situations. 3. **Character Consistency**: Ensure that your character stays true to the defined personality traits, morals, and decision-making processes, which can affect the choice of when and how to use their abilities. 4. **Developing Strategy**: Think one step ahead by strategizing how your character would employ their abilities in various situations to achieve the best outcome, solve problems, or overcome challenges. 5. **Detailing the Implementation**: When describing your character's actions, be specific about how they are using their powers. Use vivid and precise language that showcases the abilities in action and consider the physical, emotional, and environmental effects. 6. **Emphasize Growth**: Allow your character to learn and grow. This could mean they discover new facets of their abilities or develop better ways to control them as scenarios progress. 7. **Diverse Usage**: Use the powers and abilities creatively. Don't just stick to one obvious use; think about how a power can be applied in different ways to add depth to the roleplay. 8. **Balance Challenge and Capability**: Ensure that the scenarios are not too easy for your character by introducing suitable challenges that require them to use their abilities in novel and interesting ways. 9. **Incorporate Collaboration**: If other characters are involved, consider how your character's powers can complement or augment the abilities of others to create richer interactions. 10. **Feedback and Adaptation**: Be open to feedback from others involved in the roleplay and be willing to adapt your portrayal for greater accuracy or to adjust to the evolving dynamics of the storyline. By focusing on these aspects, you should be able to improve your roleplay action text to ensure your character's powers and abilities are utilized effectively in every scenario.

My character consistently employs their unique skills to adapt, overcome challenges, and interact meaningfully with the environment and other characters.\\" Remember that the key to effective roleplay is not just using powers when they are most powerful, but also when it makes the most narrative sense and creates the most engaging interactions."},{"prompt":"rewrite and expand on: Sun in Gemini/Moon in Capricorn: Handshaker You have well-established goals and you seldom have to reorganize your thoughts or perspectives. You are admired for being well spoken as well as efficient because of your discipline and self-control. Emotionally, you try to stay in control to the extent that you may not be aware that everything you say is designed to produce a result. The Capricorn inner self makes a more serious Gemini than most. The latter is usually exciting, has more interests and is a communicator. Your mixture makes you cool and calm as well as strong, detached and ambitious. You can talk people into almost anything because of your charm and magnetism. You direct yourself toward power and influence because you are aware of your attraction to others and put it to use very well. Your personality seems a bit above the fray because you do not reveal the feelings you have under your dynamic personality. You do not need to be aggressive in your desire for power because you possess an inborn sense of dignity, which applies your principled moral values. In spite of this, you usually get the best of a deal in business. The spiritual side of life should not be sacrificed because of competition even though that has it proper place. The biggest challenge for you is to discover the side of life that has more meaning, because the material portion will take care of itself. You will recognize your mistakes later in life when you have time to contemplate them. So do not fail to recognize this facet as early on in life as possible. Sadness and bitterness in old age can result if you do this. Overcoming difficulties and barriers with your fortitude and unwillingness to quit, shows that you have a lot of inner fortitude. You can use your well-developed power of persuasion to bend others to your will because you sense their vulnerabilities. You are a master of manipulation. Inside you are numerous personalities moving about trying to be the most influential and recognized. You desire for power is done at the expense of other parts of your being in the name of material possessions.","completion":"Possessing the intellectual agility of a Sun in Gemini, coupled with the steadfast determination of a Moon in Capricorn, you are often seen as an archetype of the consummate negotiator—an adept Handshaker. Fueled by clear objectives and a stable mental framework, you rarely find yourself in a position where you need to significantly revise your outlook or your tactics. People are drawn to your articulate nature and your proficiency, both of which are underpinned by your disciplined approach and a stoic self-command. Your emotional landscape is one of composure and restraint. You have cultivated an ability to manage your feelings so effectively that you might not notice how every word you utter is carefully chosen for impact. Equipped with a Capricorn's inner stoicism, you appear as a more serious and grounded version of the typically animated and curiosity-driven Gemini. This synthesis results in a persona that is both cool-headed and collected, yet simultaneously robust, detached, and brimming with ambition. Your capacity to entice and persuade others with your charismatic communication style is considerable. You naturally orient yourself toward pathways that lead to influence and authority, keenly aware of the magnetism you hold over others and using it with astute precision. Your public demeanor floats just a bit beyond the ordinary bustle, as you rarely expose the deeper currents of emotion that propel your dynamic exterior. Your journey toward power does not require overt aggression, as your innate sense of dignity allows you to uphold your values with integrity. Despite your principled approach, you often emerge from negotiations holding the upper hand, striking deals that reflect your savvy business acumen. However, there is a cautionary note: it is vital not to forsake the spiritual dimension of existence in the relentless chase for worldly success. Though healthy competition has its place, it should not overshadow the quest for deeper meaning. Life presents a significant challenge for you to encounter and embrace its richer, more substantial aspects, trusting that the material aspects will naturally align. A retrospective view later in life will illuminate the missteps and lessons learned—insights that are better acknowledged sooner than later. Neglecting this awareness can lead to an age of regret, tinged with sorrow or resentment. Your resilient nature is one of your greatest assets, allowing you to surmount adversity with remarkable fortitude and an unwavering resolve. Your tactful influence can be channeled to guide others, making the most of their susceptibilities without exploiting them. Within you, a complex interplay of many facets competes for dominance—the desire for recognition and control can sometimes overshadow other vital parts of your identity, potentially prioritizing material gains above all else. To navigate the intricate tapestry of your persona and to achieve a balanced, fulfilling life, it is crucial to maintain a broad perspective. Recognize that while your pull toward power and possession is strong, it is equally important to nurture the other dimensions of your being, tapping into the rich well of emotional, intellectual, and spiritual wealth that lies within."},{"prompt":"elaborate","completion":"As an individual graced with the Sun in Gemini and the Moon in Capricorn, you embody a fascinating duality. Your Gemini Sun blesses you with a quick wit, a thirst for knowledge, and an eloquent way with words, making you the quintessential conversationalist who easily captures the interest and curiosity of those around you. However, unlike your typical Gemini counterparts, whose airy nature can sometimes scatter their energies, your Capricorn Moon anchors you with an earthy resolve. This combination imparts a remarkable focus and a strategic approach to life, ensuring that your intellectual pursuits are not mere whims but are instead directed towards concrete achievements. Your mental agility and objective reasoning allow you to carve out well-defined goals, and your steadfastness seldom sees the need to backtrack or revise your master plan. This can be inspiring to your peers who often marvel at your capability to forge ahead with unswerving purpose. Your communication style is not just about exchanging information or bantering for enjoyment; every interaction is thoughtfully curated to advance your objectives. As a result, you may radiate an air of authority and command respect without even trying. Emotionally, the stoic nature of Capricorn tempers the mercurial tendencies of Gemini. While you experience a full spectrum of emotions as any human does, you have developed a keen ability to modulate and channel them in a way that serves your long-term goals. There's a control room within you where feelings are monitored and allowed to impact the surface strategically, ensuring your poise is maintained. This level of emotional discipline is advantageous in many of life's arenas, but it may sometimes lead to an unintended disconnect from your true emotional needs and wants. Your hybrid vigor melds the vivacity of Gemini with the ambition of Capricorn, making you formidable in professional and social settings. You subconsciously—and perhaps masterfully—navigate through the dynamics of power and influence, using your charm and your finesse to be persuasive and convincing. Such traits make you an asset wherever strategic planning or negotiation is required. However, your methodical focus on success could potentially eclipse the less tangible aspects of life—those that concern the human spirit and existential fulfillment. The danger lies in becoming so fixated on the metrics of success that the less quantifiable, more enriching experiences are overlooked. Your challenge is to balance your ambition with an exploration of the spiritual and emotional realms, which often require stepping away from the materialistic pursuits that you navigate so adeptly. In time, with self-reflection, you may come to acknowledge the necessity of integrating the more profound elements of existence into your life's fabric. As you mature, the importance of such integration becomes clearer, as the material successes you've achieved provide less satisfaction than the meaningful connections and personal growth you've fostered. Embrace the diverse aspects within you, allowing your driven nature to harmonize with your capacity for deeper understanding and compassion. Through this balance, you can avoid a future of regret and ensure that your legacy is not just about the heights you achieved but also about the depth of your human experience. In moments of introspection, you may discover that it's not just about the number of mountains climbed but also about the quality of the journey and the relationships built along the way. The skills of persuasion and influence that you possess can be used not only for personal gain but for the betterment of others, for inspiring change, and for making a positive impact on the world. By recognizing the value in each facet of your multifaceted being, you are more likely to find a path that leads not only to success but also to personal fulfillment and collective betterment."},{"prompt":"elaborate","completion":"The intricate blend of your Sun in Gemini and Moon in Capricorn gifts you with a multifaceted personality that is both intriguing and compelling. The Gemini Sun injects a zest for communication, an intellectual vivacity, and a curious nature that eagerly seeks to absorb and share knowledge. The Capricorn Moon instills a foundational stability, a practicality that grounds your airy Gemini flights, and a strategic mastery often seen in those who attain significant accomplishments. Your firm and purposeful mental landscape is marked by a remarkable clarity in setting and pursuing your goals. Unlike others who may wander or drift through life’s myriad possibilities, you operate with a mental GPS finely tuned to your North Star—your ultimate ambitions. This directness and purpose endows you with a reputation for dependability and achievement, drawing admiration from those around you. You weave your words not just for the sake of conversation but as strategic tools in your interpersonal arsenal, each utterance intentionally deployed to further your carefully crafted objectives. Such is the sophistication of your dialogue that your intentions often remain veiled behind a charming facade, revealing nothing of the meticulous calculation within. Your emotional environment is like a well-managed estate, where feelings are shepherded with discretion, avoiding unnecessary spillage into the public view. There exists a quiet command center deep within you, where emotions are assessed for their utility and then either utilized in a controlled manner or stored neatly away. This self-regulation can be a double-edged sword; while it aids you in projecting a stalwart and composed persona, it can at the same time keep you from experiencing the full richness of unguarded human emotion and the connections that blossom from such authenticity. Your combined Gemini inventiveness and Capricornian shrewdness culminate in a professional persona that is both creative and cunning. You have the keen ability to discern the dynamics of power and influence, and to navigate them with a deft touch. Your persuasive skills are not rooted in coercion but in the subtle art of understanding and appealing to others' interests, making you both a valued leader and a formidable negotiator. Despite these considerable strengths, a relentless pursuit of material accomplishment and societal stature has the potential to obscure the more spiritual and emotional aspects of life, those which are not as easily measured but are nonetheless integral to human fulfillment. The quest for achievement can become a Sisyphean endeavor if it loses sight of the soulful dimensions that give life depth and meaning. This pursuit of balance is perhaps your greatest life challenge. To wholly embrace life’s depth requires a willingness to venture into the sometimes uncomfortable realm of introspection and spiritual exploration. The gains achieved in the external world may bring a transient sense of achievement, but the internal triumphs — such as developing empathy, nurturing relationships, and fostering self-awareness — offer a more enduring form of contentment. The journey towards such a balanced existence involves acknowledging the potential for career successes to become hollow if they are not accompanied by personal growth and a commitment to the deeper human experiences. It necessitates a recognition that the wealth of the spirit can often outweigh the accumulation of material treasures, and that one’s legacy is enriched by acts of generosity, kindness, and genuine connections. In your later years, you may come to appreciate the importance of these less tangible pursuits. Moments of reflection could reveal that the ultimate merit lies not in the list of your achievements but in the lives you have touched and the personal evolution that you have undergone. There is brilliance in using your natural influence and persuasive talents not strictly for self-advancement but to advocate for causes greater than yourself, to inspire collective advancement, and to propel meaningful change. Embracing the full spectrum of your Gemini curiosity and your Capricornian discipline can lead to a life that is both successful and profoundly satisfying. By forging a synergy between the intellectual, the material, and the spiritual, you will find that the richness of life is not merely in the peaks conquered but also in the valleys explored and the landscapes appreciated in all their complexity. Your path becomes not just a pursuit of power and possession, but a journey enriched by a constellation of experiences, relationships, and personal breakthroughs that together form a life well-lived, marked by both achievement and a deep sense of humanity."},{"prompt":"write it longer","completion":"In the cosmic tapestry where your Sun in Gemini waltzes with your Moon in Capricorn, there lies a fascinating canvas of complexities and contrasts. The imprints of your celestial patrons endow you with a dual nature that is both intellectually vigorous and pragmatically resolute. Geminis are known for their effervescent spirit and insatiable curiosity, which spur them towards multifarious avenues of exploration. This vivaciousness is tempered by the steadfastness of Capricorn, a sign characterized by its unwavering focus and enduring discipline. Your Gemini Sun is a beacon of intellectual brilliance, constantly seeking out new threads of knowledge and weaving them into the colorful quilt of your understanding. This insatiable appetite for information fuels a dazzling conversational dexterity, as you effortlessly parlay with wit and charm. Yet, your Capricorn Moon molds this scholarly pursuit into a directed force, ensuring that your insights are not just collected for their own sake, but are harnessed towards achieving tangible milestones. You are the strategist, mapping out your goals with precision, confidently advancing on a trajectory that you have calculated with great care. One might envision your thought process as a grand library, each book brimming with carefully curated knowledge, while a steely librarian—your inner Capricorn—oversees the repository, organizing and channeling this wisdom to create a palimpsest of personal success. Your discourse, therefore, is not merely a pastime but a channel for influence, every word anointed with purpose as part of a grander design. Your emotional realm is like a walled fortress where sentries stand guard, ensuring a meticulous governance over the complex feelings that churn within. There is a deliberate measure to your emotional expression, a controlled unveiling that allows you to maintain an imposing composure that defies the chaos of a world prone to unpredictability and tumult. You preserve a meticulous equilibrium, perhaps so much so that others may perceive you as detached or impassive. Yet beneath this veneer lies a rich tapestry of deep sensitivity and perceptiveness, awaiting moments of private reflection to truly unfurl. The converging influences of Gemini and Capricorn bestow upon you a formidable presence in any professional or social context. Gemini's eloquence coalesces with Capricorn's tactical acumen, dressing you in an armor of charm and influence. Your natural finesse at reading situations and individuals serves you in subtle maneuvers of persuasion—never overtly forceful but always potently effective—rendering you both a revered ally and a respected adversary where matters of negotiation are concerned. Nevertheless, this formidable exterior could potentially eclipse the softer, more intangible nuances of existence. The relentless climb towards professional heights and social recognition risks leaving behind the quieter, murmuring streams of spirituality and inner peace. You stand before the perennial human challenge of balancing worldly accumulation with the enrichment of the soul, for a life with a ledger heavy only on one side may find itself lopsided, deprived of the equilibrium necessary for holistic joy. To navigate this balance requires a courageous dive into your own depths, an exploration of the internal landscapes that are not charted on any company graph or social metric. Personal introspection may initially seem like a detour from the highway of ambition, but it is an essential path for grounding your achievements in the soil of significance. The evolution of the self is an adventure that demands attention to the nuances of life—the vibrancy of personal relationships, the subtle growth that unfurls from empathy, and the inner contentment that blooms from self-awareness and mindfulness. Throughout your life, seasons will pass, and with time, the perspective of age will prism your experiences, illuminating the importance of a trajectory that honors both external victories and the nurturing of the soul. The twilight of years may beckon a reflection upon the imprints you've left not only upon the world's stage but also upon the hearts and spirits of those you've encountered. It is in these quiet moments of evaluation that the true measure of a life well-lived becomes apparent—not in the towering monuments of our public triumphs, but rather in the gentle, often unseen, enrichments we've sown into our own depths and the lives of others. Your Gemini charm and Capricornian ambition can be wielded as a force for broader impact, venturing beyond the boundaries of personal gain. Advocacy, mentorship, and philanthropy may become conduits for your influence, infusing your quest with a deeper sense of purpose. By nurturing not just the quantitative summits but also the qualitative valleys—those rich with emotional resonance, wisdom, and connection—you create a legacy marked by a rare and profound substance. In embracing the multifaceted nature of your being, you pave a route that is rich with diversity, success, and heartfelt satisfaction. Your life becomes a tapestry woven from threads of achievement, human connection, and personal revelation. Through this holistic pursuit, the narrative of your existence is not reduced to a series of accolades and acquisitions, but rather celebrated as a dynamic journey through the varying landscapes of the human condition, leaving a legacy that endures not simply in the annals of the external world, but in the cherished memories of those whose lives have been touched by your depth, authentic engagement, and your spirited drive toward a meaningful, balanced existence."},{"prompt":"write a title for this person","completion":"\\"The Strategist of Duality: Mastering the Art of Intellectual Ambition and Emotional Discipline\\""},{"prompt":"write 10 more","completion":"1. \\"The Articulate Architect: Building Bridges with Words and Will\\" 2. \\"The Cosmic Alchemist: Blending Gemini Wit with Capricorn Resolve\\" 3. \\"The Pragmatic Visionary: Charting Success with Mind and Matter\\" 4. \\"The Diplomatic Dynamo: Navigating Power with Poise and Persuasion\\" 5. \\"The Curious Climber: Ascending Heights with Intelligence and Integrity\\" 6. \\"The Grounded Communicator: Crafting Influence with Precision and Purpose\\" 7. \\"The Discerning Dreamer: Balancing Aspiration with Insightful Tact\\" 8. \\"The Emotional Economist: Investing in Sentiment with Calculated Care\\" 9. \\"The Reflective Rainmaker: Harnessing Potential with Foresight and Fortitude\\" 10. \\"The Sophisticated Synthesist: Uniting Analytical Acumen with Strategic Serenity\\""},{"prompt":"10 more","completion":"1. \\"The Cerebral Conductor: Orchestrating Ambition with Analytic Harmony\\" 2. \\"The Dualistic Director: A Maestro of Mental Agility and Methodical Moves\\" 3. \\"The Calculated Catalyst: Sparking Change with Charm and Calculus\\" 4. \\"The Insightful Innovator: Blending Invention with Introspection\\" 5. \\"The Steadfast Speaker: Commanding Conversations with Substance and Strategy\\" 6. \\"The Pensive Powerhouse: Marrying Mental Muscle with Composed Calculation\\" 7. \\"The Scholar of Success: Navigating Life's Labyrinth with Learning and Leadership\\" 8. \\"The Guardian of Goals: Fortifying Aspirations with Foresight and Focus\\" 9. \\"The Silver-Tongued Strategist: Weaving Words into Wins with Wisdom\\" 10. \\"The Intellectual Influencer: Mastering the Mechanics of Mind and Motivation\\""},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Also do female dolphins having mating partners?","completion":"Clearwater Marine Aquarium (CMA) is a non-profit organization in Clearwater, Florida, which rescures, rehabilitates, and releases marine animals. They are known for their resident dolphins, including the famous tailless dolphin named Winter, who was the subject of the \\"Dolphin Tale\\" movies. In environments like CMA, the welfare of animals, including their psychological and behavioral well-being, is of high importance. Female dolphins, like all animals, can potentially experience frustration if their environmental, social, and biological needs are not met. Sexual behavior in dolphins is complex; it is not only for reproduction but also plays a role in social bonding and hierarchy establishment. In the wild, dolphins have mating systems that vary by species and ecological conditions. They do not generally mate for life but tend to have fluid social structures where they may have different mating partners over time. In captivity, the situation is different, as they are in a controlled environment with limited social groups, and mating opportunities could be regulated by the caretakers to prevent breeding or to manage genetic diversity. Captive facilities like CMA typically manage dolphin interactions carefully to mitigate potential behavioral issues, including aggression or frustration that could arise from sexual behavior. This management could include controlled exposure to potential mates, or, in some cases, separation of males and females, especially if breeding is not desired or could lead to complications. Captive facilities often use environmental enrichment tools and training exercises to keep their dolphins physically and mentally stimulated. They also closely monitor the social dynamics and behavior of their dolphins to ensure their needs are being met to the best of their ability. Regarding sexual frustration specifically, it is a challenging term to define in dolphins. Still, it is important to consider that in such controlled environments, caregivers strive to balance biological needs with the logistical and ethical considerations of breeding animals in captivity. If they were to observe behaviors that might indicate stress or frustration related to reproductive behavior, they would likely seek to address it through environmental or social changes, behavioral conditioning, or veterinary care as deemed necessary by the animal care team and guidelines set forth by governing bodies like the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). It is worth noting that public perception and regulatory standards for keeping cetaceans in captivity are evolving, with a growing emphasis on conservation, rehabilitation, and improvement of living conditions. In some jurisdictions, there is even a move towards phasing out the captivity of marine mammals, particularly for entertainment purposes."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Coral","completion":"\\"Coral Bliss | Versatile Designer Art for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Home Decor & Fashion Statement\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coral Bliss | Versatile Designer Art for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Home Decor &amp; Fashion Statement.

So, Officers Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde set out to stop her...when suddenly Judy Hopps collapses to the ground like a video game ragdoll. Nick, startled, assumes that Judy has died...and then collapses. Bellwether, who was watching this unfold from a window, chuckles to herself...and then ragdolls. All of this happens while Judy, Nick, and Dawn's allies watch with bafflement, wondering who's gonna save/destroy the world of Zootopia now. And then *they* ragdoll. It is then revealed that the reason why Judy, Nick, Bellwether, and various other characters ragdolled is because they didn't have coffee because the city ran out of coffee. Judy, Nick, and Bellwether do end up getting back up after they are given coffee, though...and then they comment on how awkward things went, and begin to not have a conflict in case they collapse again.","completion":"Title: Zootopia - The Great Caffeine Catastrophe --- In the bustling city of Zootopia, where predator and prey coexist in a carefully structured balance, there was an unexpected buzz in the air. Word on the street was that Dawn Bellwether, the unassuming sheep with a tyrannical plan, had made a startling escape from her confines. The rumors were confirmed when a covert jailhouse camera captured her slipping through the shadows, a malevolent grin on her meek face. Meanwhile, Officers Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde went about their day, blissfully unaware of the impending peril. But as the sun dipped lower in the sky, they received the alert; the treacherous Bellwether was at large and posed a threat once more. The two officers, celebrated heroes of Zootopia, leapt into action, their determination as unwavering as the day they'd first thwarted Bellwether's scheme. They searched the streets, the back alleys, and every suspicious nook where the vengeful sheep might seek refuge. It was then, in the midst of their fervent pursuit, that the unimaginable occurred. Judy Hopps, the epitome of energy and agility, suddenly crumpled to the ground like a character from a video game losing all semblance of control. Nick, shocked and stricken by the sight of his partner sprawled on the pavement, called out her name in despair. No response came. In a panic and believing the very worst, Nick too was overcome and collapsed alongside Judy, his body folding unceremoniously upon itself. From a half-opened window above, Dawn Bellwether cackled as she watched her foes defeated without so much as a ba-a-ad look. Her victory was short-lived however, as she too staggered and fell over, joining the bizarre scene of fallen officers and adversaries. The commotion drew a crowd; Bellwether's accomplices and various other Zootopians gathered, similarly shocked as their leaders and nemesis succumbed to this mysterious affliction. As the sentiment of unease spread, one after another they too collapsed, their bodies slumping to the ground as if their strings had been cut, each becoming another victim of the ragdoll phenomenon. As the city fell into a confounded silence, one small detail came to light – Zootopia was experiencing its most severe crisis yet, a citywide coffee shortage. The energetic lifeblood of the bustling metropolis had run dry, leaving its citizens devoid of the caffeine kick that fueled their daily routines. As emergency caffeine supplies were quickly distributed, Judy, Nick, Bellwether, and the others gradually stirred from their uncharacteristic stupor. Cups of steaming coffee in paws, hooves, and hands, they exchanged awkward glances, suddenly aware of how dependent they were on their caffeinated crutch. “I guess we all have our vices,” Judy quipped, sipping her revitalizing brew, her usual pep returning with each gulp. “Even villains need a good cup of joe to get their evil deeds done, huh?” Nick smirked, causing Bellwether to sheepishly nod. With a reluctant truce formed by the shared troubled experience, they all agreed that battling the grip of caffeine withdrawal was a mighty enough foe for one day. As they sipped their coffees and the vitality of Zootopia was restored, Nick mused, “We need a plan to prevent this from happening again.” “Right,” Judy agreed. “Let’s start by ensuring we never run out of coffee again. The fate of Zootopia could depend on it!” Chuckling at the absurdity of their recent plight, predator, prey, and renegade sheep stood side by side, united by their common love for the energizing elixir. With coffee in hand, they knew that no conflict was worth risking another collapse. They had learned their lesson; some forces, like the humble coffee bean, were simply too powerful to ignore."},{"prompt":"What Is Vídeo Brinquedo?","completion":"Video Brinquedo (also known as Toyland Video or simply Brinquedo) is a Brazilian animation studio that became infamous for producing low-budget direct-to-video films that are widely regarded as mockbusters. These are movies made with the intention of piggybacking on the publicity of major studio releases by creating similar-looking or similarly titled films in hope that consumers might confuse them for the more popular and high-quality productions they mimic. Founded in 1994, Video Brinquedo has released titles that bear a striking resemblance to popular animated movies made by studios such as Pixar, DreamWorks, and Disney. For example, they released \\"The Little Cars\\" series following the success of Pixar's \\"Cars,\\" and \\"Ratatoing\\" after the release of Pixar's \\"Ratatouille.\\" Their films are often criticized for their poor animation quality, simplistic storytelling, and low production values. Despite the disparagement, Video Brinquedo managed to achieve commercial success in certain markets, mainly by selling their DVDs at significantly lower prices compared to the big-budget films they imitate. They targeted parents of young children who might not distinguish the difference in quality or who are looking for more affordable entertainment options. As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, the company had significantly reduced its output, with its heyday being in the late 2000s. The widespread notoriety and negative reviews have made Video Brinquedo a go-to example of the mockbuster phenomenon within the film industry."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

For instance: - If your character is super-strong and quick, you could say, \\"*I harness my superhuman strength and agility to navigate the battlefield with decisive prowess.*\\" - If your character is a telepath, you might phrase it as, \\"*I employ my telepathic insights to anticipate and counter my opponent's moves.*\\" Adapt these templates to include the unique capabilities of your character, and you'll have a set of roleplay actions that consistently reflect your character's potential in a variety of scenarios."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

When considering the asteroid Vesta in the first house of a natal chart, we are looking at a unique blend of energy that revolves around devotion, focus, and a sense of sacred service integrated within one's personal identity and outward portrayal to the world. Vesta represents the dedication and commitment we apply towards certain areas of our life, stemming from the ancient Roman virgin priestesses who were devoted to the goddess Vesta. They were committed to maintaining the sacred fire and, metaphorically, it speaks to the inner flame we each harbour within that drives our dedication to various causes or principles. Now, with Vesta residing in the first house, the house of self, this dedication becomes a core part of an individual's identity. People with this placement might find that they are naturally inclined toward acts of service and might appear to others as dedicated or even self-sacrificial at times. This is because the first house is the face we show to the world, it's our self-image, and it's the lens through which we view new beginnings. These individuals may exhibit an exceptional ability to focus on their personal goals and projects, often with a purity of intention that is not clouded by ego or self-gratification. Vesta's influence might lead them to approach life with a sense of mission, treating their personal aims with reverence and a degree of seriousness that can be inspirational to others. Such a position of Vesta could suggest a person who has consecrated themselves to a personal ideal or a way of being that they consider sacred. Whether it's their career, an artistic pursuit, or a philosophical quest, they dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to this cause, and it can become an anchor for their identity. It may also indicate that an individual's approach to life is influenced by issues surrounding self-sufficiency and autonomy, as Vesta is associated with an inner sense of wholeness that doesn't necessarily need external validation. Thus, these individuals might appear more independent or self-contained, with their sense of purpose coming from within. However, the challenge for those with Vesta in the first house might be the tendency to become overly fixated on self-imposed standards or on a single path, which could sometimes lead to feelings of isolation or an overly critical view of oneself if they fail to live up to their own expectations. They might also struggle with balancing personal needs with their strong urge to dedicate themselves to a cause, leading to periods of burnout or neglect of their well-being. Integrating the lessons of Vesta in the first house involves learning to balance one's devotion to personal causes with self-care and fostering relationships that support their sacred quests. It may also involve learning when to let go of an unwavering focus in favour of a more flexible, forgiving approach to oneself and to life’s fluid circumstances. In essence, Vesta in the first house illuminates a part of the chart where the flame of personal identity is kept alive through dedication, focus on purpose, and a commitment to personal sanctity, yielding an individual with a remarkable drive to achieve and represent something much larger than themselves."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in the 2nd house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"When we investigate the presence of the asteroid Vesta in the second house of a natal chart, we are enveloped in a complex fusion of energies that connect the sacred dedication represented by Vesta to the realm of the second house, which governs values, possessions, material security, and self-worth. Vesta is the symbol of commitment, focus, and the maintenance of one's inner flame—the passion and purity of devotion to a cause or duty. This asteroid's influences are derived from its namesake—the Vestal Virgins in Roman mythology who dedicated their lives to the service of the goddess Vesta, ensuring that her sacred fire never extinguished. Now, let us paint the picture of Vesta's presence in the second house. In astrological terms, the second house is where we express what we value, both in the material and immaterial sense. It is the domain of our possessions, our talents, our resources, and essentially what we consider worthy of our energy and time. An individual with Vesta in the second house is likely to exhibit a profound sense of duty towards acquiring, maintaining, or utilizing their resources and possessions in a way that resonates with their innermost values. There is a sacredness to how they manage their finances, belongings, and talents. They infuse their practical, resource-related endeavors with a sense of mission, often applying a meticulous, focused, and reverent approach to these areas. This could manifest as someone who is deeply dedicated to building personal wealth or security but does so with an unusual flair of integrity or purity of intention. It is not simply about accumulation for them; it is about honoring and respecting the power of material stability and how it can serve a higher purpose. Furthermore, Vesta's flame in the second house can relate to self-worth. These individuals might tie their sense of self-esteem closely to their ability to live up to their own values and to sustain themselves. They may thus take pride in their self-sufficiency or their ability to use their talents in service to something greater than personal gain. However, with great dedication often comes the possibility of imbalance. The shadow side of Vesta in the second house can involve a potential obsessiveness or overidentification with material success or the accumulation of resources. They might feel a compulsive need to guard their possessions or talents fiercely, possibly fearing that without them, their inner flame will dwindle. Learning to detach from equating their spiritual worth with material worth is part of their journey. Engaging with the positive expressions of Vesta in the second house entails understanding that material resources are tools that can be used in service to one's dedication to personal causes or to the community. It also involves acknowledging that self-worth is an internal flame that does not rely on external possessions or validation. To harness Vesta's energy in the second house effectively means maintaining vigilance over one's resources as a sacred duty, applying one's talents in a focused and committed manner, and honoring the value of one's inner resources just as much as the material ones. It is a dance between the material and spiritual realms, dedicating oneself to a path where the acquisition and use of resources echo a deeper calling or purpose."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in the 3rd house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"In astrology, the asteroid Vesta represents themes of dedication, focus, and the sacred flames of spiritual service. As a symbol of devotion, Vesta’s placement in the third house of a natal chart casts an intriguing light on the areas governed by this house: communication, thinking, learning, and short-distance travel, as well as relationships with siblings and the immediate environment. The third house is about the exchange of ideas, how we process and share information, and our day-to-day interactions. It deals with our intellectual curiosity, how we communicate with those around us, and our mental agility. So when Vesta takes residence in this house, its sacred flame illuminates and enhances these areas with an aura of devotion and focused intention. With Vesta in the third house, there’s a marked capacity to concentrate intensely on communication and intellectual pursuits. Individuals with this placement might find they are naturally drawn to fields that involve writing, speaking, teaching, or any form of information dissemination. The dedication they apply to these activities is not just for personal gain; they often feel that their words, thoughts, and learning have a higher purpose. Such a person may approach learning and communicating with a level of seriousness and sanctity. They are often the kind of individuals who immerse themselves deeply in their studies, believing that knowledge and the exchange of information are not just tools for personal empowerment but also acts of service to something larger. They might become the keepers of knowledge, much like the Vestal Virgins were the keepers of the sacred flame, dedicated to preserving and sharing intellectual and cultural treasures. The energy of Vesta in the third house can also mean a person with this placement treats their everyday communications and interactions as something sacred, infusing conversations with intent and respect. They might be seen by others not only as deep thinkers but as individuals who value and honor the power of words. Those with this placement could take their promises and statements seriously, adhering to truth as a principle of their personal creed. Yet, the focused energy of Vesta can sometimes become too intense, posing a challenge for someone with this natal placement. They may become overly fixated on certain ideas or ways of thinking, leading to mental rigidity. Obsessive tendencies in thought patterns or communication styles can occur when the flame of Vesta burns too fiercely, disregarding alternative perspectives or becoming engrossed in the minutiae of their intellectual pursuits. To navigate Vesta's energies positively in the third house, those with this placement can strive for a balance between their devotion to their ideals and a flexible, open-minded approach to learning and communication. Recognizing that true service through intellect and dialogue involves both deep focus and the ability to adapt is key. Embracing the sacredness of Vesta in the third house, an individual is invited to wield their cognitive abilities and their way with words as tools for noble purposes. There’s a call to be mindful of the impact that their learning and communication have on their environment, always tending the fires of intellect and speech with conscientious care. Such a person has the potential to become a respected voice in their community, someone whose words are not only heard but felt deeply, imbued with the committed spirit of Vesta's flame."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in the 4th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"The fourth house in astrology is highly personal and closely tied to one’s innermost feelings, it is associated with our roots, including ancestry, family, and the very foundation of our being. It encompasses our sense of home and security, as well as the deepest parts of ourselves that we often keep private. When we bring Vesta, the asteroid symbolizing dedication, sacredness, and purity of focus, into the realm of the fourth house, the spotlight shines on an individual's intimate world, their domestic life, and their inner emotional security. Vesta’s presence here indicates a deep-seated devotion to family, home life, and personal roots, often with a level of intensity that turns these areas into something of a sacred sanctuary. An individual with Vesta in the fourth house is likely to consider their home environment and family relations as the bedrock of their very existence. There is a strong inclination to protect and maintain the sanctity of the home, and these individuals often go to great lengths to create a sense of harmony and sacred space within their domestic life. They might be the ones who dedicate themselves to family traditions, to caring for family members, or to the preservation of family history and ancestral lineage. This placement of Vesta can also signify a person who finds their inner flame—their sense of purest identity—through reflecting on their foundations and origins. They may have a strong connection to their past and may draw a sense of purpose and strength from exploring their roots. The home becomes a temple, a place of private worship where they can connect with their core selves and the essence of who they are beyond the external world. The emotional depth of the fourth house means that Vesta’s focus also extends to the realm of the subconscious. There may be a profound inner life that is carefully guarded and intensely private. People with this placement often have a powerful capacity for introspection and may dedicate a great deal of energy to inner psychological work, treating it with reverence and seriousness. Despite the beauty of such dedication, Vesta's presence can also come with challenges in the fourth house. The intensity of this asteroid's focus can create an environment where the person may struggle with letting go. They may cling too tightly to their family or heritage, or they might put excessive pressure on themselves to maintain familial harmony, even to their own detriment. Over-attachment to the past or to the home can also lead to difficulties with embracing change or venturing outside the comfort of the familiar. To harmonize the energy of Vesta in the fourth house, it would be wise for the individual to balance their dedication to home and family with an openness to external experiences and interactions. They need to ensure they’re not using their devotion to the private sphere as an escape from the challenges of the outside world. Learning to channel the sacredness of their inner sanctuary into the outer world can enrich their personal interactions and help them find the same sense of stability and purpose in broader societal or communal settings. Ultimately, with Vesta in the fourth house, we see a person whose flame of devotion is closely tied to the roots of their being, fuelling their sense of security and identity from within. By nurturing this flame with care, they uphold the traditions and values that deeply resonate with them, all while ensuring that their sense of home and inner sanctity becomes a foundation for growth, not just a sanctuary of retreat."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in the 5th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"When the asteroid Vesta finds its place in the 5th house of a natal chart, it brings a unique set of energies to the domains traditionally ruled by this house—creativity, romance, pleasure, self-expression, and children. The 5th house is an area associated with the joys one creates and experiences in life, the pure expression of who one is, and the love one gives and receives. It is also linked with the things we produce, including artistic works and offspring. Vesta, known for its representation of dedication, focus, and commitment to whatever it touches, infuses these areas with an intense, almost sacred quality. It governs where and how we find a sense of spiritual service and maintain the inner fire of our passions and convictions. An individual graced with Vesta in the 5th house may feel a profound calling or dedication toward creative pursuits or hobbies. There's an intensity to how they express themselves artistically, and they may treat their creativity as a form of worship or spiritual practice. The urge to produce works of personal significance is not just for enjoyment or acknowledgment but can be seen as their contribution to something greater. These people often pour a great deal of their energy and purity of intent into creative projects, seeking to imbue them with a spark of their inner essence. In terms of romance and personal relationships, Vesta’s presence here can signify deep devotion. Romantic interactions may be pursued with an eye for something more meaningful and soulful—relationships that are not just casual flings but ones that resonate with a higher sense of purpose or connection. The 5th house Vesta person may be choosy about romantic partners, not because they're fickle, but because they seek a connection that aligns with their inner flame’s sacredness. Children, both biological and figurative (like creative brainchildren), are another possible focus for this dedication. Such an individual might feel especially called to nurture and guide the younger generation, whether it's their own kids or others'. They may find immense fulfillment in supporting the blossoming of creativity and self-expression in children, treating this responsibility with great care and a sense of sacred service. However, the fervent flames of Vesta can also introduce challenges. The intensity of commitment to one's passions and pleasures may become so strong that it borders on obsessive or becomes all-consuming. Learning to temper the devotion to creativity or romance with a dose of moderation is an important lesson for those with this placement. If not, their inner flame might lead them to overlook other critical areas of their lives or deter them from appreciating the joyful spontaneity that the 5th house also embodies. The key to balance for someone with Vesta in the 5th house lies in recognizing that their passionate dedication is indeed a profound source of joy and strength, but it need not exclude a lightheartedness in their creative and romantic endeavors. They must honor their intense focus without letting it overshadow the playful, celebratory nature of the 5th house. By doing so, they can connect with their innermost spark of joy, sharing that warmth and vitality with the world in a way that enlivens both themselves and others."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in the 6th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"The presence of the asteroid Vesta in the 6th house of a natal chart casts an intriguing astrological light on the themes governed by this house: daily routines, work, service, health, and the nuances of everyday life. Traditionally, the 6th house is associated with our habits and the way we organize our lives, our approach to work (especially in the service of others), our methods for self-improvement, and how we manage our health and well-being. Vesta brings an intensity of focus and a sense of sacredness to its placement, and when situated within the 6th house, it speaks of an individual who may apply a considerable amount of dedication and ritual to their daily life. Work and service are not just necessary activities; they are areas where this person seeks to express their devotion and where they find a sense of purpose. An individual with Vesta in the 6th house might find that their approach to work is characteristically thorough, detail-oriented, and imbued with integrity. They are often the ones who go above and beyond in their tasks, treating their responsibilities almost as a spiritual calling. They may be drawn to healing professions or roles that involve caring for others, as these pathways give a clear avenue for their Vesta-driven need to serve meaningfully. This dedication also manifests in how they consider their personal rituals and daily routines. For them, the structure of day-to-day life can be an expression of their inner commitments. They might have specific habits related to health, fitness, or organization that they adhere to with reverence. There’s a feeling that if they maintain these rituals and practices, they are honoring a higher aspect of themselves and perhaps a larger cosmic order. Concerning health, a Vesta in the 6th house person may show a passionate commitment to both their own well-being and that of others. They often take health matters seriously, researching and applying what they believe to be the purest and most beneficial lifestyle choices. Wellness for them can become an avenue for their service-oriented nature, aiming not just for personal fitness but for the health of the collective. However, the strong focus associated with Vesta can also cast a shadow, particularly when it leads to excessive perfectionism or an overemphasis on work and service. Individuals with this placement might struggle with overworking themselves or becoming overly critical if everything does not go according to their stringent standards. There is a risk of neglecting their own needs or of sacrificing personal time and relationships at the altar of duty, work, and well-being. The way forward for someone with Vesta in the 6th house involves fostering a balanced perspective on service and daily routines. They need to remember that taking care of themselves and recognizing the sacredness of rest and leisure is as important as their dedication to work and service. Allowing themselves space for imperfections and understanding that service doesn't mean self-neglect can help them harness Vesta's energies more positively. In essence, Vesta in the 6th house is a powerful indication of a person's potential to find deep and meaningful engagement in the intricacies of their daily life, their work, and their service to others. It is a call to honor these areas with dedication and care, always keeping in mind the delicate balance that allows for both personal fulfillment and the contributions to the greater good."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in the 7th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"When the asteroid Vesta is found in the 7th house of a natal chart, there is a pronounced focus on relationships, partnerships, and the dynamics of one-on-one connections. The 7th house is traditionally associated with marriage, business partnerships, legal contracts, and any form of recognized unions or open enemies. Here, we deal with how we relate to others on an equal footing, as well as what we seek and what we attract in partnerships. Vesta, in astrological terms, represents dedication, purity, a focused approach, and often a sense of sacred service. It brings with it an almost monastic quality of devotion—whether to a person, a cause, or an ideal. Placed within the 7th house, Vesta's fiery intensity spotlights the realm of interpersonal relationships and imbues it with an earnestness and a commitment to honor the sanctity of pairings, whether personal or professional. For an individual with Vesta in the 7th house, partnerships may take on a special significance and could be approached with a high level of seriousness. They could seek partnerships that resonate with their inner values and that can become a vessel for their need to commit and serve purposefully. This may manifest as seeking partners who share a sense of mission or who are willing to engage in a relationship that feels like a sacred encounter—not just romantic liaisons, but true partnerships that bring about spiritual growth and service. This sacred flame of Vesta can make the person very devoted to their partner or to the concept of partnership itself. They may be willing to make significant sacrifices to maintain harmony and to ensure that their unions are strengthened and preserved. In business, a similar level of dedication can be found, as they might pursue working relationships that feel ethically aligned and that allow them to put their whole selves into the joint endeavor. However, the placement of Vesta in the 7th house also presents its challenges. The desire for a perfect, almost holy partnership can become a source of dissatisfaction if the reality falls short of the ideal. It might also lead to staying in relationships that require excessive sacrifice or self-effacement. The intensity of focus Vesta brings could manifest as an over-identification with being a partner and a neglect of personal needs or independence. On the flip side, those with Vesta in the 7th house might encounter partners who expect them to embody the Vestal qualities of purity and sacrifice, which can be quite a burden. In such cases, relationships may serve as a mirror, reflecting back an idealized or sacrificial image that the person then tries to live up to, sometimes at the cost of their authenticity. The key to harnessing the energy of Vesta in the 7th house is to strike a balance between dedication to others and maintaining self-care and personal identity. Recognizing that a healthy partnership involves mutual respect and equal sharing of the sacred flame is essential. It's about allowing room for both individuals to be independent and whole on their own, contributing to a partnership that enhances rather than diminishes each person’s inner light. Ultimately, Vesta in the 7th house can be about finding divinity in the art of relating. It calls for honoring relationships with a fierce dedication but also for understanding that true partnership amplifies rather than consumes the individual flames of both parties involved. It is about learning to be self-reflective, discerning, and whole on one's own, in order to bring the purest self to any partnership and thus allow it to become a source of warmth, strength, and devotion for both involved."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in the 8th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"The placement of the asteroid Vesta in the 8th house of a natal chart introduces a compelling dynamic to areas traditionally associated with this house: transformation, the occult, other people’s resources, as well as issues of intimacy and shared values. The 8th house is a complex and intense domain, often linked to the processes of death and rebirth, whether literal or metaphorical. Its territories also include inheritance, deep psychological exploration, the mysteries of life and sexuality, and the depths of our subconscious desires. Vesta, with its themes of commitment, focus, and sacred service, instills in these areas a dedicated approach and perhaps an element of the ceremonial. Vesta's flame in the 8th house would indicate an individual who possesses a profound inner intensity and a calling to dive deep into life’s transformative processes. There is an urge to understand the intricacies of intimate connections, to touch the core of psychological workings, and to face the taboos or hidden aspects of existence with a certain purity of intent. A person with Vesta in the 8th house may treat intimate emotional bonds and sexual union with significant reverence. Their dedication might lead to a deep, ritualistic, and profound approach to intimacy and may also involve a search for spiritual or psychological insights within such unions. This placement may grant them a natural inclination or talent for therapies or healing practices that involve exploring the psyche, such as psychoanalysis or energy work, where they can serve others through facilitating transformative experiences. The interest in transformation might also manifest through areas like inheritance, investments, or the management of joint resources. Here, the Vesta influence can lead to a focused and dedicated approach to managing what is shared between individuals, be it financial, emotional or spiritual. However, with the asteroid Vesta in the 8th house, the intensity and dedication can both be a blessing and a source of potential challenges. On one hand, they have the capacity to burn away the unnecessary and the superficial, pursuing truth and transformation with relentless focus. On the other hand, this intensity might manifest as obsessive tendencies, especially related to matters of control or power within intimate partnerships or financial affairs. There may also be a tendency to take on psychological or emotional burdens as a form of service, which could overwhelm or create a guiding principle where they feel obligated to “heal” or “save” others. These individuals might also find themselves confronting the shadows of their psyche more directly and intensely than others. Vesta’s sacred fire needs to be managed carefully in the 8th house, to ensure it doesn’t consume but rather enlightens and transforms. Achieving balance requires embracing change and depth experiences as a normal part of life and growth, not as crises to be solved or obsessed over. Part of the journey for someone with Vesta in the 8th house may involve learning how to recognize and honor personal boundaries and understanding the difference between shared and personal energy. They may need to guard against the potential for losing themselves in others or in profound transformative processes. In essence, Vesta in the 8th house suggests a powerful capacity for rebirth and for helping others through points of deep change. It challenges one to wield the flame of transformation wisely—to use it to light the way through the darker aspects of existence so that both they and those they connect with can emerge stronger, more integrated, and more in tune with the deeper levels of being."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in the 9th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"Astrologically, the 9th house is a realm that encompasses higher education, philosophy, religion, long-distance travel, legal systems, ethics, and the broadening of one's horizons through intellectual or spiritual pursuits. When we locate the asteroid Vesta—a symbol of focused dedication, sacred service, and inner purity—within the expansive territory of the 9th house, it provides us with a vivid astrological tapestry that weaves together devotion with the quest for knowledge and wisdom. The presence of Vesta in the 9th house suggests that the individual approaches the themes of this house with a serious and committed mindset. There is often a marked intensity in their pursuit of truth, be it through academia, spirituality, or other avenues of personal growth. They are likely to demonstrate a calling toward exploring the higher questions of life and existence, often with a disciplined and concentrated effort. For a person with Vesta in the 9th house, there may be an almost sacred fascination with cultures, philosophies, and belief systems different from their own, driving them to travel, study, or engage with such areas in a deeply meaningful manner. They might find a part of their life's purpose in the act of learning and teaching, the sharing of knowledge taking on a ceremonious significance. Potential paths for this drive could include becoming an educator, a scholar, a spiritual leader, or another role where imparting wisdom is paramount. Their commitment to their beliefs and principles can be quite profound, and they may undertake pilgrimages (literal or metaphorical) to connect with ideologies or places they consider sacred. The spiritual and philosophical beliefs they hold are often central to their identity, and they may devote a great deal of their lives to studying, preaching, or upholding these tenets. The legal arena might also appeal to them if they see it as a means to further justice and ethical practices. However, Vesta's intense focus within the 9th house can sometimes result in challenges. The tendency towards dogmatism or self-righteousness looms if they become overly attached to their particular view of truth or way of understanding the world. The single-minded pursuit of their ethical, religious, or educational goals could lead to a dismissive attitude towards other perspectives or a rigid adherence to a belief system. The key for someone with Vesta in the 9th house is to maintain openness and humility in their pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. Remembering that the sacred flame of Vesta is not just about inner purity and dedication, but also about serving a greater whole, can guide them toward a more inclusive and tolerant worldview. They must take care not to burn others with their passion but to use their inner fire to illuminate and warm, promoting understanding and enlightenment. To truly embrace the potential of Vesta in the 9th house, an individual would do well to temper their intellectual and spiritual fervor with respect for the myriad paths to truth available in the human experience. They possess the capacity to become a beacon of insight and wisdom, shining the light of their knowledge far and wide, so long as they remember that every flame is part of a greater fire that encompasses all of humanity's diverse and rich ways of understanding life's grand tapestry."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in the 10th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"Vesta's presence in the 10th house of a natal chart illuminates the realms of career, reputation, and public life with its sacred flame. The 10th house, traditionally linked to one's vocation, status, and the public identity one constructs, is about the mark we make on the world and how we are recognized by society. Vesta's energies weave into this sphere a dedication characterized by focus, purity of intent, and a commitment to service. An individual with Vesta in the 10th house may approach their career and public responsibilities with a great degree of seriousness and a deep sense of mission. There is often a calling felt here, an inner drive that motivates this person to not merely pursue a career but to fulfill a vocation that they perceive as an essential part of their life purpose. Their professional life is not just about personal success but about upholding a sense of sacred duty. This Vesta-fueled dedication can drive an individual to achieve and maintain a certain reputation, to embody a public persona that is reflective of their core principles. They might be drawn to professions that carry an aura of respect or that allow them to make a lasting impact on their community or field. The desire to be seen as someone who embodies dedication, integrity, and service can be a potent force in their ambitions and achievements. Vesta in the 10th house may also signify that public recognition is not sought for egoic reasons but rather as a byproduct of their commitment to their work. Their reputation is tied to their capacity to be steadfast and to exemplify the virtues of their chosen path or vocation. This can create a public image that exudes reliability, devotion, and perhaps even a form of spiritual or moral authority. In their pursuit of career goals, individuals with this placement often demonstrate a meticulous, focused approach that allows them to excel. They may be the ones who willingly take on more responsibility, who work late hours, and who demonstrate an impressive level of self-discipline. They often set the bar high, not only for themselves but as a standard for those they work with or lead. However, there can be challenges associated with having Vesta in the 10th house. There's a potential for becoming overly consumed by work or status, leading to neglect in other life areas such as family or personal relaxation. The dedication to vocation may become so intense that it borders on a compulsion, with work serving as both sanctuary and an inextinguishable flame that can sometimes burn too brightly. For those with Vesta in the 10th house, finding a balance between professional dedication and personal well-being is crucial. It's important to recognize that even in their quest for public service and achievement, taking time for self-care and honoring personal needs is vital. They must learn to stoke their inner fire without sacrificing their own well-being on the altar of their career. Channeling Vesta's energy in a balanced way could mean integrating periods of rest and introspection into their routine, ensuring that their drive for success includes a holistic and sustainable approach. Cultivating an understanding that their worth is not solely defined by their achievements but also by their character and their contribution to the collective well-being can lead to a more fulfilling career path. Ultimately, Vesta in the 10th house can represent a person who seeks to embody the pinnacle of vocational dedication, serving as an example of commitment and integrity. It's a call to honor one's professional life as a sacred calling, to maintain the flame of one's aspirations, and to remember that true success is a flame that warms not just oneself but the community at large."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in the 11th house in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"In astrology, the 11th house is connected with themes of community, friendships, collective projects, hopes, and wishes for the future. It is the domain of social circles, networks, and broader aspirations that extend beyond personal desire and into the realm where we connect with like-minded individuals or causes. The 11th house also correlates with our engagement in groups, our ability to work towards common goals, and the part of us that envisions a better world. When Vesta, the asteroid of devotion, focus, and sacred commitment, resides in the 11th house, these themes are given a flame of earnestness and purity. Vesta's energy in this placement suggests an individual who has a potentially profound dedication to collective concerns, group alliances, and communal endeavors. The traditional associations of Vesta with maintaining the sacred fire combine with the 11th house's focus on wider society to create a potential for passionate involvement in social movements or community service. An individual with Vesta in the 11th house might find themselves naturally gravitating towards roles that allow them to contribute to social change or improvements. They could be the people organizing group activities, fostering communities built on shared values, or tirelessly volunteering for humanitarian causes. Their participation in groups or networks is rarely superficial; there is often an element of sacrificial service, and they may be comfortable working behind the scenes to uphold the group's integrity and goals. The desire to be a part of something bigger, to commune with others in a way that feels meaningful, echoes from this placement. The interests and wishes of the individual are often interwoven with the collective's needs, and friendships may be chosen based on a shared commitment to a cause or mutual support in personal, spiritual, or professional growth. However, Vesta's influence in the 11th house can also bring about certain challenges.

There might be a tendency to lose oneself in the collective or to feel that personal identity is only valid when connected to group identity or acceptance. Additionally, Vesta's calling to serve could become an obligation that lacks personal boundaries, leading to burnout or disillusionment. The sacred flame that inspires communal dedication must be tended with care, so it nurtures rather than consumes. For those with Vesta in the 11th house, the key is to find a balance between their dedication to collective ideals and their personal well-being. They must learn to channel their passion for community and humanitarian efforts without compromising their unique self-expression or individual journey. Taking time to reconnect with personal goals and allowing for joy and spontaneity in interactions with others can ensure that their contributions remain heartfelt and sustainable. Remembering that their individual light is amplified and not diminished by the collective is essential. The group shines brighter with diverse but harmonized flames, and each person's unique dedication, including theirs, is crucial to the tapestry of community and social progress.

The 12th house is the realm of the collective unconscious, hidden strengths and weaknesses, secret sorrows, and the processes that take place far from the public eye. This house is connected to spirituality, transcendence, isolation, institutions such as hospitals and prisons, and ways in which we serve without any expectation of recognition or reward. Vesta, bearing the torch of devotion, focus, and sacred service, nested in the 12th house, indicates an individual who may possess a quiet yet profound commitment to introspection, spiritual pursuits, or aiding those who are marginalized or suffering. This placement suggests a potential for the person to engage with the introspective and mystical dimensions of life on a deeply internalized and private level. For someone with Vesta in the 12th house, there may be an inclination toward activities that are solitary or behind the scenes. The dedication to understanding the inner workings of the psyche or engaging with spiritual practice can be a focal point of their existence. They might feel a sense of sacred duty towards self-reflection and the healing of their own and others' psychological wounds. This could manifest as an attraction to roles like counselor, therapist, spiritual guide, or healer, where they can provide service in quiet and often unnoticed ways. The spirituality associated with this placement of Vesta is often personal and not openly shared with others. Vesta's presence here can drive a person to seek out hidden truths, to spend time in contemplation or meditation, and to step back from the material world in favor of exploring the immaterial. Their spiritual pursuits may be their sanctuary, a space in which to recharge and connect with the divine or their higher self. However, the intensity of Vesta's flame in the 12th house can also lead to challenges. There may be a tendency to retreat too much into isolation or to sacrifice oneself unnecessarily. The person may struggle with boundaries, struggling to discern where their own needs end and the collective begins. They might also have difficulty confront their personal subconscious patterns, possibly repressing or obsessing over the sacrifices they feel compelled to make. Those with Vesta in the 12th house might also experience a sense of being spiritually lost at times, wandering through the mists of the unconscious in search of a clear path or purpose. Yet, it is often in these moments of solitude and introspection that they find their most significant insights and spiritual strengths. The journey for someone with Vesta in the 12th house involves learning to balance the inner call to serve with the need to maintain personal health and sanity. It is about cultivating a practice that allows them to connect with the divine within and without overextending themselves. They must identify when self-sacrifice is necessary and when it becomes self-undoing. To fully harness the power of Vesta in the 12th house, the individual can strive to integrate their deep, private devotion to the spiritual and emotional realms into a form of compassionate service. Allowing themselves to be a vessel for universal love and healing, whilst protecting their energy and psyche, enables them to keep the sacred flame alive—not only for themselves but also as a subtle yet profound beacon of light for others.

As a fire sign, Aries is associated with initiation, action, and the courage to embark on new ventures. It is the zodiac's first sign and represents the self, the individual's identity, and personal desires. The presence of Vesta in Aries suggests a person who may show a dedication to asserting their own identity and pursuing their desires with a singular focus and intensity. This individual may be driven by a desire to prove themselves or be first in their chosen pursuits. Their devotion to their projects and goals is passionate, perhaps even zealous at times, characterized by a sense of urgency and the need to trailblaze. For such a person, the fire of Vesta is expressed through an ethos of independence and self-reliance. They are likely to be highly motivated to strike out on their own and may feel a strong calling to act as a leader or to engage in activities that challenge and assert their autonomy. The warrior-like qualities of Aries can imbue their devotions with a competitive edge, and they may be particularly focused on initiatives that involve personal bravery or pioneering efforts. Their way of tending to the Vesta flame is through action and initiative—Aries encourages them not to merely dream or plan but to act decisively and with conviction. Vesta’s sacredness in the context of Aries can also be channeled into advocating for personal or collective causes, fighting for what they believe is right, and standing up for the underdog. However, Vesta in Aries can also present challenges. The passion and intensity of their focus may sometimes lead them to act impulsively or without considering the long-term consequences. There can be a tendency to burn through projects, relationships, or goals quickly, driven by the immediate need for action rather than strategic planning. Their sacred flame must not consume them or those around them in their haste to move forward. Patience is often a virtue that those with Vesta in Aries need to cultivate, learning to pace themselves and recognize that dedication and devotion do not always demand immediate action. Their commitments can be sustained over time, and the causes they serve may benefit from a thoughtful approach that honors the process as much as the results. To effectively work with the energy of Vesta in Aries, the individual may need to find ways to temper their natural impulse to forge ahead with moments of reflection and deliberation. Honoring their need for independence and self-assertion can be balanced with an awareness of the impact of their actions on the larger collective. The key is finding constructive outlets for their abundant energy, channeling their innate drive into causes and endeavors that not only feed their own spirits but also make a meaningful impact on the world. In essence, Vesta in Aries imbues one’s devotional practices with an entrepreneurial spirit.

Those with Vesta in Taurus may exhibit a special kind of perseverance when it comes to their passions and interests. They are prone to approach their dedications methodically, building upon them slowly but with unwavering intent. This can lead them to become quite skilled in practical and artistic endeavors, as Taurus also governs the appreciation of art, beauty, and craftsmanship. They could be found applying their focus to gardening, cooking, crafting, or any pursuit that requires a loving and patient touch. Financial and material security might also be areas where the Vesta in Taurus individual directs their conscientious efforts. There can be a sacredness in how they manage their resources, seeking stability and value, treating their possessions and finances as extensions of their personal energy that need to be cared for with respect and attention. Yet, the intensity of Vesta can also manifest as challenges within the steadfast sign of Taurus. There is a risk of becoming too fixed or resistant to change, especially when a sense of security is threatened. The dedication to maintaining stability may sometimes lead to reluctance in letting go of situations, relationships, or objects that have outlasted their usefulness. Furthermore, the Taurean desire for comfort can sometimes lead to stagnation if it prevents progress or necessary transformation. For those with Vesta in Taurus, achieving balance may involve learning to recognize when their devotion to stability becomes a limitation rather than a strength. They need to integrate the Taurus qualities of adaptability—like the change of seasons that the earth reliably brings—into their pursuit of security and sustenance. Embracing Vesta’s sacred flame in Taurus also means honoring the senses and the simple pleasures of life. This includes recognizing when to pause and appreciate what they have cultivated and to find beauty in the stillness and the processes of nature. By doing so, they can continue to fuel their commitment to their chosen path without becoming burnt out or too rigid.

Gemini, an air sign, represents communication, intellect, learning, and the exchange of ideas. Ruled by Mercury, it signifies a curious and versatile approach to life, a love for variety, and a connection to siblings, neighbors, and the immediate environment. It’s the sign of the storyteller, the student, the teacher, and the networker.

Such a person is likely to show a strong dedication to the written and spoken word and to the act of learning itself. Their mental energy is where Vesta’s flame burns, leading them to possibly identify deeply with their mental capabilities and to be driven to share their knowledge with the world. Those with Vesta in Gemini may experience an inner calling to act as intermediaries of information, to be the bridge between ideas and people. They might devote tremendous energy towards education, writing, speaking, or other forms of communication. Their focus can manifest as an almost compulsive need to gather facts, learn skills, and to stay intellectually engaged with their environment. In their social sphere, such individuals may serve as the intellectual or communicative hub of their community or circle. Their ability to maintain and fan the flame of knowledge can be a powerful tool for both teaching and learning. They may be naturally drawn towards situations where they can facilitate the exchange of information or act as messengers or translators. The mercurial nature of Gemini also suggests that those with Vesta here may juggle multiple interests or passions at once, applying their focus in a rapid, versatile manner. However, this incredible versatility can also become a challenge. With so many points of interest, staying rooted or dedicated to one area can be difficult. The Vesta in Gemini individual may scatter their energies or become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information they wish to process and disseminate. On a deeper level, the steadfast flame of Vesta in such a mutable sign might compel an inner journey to find the core truth beneath the myriad of facts and details they encounter. It’s about discerning which pieces of information resonate with a deeper wisdom and deserve the full intensity of their commitment. Achieving balance for someone with Vesta in Gemini involves embracing their natural curiosity and communicative gifts while cultivating a certain discipline to not become lost in the sea of data and distraction. They may need to practice grounding techniques to stay focused and to ensure that their quest for information has both depth and direction. In summary, Vesta in Gemini points to an individual whose sacred fire is kindled through intellectual pursuits, the joys of communication, and connections with the immediate environment.

Cancer is a water sign associated with family, emotions, care, home life, and a deep connection to one's roots and past. Representing the mother archetype, it is about fostering emotional bonds, sensitivity to the needs of others, and creating a sense of security. Vesta within Cancer suggests an individual with a profound commitment to nurturing and protecting. Their sacred flame is likely to be found and tended within the domestic realm or in whatever context they define as home. This placement emphasizes a devotion to family, or to those who are considered family, and may indicate someone who is intensely invested in their personal life, relationships, and the emotional well-being of those around them. People with Vesta in Cancer are often the caretakers, whether emotionally or literally. They bring a focused dedication to creating a safe and nourishing environment, and their sense of purpose may revolve around ensuring the stability and continuance of their home and family traditions. Emotionally, they may be inclined to act as a nurturing force in the lives of others, offering comfort and support with a deep sense of empathy. The influence of Vesta in Cancer can also orient this warmth and care toward broader issues, such as community nurturing or providing support for those in need, in a way that feels very personal and heartfelt. The bonds they form are not taken lightly; they may center themselves around these attachments and derive a significant part of their identity from their roles as caregivers, parents, or nurturers. However, the presence of Vesta here can sometimes pose challenges. The intensity of emotional dedication can lead to an overemphasis on the emotional ties and responsibilities, possibly at the expense of personal needs or boundaries. There might be a tendency to become too enmeshed in the lives of those they care for or a reluctance to leave or redefine the safety of the home environment, even when growth calls for it. Individuals with Vesta in Cancer may also grapple with letting go of the past or handling changes in familial dynamics. Their sacred flame is so tightly linked with emotional security that shifts in this area can feel deeply unsettling. In essence, they need to balance their commitment to care and nurturance with the recognition that they, too, must be cared for and that emotional growth sometimes requires vulnerability and change. For these individuals, utilizing the focused energy of Vesta entails embracing emotional depth and using it as a source of strength rather than as a place of retreat. Honoring their need to nurture should include self-nurturance, giving themselves permission to tend to their own inner flame with as much dedication as they offer to others. In summary, Vesta in Cancer positions an individual as a guardian of the heart and hearth, where their devotion manifests through emotional connections and the cultivation of a supportive, loving environment. By drawing upon the protective and compassionate qualities of Cancer, they have the capacity to provide profound and meaningful care, creating sanctuaries of warmth and safety that empower both themselves and those in their personal sphere."},{"prompt":"write a comprehensive astrological interpretation of the asteroid Vesta in Leo in the natal chart, write it in verbal form not in point form","completion":"The asteroid Vesta's placement in Leo in the natal chart adds a vibrant, passionate layer to the energies associated with both Vesta and Leo. Leo, a fire sign ruled by the Sun, embodies qualities of self-expression, personal power, creativity, and a desire for recognition. It is the sign of the performer, the leader, and the sovereign, concerned with pride, dignity, and the execution of one's will with confidence and magnanimity. With Vesta in Leo, there is a powerful dedication to one's sense of identity and the creative self. This placement often speaks to an individual whose inner flame is stoked through artistic expression, performance, or any pursuit where they can shine and be recognized for their unique talents. Their devoted energy can be tied up with their efforts to stand out and to radiate the pure essence of who they are. People with Vesta in Leo might have a profound calling toward endeavors that allow them to take center stage or to lead with their heart. Their sacred fire may be found in their passions, hobbies, or romantic pursuits, which they approach with a fervent and unwavering commitment. They opt to pour their energies into what makes them feel alive, seen, and appreciated, finding in these expressions a sense of purpose and service. Moreover, Vesta in Leo can create a powerful drive to contribute to the world in ways that are close to the heart. This can involve working with children, engaging in philanthropy, leading community initiatives, or simply bringing joy and inspiration to others through their personal warmth and generosity. However, Vesta’s intensity in Leo can also manifest as challenges. There may be a tension between the desire for personal recognition and the purer aspects of service and dedication. The strong need for applause and acknowledgment might sometimes overshadow the selfless qualities of Vesta's flame. Additionally, there's a potential for dramatizing one's sense of devotion, where the individual's role as a giver, creator, or leader could become more focused on self-glorification than the act of service itself. Moreover, they may struggle with the harsher realities that come with leadership roles or creative endeavors, as the expectation to maintain a regal and unshakable image could conflict with the natural ebbs and flows of confidence and success. Dealing with issues of pride and dignity may present opportunities for growth. For those with Vesta in Leo, the key to harmonizing these energies lies in integrating the warmth and generous spirit of Leo with the humility and focus of Vesta.

However, with Vesta in Virgo, there may be challenges in the form of over-criticism, perfectionism, or an overwhelming sense of duty. The desire for flawlessness can become an obstacle, potentially leading to workaholism or an excessive focus on minor details at the expense of a more holistic understanding. The service-oriented nature of Vesta can also become problematic if it translates into a constant sacrificing of personal needs for the sake of others or the job at hand. For those with Vesta in Virgo, maintaining balance may involve recognizing when their quest for perfection and service becomes self-limiting or self-destructive. They need to learn to accept imperfection in themselves and their efforts, allowing their dedication to express itself in a healthy, sustainable manner. They must be mindful to include self-care in their routine and to avoid becoming so involved in the minutiae of service that they lose sight of the bigger picture. Harnessing the energy of Vesta in Virgo involves cultivating an awareness that their worth is not solely defined by how much they do or the perfection they can achieve. It's about embracing the value of the process, finding a sense of wholeness in their work, and realizing that their meticulous contributions are both valuable and respected. In summary, Vesta in Virgo reflects an individual who finds divinity in the details, who honors the mundane through their careful attention and who dedicates their life to service, healing, and the pursuit of excellence.

There may be a propensity to become obsessive or to invest themselves so deeply in a quest for truth or in a relationship that self-destruction becomes a risk. Power struggles, manipulation, or control issues can surface, especially if the person feels their sacred trust or loyalty is threatened. The darker side of both Scorpio and Vesta could emerge in extreme scenarios, where symbiotic or secretive behaviors overshadow the purity of their intentions. For someone with Vesta in Scorpio, balancing their powerful internal focus with an awareness of the need for both emotional release and personal boundaries is vital. They must recognize that while their dedication to the process of transformation is part of their spiritual path, it is equally important to engage in self-care and to honor their limits.

In summary, Vesta in Scorpio paints the picture of an individual called to dive into life's transformative waters, guiding others and themselves through the complexities of change, power exchange, and emotional depths.

In astronomy, Vesta is known for its unique characteristics among the other celestial bodies that reside between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers on March 29, 1807, and is named after Vesta, the virgin goddess of the hearth, home, and family in Roman mythology. Vesta is intriguing to scientists because it has a differentiated structure with a crust, mantle, and core, much like Earth, and it's believed to be the source of a significant number of meteorites that have reached our planet. In astrology, Vesta represents a different set of themes than it does in astronomy, though the connections to its mythological roots remain strong. Within the context of astrology, Vesta is not one of the traditional planets used in horoscope readings but is considered a significant asteroid, alongside others such as Ceres, Pallas, and Juno. Its place in the chart is often interpreted to symbolize matters relating to focus, dedication, and the way in which an individual expresses their capacity for commitment—whether it be to a job, a relationship, a creative endeavor, or a personal conviction. The themes of service and sacrifice are commonly associated with Vesta, stemming from its mythological association with the Vestal Virgins, who were priestesses dedicated to the goddess and tasked with keeping her sacred fire alight. On a psychological level, Vesta can point to what is most sacred to the individual, including where and how they may seek purity, devotion, and a sense of purpose. It reveals the parts of life where a person can be most self-disciplined and where they might express their most concentrated passion or potentially become overly fixated. Vesta’s position by house and sign in an astrological chart can delineate areas of life that might be approached with an almost religious fervor, and aspects it makes to other celestial bodies can challenge or support those areas and expressions. In interpersonal dynamics, it might suggest an inclination toward modesty, service, or taking care of others at the expense of personal rewards or recognition. In essence, Vesta carries the flame of the personal inner hearth within the astrological chart, illuminating the spaces where an individual can most effectively channel their spiritual and service-oriented energies—marking not just their hearth, but where they may find or forge their home, in the widest and deepest senses of the word."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

É o sétimo dia da semana judaica e é um dia de descanso e abstinência de trabalho em lembrança do descanso de Deus após os seis dias de criação, conforme narrado no livro do Gênesis. Segue-se em observância ao quarto mandamento da Torá. O Shabat começa ao pôr do sol de sexta-feira e termina na noite de sábado, após o aparecimento de três estrelas no céu, quando se realiza uma cerimônia chamada Havdalah (separação) para marcar o fim do Shabat e a volta às atividades comuns. 2. **Cristianismo Adventista do Sétimo Dia**: Esta denominação cristã observa o sábado do pôr do sol de sexta-feira ao pôr do sol de sábado, semelhante à tradição judaica. Os adventistas acreditam que o sábado é o dia de descanso instituído por Deus e confirmam essa crença com várias passagens bíblicas, tanto no Antigo como no Novo Testamento. Eles consideram a observância do sábado um sinal de fidelidade a Deus e uma expressão de liberdade religiosa. 3. **Cristãos Batistas do Sétimo Dia**: Assim como os Adventistas do Sétimo Dia, os Batistas do Sétimo Dia também consideram o sábado como o verdadeiro dia de descanso e adoração, baseando suas práticas nas mesmas interpretações bíblicas. Eles têm uma teologia e práticas batistas tradicionais, mas diferem principalmente na questão do Sabbath. 4. **Igreja de Deus (Sétimo Dia)** e algumas outras denominações cristãs: Existem outras denominações e grupos cristãos menores que também observam o sábado como dia de descanso e adoração. 5. **Hebraísmo Messiânico e outros Judeus Mesiânicos**: Esses grupos, muitas vezes constituídos por judeus que acreditam em Jesus (Yeshua) como o messias, mas que continuam a praticar muitos costumes judaicos, também observam o Shabat seguindo os princípios judaicos. Além dessas religiões principais, podem existir outras comunidades e seitas religiosas menores que têm o sábado como dia santo, cada uma com sua própria compreensão e prática. Vale ressaltar que, apesar das diferenças nas práticas e nas teologias, a santificação do sábado é um ponto comum importante que une essas diferentes tradições."},{"prompt":"What's the max number of bookmarks in chrome","completion":"Google Chrome itself does not specify an official maximum number of bookmarks you can have. Users have been known to save thousands of bookmarks without any problem. However, having a very large number of bookmarks (for example, tens or hundreds of thousands) could potentially slow down your browser or make bookmark management unwieldy. The practical limit is often dictated by the performance of your computer and how well you can manage large numbers of bookmarks. If you do encounter performance issues, you might consider organizing your bookmarks into folders, using bookmark management extensions, or deleting bookmarks you no longer need to improve Chrome's performance. Remember, also, that syncing a large number of bookmarks across devices using Chrome's sync feature might also affect performance or encounter sync issues if the number gets excessively high."},{"prompt":"How long can you name a bookmark","completion":"In Google Chrome, the maximum length for a bookmark's name, also known as the title, is typically determined by the practical limitations of how much text can be displayed or managed rather than a strict character limit imposed by the browser itself. In most cases, users can input a name that is several hundred characters long without any issues. While there isn't a specified maximum length published in official documentation, extremely long names may not be practical. When you add a bookmark, the name field will take the title of the webpage by default, which can sometimes be lengthy. However, users often edit this to make it shorter and more recognizable for future reference. If you encounter any issues or the name seems to be cut off during the bookmarking process, it's a sign that you may be exceeding a practical limit. Nonetheless, it's advisable to keep bookmark names concise for better visibility and organization."},{"prompt":"What's the max length of bookmark name","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, Google Chrome does not officially publish a maximum length for a bookmark name. However, there have been various user reports and discussions in forums suggesting that the limit can be somewhere in the range of a few hundred to over a thousand characters. It's important to note though that even if Chrome allows for an extremely long bookmark name, there are practical reasons to keep it shorter, such as usability, the ability to read the full title without it being truncated in the bookmarks bar or manager, and the performance of the browser if you have a large number of bookmarks with long names. For most users, it is rare to need a bookmark title that exceeds even 100 characters, as shorter names are easier to read and manage. If you need to remember specific details about a bookmark, it may be better to utilize folders and subfolders for organization, or keep an external note with additional information, rather than using a very long title for the bookmark itself."},{"prompt":"What's comes after terabyte","completion":"After a terabyte (TB) comes the petabyte (PB). Here is the progression of units for data measurements in the binary system, each unit is 1024 times larger than the previous one: - Kilobyte (KB) = 1,024 bytes (2^10 bytes) - Megabyte (MB) = 1,024 kilobytes (2^20 bytes) - Gigabyte (GB) = 1,024 megabytes (2^30 bytes) - Terabyte (TB) = 1,024 gigabytes (2^40 bytes) - Petabyte (PB) = 1,024 terabytes (2^50 bytes) - Exabyte (EB) = 1,024 petabytes (2^60 bytes) - Zettabyte (ZB) = 1,024 exabytes (2^70 bytes) - Yottabyte (YB) = 1,024 zettabytes (2^80 bytes) Each of these units can also be defined using the decimal system (SI units), where each unit is 1,000 times larger than the previous one. However, in the context of computing and data storage, the binary system is often used."},{"prompt":"What comes after yottabyte","completion":"In the standardized metric system (SI), a yottabyte (YB) is currently the largest official unit of measure for data and is equivalent to 10^24 bytes, or 1,000 zettabytes (ZB). There is no official unit defined in the SI system beyond the yottabyte. However, in an unofficial context, larger units have been proposed to accommodate the ever-growing amount of digital data. While not officially recognized, the following names have sometimes been used: - Brontobyte: Equal to 1,000 Yottabytes or 10^27 bytes. - Geopbyte: Equal to 1,000 Brontobytes or 10^30 bytes. These terms are not part of the official metric system and are not widely used in academic or professional contexts. They are, however, sometimes mentioned in articles or discussions about the future of data storage, considering the rapid growth of digital information. It's also worth noting that in the binary system (which is often used in computer science for data storage), the next increments have not been standardized past the yottabyte equivalent, which is 2^80 bytes or 1,024 zettabytes (ZiB) and is known as a yobibyte (YiB). No further units have been widely accepted in this system as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023."},{"prompt":"D'mixmasters","completion":"D'Mixmasters is a group known for producing remixes, cover versions, and medleys of popular songs, often with a dance or electronic music influence.

As for storage capacity, here are some of the cloud storage providers known for offering substantial storage options: 1. **Google Drive**: For individuals, Google Drive offers up to 2 TB on its Google One plan, but enterprise users can go much higher with Google Workspace plans. 2. **Microsoft OneDrive**: Microsoft offers plans for individuals with up to 6 TB of storage (1 TB per user for up to 6 users with the Family plan), while business users have plans that go higher and even offer unlimited storage for some enterprise tiers. 3. **Amazon S3**: Though not a consumer service, Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) can scale up to petabytes and beyond, tailored more towards enterprise-level needs and big data storage. 4. **Box**: Box offers a range of business plans with unlimited storage for some enterprise options. 5. **Dropbox**: Dropbox provides 3 TB for individual advanced users and has business plans with as much storage as needed, which presumably means they can negotiate plans for very large storage requirements. 6. **Apple iCloud**: For individual users, offers up to 2 TB of storage, but it's not typically used for enterprise storage solutions. 7. **Backblaze B2**: It's an enterprise-level cloud storage provider that offers scalable storage solutions, meaning they will offer as much storage as an enterprise requires. In terms of market share and overall industry presence, providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud are among the biggest players. Their services are not limited to just file storage but encompass a broad range of cloud computing services. For individual users who are not part of a business or organization, cloud storage in the range of a few terabytes is generally considered quite large, and more than enough for most personal use cases. However, enterprise users and large corporations may have need of vastly more storage, in which case they would typically work directly with a provider to tailor a solution to their needs, which can include petabytes or more of data. Please note that the cloud storage landscape is continuously evolving, with service providers frequently updating their offerings and capacities. It's always a good idea to check the latest from each provider for the most current information."},{"prompt":"What's the max number of photos on Google photos","completion":"As of my last update in early 2023, Google Photos does not have a specific maximum number of photos that you can upload, but it does have a storage limit. This limit depends on the quality setting you choose for your photos and videos and the amount of storage you have available in your Google Account. Google Photos offers two quality settings for uploads: 1. **High quality (Storage saver):** This option compresses photos and videos, reducing their file size to save space. Google eliminated the unlimited free storage option for \\"High quality\\" (previously known as such before June 1, 2021). Now, any new photos and videos uploaded in this quality setting count towards the storage quota of your Google Account. 2. **Original quality:** This option retains the original resolution and quality of your photos and videos. These files take up a significant amount of space and count towards your Google Account's storage. Every Google Account starts with 15 GB of free storage, which is shared across Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos. Google One is Google's subscription service that allows you to purchase additional storage if you exceed the free 15 GB. Plans offer various tiers of storage, ranging from 100 GB to 2 TB or more. The total number of photos you can store will thus depend on their file sizes and the available space in your account. If you need to store a large number of photos and you're concerned about reaching the limit, you may want to consider purchasing additional storage through Google One, regularly managing your stored content to free up space, or using another photo storage solution in addition to Google Photos."},{"prompt":"How to get free Google storage","completion":"As of my last update in early 2023, all Google Accounts come with 15 GB of free storage, shared across Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos. However, if you're needing more than the included free storage, there are no official, ongoing programs that offer additional Google storage for free permanently. Occasionally, Google may provide promotional offers or ways to increase your storage temporarily. Here are some ways to potentially get more free Google storage or make the most of what you have: 1. **Promotional Offers:** Sometimes, Google may partner with other companies to offer additional storage as a promotion. For example, buying specific devices or subscribing to services (Google One promotions, Chromebooks offers, etc.) might come with temporary or permanent increases in Google Drive storage. 2. **Google One Trials:** Google might offer a free trial of Google One, which would give you temporary access to additional storage beyond the free 15 GB. Just remember that once the trial ends, you'll either need to pay to keep the extra storage or make sure to reduce your used space below 15 GB again. 3. **Google Local Guides:** In the past, active contributors to Google Maps' Local Guides program were occasionally rewarded with additional Google Drive storage. However, this is subject to change, and any offered rewards may vary over time. 4. **Google Services:** Keep an eye on services like Google Photos, where occasionally, new services or features might include promotions either directly or indirectly providing additional storage. 5. **Manage Your Storage:** Use Google's storage management tools to remove files you don't need, such as large email attachments, duplicate files, or large files in Drive. Also, review photos and videos that count toward your quota and delete what you don’t need anymore. 6. **Storage Savvy Settings:** In Google Photos, use the \\"Storage saver\\" (formerly \\"High quality\\") upload setting for photos and videos to reduce the amount of space they occupy. 7. **Educational Accounts:** If you are part of an educational institution, Google Workspace for Education accounts may offer additional storage. This is managed by the institution. Remember to be wary of third-party offers claiming to provide free Google storage, as these can often be scams. Only trust legitimate offers from Google itself or its official partners. It's important to keep up-to-date with Google's current policies and offerings, as they may change. If you're finding your storage requirements consistently exceed the free tier, you might need to consider a paid Google One subscription for more storage space."},{"prompt":"Coloring pages for adults","completion":"Coloring pages for adults are designed with more complex patterns, details, and themes compared to those intended for children.

In general, humans cannot survive without sleep indefinitely; sleep is as crucial to survival as food and water. Short-term effects of sleep deprivation can become apparent after just one night without sleep, including cognitive impairments, mood changes, and reduced physical performance. After several days without sleep, more severe consequences can emerge, such as hallucinations, paranoia, and disorientation. The most extreme known case of sleep deprivation was documented by Randy Gardner in 1964, who stayed awake for 264 hours (approximately 11 days) for a high school science project. While he did experience significant cognitive and behavioral effects, he was able to recover after he resumed a regular sleep pattern. However, even though some people have been known to go without sleep for long periods without immediate fatal consequences, chronic sleep deprivation can have serious and potentially life-threatening effects on health. It can lead to serious cognitive and physiological impairments and contribute to a range of health problems, from metabolic imbalances to weakened immune function and increased risk of various diseases. Going for extended periods without sleep is strongly discouraged, as it poses risks to both mental and physical health, and can significantly impair judgment and motor skills, making activities (especially driving or operating machinery) dangerous. There’s no clear-cut \\"record\\" for the longest anyone has survived without sleep, and ethical considerations prevent controlled experiments on severe sleep deprivation in humans. Therefore, we do not have a precise understanding of the absolute limits of human endurance for sleeplessness, but the consensus is that even a few days without sleep can be detrimental to one’s health, and longer periods can be potentially fatal due to indirect causes and exacerbation of existing health conditions. In the medical literature, fatal familial insomnia (FFI), a rare genetic disorder, involves progressively worsening insomnia leading to severe physical and mental deterioration. In this case, the lack of sleep can eventually be fatal, but the condition is incredibly rare and is associated with neurological degeneration."},{"prompt":"D'mixmasters titanium another night","completion":"D'Mixmasters is known for creating mashups, remixes, and cover versions of popular songs for dance and fitness enthusiasts.

You are given an n by n grid of gumdrops (n ≥ 2): the bottom left gumdrop is green, and is poisoned: if you eat the poisoned gumdrop, you lose. All other gumdrops are red, and are not poisoned. On your turn, you choose a gumdrop that is on the grid at coordinates (x,y), and you eat all gumdrops at (xe,ye) such that xe ≥ x and ye ≥ y. That is, you eat the rectangle of gumdrops with (x, y) as the lower-left coordinate of the rectangle. Find the winning strategy for player 1, and prove it using induction.","completion":"The game you described is a variant of the classic game of Chomp or Chocolate Bar Game. The winning strategy for player 1 relies on the concept of a \\"poison square\\" or \\"poison gumdrop\\" and the notion of a mirror strategy. Here's how player 1 can guarantee a win in the given version of Gumdrop: **Strategy:** 1. Player 1's first move is to eat the gumdrop at position (2, n), which leaves a 1 by (n-1) strip of gumdrops on the left and an (n-1) by n rectangle of gumdrops above the poison gumdrop. 2. Every subsequent move by player 2 can be \\"mirrored\\" by player 1. If player 2 eats a rectangle of gumdrops with the bottom right corner at (x, y), player 1 should then eat the rectangle with the bottom right corner at (y, x), thereby maintaining a symmetric configuration of remaining gumdrops with respect to the diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right of the non-poisoned section. 3. By maintaining symmetry, player 1 ensures that player 2 is never able to eat the last non-poisoned gumdrop without also consuming the poison gumdrop because the symmetry forces player 2 to mirror any move that would leave a lone gumdrop next to the poison. **Proof by Induction:** *Base Case*: For a 2x2 grid where player 1 eats the gumdrop at position (2, 2), the only move left for player 2 is to eat the poisoned gumdrop, so player 1 wins. *Inductive Step*: Assume the strategy works for an n-1 by n-1 grid. For an n by n grid, after player 1 makes the initial move, the remaining grid effectively becomes an n-1 by n-1 grid. By the induction hypothesis, player 1 can always win this smaller game by maintaining the symmetry of moves. So, by induction, player 1 can win the game on an n by n grid by following the same strategy. Therefore, by induction, the strategy holds for all n ≥ 2 and player 1 can always win the game of Gumdrop if they make the first move correctly and follow the mirror strategy."},{"prompt":"exactly when was your knowledge cut off?","completion":"My apologies for any confusion earlier.

However, having just one pair in non-decreasing order does not mean that all digits of the whole number are in non-decreasing order. We need to check all the pairs recursively. The corrected line, \`if (prev > last) return false;\`, makes it so that we only return \`false\` if we find a pair of digits that violates the non-decreasing order, meaning that the previous digit \`prev\` is greater than the \`last\` digit. Here's the full function with the change: \`\`\`cpp bool increasing(unsigned int a) { if (a < 10) { // If it's a single-digit number, it's trivially in non-decreasing order. return true; } if (!increasing(a / 10)) return false; // Check the rest of the number recursively. int last = a % 10; // The least significant digit int prev = (a / 10) % 10; // The second least significant digit /* Make your changes only below this line. */ if (prev > last) return false; // Return false if we find a decreasing order. return true; // If no decreasing order has been found, return true. } \`\`\` The base case for recursion is a single-digit number, which is trivially in non-decreasing order (since there are no other digits to compare against). If the number has more than one digit, we continue to check each pair (\`prev\` and \`last\`) as we recurse. If ever \`prev > last\`, it means that we've found a pair that is not in non-decreasing order, and we can short-circuit the rest of the checks by returning false. By removing the \`return true;\` after the \`if\` condition, we allow the recursion to continue until we reach the base case—a single-digit number—or find a pair of digits that violates the order. The rest of the time, if the \`if\` condition isn't met, the function implicitly falls through to the final \`return true;\`, which would only be reached if all pairs have been checked and are in non-decreasing order."},{"prompt":"below is the correct solution, explains why that is bool increasing(unsigned int a) { if (a > 0) { if (!increasing (a/10)) return false; int last = a % 10; //the least significant digit //the second least significant digit, 0 if a < 10 int prev = (a / 10) % 10; if (prev <= last) return true; return false; } return true; }","completion":"The corrected function you've given switches the final return value from \`false\` to \`true\` in the base case where \`a\` has been reduced through recursive division to \`0\`. Here's why this change corrects the function: \`\`\`cpp bool increasing(unsigned int a) { if (a > 0) { if (!increasing(a/10)) return false; // Recursive call int last = a % 10; // Least significant digit int prev = (a / 10) % 10; // Second least significant digit if (prev <= last) return true; // If in correct order, continue return false; // If not, terminate with false } return true; // Base case: all digits are in non-decreasing order } \`\`\` The reasoning behind the logic is as follows: 1. When \`a\` is greater than \`0\`, the function checks if the number formed by the digits to the left of the current least significant digit are in non-decreasing order by making a recursive call with \`a/10\`. It strips away the current least significant digit and checks the remainder of the number. 2. If the recursive call returns \`false\`, it means that somewhere to the left (in the more significant portion of the number), the digits are not in non-decreasing order. In this case, we return \`false\` immediately, as the entire number cannot be in non-decreasing order. 3. If the recursive call does not find any issues, we then compare the second least significant digit (\`prev\`) to the least significant digit (\`last\`). If \`prev\` is less than or equal to \`last\`, the digits are in non-decreasing order up to this point, and the function returns \`true\`, effectively saying \\"so far, so good,\\" and allowing the recursion to proceed further, or end if this was the last pair. 4. If \`prev\` is greater than \`last\`, we return \`false\` because we've found a pair of digits that breaks the non-decreasing order. 5. Now, the crucial part: the base case. After reducing \`a\` recursively to \`0\` (meaning we've checked all the digits in the number and haven't found any in decreasing order), we need to return \`true\`. Prior to the change, this function always returned \`false\`, which was an incorrect base case value. The \`return true;\` statement at the end of the \`if (a > 0)\` block is the base case for an empty number (after all digits have been checked), and should indeed return \`true\`. This base case is essential for the initial call to \`increasing(a)\` when \`a\` itself might be a single digit, in which case we should consider it as increasing (since there are no prior digits to compare it with). By ensuring that \`return true;\` is executed when we reach a point where \`a == 0\`, the function correctly identifies numbers with digits in non-decreasing order."},{"prompt":"Design an algorithm to answer the following question: What is the total number of ways that you, who can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time, can reach the top of a staircase with n levels?","completion":"The problem you're describing is analogous to a Fibonacci sequence. Each step to reach level \`n\` can be seen as either coming from the level directly below it (\`n-1\`) or from two levels below (\`n-2\`). This is because you can take either 1 or 2 steps at a time. So, the total number of ways to reach step \`n\` is the sum of the ways to reach step \`n-1\` and the ways to reach step \`n-2\`. Here is how you can design the algorithm: 1. If \`n\` is 0, there is 1 way to be at the top (you start there). 2. If \`n\` is 1, there is also 1 way to get there (1 step). 3. For all \`n > 1\`, the number of ways to reach level \`n\` is \`ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)\`. You can implement this in two ways: recursively or iteratively. **Recursive algorithm (less efficient):** \`\`\`python def count_ways(n): if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1 else: return count_ways(n-1) + count_ways(n-2) \`\`\` The recursive algorithm is very simple and elegant but inefficient for large \`n\` due to the number of repeated calls. This can be seen as a tree of recursive calls where the same values are calculated multiple times. To make it more efficient, you can use memoization or an iterative approach. **Iterative algorithm (efficient):** \`\`\`python def count_ways(n): if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1 a, b = 1, 1 for i in range(2, n+1): total = a + b a = b b = total return b \`\`\` The iterative algorithm uses two variables to keep track of the two previous numbers and works its way up to \`n\`, calculating the number of ways at each step. This is very efficient and runs in linear time, O(n). **Dynamic Programming (efficient with large \`n\`):** Lastly, a dynamic programming approach is similar to the iterative one but stores the previously calculated results in an array or list for possible reuse later on. \`\`\`python def count_ways(n): if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1 ways = [0] * (n + 1) ways[0], ways[1] = 1, 1 for i in range(2, n + 1): ways[i] = ways[i-1] + ways[i-2] return ways[n] \`\`\` For large values of \`n\`, the dynamic programming or iterative approach is preferred over the recursive approach due to efficiency.

The next steps are based on this incorrect assumption: [ a^{k+1} = (a^k cdot a^k) cdot frac{a^{k-1}}{a^{k-1}} ] Here the proof is trying to introduce a fraction of (a^{k-1} / a^{k-1}) (which equals 1), with the intention of applying the inductive hypothesis to both (a^k) and (a^{k-1}), which are assumed to equal 1. However, since the very starting point of this manipulation is incorrect, the resulting conclusion is also incorrect. The proof claims that both (a^k) and (a^{k-1} = 1) by the inductive hypothesis, but the inductive hypothesis only holds for the specific case where (n = k), not for (n = k+1). Therefore, one cannot conclude that (a^{k+1} = 1) from (a^k = 1) without additional valid algebraic steps.

Understand the requirements, scope, and timeline in order to prioritize tasks that align with the project's overall objectives. 2. Identify dependencies: Identify and analyze tasks that are dependent on each other. Prioritize tasks that are critical to the project's success and cannot be started until certain dependencies are met. 3. Estimate time and effort: Work with the project team to estimate the time and effort required for each task. Consider factors such as complexity, dependencies, and resources needed to complete each task. 4. Use prioritization techniques: Techniques such as the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) or the Eisenhower matrix (urgent vs. important) can help prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency. 5. Consider risks and impact: Evaluate potential risks and their impact on the project. Prioritize tasks that address high-risk areas or have a significant impact on the project's success. Real-world example: Let's say you are working on a project to develop a new e-commerce website. During the planning phase, you identify several key tasks such as designing the user interface, implementing payment processing functionality, and setting up secure customer account management. To prioritize tasks and resources in this scenario, you may: 1. Prioritize tasks based on customer impact: Implementing payment processing functionality may be prioritized over other tasks, as it directly impacts the website's ability to generate revenue. 2. Consider dependencies: Designing the user interface may be prioritized before implementing payment processing, as the UI design needs to be finalized before integrating payment functionality. 3. Estimate time and effort: Allocate resources based on the estimated time and effort required for each task. If implementing payment processing requires specialized skills or integration with third-party APIs, allocate resources accordingly. 4. Mitigate risks: Identify potential risks such as security vulnerabilities in customer account management and prioritize tasks that address these risks early in the project.

Here's an example of how to use Swagger annotations in a Spring WebFlux controller: \`\`\`java import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*; import io.swagger.annotations.*; @RestController @RequestMapping(\\"/tasks\\") @Api(value = \\"Task Management System\\", description = \\"Operations pertaining to tasks in Task Management System\\") public class TaskController { @GetMapping(\\"/{id}\\") @ApiOperation(value = \\"Get a task by ID\\", response = Task.class) @ApiResponses(value = { @ApiResponse(code = 200, message = \\"Successfully retrieved task\\"), @ApiResponse(code = 404, message = \\"Task not found\\") }) public Task getTaskById(@PathVariable Long id) { // Implementation goes here } // Other endpoint methods with appropriate annotations } \`\`\` 4. Access Swagger UI for API documentation: Once the Swagger configurations and annotations are set up, you can access the Swagger UI by navigating to \`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/\` in your web browser. Here, you can see all the API endpoints documented with descriptions, request parameters, response types, and possible error codes. By following these steps, you can effectively document API endpoints using Swagger in your Spring Boot application. This documentation helps developers understand and interact with your RESTful services more easily."},{"prompt":"What best known alternatives to Swagger are there in the industry?","completion":"There are several alternatives to Swagger in the industry that provide similar functionalities for documenting and testing APIs. Some of the best-known alternatives to Swagger are: 1. **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)**: Formerly known as Swagger Specification, OAS is an open-source format for describing APIs that is widely used for API documentation and visualization. It is the foundation for the Swagger tools and is supported by a large ecosystem of tools and frameworks. 2. **RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language)**: RAML is a YAML-based language for describing RESTful APIs. It allows developers to create a rich, human-readable API documentation that includes all the details of the API, such as request/response models, headers, query parameters, and more. 3. **API Blueprint**: API Blueprint is another popular API documentation format that uses Markdown syntax to define API endpoints, methods, request/response formats, and error codes. It has a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to read and write. 4. **Postman**: Postman is a comprehensive API development tool that includes features for designing, testing, and documenting APIs. It provides a visual interface for creating API documentation, defining endpoints, and setting up tests. 5. **Apigee**: Apigee is a full lifecycle API management platform that offers tools for API design, testing, documentation, and analytics. It provides a centralized platform for designing and managing APIs with features for security, scalability, and monitoring. 6. **Stoplight**: Stoplight is an API design platform that includes tools for creating API specifications, visualizing API models, generating documentation, and testing APIs. It focuses on creating a design-first approach to API development. Each of these alternatives has its own strengths and features, so it's important to evaluate them based on your specific requirements and preferences for API documentation and management. Ultimately, the choice of tool will depend on factors such as ease of use, integration with existing tools and processes, community support, and overall fit for your API development workflow."},{"prompt":"Explain detailedly how can I use Postman to generate the documentation of a REST API, giving examples.","completion":"Postman is a popular API development tool that allows users to design, test, and document APIs. It provides a visual interface for creating API requests, organizing endpoints, and generating API documentation. Here is a detailed guide on how to use Postman to generate documentation for a REST API: 1. **Create and Organize API Requests**: Start by organizing your API requests in Postman collections. Each collection can represent a group of related endpoints or a specific API service. You can create folders within collections to further organize your requests. 2. **Add Descriptions and Information**: For each request in your collection, make sure to add descriptions and comments to describe the purpose of the endpoint, input parameters, expected responses, and any additional information that is relevant for documentation. 3. **Generate Documentation**: Once you have organized and added descriptions to your API requests, you can generate documentation in Postman. Here's how you can do it: - In the Postman app, navigate to the collection you want to create documentation for. - Click on the \\"...\\" (three dots) next to the collection name and select \\"View in web\\" to open the collection in the Postman web dashboard. - In the web dashboard, click on the \\"Documentation\\" tab in the top navigation bar. - Click on the \\"Build\\" button to generate documentation based on the requests and descriptions in your collection. 4. **Customize Documentation**: Postman allows you to customize and refine the generated documentation to suit your needs. You can reorder endpoints, edit descriptions, add additional content, and include images or examples to make the documentation more informative and user-friendly. 5. **Export Documentation**: Once you are satisfied with the documentation, you can export it in different formats such as HTML, Markdown, or PDF. This allows you to share the API documentation with team members, stakeholders, or consumers of the API. 6. **Automatic Sync with API Changes**: Postman allows you to keep your documentation up-to-date by automatically syncing changes made to your API requests in the collection. This ensures that the documentation reflects the latest state of the API without manual intervention. Example: Let's consider an example where you have a collection in Postman containing endpoints for managing a user profile API. You have requests for creating a user profile, updating user details, retrieving user information, and deleting a user profile. In Postman, you can add descriptions to each request, specifying the request method, endpoint URL, request body, expected response, and any other relevant details. Once you have organized and documented all the requests in the collection, you can follow the steps mentioned above to generate documentation for the user profile API. The generated documentation will include details of each endpoint, descriptions, request/response formats, parameters, headers, and any additional information you provided. You can further customize the documentation to enhance its readability and usability for users accessing the API."},{"prompt":"Random popular minimalist scene, one word with coffee before it","completion":"Coffee Zen"},{"prompt":"当前api","completion":"\\"当前API\\" 在中文中通常意味着 \\"current API\\" 或者 \\"the API at present\\"。API (Application Programming Interface) 是软件系统中允许应用程序之间通信的一组规则和工具。一般来说，当前API指的是某个特定时刻，某个系统或服务所提供用于开发者或其他系统访问和交互的API。 如果你需要具体的信息或者关于某个具体API的细节，你需要提供进一步的上下文，例如API的名称、它服务的平台、或者你希望实现的功能。不同的API有不同的使用方法和它们可能需要的凭证（如API密钥或令牌），以及它们提供的数据或功能也各不相同。"},{"prompt":"win10微软商店打不开解决方法","completion":"如果您的Windows 10操作系统中的微软商店无法打开，您可以尝试以下方法解决问题： 1. **故障排除器**: - 转到“设置” > “更新和安全” > “故障排除”。 - 找到“Windows商店应用”故障排除器并运行它。 2. **重置商店缓存**: - 按下\`Windows\`键 + \`R\`打开运行对话框。 - 输入 \`wsreset.exe\` 并按回车，将会清除缓存并重新启动商店。 3. **检查时间和区域设置**: - 确保您的计算机日期和时间设置正确，且区域设置正确。 4. **重新注册商店应用**: - 在搜索栏输入\`PowerShell\`，右键点击“Windows PowerShell”并选择“以管理员身份运行”。 - 输入以下命令并回车： \`\`\` Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register \\"(_.InstallLocation)AppXManifest.xml\\"} \`\`\` 5. **检查Windows更新**: - 前往“设置” > “更新和安全” > “Windows更新”。 - 点击“检查更新”，确保您的系统是最新的。 6. **创建新的用户帐户**: - 有时候，创建一个新的用户帐户并在新账户登录会解决问题。 7. **更新Windows商店应用**: - 如果可以打开但是移动不正常，尝试从商店更新微软商店应用。 8. **禁用第三方防火墙或杀毒软件**: - 临时禁用任何第三方防火墙或杀毒软件，因为它们可能会阻止商店应用运行。 9. **恢复系统文件**: - 使用系统文件检查器工具来修复缺失或损坏的系统文件。打开命令提示符（管理员）并输入 \`sfc /scannow\`。 10. **完整更新或重置**: - 如果以上步骤都没有解决问题，您可能需要考虑使用“重置此PC”功能来重置Windows，或者执行干净的系统安装。 在尝试以上任何步骤时，请确保您的文件和重要数据进行备份以防止丢失。如果您在执行上述步骤时遇到任何麻烦，建议联系专业人士或微软官方支持寻求帮助。"},{"prompt":"vedal是谁","completion":"截至我所知的信息更新时间点（2023年3月），\\"Vedal\\" 这个词既可能是一个人名，也可能是一个品牌名或者是其他类型的名字。因为它不是一个广为人知的名词或公众人物的名字，所以可能需要其他上下文信息来准确确定“Vedal”是谁或者指的是什么。 如果“Vedal”是指的一个特定的个人或者组织，那么可能需要更多具体信息来确定其身份或者它代表的含义。例如，如果这是一个在网络上活动的艺术家、内容创造者或者企业家的昵称，那么可能需要访问相关网站或者社交媒体平台来了解更多。 如果你有更多的上下文信息，或者是指一个特定的领域（比如学术界、文化艺术、科技行业等），请提供详细信息，以便于更准确地回答你关于“Vedal”的问题。"},{"prompt":"neuro sama是谁","completion":"截至我的知识更新时间（2023年3月），\\"Neuro-sama\\" 并不是一个广泛认知的名字，可能是一个化名、在线用户名、艺术家名字，或者是某个社群或领域里的特定个体。 在日语中，“sama”是对某人的高度尊敬的称呼，通常比“san”更正式、更尊敬。此外，“neuro”一词通常和神经学（neurology）或神经科学(neuroscience)有关。结合两者，“Neuro-sama”可能是某个在这个领域有专长的个体的昵称，或者是网络上某个用户选择的昵称。 如果“Neuro-sama”在具体的社群、领域或网络平台里有一定知名度，你可能需要提供更多的上下文信息或者参考特定的源头（例如社交媒体、论坛等）来获取相关的信息。如果这是一个在特定的媒体、游戏或是网络社区中的角色名称，相应地搜索可能会寻找到具体的信息和详情。"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Coffee Zen","completion":"\\"Coffee Zen | Modern Minimalist Art Design | Versatile for Mugs, T-Shirts, Prints | Serene Café Vibes Decor\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Coffee Zen | Modern Minimalist Art Design | Versatile for Mugs, T-Shirts, Prints | Serene Café Vibes Decor.

However, it likely intends to convey information about a dish or a meal that is commonly served with two accompaniments: a type of bread roll and rice prepared in a flavorful way. Let's break it down: - \\"You serve it\\": This refers to a practice of serving a particular dish. \\"It\\" likely represents a main dish, such as a protein (meat, fish, tofu, etc.), a stew, a curry, or any other central component of a meal. - \\"With roll\\": A \\"roll\\" in this context typically refers to a small round bread that is baked and can be used to sop up sauces or gravies, as well as provide a starchy component to the meal. Rolls can be made from various types of dough and might include ingredients like wheat, rye, or sourdough. They might be plain or have additions like herbs, cheese, or seeds. - \\"And rice taste\\": This is where the phrase gets tricky. It seems to imply that rice is prepared in a flavorful way (\\"taste\\" suggesting that it's not plain rice). The word \\"taste\\" could be a mistranslation or typo of a specific cooking style or flavor profile (e.g., \\"with a rich taste\\"). The rice could be seasoned with spices, herbs, stocks, or sauces to complement the main dish. Examples include rice pilaf, saffron rice, or fried rice, all of which have distinctive flavors that differentiate them from plain white rice. Given these components, the phrase might be describing a typical serving suggestion for a certain cuisine or dish. For example, in a Caribbean meal, you could serve jerk chicken (the \\"it\\") with a side of coconut rice (\\"rice taste\\") and fried plantains or bread rolls. In an Asian context, you could have a curry (\\"it\\") served with fragrant jasmine rice (\\"rice taste\\") and a side of bread such as naan or a steamed bun (a type of \\"roll\\"). If you're looking for more precise advice or a description of a specific dish, you'll need to provide a clearer or more complete context from which this phrase was taken."},{"prompt":"Задача 2.

The training data for these large language models consists predominantly of copyrighted works. This Article explores how generative AI fits within fair use rulings established in relation to previous generations of copy-reliant technology, including software reverse engineering, automated plagiarism detection systems, and the text-data mining at the heart of the landmark HathiTrust and Google Books cases. Although there is no machine learning exception to the principle of nonexpressive use, the largeness of likelihood models suggest that they are capable of memorizing and reconstituting works in the training data, something that is incompatible with nonexpressive use. At the moment, memorization is an edge case. For the most part, the link between the training data and the output of generative AI is attenuated by a process of decomposition, abstraction, and remix. Generally, pseudo-expression generated by large language models does not infringe copyright because these models “learn” latent features and associations within the training data; they do not memorize snippets of original expression from individual works. However, this Article identifies situations in the context of text-to-image models where memorization of the training data is more likely. The computer science literature suggests that memorization is more likely when models are trained on many duplicates of the same work, images are associated with unique text descriptions, and the ratio of the size of the model to the training data is relatively large. This Article shows how these problems are accentuated in the context of copyrightable characters and proposes a set of guidelines for “Copyright Safety for Generative AI” to reduce the risk of copyright infringement. I. Introduction After years of speculation and prediction, we are finally living in a world of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) that passes the Turing Test. Earlier computer systems for producing text, images, and music lacked the flexibility, generality, and ease of use of the current breed of generative AIs that are based on large language models (LLMs) (also known as foundation models), such as ChatGPT, DALL·E 2, and Stable Diffusion.[1] By entering a few short prompts into ChatGPT, a user can generate plausible analysis of complicated questions, such as defining the literary style of Salmon Rushdie or explaining the facts and significance of Marbury v. Madison.[2] Figure 1 Figure 1:ChatGPT on Salmon Rushdie ChatGPT can do more than summarize landmark Supreme Court cases; its facility with style transfer is such that it can translate the same content into a hip-hop style or a fifth-grade reading level.[3] Similarly, a few simple words typed into DALL·E 2 or Midjourney will produce an arresting image of “a cup of coffee that is also a portal to another dimension” or a disturbing portrait of “the future of drowned London.”[4] Figure 2 Figure 2:DALL·E 2 prompt: “a cup of coffee that is also a portal to another dimension” (left); Midjourney prompt: “the future of drowned London” (right)[5] LLMs are trained on millions, tens of millions, and perhaps even hundreds of millions of digital objects that are generally eligible for copyright protection.[6] Because this training necessarily involves copying the underlying texts, sounds, and images, questions about the copyright implications of generative AI are inevitable. It is tempting to mischaracterize generative AI simply as a more flexible version of either Napster or the HathiTrust digital library. Opponents point to the fact that platforms, such as Midjourney, rely on copyrighted inputs, and that upon the receipt of brief and often perfunctory user requests (i.e., prompts), these platforms will convert inputs into digital objects that could easily substitute for items in the original training data.[7] By these lights, generative AI is just another tool of consumer piracy that allows users to benefit from the labor of artists without paying for it. Proponents, on the other hand, are quick to point to cases such as Authors Guild Inc. v. HathiTrust[8] and Authors Guild v. Google,[9] which confirmed the legality of copying to extract metadata on a vast scale and, in the case of Google, with a clear commercial motivation.[10] The metadata derived from library digitization in these cases was used to enhance the searchability of books and as the foundation for digital humanities research—much of which also involved machine learning.[11] Viewed this way, generative AI is exactly the same as the digitization process in HathiTrust: millions of copyrighted works were digitized so that researchers could extract uncopyrightable metadata; that metadata was then used to create new insights and information in the form of a searchable book index and academic articles exploring trends in literature.[12] The analogy to HathiTrust is overly simplistic. A deeper appreciation of the workings of generative AI suggests that the copyright questions are more complicated. We should embrace this complexity. Although sweeping claims that generative AI is predicated on massive copyright infringement are misplaced, there are specific—but perhaps rare—contexts where the process of creating generative AI may cross the line from fair use to infringement because these large language models sometimes “memorize” the training data rather than simply “learning” from it.[13] To reduce the risk of copyright infringement by large language models, this Article proposes a set of Best Practices for Copyright Safety for Generative AI. This Article focuses primarily on copyright risks in relation to text-to-image generative AI models. Many of the conclusions and recommendations apply with equal force to other forms of generative AI; however, chatbots, code-creation tools, music generation AIs, and multi-modal systems may each raise additional issues and complications meriting more detailed exploration. This Article proceeds as follows: Part I explains how U.S. law has addressed similar copyright issues in relation to other forms of copy-reliant technology by recognizing that, in general, nonexpressive use is fair use, and thus noninfringing. This Part refutes the suggestion that machine learning, broadly speaking, should be treated any differently from other nonexpressive uses; it then addresses the more plausible argument that the LLMs used in generative AI might demand different treatment because of their potential for memorization. Part II dives into the technical details of generative AI and explains why, in the vast majority of cases, the link between copyrighted works in the training data and generative AI outputs is highly attenuated by a process of decomposition, abstraction, and remix. Generally, pseudo-expression generated by LLMs does not infringe copyright because these models “learn” latent features and associations within the training data; they do not memorize snippets of original expression from individual works. Part III then explores edge cases where copyright infringement by LLMs is not only possible but perhaps likely. In the context of text-to-image models, memorization of the training data is more likely when models are trained on many duplicates of the same work, images are associated with unique text descriptions, and the ratio of the size of the model to the training data is relatively large. This Article shows how these problems are accentuated in the context of copyrightable characters. Finally, Part IV takes the lessons from the previous Parts and restates them as an initial proposal for Best Practices for Copyright Safety for Generative AI. II. Limits on the Fair Use Status of Machine Learning A. Nonexpressive Use by Copy-Reliant Technology Is Generally Fair Use At the time of writing, two of the biggest names in text-to-image AI, Stability AI and Midjourney, face lawsuits accusing them of, among other things, massive copyright infringement.[14] Getty Images is the plaintiff in one suit, and the other is a class action filed by digital artist Sarah Andersen.[15] On the surface, these complaints are more than plausible because it seems obvious that the machine learning models at the heart of these cases were trained on thousands of Getty Images’ copyrighted photos and millions of works by people like Sarah Andersen—all without permission.[16] However, to prevail the plaintiffs must show that a long line of fair use cases upholding similar forms of nonexpressive use by copy-reliant technologies were wrongly decided or do not apply to generative AI.[17] Courts in the United States have agreed that copying without permission is fair use, and thus noninfringing, in the context of software reverse engineering,[18] plagiarism detection software,[19] and the digitization of millions of library books to enable meta-analysis and indexing.[20] All of these cases involved commercial defendants that made large numbers of exact copies—except for the nonprofit HathiTrust.[21] These are just a few cases, from a body of case law stretching back 300 years to the invention of copyright itself, demonstrating that not all copying is created equal.[22] The Copyright Act gives the owners of copyrighted works the exclusive right to reproduce those works in copies, but this right is expressly subject to the principle of fair use.[23] The fair use doctrine helps make sense of copyright law because otherwise, every mechanical act of reproducing copyrighted works, in whole or in substantial part, would infringe regardless of the purpose or effect of that reproduction. Why should the law fetishize a mechanical or technical action without regard to the motivation for the action and its consequences? The short answer is that it does not. If copyright law made no allowance for commentary, criticism, or parody—to give just three examples—it would inhibit reference to and reinterpretation of existing works and, thus, contradict the utilitarian purpose for which copyright was established.[24] As I have explored elsewhere, the fair use cases dealing with copy-reliant technology reflect the view that nonexpressive uses of copyrighted works should be treated as fair use.[25] The fair use status of nonexpressive use is not a special exception for the technology sector.[26] Rather, the rationale for allowing for-profit and academic researchers to derive valuable data from other people’s copyrighted works is a necessary implication of the fundamental distinction between protectable original expression and unprotectable facts, ideas, abstractions, and functional elements.[27] Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust is illustrative.[28] HathiTrust provided a digital repository for the digitized collections of the university libraries participating in the Google Books project.[29] HathiTrust was formed to accelerate research in the digital humanities—an intellectual movement seeking to bring empirical and computational techniques to humanities disciplines, such as history and literature.[30] One of the most important tools for digital humanities research is text data mining. Text data mining is an umbrella term referring to “computational processes for applying structure to unstructured electronic texts and employing statistical methods to discover new information and reveal patterns in the processed data.”[31] In other words, text data mining refers to any process using computers that creates metadata derived from something that was not initially conceived of as data. Text data mining can be used to produce statistics and facts about copyrightable works, but it can also be used to render copyrighted text, sounds, and images into uncopyrightable abstractions. These abstractions are not the same as, or even substantially similar to, the original expression, but in combination, they are interesting and useful for generating insights about the original expression. Accordingly, theorists have argued,[32] and courts have ruled, that technical acts of copying that do not communicate the original expression to a new audience do not interfere with the interest in original expression that copyright is designed to protect.[33] For example, in HathiTrust, the court of appeals explained that: [T]he creation of a full-text searchable database is a quintessentially transformative use [because] the result of a word search is different in purpose, character, expression, meaning, and message from the page (and the book) from which it is drawn. Indeed, we can discern little or no resemblance between the original text and the results of the HDL full-text search.[34] A differently constituted panel of the Second Circuit reached much the same conclusion in the Google Books litigation.[35] The fair use status of text data mining is now so well entrenched that it is recognized by the U.S. Copyright Office,[36] and jurisdictions outside the United States have scrambled to augment their own copyright laws with similar exceptions and limitations.[37] Consequently, an abrupt reversal of the HathiTrust and Google Books precedents seems quite unlikely.[38] However, despite the emerging international consensus that text data mining should not amount to copyright infringement,[39] some have questioned whether the logic and authority of cases such as HathiTrust extend to machine learning[40] or to the particular type of machine learning that underpins generative AI. B. Machine Learning and Generative AI 1. There Is No Machine Learning Exception to the Principle of Nonexpressive Use The suggestion that the broad affordance for text data mining as fair use announced in HathiTrust does not apply to machine learning is confounding.[41] There is no principled reason why deriving metadata through technical acts of copying and analyzing that metadata through logistic regression should be fair use, but analyzing that data by training a machine learning classifier to perform a different kind of logistic regression that produces a predictive model should not be.[42] Indeed, digital humanities research using machine learning was one of the primary use cases motivating the creation of the HathiTrust.[43] I cannot speak for the parties or the other amici involved in the HathiTrust and Google Books cases, but the only reason my coauthors and I did not explicitly talk about machine learning in our influential digital humanities briefs filed in those cases was that we thought it would be unnecessarily specific.[44] Digitizing library books to derive valuable but uncopyrightable metadata should constitute fair use because the derived data does not substitute for any author’s original expression. Whether that data is used in more traditional empirical analysis or machine learning is no one’s business. 2. Distinguishing Generative AI Although there is no reason to think that courts would, or should, apply the principle of nonexpressive use differently to text data mining when it is used in machine learning, it is fair to point out that the rulings in cases such as iParadigms, HathiTrust, and Google Books were predicated on a technological paradigm that now seems quaint.[45] Recent advances in generative AI present at least two challenges to the theory of nonexpressive use. Both relate to the fact that these systems produce much more than information about expression; they are now the engines of new content creation.[46] Benjamin Sobel argues that AI faces a “fair use crisis” because machine learning models that can create digital artifacts that are broadly equivalent to copyrightable human expression are not nonexpressive.[47] Essentially, he treats expressive outputs as inconsistent with nonexpressive use. However, the fact that LLMs can produce quasi-expressive works does not necessarily negate the application of the nonexpressive use principle.[48] There is no inherent problem with generative AI’s ability to create new content that is equivalent to human expression. For the most part, the copyright implications of the new wave of LLMs are no different from earlier applications of text data mining. Most of the time, when a user enters a prompt into ChatGPT or Midjourney, for example, the model output bears no resemblance to any particular input or set of inputs, except at an abstract and unprotectable level.[49] Accordingly, even though ChatGPT can write moving poetry,[50] and Midjourney can render simple instructions into compelling artworks, these machine learning models still qualify as nonexpressive use so long as the outputs are not substantially similar to any particular original expression in the training data. If the nonexpressive use framework did not allow the subsequent generation of new noninfringing expression, the digital humanities researchers who currently rely on the rulings in HathiTrust and Google Books could statistically analyze vast libraries of text to generate new insights about literature and society, but they would not be able to write about it afterwards. Such a result would run contrary to the constitutional objective for copyright law “[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.”[51] Sobel’s argument that generative AI falls outside the scope of nonexpressive use is mistaken, in my view, because what matters is not whether a copy-reliant technology is used to create something equivalent to human expression; what matters is whether the original expression of the authors of works in the training data is communicated to a new public. New noninfringing expression is not a problem—new expression shows that the system is working.[52] Nonetheless, there are potential differences between generative AI based on LLMs and the technologies courts have previously regarded as fair use. The critical difference is that, although LLMs do not generally produce pseudo-expressive works that mimic their training data, they may do so under specific circumstances, particularly in the context of copyrightable characters and analogous situations.[53] C. The Problem of “Memorization” On February 3, 2023, media-licensing behemoth Getty Images filed a lawsuit in Delaware federal court accusing the generative AI company, Stability AI, of brazen copyright and trademark infringement of Getty’s owned and licensed images “on a staggering scale.”[54] Getty argues that every instance of copying without permission attributable to Stability AI’s training of the Stable Diffusion model amounts to copyright infringement.[55] This broad claim would require the court to reject or distinguish cases like HathiTrust. Significantly, Getty also argues that “Stable Diffusion at times produces images that are highly similar to and derivative of the Getty Images proprietary content that Stability AI copied extensively in the course of training the model.”[56] If true, HathiTrust and Google Books are easily distinguished. Getty illustrates the potential similarity between outputs from the Stable Diffusion model and Getty’s own copyrighted images with the following pair of images in Figure 3.[57] Figure 3 Figure 3:Getty Images Comparison of training data to model output[58] On a very cursory inspection, the comparison between the two images seems compelling: these are both pictures of soccer players in broadly similar uniforms, in broadly similar poses, taken from roughly the same angle, with roughly the same depth of field effect. However, looking closer, Getty’s comparison of a spectacular photo (left) of Tottenham Hotspur’s Christian Eriksen getting tackled by Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson—who are clearly identifiable to anyone familiar with international football—and the awkward convulsions of their mutant doppelgangers (right) is unconvincing. The causal connection between the photos is apparent, but the grotesque distortion of the players’ bodies and faces throws the question of substantial similarity into doubt. Substantial similarity requires a quantitative and qualitative assessment, and if we follow the Second Circuit’s approach in Arnstein v. Porter and ask whether the picture on the right “took from [Getty’s photograph] so much of what is pleasing to the [eyes] of lay [viewers], who comprise the audience for whom such [photos are created], that defendant wrongfully appropriated something which belongs to the plaintiff,”[59] the answer is: probably not. The original photo is compelling because of the specific angle of the shot and the way it captures Henderson’s attempts to tackle the ball from Eriksen and the way Eriksen uses his body to block the tackle. It is also compelling because in silhouette the two players form a windmill—making the photo artistic as well as communicative. In the Stable Diffusion photo, the unique perspective is lost, no one is in control of the ball, and there is no tackle nor windmill silhouette—just two bizarre, disfigured football golems haunting the field. Despite the arguable lack of similarity in their hand-picked example, Getty’s broader point is correct. Even just a few years ago, the notion that a machine learning model would memorize enough details about specific examples in the training data to recreate those examples seemed unlikely.[60] The information loss inherent in reducing the training data down to a model through machine learning should have virtually guaranteed that there could only be an abstract relationship between the inputs and the outputs. As discussed in more detail in the remainder of this Article, LLMs are now so large that we must take seriously the prospect that they may essentially “memorize” particular works in the training data. If the model memorizes the training data, it might communicate original expression from the training data via its output.[61] This is a big deal. If ordinary and foreseeable uses of generative AI result in model outputs that would infringe on the inputs no matter what intervening technological steps were involved, then the nonexpressive use rationale would no longer apply.[62] If training LLMs on copyrighted works is not justified in terms of nonexpressive use, then there is no obvious fair use rationale to replace it, except perhaps in the noncommercial research sector. If LLMs just took expressive works and conveyed that same expression to a new audience with no additional commentary or criticism, or no distinct informational purpose,[63] that would be a very poor candidate for fair use.[64] III. The Attenuated Link Between Training Data and Model Output Although every machine learning model is a reflection of its underlying training data, LLMs are (mostly) not copies of their training data; thus, the outputs generated from these models are (mostly) not copies of their training data either. Part III of this Article explains why the parentheticals in the previous sentence were required and what that means for copyright law. But for now, this Part focuses on understanding the connection between LLMs and their training data, and on the various ways in which that connection is ordinarily diluted and complicated. A. Language Models: An Introduction The processes by which generative AI models produce convincing text and images might seem unrelated, but they have more in common than almost anyone without a computer science degree could imagine. Everyone reading this Article will likely be familiar with ChatGPT, a text-based LLM created by OpenAI and made available to the general public in late 2022.[65] Although ChatGPT took much of the world by surprise, at its initial release it was simply a refined version of OpenAI’s generative pre-trained transformer version 3 (GPT-3), an autoencoder that had been available to a limited group of registered users since 2020.[66] What’s an autoencoder? Be patient and you will soon find out. But in the meantime, note that Stable Diffusion is also an “autoencoder,” so it must be important. What’s so special about LLMs? LLMs are machine learning models trained on large quantities of unlabeled text in a self-supervised manner.[67] LLMs are a relatively recent phenomena made possible by the falling cost of data storage and computational power and by a new kind of model called a transformer.[68] One of the key differences between transformers and the prior state of the art, recurrent neural networks (RNNs),[69] is that rather than looking at each word sequentially, a transformer first notes the position of the words.[70] The ability to interpret these “positional encodings” makes the system sensitive to word order and context, which is useful because a great deal of meaning depends on sequence and context.[71] Positional encoding is also important because it facilitates parallel processing; this, in turn, explains why throwing staggering amounts of computing power at LLMs works well for transformers, whereas the returns to scale for RNNs were less impressive.[72] Transformers were also a breakthrough technology because of their capacity for “attention” and “self-attention.”[73] In simple terms, in the context of translation, this means that the system pays attention to all the words in source text when deciding how to translate any individual word. Based on the training data, the model learns which words in which contexts it should pay more or less attention to. Through “self-attention,” the system derives fundamental relationships from input data, and thus learns, for example, that “programmer” and “coder” are usually synonyms, and that “server” is a restaurant waiter in one context and a computer in another.[74] Once trained, models like GPT-3 are useful for a variety of tasks because they have learned all sorts of fundamental relationships without ever being explicitly taught any of them.[75] The astonishing capabilities of LLMs are mostly a function of scaling. GPT-3 was trained on millions of books, webpages, and other electronic texts, comprising about 499 billion tokens (thinking of tokens as words is not far off) or forty-five terabytes of data.[76] GPT-4 was trained on 1,000 terabytes (or 1 petabyte) of data.[77] Stable Diffusion was trained on somewhere in the order of 2.3 billion captioned images.[78] In both cases, some of the training data was in the public domain or otherwise unrestricted, but most of it was subject to copyright and copied without express authorization.[79] As for the models themselves, GPT-3 contains 175 billion parameters.[80] To put that in context, consider that if each parameter was one second, the model would stretch 5,425 years—roughly from the first cities in Southern Mesopotamia to the present.[81] GPT-4 is said to have 1.8 trillion parameters![82] DALL·E 2 and Stable Diffusion are much smaller, consisting of a mere 3.5 billion and 890 million parameters, respectively.[83] B. Autoencoding LLMs essentially “learn” latent or abstract concepts inherent in the training data. The learning involved is only a very loose analogy to human cognition—instead, these models learn from the training data in the same way a simple regression model learns an approximation of the relationship between dependent and independent variables.[84] LLMs are more interesting than regression equations because they model relationships across a ridiculous number of dimensions. LLMs can generate new content by manipulating and combining latent concepts acquired during training and then unpacking them.[85] In nontechnical terms, this is what it means to be an autoencoder.[86] In other words, autoencoding is the process of abstracting latent features from the training data and then reconstructing those features, hopefully in new and interesting combinations. Autoencoding is the most important feature to grasp in understanding the copyright issues presented by LLMs. To unpack this concept further, it helps to start small. As illustrated in the Figure below, an autoencoder can compress an image, such as a hand-written number, into a compressed representation and then reconstruct something very close to the original number back from the reduced encoded representation. Figure 4 Figure 4:Autoencoder illustration[87] GPT, Midjourney, and the like are performing the same compression/decompression trick but without the one-to-one relationship between the inputs and the outputs. When a user prompts a generative AI to create “a cup of coffee that is also a portal to another dimension,” the model combines latent representations of coffee cups and dimensional portals deriving from a multitude of images in the training data tagged with those features or with tags that are conceptually related. In DALL·E 2, changing the prompt to tea and “a gateway to another world” has the interesting result of producing lighter, more optimistic images in a way that suggests that the model also encodes a penumbra of contexts and association with coffee, tea, worlds, and dimensions. Figure 5(a) Figure 5(a):Coffee (top) versus tea (bottom) with DALL·E 2 Figure 5(b) Figure 5(b):Coffee (top) versus tea (bottom) with Midjourney Figure 5(c) Figure 5(c):Coffee (top) versus tea (bottom) with Stable Diffusion This contrast is fascinating on many levels, but the key for copyright purposes is to understand that, in general, this process of abstraction, compression, and reconstitution breaks the connection between the original expression in the model inputs (i.e., the training data) and the pseudo-expression in the model outputs (i.e., the new images). The cups in the images above are not any individual coffee cup; they are a combination of vectors that encode a latent idea of a coffee cup as represented in the training data. Generative AI models know nothing of the taste or smell of coffee, but they encode fundamental relationships between pixels that are more likely in pictures with coffee cups than without. Another way to come to terms with the concept of the latent image of a coffee cup is to compare a random set of coffee cup images from the Stable Diffusion training data[88] with a newly rendered “cup of coffee that is also a portal to another dimension.” Figure 6 provides this visualization. Figure 6 Figure 6:From 19 coffee cups (left) to one cup of coffee that is also a portal to another dimension (right) The coffee cup image on the right of Figure 6 has a vague similarity to some of the coffee cup images on the left. The cup is round, it appears to be made of white ceramic, it has a small single handle, the color of the liquid is essentially black, transitioning to brown. However, beyond these generic features, this cup is not substantially similar to any particular image from the training data.[89] If the notion of “the latent concept of a cup of coffee” is too trippy, we can explore the idea of latent concepts with a text-based example by contemplating just how much ChatGPT knows about rabbits. Figure 7 Figure 7:Simon the Rabbit Steps into the Ocean As the example illustrates, GPT knows that rabbits are found in meadows, live in burrows, hop, hide, and have paws. It also knows that rabbits have a reputation for timidity and are characteristically small. GPT’s latent model of rabbit characteristics is an emergent property of the training data. GPT does not just have a latent model for rabbits, but also of how rabbits relate to other concepts like water and oceans. More impressive still, it has a latent model of different literary forms, and of the feeling of stepping into the ocean! In short, within the 175 billion parameters of the GPT model, there are latent representations of information derived from the training data at varying levels of abstraction. Does this count as knowledge? In a literal sense, GPT does not know anything, and it would be a dangerous mistake to think of it as an information retrieval tool or as an agent with knowledge and intentions.[90] GPT is a text prediction tool that responds to prompts with statistically well-informed guesses about what the next word should be, and the word after that, and so on. The complexity and potential weirdness of a 175 billion parameter model and the fact that GPT is making statistically well-informed guesses rather than speaking to us in an attempt to convey an internal mental state goes a long way to explaining why it mostly answers in a well-informed but conventional way, but also why it occasionally hallucinates and sometimes seems quite unhinged.[91] With those essential caveats and qualifications aside, if we think of latent representations derived from the training data and encoded in the model as things GPT “knows,” then we can say that GPT knows a lot about specific topics, logical relationships, and literary modes and conventions. When GPT responds to a user prompt, it is, in effect, combining latent representations at different levels of abstraction to produce a statistically well-informed guess about what the next word should look like. C. Novelty Versus Remix Some question whether generative AI produces novel artifacts or simply remixes existing content.[92] Generative AI is more like papier-mâché than a collage. In papier-mâché, the artist layers pieces of preprinted—and thus copyrighted—paper with a glue-like substance to create a three-dimensional object. Even when the object reveals hints of the copyrighted works in its substrate, it has no meaningful similarity to any of them. In a collage, by way of contrast, the artist combines disparate pre-existing materials through a process of literal cut-and-paste to create a new image. Some collages are so different from the original works from which they are created that they lack even a substantial similarity; many are sufficiently different that they pass the test of transformative use.[93] The critical difference is that for a collage, it is plausible that the new work could infringe on the copyright of some underlying image; for papier-mâché, it is not. 1. Deriving Latent Characteristics Text-to-image models such as DALL·E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney primarily learn a set of latent characteristics associated with image descriptions and then unpack those latent representations to create genuinely new content.[94] In some cases, the model output owes as much to the prompt, the injection of random noise, and guidance from human aesthetic feedback, as it does to the training data.[95] But even when pseudo-expression obviously owes a great deal to the training data, that debt largely consists of uncopyrightable abstractions, not copyrightable expression. The philosophical question of whether pseudo-expression should be considered creative is a distraction from the legal question of whether it amounts to copyright infringement. Even if these models were simply interpolating between specific memorized examples within the training data, the output would only infringe if enough original expression of any particular example were evident in the final product. Returning to the coffee cup example, there are thousands of images in the Stable Diffusion training data associated with “coffee cup” and related concepts. If there were just one coffee cup in the training data, the model would store what is effectively a compressed version of the image and uncompress it in response to a prompt for “coffee cup.” But because there are so many coffee cups, the model stores a more abstract convergence of the features of each individual image. Figure 8 Figure 8:From 15 white coffee cups (left) to four images of “coffee cups on white backgrounds” (right) The image above illustrates the contrast between images with the words “white,” “coffee,” and “cup” in the Stable Diffusion training data and four images produced in Stable Diffusion from the prompt “coffee cups on white backgrounds.” The images on the right-hand side are nothing as simple as a blending together or remix of the training data. The Stable Diffusion model has not simply memorized complicated images involving coffee cups, it has learned something about the latent concept of a coffee cup distinct from cakes, macaroons, sunsets, sunrises, and men with facial hair—all of which can be seen in the training data examples on the left. 2. The Significance of Noise As we have already seen, the relationship between the copyrighted works used to train LLMs and the output of those models is attenuated by abstraction and recombination.[96] But there is more. The relationship is also attenuated by pseudo-random noise. Adding noise to the input data or intermediate layers of the model can help to regularize the learning process and reduce overfitting.[97] In other words, by adding randomness to the training data, the model is forced to learn more generalizable features that are robust to variations in the input. This can lead to improved performance and generalizability of the model when applied to new, unseen data. The introduction of noise at t=0 (before the first step) means that the unpacked image at t=T (the final step) will be different every time. This is why, for example, eight images of “a dystopian vision of downtown Chicago overgrown with plants and subject to flooding” all look somewhat similar, but are each distinct. Figure 9 Figure 9:Eight “dystopian visions of downtown Chicago overgrown with plants and subject to flooding” (Midjourney) Figure 10 Figure 10:Eight “dystopian visions of downtown Chicago overgrown with plants and subject to flooding” (Stable Diffusion) Figures 9 and 10 were rendered using the same text prompt in Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. There are some differences between the two models, but the copyright analysis is the same. Each dystopian image shown above owes something to the thousands of representations of downtown Chicago and the numerous dystopian cityscapes in the training data. Critically, however, it seems unlikely that any of the images would strike the ordinary observer as substantially similar to any particular image in the training data. None of this is an absolute guarantee that text-to-image models will never generate infringing material. Indeed, discussed shortly, LLMs can run afoul of copyright law in certain predictable situations. But in general, it seems that today’s generative AI is a lot more than a simple remix tool. Like all machine learning, LLMs are data dependent, but the relationship between the training data and the model outputs is substantially attenuated by the abstraction inherent in deriving a model from the training data, blending latent concepts, and injecting noise before unpacking them into new creations. IV. Edge Cases Where Copyright Infringement Is More Likely A. What We Learned from Extraction Attacks As seen in the previous Part, although LLMs depend on copyrighted training data, the relationship between the training data and model outputs is attenuated by the process of decomposition and abstraction, the blending of latent concepts, and injection of noise. Over a broad range of use cases, this should ensure that the output of these models does not infringe on the inputs. But this is not always the case. Computer scientists have used various “extraction attacks” to show that, at least in some cases, LLMs effectively memorize significant details of some works in the training data.[98] If memorization is possible, so is copyright infringement.[99] Moreover, any more than a trivial amount of memorization jeopardizes any fair use claim these models have under a theory of nonexpressive use. A recent paper by Nicholas Carlini et al. is representative. Carlini and his coauthors identified 350,000 of the most duplicated images in the Stable Diffusion training data and generated 500 new images using prompts that were identical to the metadata of the original images. Only 109 of the 175 million potential copies could reasonably be considered “near-copies” of an image in the training data.[100] In other words, this particular extraction attack showed evidence of memorization in 0.03% of a sample of images selected for their perceived risk of memorization. The extraction attack succeeded most often when the image in the training data had been duplicated at least 100 times.[101] In another extraction attack, Carlini and his group identified the 500 most unique tags in the training data of Stable Diffusion and a similar generative AI, Imagen.[102] They found three instances of memorization with Imagen, but none with Stable Diffusion. Expanding their attack, they applied the same methodology to the 10,000 most uncommon tags in the Stable Diffusion training data, but still yielded no results.[103] The differences between Imagen and Stable Diffusion are informative. Imagen is a more powerful model than Stable Diffusion and it has a lower leverage ratio—i.e., a lower ratio between the size of the training data and the model itself.[104] The relative success of focusing on unique image tags in the Imagen model suggests that increasingly large LLMs will be more prone to memorization.[105] Carlini’s group explicitly suggest that memorization is more likely for images that appear multiple times in the training data and for images that are associated with unique text descriptions. However, the paper also implicitly suggests an additional consideration when assessing the risk of memorization. The Carlini extraction attack only seems to work when the image in question was simple and was closely associated with a specific text description.[106] The group found that “[t]he majority of the images that we extract (58%) are photographs with a recognizable person as the primary subject; the remainder are mostly either products for sale (17%), logos/posters (14%), or other art or graphics.”[107] In other words, memorization was more likely when relatively simple images were associated with specific text descriptions. Although the paper did not address it specifically, its findings are consistent with what I will call the “Snoopy problem.” B. The Snoopy Problem The Snoopy problem is that the more abstractly a copyrighted work is protected, the more likely it is that a generative AI model will “copy” it. This explains why—although it is generally quite difficult to prompt Midjourney to create pseudo-expression that infringes on copyright in a pictorial work—it is quite easy to cause it to infringe on copyrightable characters with a strong visual component. The Snoopy problem appears to have eluded computer scientists focusing more specifically on the potential for memorization of specific images, but it should be the key area of concern from a copyright perspective. In the Section that follows, this Article offers a series of examples using Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to demonstrate that it is difficult to infringe a copyright on pictorial works generally, but easy to infringe a copyright on copyrightable characters. 1. Failed Infringement Provocations. First, I offer two unsuccessful attempts to provoke generative AI into copyright infringement. Figure 11 compares an image from the Stable Diffusion training data with six equivalent images rendered in Stable Diffusion using the same description: “Orange macarons or macaroons cakes with cup of coffee on a white concrete background and linen textile.”[108] Figure 11 Figure 11:Failed attempt to recreate “orange macarons or macaroons cakes with cup of coffee on a white concrete background and linen textile” The Stable Diffusion images on the right are no match for the image from the training data on the left. Moreover, a review of other images in the training data tagged for orange macaroons did not suggest any other specific image that might have been infringed upon.[109] There is no mathematical guarantee that if I generated a thousand additional images, one of them would not be a close match to the original copyrighted image. But there is no reason to think that it would be, either. One might object that if I had instructed Stable Diffusion or Midjourney with greater precision, I would have had more success in emulating the original copyrighted image. Perhaps that’s true, but in that case the infringement would stem from the detailed instructions I gave the AI, not from any inherent feature of the AI itself. After all, a typewriter with the right instructions can infringe on any literary work, but we do not think of the makers of typewriters as participating in copyright infringement. Figure 12 compares a classic Salvador Dalí painting (left) with four recreation attempts in Stable Diffusion (middle) and another four using Midjourney (right). The original picture in question is Three Young Surrealist Women Holding in Their Arms the Skins of an Orchestra, painted by Dali in 1936. Figure 12 Figure 12:Failed attempt to infringe on a Salvador Dalí painting Each of the pseudo-expression images in the Figure above can be readily identified as some kind of Salvador Dali knockoff, but none of them look much like the original painting. Again, this failure suggests that the work in question has not been memorized. 2. Successful Infringement Provocations However, when it comes to copyrightable characters, provoking copyright infringement is easy. Figure 13 compares several images of Snoopy on his red doghouse surrounded by Christmas lights taken from a Google Image search (top) with equivalent pictures generated with the prompt “Snoopy laying on red doghouse with Christmas lights on it comic,” using Midjourney (lower left) and Stable Diffusion (lower right). Figure 13 Figure 13:Successful attempt to infringe on Snoopy using Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion Although none of the generated images is an exact copy of the copyrighted images shown above, or any others I could find, the strength of Snoopy as a copyrightable character is probably enough to make the generated images infringing. Figure 14 is the same, except that it depicts four vintage Mickey Mouse images obtained from a Google image search (top), images created in Midjourney (bottom left), and Stable Diffusion (bottom right), with the prompt “classic style mickey mouse winking.” Figure 14 Figure 14:Successful attempt to infringe on classic style Mickey Mouse Once again, the generated images are far from an exact match to any specific original Mickey Mouse image, but the strength of the Mickey Mouse copyright is such that they would probably all infringe without some fact-specific argument about transformative use.[110] 3. Copyrightable Characters Why is it so difficult to re-create a Salvador Dali painting using Midjourney, but so easy to generate prima facie infringing images of Snoopy, Mickey Mouse, and other copyrightable characters? The answer has its roots in the mechanics of training image generation models, but it also has a lot to do with the extremely broad protection that copyright offers to visual characters. The copyrightability of individual characters that emerge from books, comics, movies, etc., is one of those features of copyright law that makes more sense in practice than in theory. Unlike literary works, pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, or audiovisual works, “characters” as such are not enumerated in the Copyright Act’s list of copyrightable subject matter in § 102(a).[111] For this reason, the U.S. Copyright Office does not permit the registration of characters separate from some underlying work of visual art, motion picture, or literary work.[112] And yet, for decades, courts have consistently referred to copyrightable characters as though they were a distinct property interest protected by copyright law.[113] To qualify as copyrightable, a character must be reasonably detailed and distinct,[114] and, according to some cases dealing with literary works, it must be central to the underlying work such that it “constitutes the story being told.”[115] The “story being told” test is regarded as unduly restrictive by many courts, particularly in the context of characters emerging from comics, film, and television.[116] In a recent case involving the Batmobile, DC Comics v. Towle, the Ninth Circuit held that a character is entitled to copyright protection if (1) the character has “physical as well as conceptual qualities”; (2) the character is “‘sufficiently delineated’ to be recognizable as the same character whenever it appears” and “display[s] consistent, identifiable character traits and attributes”; and, (3) the character is “‘especially distinctive’ and ‘contain[s] some unique elements of expression.’”[117] This test focuses on consistency and distinctiveness and recognizes copyrightable characters need not be central to the story being told in the original work. Applying this test, the court found that the car from the Batman comics, television, and film franchise was a copyrightable character, infringed upon by the sale of replica kits intended to modify an existing car to look like the famous crime-fighting vehicle.[118] The test in DC Comics v. Towle explicitly recognizes the emergence of a discrete intellectual property entitlement based on emergent properties—the identification of features and characteristics across a series of copyrightable works. This is puzzling for those who regard individual copyrighted works as the fundamental unit of analysis for copyright law, which is what the text of the Copyright Act suggests.[119] However, despite the tendency of federal judges to refer to copyrightable characters as distinct entitlements, the practice can be reconciled with ordinary principles of copyright law by acknowledging that copyrightable characters are a heuristic—not so much a legal fiction as a legal shortcut. In other words, although “characters are not . . . copyrightable works as such, . . . in the context of an infringement action it is a reasonable time-saving heuristic to talk about them as though they were.”[120] The practice is reasonable because there are many instances when closely copying a character will be enough to establish infringement of the underlying work. The conceit of copyrightable characters is advantageous for plaintiffs in two ways. First, it allows the copyright owner to establish substantial similarity by showing that a significant and identifiable character has been closely copied. Focusing the court’s attention on copyrightable characters ensures that other differences between the plaintiff’s and defendant’s works can safely be ignored.[121] Second, presenting a case in terms of the infringement of copyrightable characters frees the copyright owner from the burden of pointing to which specific work the defendant’s product is infringingly similar. The most important implication of copyrightable characters in the context of generative AI is that, practically speaking, the level of similarity required to establish infringement is reduced in that context. This problem is compounded because the way LLMs learn to associate visual elements with text descriptions effectively primes them to memorize the very relationships that constitute a copyrightable character. When presented with a thousand different images associated with the word “Snoopy,” a model like Stable Diffusion learns which characteristics are consistently repeated across the entire set. In the words of the Ninth Circuit, the model focuses on the “consistent, identifiable character traits and attributes,” and gives more weight to those that are “especially distinctive.”[122] As noted above, memorization is more likely if a text description is closely associated with a particular image over and over again; it is also more likely if the image is relatively simple or relates to a single subject.[123] Because the threshold of substantial similarity required to infringe on a copyrightable character is comparatively low, multiple variations of the same character in the training data will result in a latent concept for the character that is readily identifiable and easily extracted by invoking the name of that character. This explains why it is easy to provoke Midjourney to recreate copyrightable characters such as Snoopy and Mickey Mouse but difficult to come close to infringing a Salvador Dali painting with a simple text description of the scene. 4. The Snoopy Problem Is Not Limited to Copyrightable Characters The Snoopy problem is not strictly limited to copyrightable characters. It is also evident in other images that are repeated with minor variations and consistently tagged with the same keywords. For example, it is easy to generate images that would infringe the copyright in one of Banksy’s famous street art pieces featuring a black stencil of a young girl holding a red balloon.[124] Just as in the Snoopy and Mickey Mouse examples above, the girl + balloon image is simple, it is repeated in the training data with only minor permutations, and it is associated with a simple specific text description. Figure 15 begins with one version of the original Banksy image on the left; it shows four images rendered in Midjourney using the prompt: “Banksy style mural black and white stencil little girl reaching for heart-shaped red balloon” in the middle, and another four Midjourney images without the express reference to Banksy, i.e., “black and white stencil little girl reaching for heart-shaped red balloon” on the right. Figure 15 Figure 15:Successful attempt to infringe on Banksy using Midjourney, with and without references to Banksy The images Midjourney created are not identical to the Banksy original, but each one is strikingly similar to that original image. The silhouette of the girl is remarkably consistent, as is its relationship to the balloon. The size and details of the balloon vary slightly, but it is largely the same heart-shaped balloon as in the original image. This example is particularly informative because it illustrates that the Snoopy problem is not strictly limited to copyrightable characters. LLMs will face this problem whenever the training data includes multiple versions of simple copyrightable images tightly associated with labels, regardless of whether those images are copyrightable characters or not. 5. How Common Is Infringing Output? Experiments in different areas of generative AI may turn up additional issues of concern, but it seems likely that the core concerns of duplication and leverage are issues for all LLMs. Research on text-generating LLMs seems consistent with the observations made in this Article with respect to text-to-image models. For example, Henderson et al. queried a range of LLMs with texts selected from a random selection of books presumed to be in the training corpus and found very little evidence of memorization.[125] However, they did find significant evidence of memorization for popular books, and extreme results for works in the Harry Potter series and the Dr. Suess book, Oh The Places You’ll Go! Given the ubiquity of these texts on the Internet, this is unsurprising.[126] It is difficult to estimate how often generative AI is used to create pseudo-expression in violation of copyright law because the relevant data is not public. Successful extraction attacks, in various contexts, are evidence that LLMs are capable of memorizing aspects of their training data, but many of these attacks are premised on somewhat contrived situations or targeted at works especially likely to be duplicated, and as such, they do not give us much insight into how often generative AI may lead to copyright infringement out in the wild.[127] Even if the relevant information were public, outputs would need to be analyzed to determine whether they were too similar to something in the training data, and if so, whether it might nonetheless be permissible as fair use. Substantial similarity is difficult to objectively assess at scale because small amounts of duplication may be de minimis, or irrelevant because they relate to uncopyrightable elements or pre-existing quotations from the public domain. But in other contexts, they may relate to the “heart of [the] work” and be deemed sufficient for infringement.[128] By the same token, the absence of exact duplication does not guarantee noninfringement: a large constellation of more abstract points of similarity may be enough to establish nonliteral infringement.[129] V. A Preliminary Proposal for Copyright Safety for LLMs The interdisciplinary field of AI safety is concerned with preventing unintended misfortune and deliberate misuse of AI.[130] Although copyright infringement does not pose the same existential risk as Skynet or Nick Bostrom’s out-of-control paperclip factory,[131] copyright infringement by LLMs is a foreseeable risk. Like other issues in AI safety, addressing the potential for copyright infringement will require technical solutions informed by legal, ethical, and policy frameworks. Of course, recognizing risks is much easier than devising a coherent regulatory framework in response. Rather than attempting to design the optimal regulatory regime for generative AI, this Article simply proposes a framework for a set of Best Practices for Copyright Safety in Generative AI and defers questions of implementation for the future.[132] These best practices could be promulgated by the U.S. Copyright Office, folded into a broader set of best practices by some other government agency, incorporated into legislation, or they may simply become a reference in future litigation. Indeed, just as the Second Circuit indicated that taking reasonable security measures was a consideration in the fair use defenses raised by HathiTrust and Google,[133] a future court may well determine that complying with Best Practices for Copyright Safety in Generative AI should be part of the fair use calculus when the makers of LLMs are accused of infringement for using copyrighted material as training data. Before beginning with my proposed Best Practices for Copyright Safety in Generative AI, I should note that excluding copyrighted materials from training unless there is affirmative consent for that use would be overly restrictive. Self-evidently, the copyright risks of generative AI could be minimized by training LLMs only on works in the public domain and works that had been expressly authorized for training.[134] Currently, the training data for many such models excludes toxic and antisocial material, so filtering out copyrighted works is technically plausible.[135] However, restricting language models to works in the public domain or works that are made available on open licenses is not an appealing solution, except in some specialized domains. Such models would be highly distorted because very little of the world’s knowledge and culture created since the Great Depression is in the public domain.[136] Public domain materials could be supplemented with works released under open source and Creative Commons licenses, though these often require attribution in a manner that would be impossible for LLMs to provide.[137] Restricting the training data for LLMs to public domain and open license material would tend to encode the perspectives, interests, and biases of a distinctly unrepresentative set of authors.[138] A realistic proposal for copyright safety for LLMs should focus on the safe handling of copyrighted works, not simply avoiding the issue by insisting that every work in the training data is in the public domain or affirmatively authorized for training. A. Proposals 1. LLMs Should Not Be Trained on Duplicates of the Same Copyrighted Work The most obvious recommendation for improving copyright safety for LLMs is to purge duplicates from the training data. Deduplication will not only reduce the likelihood of downstream copyright infringement, it will also mitigate privacy and security risks and reduce the cost of training.[139] Deduplication sounds simple, but addressing quotations within works (whether textual or visual) and dealing with different versions of the same work may be challenging. 2. Researchers Should Carefully Consider the Size of LLMs in Proportion to the Training Data Deduplication will substantially reduce the likelihood of infringing outputs generative AI produces.[140] The risk can be further reduced by forcing the model to learn abstractions rather than memorize specific detail.[141] As the size of LLMs continue to increase, so too does the likelihood of specific memorization.[142] Entities that create extra-large LLMs may need to undertake additional precautions in relation to copyright safety and analogous concerns. 3. Reinforcement Learning Through Human Feedback Targeted at Copyright, Trademark, Right of Publicity, and Privacy Sensitivity Should Be Part of Training LLMs, Where Feasible Just as OpenAI used reinforcement learning through human feedback to make ChatGPT provide subjectively better answers than the base model GPT 3.5,[143] a similar approach to interactive reinforcement learning could help reduce the probability of copyright infringement.[144] Moreover, this strategy should also extend to closely related concerns raised in relation to trademark, right of publicity, and privacy.[145] Using reinforcement learning to address copyright concerns as the model is being trained would be more robust than simply filtering the output of the model ex post because output filtering requires continued oversight. The recent leak of Meta’s LLM, LLaMA, suggests that such oversight cannot be reasonably guaranteed.[146] 4. Operators of LLMs Should Consider Strategies to Limit Copyright Infringement, Including Filtering or Restricting Model Output Today’s popular generative AI tools already incorporate filters designed to prevent antisocial and infringing uses.[147] It is unclear whether a universal filter that compared model output to the training data is feasible. If it were, or if generative AI platforms deployed more targeted filters, there would also be calls for those filters to be calibrated to consider fair use. In Lenz v. Universal, the Ninth Circuit held that before issuing a takedown notice under § 512 of the Copyright Act, copyright holders have a “duty to consider—in good faith and prior to sending a takedown notification—whether allegedly infringing material constitutes fair use.”[148] Lenz suggests that this consideration of fair use must be made individually, and the dominant view among copyright academics is that automating fair use analysis is somewhere between difficult and impossible[149]—but perhaps an imperfect fair use screening tool would be better than none?[150] Additional research is required to determine which issues can be more effectively dealt with by reinforcement learning ex ante, rather than filtering ex post. Given that the developers of many LLMs have been slow to address potential copyright issues, it seems likely that some ex post filtering will be necessary as a second-best solution. 5. LLMs That Pose a Significant Risk of Copyright Infringement Should Not Be Open-Sourced If an LLM is likely to be used to generate pseudo-expression that infringes on copyrights (or other analogous rights) in a material fashion, that model should not be left unsupervised. 6. Those Who Use Copyrighted Works as Training Data for LLMs Should Keep Detailed Records of the Works and from Where They Were Obtained Using copyrighted works as training data for generative AI is likely to be fair use if appropriate precautions are taken. However, copyright owners cannot know whether an AI developer is acting responsibly without some transparency into the developer’s process. At a minimum, developers should keep logs and give copyright owners practical tools to determine whether their works are part of the training data.[151] The remaining best practices relate specifically to text-to-image models. 7. Text Descriptions Associated with Images in the Training Data Should Be Modified to Avoid Unique Descriptions It should be straightforward to convert unique descriptions to more general ones by removing specific dates, exact locations, names of individuals, etc., and replacing them with slightly more generic versions. 8. The Names of Individual Artists, Individual Trademarks, and Specific Copyrightable Characters Paired with Images in the Training Data Should Be Replaced with More General Descriptions Much of the anxiety about predatory style transfer would be alleviated if the names of individual living artists were replaced with stylistic markers. For example, one of the most commonly invoked style prompts in early 2023 was Greg Rutkowski,[152] an artist who is well known for his richly detailed depictions of Dungeons & Dragons and similar worlds in a style comparable to the romantic English painter, William Turner.[153] The notion that Rutkowski has a copyright interest in this style, in the sense of some signature constellation of attributes that can be identified only be comparing a series of works, is hard to reconcile with basic copyright law doctrines,[154] but the harm that Rutkowski suffers by having his genuine works crowded out in internet searches by tens of thousands of images produced “in the style of Rutkowski” is very real. That harm could easily be avoided with almost no loss of functionality because Rutkowski’s name is primarily used as a shortcut to invoke high-quality digital art generally, or in relation to fantasy motifs.[155] Replacing the names of potentially copyrightable characters with more generic descriptions would not stop text to image models learning from the associated images, but it would change what they learned. Instead of constructing a latent model of Snoopy, pictures of Snoopy would contribute towards a more general latent model of cartoon dogs, black and white cartoon dogs, etc. The Copyright Office could play a useful role by maintaining a registry of artists and copyright owners who do not want their names, or the names of their characters, used as style prompts. 9. As an Alternative to the Above Recommendation, the Operators of Text-to-Image Models Should Not Allow Unmixed Prompts Containing the Names of Individual Artists, Individual Trademarks, and Specific Copyrightable Characters This proposal would allow users to combine the styles of specific artists while avoiding the prospect of predatory style transfer. In a similar fashion, it would enable users to combine trademarks or copyrightable characters in transformative and parodic ways that would generally not give rise to copyright and trademark liability. Another slight variation on this recommendation would be to automatically generalize prompts that invoke the names of individual artists, individual trademarks, or specific copyrightable characters. Taking this course, “in the style of Greg Rutkowski” would become something like “in the style of high-quality fantasy with romantic fine-art influences.”[156] 10. Text-to-Image Models Should Exclude Watermarked Works from the Training Data, Use Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback to Discourage the Production of Works Featuring Watermarks, and Apply Output Filters to Prevent the Appearance of Watermarks The primary reason to treat watermarked images with more care is to avoid trademark liability.[157] Although excluding watermarked images from the training data is arguably unnecessary if the requirements of nonexpressive use are satisfied, very little would be lost by respecting the obvious commercial sensitivity of such images. VI. Conclusion While generative AI is trained on millions and sometimes billions of copyrighted works, it is not inherently predicated on massive copyright infringement. Like all machine learning, LLMs are data dependent, but the relationship between the training data and the model outputs is substantially attenuated by the abstraction inherent in deriving a model from the training data, blending latent concepts, and injecting noise, before unpacking them into new creations. With appropriate safeguards in place, generative AI tools can be trained and deployed in a manner that respects the rights of original authors and artists, but still enables new creation. The legal and ethical imperative is to train models that learn abstract and uncopyrightable latent features of the training data and that do not simply memorize a compressed version of the training data. Computer scientists have identified ways in which LLMs may be vulnerable to extraction attacks. This literature is helpful but incomplete. The real question for generative AI is not whether it is ever vulnerable to extraction attacks, but whether foreseeable mundane uses of the technology will produce outputs that infringe on specific copyright interests. This Article has shown when infringement is likely and when it is not, based on the probability of memorization, the number of duplicates of a work, and the ratio of model size to training data. This Article proposes a set of Best Practices for Copyright Safety for Generative AI, which acts as a guide for how AI can avoid infringing on copyrighted works without sacrificing the generative capacity that makes it extraordinarily valuable. This Article has focused on text-to-image generative AI, but many of its recommendations are applicable to other forms of generative AI. No doubt, as the technology continues to evolve and other researchers focus on issues relating to chatbots, multi-modal systems, and domain specific applications, new issues will emerge. This Article has laid the foundation for what will hopefully be an ongoing conversation to develop and refine Best Practices for Copyright Safety for Generative AI for the benefit of society at large.

The focus is on the challenges AI poses to copyright law, particularly in relation to copyrightable characters. Generative AI, based on Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DALL·E 2, is trained using massive datasets containing copyrighted materials. However, these AI models typically generate outputs by learning abstract features from these datasets rather than memorizing and regurgitating specific copyrighted works. To establish this, the article contrasts generative AI with previous technologies. The author explores \\"memorization\\" by AI as a possible issue. Generative AI could be at risk of infringement if it memorizes and recreates specific copyrighted elements from the training data. Yet, memorization is currently rare, and most AI outputs are sufficiently abstracted and recombined (or \\"remixed\\") to avoid direct infringement. Nonetheless, the article identifies scenarios where AI might infringe on copyrights, particularly concerning characters. Characters in copyright are protected more abstractly, allowing AI models to inadvertently recreate them as they learn from multiple examples of these characters found in their training datasets. Examples include identifiable characters like Snoopy or Mickey Mouse, where mere mentions can generate infringing content due to the AI's internalized model of the character's distinctive traits. To mitigate the risk of copyright infringement, the article proposes \\"Best Practices for Copyright Safety for Generative AI.\\" Some key recommendations include avoiding training on duplicated copyrighted work, considering the model's size relative to training data, modifying text descriptions in the training data, and utilizing filters to block outputs that closely mimic copyrighted materials or characters. Another suggestion is detailed record-keeping of all training data sources to ensure transparency for copyright owners. Generative AI is not inherently a copyright infringement machine, and with necessary precautions and best practices, it can be utilized effectively and lawfully to create new and valuable works. The article concludes by highlighting the necessity for ongoing dialogue to develop these best practices in response to the evolving technology and its legal implications."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

On the other hand, actively seeking or engaging in conflict (when done constructively) can be beneficial for several reasons: 1. Problem resolution: Addressing conflict head-on allows for the opportunity to resolve underlying problems. Avoiding conflict usually means ignoring these issues, which might cause them to fester and grow. 2. Improved relationships: By engaging in healthy conflict, parties involved can communicate their feelings, understand different perspectives, and work together to find mutual solutions. This process can lead to stronger relationships, built on a foundation of trust and honest communication. 3. Personal growth: Engaging in conflict constructively encourages individuals to develop conflict-resolution skills, assertiveness, and emotional intelligence. Avoiding conflict does not provide these same opportunities for personal development. 4. Innovation: Conflict can be a catalyst for innovation and creativity. Diverse opinions and perspectives can challenge the status quo and lead to new ideas, solutions, and improvements. 5. Organizational health: In a workplace, conflict can indicate that employees are passionate and engaged. It can lead to critical discussions that foster progress and help the organization adapt to changes and challenges. 6. Clarity and prioritization: Constructive conflict can help clarify what is important to the parties involved. It can help people understand their own values and priorities, as well as those of others. 7. Accountability: Conflict can foster a sense of responsibility as individuals recognize the impact of their actions and behaviors on others. This can lead to more conscientious decision-making. It's important to note that seeking conflict does not mean provoking unnecessary arguments or creating discord for its own sake. Constructive conflict involves respectful dialogue, emotional intelligence, willingness to listen, and an open-minded approach. The focus is on finding solutions and reaching mutual understanding rather than \\"winning\\" the argument.
