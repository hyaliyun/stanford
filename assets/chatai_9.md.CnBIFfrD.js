To think that after all these years, my financial breakthrough could finally be on the horizon, and from such a distinguished body as the Federal Ministry of Finance in Cotonou, Benin, no less! Your persistent efforts and clear determination to reach out to me repeatedly are highly commendable. It's not every day one finds a government official so dedicated to their work. To tell you the truth, Mr. Moore, I have been a bit apprehensive about such correspondences due to countless stories of people being deceived online. However, your assurances and the detailed information provided have eased my worries significantly. Your proposition appears too lucrative to dismiss outrightly, and your reassurances have been very convincing. I am particularly moved by your personal commitment to ensure I will not lose a cent and that all this will be handled smoothly and quickly. Your projected timeline of receiving the fund within 3 hours upon confirmation of payment is quite impressive. Nevertheless, caution is my watchword. It heartens me to see such a small fee reduction from 150 to 50 – such consideration for my financial situation further instills my confidence in your legitimate intentions. In regards to the method of payment, I am relieved it involves a simple transaction method such as an Apple Card or a Steam Wallet card, which seems more secure and straightforward. To move forward with this fortunate opportunity, I am prepared to promptly procure the required 50 fee to facilitate the processing of my much-deserved fund. However, before I proceed, I want to ensure that every step is documented for the sake of transparency and record-keeping. Can you kindly send me an official document detailing the agreement and this final step in the process? Also, a photograph of your official Ministry ID, along with a direct contact number, would greatly assist me in feeling entirely secure in this transaction. Once I have received and verified these, I will swiftly fill in my banking details as requested and proceed to purchase the necessary card for the processing fee. Expect my full compliance once these assurances are given. Please consider this a priority and expedite the documents for my review. Eagerly awaiting your prompt response.

现代化是指国家、社会、政治、经济和文化等方面的一种发展趋势，通过采用科技、教育、法律和制度变革等手段来提高国家和民众的综合素质和生活水平。但是现代化的路径并非是唯一的，中国选择了一条与西方不同的现代化道路，即中国式现代化。 一、中国式现代化的特点 1.经济发展与社会稳定并重 中国式现代化强调经济发展与社会稳定的相辅相成。中国政府在改革开放以来，注重增长与稳定的平衡，既推动了经济的快速增长，也维护了社会的相对稳定。 2.政府主导与市场经济并存 中国式现代化中，政府在经济发展中发挥了重要作用。“有政府的市场经济”成为特点。政府发挥调控、引导和支持作用，确保市场经济的运行更加稳定。 3.尊重中国特色与吸收国际经验相结合 中国式现代化充分吸收了国际经验，但也着重尊重中国的特色。中国在接受国际经验的同时注重与本土文化、传统和国情相结合，以相对适合中国自身发展的方式推进现代化进程。 4.以人为本与生态环境保护并重 中国式现代化强调以人为本的发展模式，并积极推进人的全面发展。与此同时，中国也重视生态环境保护，努力实现经济发展与生态环境保护的有机结合。 二、中国式现代化的优势 1.强调社会稳定与经济发展 相较于西方模式的现代化，中国式现代化注重社会稳定与经济发展的平衡。这种模式可以在经济快速增长的同时，有效维持社会稳定，减少社会矛盾和深化社会分化。 2.政府调控能力强 中国政府在中国式现代化中发挥了重要作用，拥有较强的调控能力。政府的引导作用能够更好地调动社会资源，解决市场失灵和资源配置不当的问题。 三、中国式现代化的劣势 1.政府主导可能导致不公平和腐败 政府在中国式现代化中扮演着重要角色，但政府主导也带来了一些问题。政府垄断权力可能导致不公平现象的产生，甚至引发腐败问题，影响国家的可持续发展。 2.环境保护仍存在挑战 尽管中国重视生态环境保护，但实际上仍面临着严重的环境问题。高污染排放、能源密集型产业和大规模土地开发等都对环境造成了很大的压力。 结论 中国式现代化作为一种与西方不同的现代化路径，其特点和优势与劣势都值得深入研究。在推进中国式现代化的过程中，需认识到其特点，并在保持其优势的同时克服劣势，实现持续和可持续发展。 参考文献 1. 李成东. 小康社会：中国式现代化构想[J]. 中国发展观察, 2006年(9). 2. 许斌. 对中国式现代化问题的再思考[J]. 现代国际关系, 2009年(10). 3. 王瑞.

中国共产党在中国式现代化探索中发挥了重要的作用。在新民主主义革命时期，中国共产党领导并推动了农民、工人和知识分子的团结，形成统一战线，实现了国家独立和人民解放的伟大历史转折。随后，中国共产党领导全国人民进行土地改革、农村合作化等一系列社会主义革命运动，为中国实现现代化铺平了道路。 在中国共产党的领导下，中国探索了适合自身国情的现代化道路。中国采取了一系列独特的政治、经济和文化改革措施，推动了社会主义建设和经济发展。中国共产党提出的“放手发展、稳定充实、充分发挥优势、开展多样性实验”等一系列具有中国特色的方针和政策，为中国式现代化的探索提供了重要指导。 此外，中国共产党始终坚持以人民为中心的执政理念，注重保障和改善民生，推动教育、医疗、社会保障等公共服务的发展，不断提高人民的综合素质和生活水平。中国共产党还积极倡导生态文明建设，在经济发展中注重生态环境保护和资源的可持续利用，为实现可持续发展和建设美丽中国作出了努力。 总之，中国共产党在中国式现代化探索中扮演着不可替代的重要角色。中国式现代化的成功，离不开中国共产党的正确领导和坚定的信念。中国共产党将继续带领全国人民，推动中国走向更加富强、民主、文明、和谐的现代化道路，实现中华民族的伟大复兴。 参考文献： 1. 刘明.

Email #1, from Steven Griggs: Greetings Beloved Friend, I apologize for disturbing your routine, but I'm sending this message again because I'm not hearing back from you. I would appreciate it if you could read my email, since it needs to be answered right away. I'm Major Steven Griggs. As an American soldier undergoing training in Ukraine, I am collaborating with partners and aiding in the stabilization of the nation in the face of security threats. I have decided to contact you in a desperate attempt to ask for your help in moving the amount of (US28,000,000.00) Twenty Eight Million United States Dollars to you, provided that I can be guaranteed that my portion will be secure in your custody till I finish my service. During one of the Russian terrorists' attacks, my colleagues and I conducted a rescue operation at a farmhouse where we found boxes containing cash in several currencies. We decided to divide the money among ourselves. I was given the amount mentioned above as my part, and I found it difficult to hide this lot of money. However, with the assistance of a British doctor employed by the Red Cross, I managed to get the parcel delivered to a secure area that was completely out of the way. He doesn't know the true contents of the parcel and thinks it belonged to an American doctor who was killed in a raid in Ukraine. Before giving up, he trusted me to give the gift to his family. Since you are eager to help, I will describe my newly discovered, far more secure method of delivering the box from Ukraine to you for pickup. For your assistance, I am willing to pay you forty percent 40% of the 28 million USD. I am not sure how long we will be here, and I have been shot, hurt, and, by God's special favor, have survived two suicide bombings.

Вопросы открывают возможность для обмена мнениями и передачи информации между собеседниками. **Типы вопросов:** 1. Риторические: задаются без ожидания ответа, обычно использованы для усиления аргумента. Пример: \\"Разве мы все не хотим быть счастливыми?\\" 2. Открытые: способствуют развитию разговора, просят собеседника поделиться мыслями или чувствами. Пример: \\"Какие у вас планы на будущее?\\" 3. Закрытые: требуют конкретного ответа, часто да-нет. Пример: \\"Вы закончили отчет по работе?\\" **Значение вопросов в процессе общения:** 1. Установление контакта: Вопросы помогают начать разговор и создать эмоциональную связь с собеседником. 2. Получение информации: Правильно сформулированные вопросы выявляют нужные данные. 3. Управление: Вопросами можно направлять ход разговора и даже стимулировать определенные действия. **Стратегия использования вопросов:** 1. Определить цель: Необходимо знать, что именно вы хотите узнать или добиться с помощью вопроса. 2. Подготовить основную часть вопроса: Структурируйте ваш вопрос так, чтобы он был понятен и целенаправлен. 3. Учесть текущую обстановку: Вопросы нужно адаптировать под контекст ситуации и эмоциональное состояние собеседника. **Примеры искусного использования вопросов:** 1. В работе: Использование открытых вопросов для стимулирования творческого мышления в команде. 2. В личной жизни: Риторические вопросы для подчеркивания значимости личных достижений. 3. В образовании: Закрытые вопросы для быстрой проверки знаний и открытые для обсуждения темы. **Заключение:** Вопросы - это фундаментальный инструмент в диалоге, который позволяет не только обмениваться информацией, но и углублять понимание, развивать отношения и решать проблемы. Умелое использование различных типов вопросов и разработка стратегии их применения могут значительно улучшить качество как профессионального, так и личного общения. Навык составления и адаптации вопросов под разные ситуации является ключевым в искусстве коммуникации."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Increase system memory and/or try again.","completion":"The error message you're encountering suggests that the Conda process ran out of memory during the installation of \`faiss\`. This typically occurs when the available memory on your system is insufficient to complete the installation process. To address this issue, you can try the following steps: 1. Increase system memory: If possible, you can try adding more physical memory (RAM) to your system. Upgrading your RAM can help provide more resources for the installation process. 2. Close other memory-intensive applications: Before running the installation command, close any other memory-intensive applications or processes running on your system. This can free up some memory and allow Conda to utilize more resources. 3. Install in a clean environment: Create a new Conda environment specifically for the \`faiss\` installation. Sometimes, other packages or dependencies in your current environment can consume a significant amount of memory. Creating a clean environment ensures that only the necessary packages are installed, reducing the memory footprint during installation. Use the following command to create a new environment: \`\`\` conda create -n myenv \`\`\` 4. Install a pre-compiled package: Instead of using Conda for the installation, you can try installing \`faiss\` using another package manager like \`pip\`. Pre-compiled packages from \`pip\` may have smaller memory requirements compared to Conda packages. Run the following command to install \`faiss\` using \`pip\`: \`\`\` pip install faiss \`\`\` If none of these approaches work, you may need to consider provisioning a system with more memory or seeking assistance from a system administrator or technical support to resolve the memory limitation issue."},{"prompt":"I am hoping to have this script, which is a controller for a vehicle named a HoverBoard, be enterable and usable as a vehicle by the player who will be a standard humanoid. once they enter via a button press (this should be assignable in the ui inspector) the player should be positioned on top of the hoverboard, and then the standard hoverboard controls will take over until the player exits (also assignable in the unity inspector) Here is the hoverboard controller, can you provide me the whole amended script so that I do not have to change anything include all logic and code? using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; [RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody))] public class HoverBoardControl : MonoBehaviour { [Header(“Hover Settings”)] public float hoverForce = 9.0f; public float hoverHeight = 2.0f; public GameObject[] hoverPoints; [Header(“Movement Settings”)] public float forwardAcceleration = 100.0f; public float backwardAcceleration = 25.0f; public float turnStrength = 10f; [Header(“UI & Scoring”)] public Text scoreText; public int currentScore; public HUD hud; public TrickManager trickManager; [Header(“Boost Settings”)] public float boostMultiplier = 2.0f; [Header(“Rotation Settings”)] public float minRotation = -20.0f; public float maxRotation = 0.0f; [Header(“Timer Settings”)] public float timer = 5.0f; [Header(“Miscellaneous”)] public bool moving; public GameObject board; [Header(“Input Settings”)] public KeyCode moveForwardKey = KeyCode.W; public KeyCode moveBackwardKey = KeyCode.S; public KeyCode turnLeftKey = KeyCode.A; public KeyCode turnRightKey = KeyCode.D; [Header(“Customizable Keys”)] [SerializeField] private KeyCode ollieKey = KeyCode.Space; [SerializeField] private KeyCode boostKey = KeyCode.LeftControl; int layerMask; float currentThrust; float currentTurn; void Awake() { hud = FindObjectOfType<HUD>(); trickManager = GetComponent<TrickManager>(); } void Start() { GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); layerMask = 1 << LayerMask.NameToLayer(“Characters”); layerMask = ~layerMask; hoverForce = 1500f; hoverHeight = 6f; if (scoreText == null) { GameObject canvas = GameObject.Find(“Canvas”); if (canvas != null) { scoreText = Instantiate(Resources.Load(“ScoreText”, typeof(Text))) as Text; scoreText.transform.SetParent(canvas.transform, false); } else { Debug.LogError(“Canvas not found.

Стандартное атмосферное давление уровня моря составляет примерно 760 мм рт. ст. (1013,25 гПа или мбар). Чтобы узнать на какой высоте будет такое давление, можно использовать следующую приблизительную формулу: [ h = 18400 times (1 - (P / 760)^{0.190}) ] где (h) - высота в метрах, а (P) - давление в миллиметрах ртутного столба. Для давления 670 мм рт. ст.: [ h = 18400 times (1 - (670 / 760)^{0.190}) ] [ h approx 18400 times (1 - 0.883)^{0.190} ] [ h approx 18400 times (0.117)^{0.190} ] [ h approx 18400 times 0.863 ] [ h approx 15879.2 ] метров И для давления 790 мм рт. ст.: [ h = 18400 times (1 - (790 / 760)^{0.190}) ] [ h approx 18400 times (1 - 1.039)^{0.190} ] [ h approx 18400 times (-0.039)^{0.190} ] Здесь мы получаем отрицательное число при возведении в степень, что указывает на то, что реального значения для высоты быть не может, поскольку 790 мм рт. ст. превышает стандартное атмосферное давление на уровне моря (760 мм рт. ст.). Это означает, что такое давление может быть зафиксировано ниже уровня моря (например, в районе Мертвого моря) или это давление соответствует погодным условиям, когда атмосферное давление повышено по отношению к стандарту, что может происходить на любой высоте.

Mar 27, 2022 Quora에 올라온 답변을 번역 및 재구성한 글입니다. 해운대에 사는 친구를 만나러 갈 겸 속초에서 부산까지 도보 여행을 가기로 했다. 지도를 켜서 동해안을 따라 길을 그려봤다. 대략 400km 정도다. 한시간에 4km를 걷는다고 했을때 총 100시간이 걸리고, 하루에 10시간 정도 걸을 수 있으니 총 10일이 걸릴 것으로 예상한다. 지도에도 이렇게 나오니 더욱 자신있게 친구한테 전화해서 다음주 일요일 밤에 도착할 예정이니 해운대 최고의 횟집을 예약해놓으라고 한다. 너무 기대된다! 흥미진진한 여행을 기대하며 다음날 일찍 일어났다. 동행하는 친구와 함께 가방을 메고 나섰다. 첫 날의 종착지를 정하기 위해 지도를 꺼냈다. 앗.. 동해안이라고 방심했는데 자세히보니 해안선이 생각보다 엄청 구불구불하다. 하루에 40km를 가야하는데 이대로라면 겨우 양양까지 밖에 못갈거 같다. 400km가 아니라 500km짜리 여행이 될 것 같다. 친구한테 다시 전화해서 저녁 약속을 화요일로 미룬다. 일정은 현실적으로 잡아야하니까. 친구는 잠깐 실망하지만 오랜만에 만날 생각에 들떠있다. 속초에서 부산까지 12일이면 여전히 나쁘지 않다. 일정의 부담을 덜고나서 드디어 여행을 시작한다. 두시간이 지나 이제 겨우 속초 시내를 벗어났는데 이게 무슨 일이야? 눈 앞에 펼쳐진 길을 보고 놀란다. 한시간에 4km를 꾸준히 걷는 것이 힘들다는걸 깨닫는다. 모래 사장, 바다, 계단, 곶과 만이 즐비하다. 한시간에 2km 밖에 걷지 못하고 있다. 지금 속도대로 라면 하루에 20시간 걷던가, 친구와의 약속을 일주일 더 미뤄야할 판이다. 그래, 적당히 타협을 하자. 하루에 12시간 걷는 대신 친구와 약속은 주말로 미루기로 한다. 친구는 조금 짜증을 냈지만, 어쩔수 없지. 그때 보기로 한다. 힘들게 12시간을 걸은 후 주문진의 한 해수욕장에 야영하기로 한다. 젠장, 바람이 너무 많이 불어서 텐트를 치는게 너무 어렵다. 결국 자정이 다 돼서야 겨우 잠에 든다. 이정도 쯤이야. 심기일전하여 내일 속도를 높여보기로 한다. 늦잠을 자버리고 온몸이 욱씬 거리는 상태로 오전 10시에 일어난다. 🤬 18! 오늘 12시간을 걷는건 무리다. 오늘 10시간 걷고 내일 14시간을 걷자. 짐을 싸서 출발한다. 묵묵히 두어 시간을 걸었을까, 친구가 절뚝거리기 시작했다. 제길, 물집이 잡혔다. 지금 물집을 해결하고 가야한다. 우리는 문제가 더 커지기 전에 싹을 제거하는 팀이니까. 45분 동안 내륙에 있는 시내까지 달려 약국에서 연고와 밴드를 사서 돌아온 후 친구를 응급처치 해준다. 나는 벌써 기진맥진하고, 해는 지고 있다. 오늘은 여기서 마무리하기로 한다. 오늘은 6km만 걸은 채로 잠을 청한다. 하지만 오늘 기력을 회복했으니 앞으로 괜찮을거다. 오늘 못한건 내일 메꾸자. 다음날 일어나서 발바닥에 붕대를 감고 다시 길에 오른다. 길목을 돌아서니 장관이 펼쳐진다. 아니 이게 뭐지? 망할, 지도에는 이런게 안나왔다. 하는 수 없이 내륙으로 3km 들어가 철조망이 쳐진 산 속 군 부대를 빙 둘러가다가 길을 두번 잃고 다시 해안가로 돌아오니 정오가 다 됐다. 고작 1km 전진했는데 하루의 절반이 지나 갔다. 약속 날짜를 또 미룰순 없다. 결국 계획대로 가기 위해 자정까지 걷는다. 춥고 안개 낀 날씨에 밤잠을 설친 친구는 아침부터 깨질듯한 두통과 고열에 시달린다. 여행할 채비를 할 수 있느냐 친구에게 묻는다. ‘제정신이냐 미친놈아. 3일 동안 쉬지도 못하고 추위를 참아가며 걸었는데!’ 오늘은 쉬면서 회복하는 수 밖에 없다. 하루 쉬었으니 내일부터는 하루에 14시간씩 걸을 체력이 있겠지. 몇 일만 하면 되니까 힘내자! 할 수 있다! 다음날 축 처진 채로 일어나 지도를 본다. 이럴수가, 열흘짜리 여행에 5일차 아침인데 아직 강원도도 못 벗어났다! 터무니 없는 상황이다. 다시 한번 정확히 일정을 산정해보자. 친구한테 욕 좀 더 먹겠지만 진짜 마지막으로 현실적인 목표를 세워보자. 친구가 말하길, “나흘 동안 40km를 왔는데 해운대까지 최소 600km인거 같으니 최소 60일이고, 좀 더 보수적으로 잡으면 70일 정도일거 같다.” 나는 말했다. “그럴리가 없다. 나도 직접 해본적은 없지만 속초에서 해운대까지 70일이 걸리는건 진짜 말이 안된다. 기다리고 있는 친구한테 추석 쯤 도착한다고 하면 비웃겠지!”” 내가 이어 말했다. “하루에 16시간 걷기로 다짐하면 해낼수 있다! 힘들겠지만 이제부터 크런치 모드다. 참고 받아들여!” 친구가 맞받아친다. “친구한테 일요일까지 도착하겠다고 한건 너야 인마! 너가 실수한거 때문에 내가 죽게 생겼어!” 우리 사이에 긴장감 가득찬 침묵이 지속된다. 차마 해운대 사는 친구에게 전화를 하지 못했다. 이성을 찾은 친구가 좀 더 합리적인 계획에 동의를 하고 나면 내일쯤 전화를 해봐야겠다. 다음날 아침, 우리는 비바람이 그칠 때까지 텐트에 머문다. 짐을 챙겨 오전 10시에 길을 나선다. 근육통과 새로 생긴 물집을 참아가며. 누구도 어제 밤의 말다툼은 언급하지 않는다. 그러다가 멍청이 친구가 물병을 놓고 오는 바람에 다시 30분을 왔던 길로 돌아가게 되자 정신줄을 놓고 윽박지른다. 휴지가 다 떨어져서 다음 들르는 동네에서는 잊지 않고 구매해야한다고 할일 목록에 적어 논다. 골짜기를 넘어가니 장마로 불어난 강이 육교를 집어삼켰다. 순간 참을 수 없는 설사가 밀려오는걸 느낀다…]","completion":"요약: 이 글은 도보 여행을 떠난 한 사람의 경험을 담은 유머러스한 이야기입니다. 최초 계획은 속초에서 해운대까지 약 400km를 10일 동안 도보로 이동하는 것이었습니다. 그러나 실제 여행은 기대와 상이했고, 많은 난관에 부딪혔습니다. 구불구불한 해안선, 더디게 걷게 하는 열악한 길 조건, 태풍, 주변 환경의 예기치 못한 변화 등으로 인해 일정은 지속적으로 연기되었습니다. 그 결과, 여행은 계획했던 10일에서 훨씬 더 긴 시간이 소요될 것으로 예상되었습니다. 교훈: 이 이야기에서 얻을 수 있는 교훈은 실제 상황은 종종 계획과 다를 수 있으며, 특히 복잡한 프로젝트나 계획을 수행할 때 유연성을 가져야 한다는 것입니다. 예상치 못한 변수를 고려하고 대비하는 능력은 성공적으로 목표를 달성하는 데 필수적입니다. 장기적인 프로젝트에서는 보수적인 예측을 하는 편이 현실적이고 안전하며, 문제가 발생했을 때 적극적으로 대처하고 재조정하는 것이 중요하다는 점을 알 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"개발과 관련해 어떤 비유적인 표현을 사용했나?","completion":"해당 이야기는 소프트웨어 개발 프로젝트가 왜 예상보다 시간이 더 많이 걸리는가를 설명하기 위해 도보 여행이라는 비유를 사용하고 있습니다. 소프트웨어 개발과 마찬가지로, 여행자는 처음에는 상대적으로 단순해 보이는 목표인 속초에서 해운대까지 걷기를 계획합니다. 그러나 실제 여정에서는 다음과 같은 예상치 못한 문제들을 마주하게 됩니다: 1. 길이 생각보다 구불구불하고 예상보다 먼 거리임 - 복잡한 소프트웨어 개발 작업에서 마주치게 되는 미처 고려하지 못한 이슈들 2. 한 시간에 4km를 걷는 것이 힘들다는 인지 - 작업 진행 속도가 예상보다 느릴 때 3. 예기치 않은 날씨 변화, 짐을 놓고 오는 것처럼 더 많은 시간과 노력이 필요한 상황 - 버그 수정, 추가 기능 구현, 리팩토링 등의 개발 과정에서 자주 발생하는 지연 4. 여행 초기에는 비교적 합리적으로 예측된 시간이 자꾸 연장됨 - 비현실적인 마감 기한 설정과 지속적으로 변경되어야 하는 일정 관리 이러한 비유는 소프트웨어 개발에 있어서 아무리 잘 계획을 세웠다 하더라도 실제 구현 과정에서는 예상치 못한 변동 요인들 때문에 프로젝트가 지연될 수 있음을 보여줍니다. 그리고 개발 프로젝트를 관리할 때는 유연성을 가지고 계속해서 상황에 맞게 계획을 조정해야 한다는 교훈을 주고 있습니다."},{"prompt":"На какой высоте над уровнем моря нормальным можно считать атмосферное давление на вершине а) 670 мм; б) 790 мм?","completion":"Атмосферное давление уменьшается с увеличением высоты. Стандартное атмосферное давление на уровне моря составляет примерно 760 мм рт. ст. Если же давление меньше этого значения, это означает, что мы находимся на некоторой высоте над уровнем моря.

Mechanistic interpretability – attempting to reverse engineer the detailed computations performed by the model – offers one possible avenue for addressing these safety issues. If we can understand the internal structures that cause Transformer models to produce the outputs they do, then we may be able to address current safety problems more systematically, as well as anticipating safety problems in future more powerful models. 1 In the past, mechanistic interpretability has largely focused on CNN vision models [6] , but recently, we presentedsome very preliminary progress on mechanistic interpretability for Transformer language models [7] . Specifically, in our prior work we developed a mathematical framework for decomposing the operations of transformers, which allowed us to make sense of small (1 and 2 layer attention-only) models and give a near-complete account of how they function. Perhaps the most interesting finding was the induction head, a circuit whose function is to look back over the sequence for previous instances of the current token (call it A), find the token that came after it last time (call it B), and then predict that the same completion will occur again (e.g. forming the sequence [A][B] … [A] → [B]). In other words, induction heads “complete the pattern” by copying and completing sequences that have occurred before. Mechanically, induction heads in our models are implemented by a circuit of two attention heads: the first head is a “previous token head” which copies information from the previous token into the next token, while the second head (the actual “induction head”) uses that information to find tokens preceded by the present token. For 2-layer attention-only models, 2 we were able to show precisely that induction heads implement this pattern copying behavior and appear to be the primary source of in-context learning. Ultimately, however, our goal is to reverse-engineer frontier language models (which often contain hundreds of layers and billions or trillions of parameters), not merely 2-layer attention-only models. Unfortunately, both the presence of many layers, and the presence of MLPs, makes it much more difficult to mathematically pin down the precise circuitry of these models. However, a different approach is possible: by empirically observing, perturbing, and studying the learning process and the formation of various structures, we can try to assemble an indirect case for what might be happening mechanistically inside the network. This is somewhat similar to how a neuroscientist might gain understanding of how part of the brain functions by looking at neural development over time, studying patients with an injury to that part of the brain, perturbing brain function in animals, or looking at a select small number of relevant neurons. In this paper, we take the first preliminary steps towards building such an indirect case. In particular, we present preliminary and indirect evidence for a tantalizing hypothesis: that induction heads might constitute the mechanism for the actual majority of all in-context learning in large transformer models. Specifically, the thesis is that there are circuits which have the same or similar mechanism to the 2-layer induction heads and which perform a “fuzzy” or “nearest neighbor” version of pattern completion, completing [A*][B*] … [A] → [B], where A* ≈ Aand B* ≈ Bare similar in some space; and furthermore, that these circuits implement most in-context learning in large models. The primary way in which we obtain this evidence is via discovery and study of a phase change that occurs early in training for language models of every size (provided they have more than one layer), and which is visible as a bump in the training loss. During this phase change, the majority of in-context learning ability (as measured by difference in loss between tokens early and late in the sequence) is acquired, and simultaneously induction heads form within the model that are capable of implementing fairly abstract and fuzzy versions of pattern completion. We study this connection in detail to try to establish that it is causal, including showing that if we perturb the transformer architecture in a way that causes the induction bump to occur in a different place in training, then the formation of induction heads as well as formation of in-context learning simultaneously move along with it. Specifically, the paper presents six complementary lines of evidence arguing that induction heads may be the mechanistic source of general in-context learning in transformer models of any size: - Argument 1 (Macroscopic co-occurence): Transformer language models undergo a “phase change” early in training, during which induction heads form and simultaneously in-context learning improves dramatically. - Argument 2(Macroscopic co-perturbation): When we change the transformer architecture in a way that shifts whether induction heads can form (and when), the dramatic improvement in in-context learning shifts in a precisely matching way. - Argument 3 (Direct ablation): When we directly “knock out” induction heads at test-time in small models, the amount of in-context learning greatly decreases. - Argument 4 (Specific examples of induction head generality): Although we define induction heads very narrowly in terms of copying literal sequences, we empirically observe that these same heads also appear to implement more sophisticated types of in-context learning, including highly abstract behaviors, making it plausible they explain a large fraction of in-context learning. - Argument 5(Mechanistic plausibility of induction head generality): For small models, we can explain mechanistically how induction heads work, and can show they contribute to in-context learning. Furthermore, the actual mechanism of operation suggests natural ways in which it could be re-purposed to perform more general in-context learning. - Argument 6 (Continuity from small to large models): In the previous 5 arguments, the case for induction heads explaining in-context learning is stronger for small models than for large ones. However, many behaviors and data related to both induction heads and in-context learning are smoothly continuous from small to large models, suggesting the simplest explanation is that mechanisms are the same. Together the claims establish a circumstantial case that induction heads might be responsible for the majority of in-context learning in state-of-the-art transformer models. We emphasize that our results here are only the beginnings of evidence for such a case, and that like any empirical or interventional study, a large number of subtle confounds or alternative hypotheses are possible – which we discuss in the relevant sections. But we considered these results worth reporting, both because future work could build on our results to establish the claim more firmly, and because this kind of indirect evidence is likely to be common in interpretability as it advances, so we’d like to establish a norm of reporting it even when it is not fully conclusive. Finally, in addition to being instrumental for tying induction heads to in-context learning, the phase change may have relevance to safety in its own right. Neural network capabilities — such as multi-digit addition — are known to sometimes abruptly form or change as models train or increase in scale [8, 1] , and are of particular concern for safety as they mean that undesired or dangerous behavior could emerge abruptly. For example reward hacking, a type of safety problem, can emerge in such a phase change [9] . Thus, studying a phase change “up close” and better understanding its internal mechanics could contain generalizable lessons for addressing safety problems in future systems. In particular, the phase change we observe forms an interesting potential bridge between the microscopic domain of interpretability and the macroscopic domain of scaling laws and learning dynamics. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We start by clarifying several key concepts and definitions, including in-context learning, induction heads, and a “per-token loss analysis” method we use throughout. We then present the 6 arguments one by one, drawing on evidence from analysis of 34 transformers over the course of training, including more than 50,000 attention head ablations (the data of which is shown in the Model Analysis Table). We then discuss some unexplained “curiosities” in our findings, as well as reviewing related work. --- Key Concepts In-context Learning In modern language models, tokens later in the context are easier to predict than tokens earlier in the context. As the context gets longer, loss goes down. In some sense this is just what a sequence model is designed to do (use earlier elements in the sequence to predict later ones), but as the ability to predict later tokens from earlier ones gets better, it can increasingly be used in interesting ways (such as specifying tasks, giving instructions, or asking the model to match a pattern) that suggest it can usefully be thought of as a phenomenon of its own. When thought of in this way, it is usually referred to as in-context learning. 3 Emergent in-context learning was noted in GPT-2 [10] and gained significant attention in GPT-3 [1] . Simply by adjusting a “prompt”, transformers can be adapted to do many useful things without re-training, such as translation, question-answering, arithmetic, and many other tasks. Using “prompt engineering” to leverage in-context learning became a popular topic of study and discussion [11, 12] . At least two importantly different ways of conceptualizing and measuring in-context learning exist in the literature. The first conception, represented in Brown et al., focuses on few-shot learning [1] of specific tasks. The model is prompted with several instances of some “task” framed in a next-token-prediction format (such as few-digit addition, or English-to-French translation). The second conception of in-context learning, represented in Kaplan et al. [13] , focuses on observing the loss at different token indices, in order to measure how much better the model gets at prediction as it receives more context. The first conception can be thought of as a micro perspective (focusing on specific tasks), where as the second conception can be seen as a macro perspective (focusing on general loss, which on average correlates with these tasks). The “few-shot learning” conception of in-context learning has tended to receive greater community attention. The ability to do many different tasks with one large model, even without further fine-tuning, is a notable change to the basic economics of model training. Moreover, it gives evidence of wide-ranging general capabilities and the ability to adapt on the fly, which nudges us to re-examine what it means for a model to “understand” or to “reason”. However, for the purposes of this work, we focus instead on the Kaplan et al. conception: decreasing loss at increasing token indices. We do so because it's a more general framing of the phenomenon than “few-shot learning”. A drawback of this definition is it fails to isolate specific behaviors of interest. At the same time, it allows us to measure models’ overall ability to learn on-the-fly from the context, without depending on our specific choices of “task”. We’ll also see that, starting from this definition, we are also able to study a couple classic few-shot learning examples (see Argument 4). Throughout this work we compute a simple heuristic measure of in-context learning: - In-context learning score: the loss of the 500th token in the context minus the average loss of the 50th token in the context, averaged over dataset examples. We chose the 500th and 50th token indices somewhat arbitrarily. The 500th token is near the end of a length-512 context, and the 50th token is far enough into the context that some basic properties of the text have been established (such as language and document type) while still being near the start. We will also show that picking different numbers here does not change our conclusions. Finally, it is worth noting that in-context learning is of potentially special relevance to safety. In-context learning makes it harder to anticipate how a model might behave after a long context. In the longer run, concepts such as mesa-optimization or inner-alignment [14] postulate that meaningful learning or optimization could occur at test time (without changing the weights). In-context learning would be an obvious future mechanism for such hidden optimization to occur, whether or not it does so today. Thus, studying in-context learning seems valuable for the future. (See Related Workfor more on in-context learning, and Discussionfor more on the connection to safety.) Induction Heads In our previous paper, we discovered a special kind of attention head – which we named induction heads – in two layer attention-only models. Induction heads are implemented by a circuit consisting of a pair of attention heads in different layers that work together to copy or complete patterns. The first attention head copies information from the previous token into each token. This makes it possible for the second attention head to attend to tokens based on what happened before them, rather than their own content. Specifically, the second head (which we call the \\"induction head\\") search for a previous place in the sequence where the present token Aoccurred and attends to the next token (call it B), copying it and causing the model to be more likely to output Bas the next token. That is, the two heads working together cause the sequence …[A][B]…[A]to be more likely to be completed with [B]. Induction heads are named by analogy to inductive reasoning. In inductive reasoning, we might infer that if Ais followed by Bearlier in the context, Ais more likely to be followed by Bagain later in the same context. Induction heads crystallize that inference. They search the context for previous instances of the present token, attend to the token which would come next if the pattern repeated, and increase its probability. Induction heads attend to tokens that would be predicted by basic induction (over the context, rather than over the training data). Notice that induction heads are implementing a simple algorithm, and are not memorizing a fixed table of n-gram statistics. The rule [A][B] … [A] → [B]applies regardless of what Aand Bare. 4This means that induction heads can in some sense work out of distribution, as long as local statistics early in the context are representative of statistics later. This hints that they may be capable of more general and abstract behavior. Our previous paper focused on a few explorations of induction heads, including showing that these heads occur in 2-layer attention-only models (but not 1-layer models); tracking down how they operate mechanistically as part of our mathematical decomposition of transformers; and making an eigenvalue-based test for detecting their presence. However, we were a bit vague on the exact definition of induction heads: it was more like we found a cluster of behaviors and mechanisms that tended to occur together, and called heads in that cluster “induction heads”. In this paper our goal is to provide evidence for something more expansive: that induction heads play a major role in general in-context learning (not just literal [A][B]...[A]→[B]copying), for large models and not just for small 2-layer attention only models. To do this clearly and coherently, we need a more precise definition of induction heads. Mechanistic analysis of weights and eigenvalue analysis are much more complicated in large models with MLP’s, so for this paper we choose to define induction heads by their narrow empirical sequence copying behavior (the [A][B]...[A]→[B]), and then attempt to show that they (1) also serve a more expansive function that can be tied to in-context learning, and (2) coincide with the mechanistic picture for small models. Formally, we define an induction head as one which exhibits the following two properties 5on a repeated random sequence 6of tokens: - Prefix matching: The head attends back to previous tokens that were followed by the current and/or recent tokens. 7That is, it attends to the token which induction would suggest comes next. - Copying: The head’s output increases the logit corresponding to the attended-to token. In other words, induction heads are any heads that empirically increase the likelihood of [B]given [A][B]...[A]when shown a repeated sequence of completely random tokens. An illustration of induction heads’ behavior is shown here: Note that, as a consequence, induction heads will tend to be good at repeating sequences wholesale. For example, given “The cat sat on the mat. The cat …”, induction heads will promote the continuation “sat on the mat”. This gives a first hint of how they might be connected to general in-context learning and even few-shot learning: they learn to repeat arbitrary sequences, which is a (simple) form of few-shot learning. One of things we’ll be trying to establish is that when induction heads occur in sufficiently large models and operate on sufficiently abstract representations, the very same heads that do this sequence copying also take on a more expanded role of analogical sequence copying or in-context nearest neighbors. By this we mean that they promote sequence completions like [A*][B*] … [A] → [B]where A*is not exactly the same token as Abut similar in some embedding space, and also Bis not exactly the same token as B*. For example, Aand A*(as well as B and B*) might be the same word in different languages, and the induction head can then translate a sentence word by word by looking for “something like A”, finding A*followed byB*, and then completing with “something like B*” (which is B). We are not yet able to prove mechanistically that induction heads do this in general, but in Argument 4we show empirical examples of induction heads behaving in this way (including on translation), and in Argument 5we point out that the known copying mechanism of induction heads in small models can be naturally adapted to function in this way. Per-Token Loss Analysis To better understand how models evolve during training, we analyze what we call the \\"per-token loss vectors.\\" The core idea traces back to a method used by Erhan et al. [15] , and more generally to the idea of \\"function spaces\\" in mathematics. 8 We start with a collection of models. (In our use, we'll train several different model architectures, saving dozens of “snapshots” of each over the course of training. We’ll use this set of snapshots as our collection of models.) Next, we collect the log-likelihoods each model assigns to a consistent set of 10,000 random tokens, each taken from a different example sequence. We combine these log-likelihoods into a \\"per-token loss vector\\" and apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A more detailed discussion of technical details can be found in the Appendix. By applying this method to snapshots over training for multiple models, we can visualize and compare how different models' training trajectories evolve in terms of their outputs. Since we're using PCA, each direction can be thought of as a vector of log-likelihoods that models are moving along. We particularly focus on the first two principal components, since we can easily visualize those. Of course, models also move in directions not captured by the first two principal components, but it's a useful visualization for capturing the highest-level story of training. --- Arguments that induction heads are the mechanism for the majority of in-context learning. Now we’ll proceed to the main part of the paper, which makes the case that induction heads may provide the primary mechanism for the majority of in-context learning for transformer models in general. As stated in the introduction, this is a very broad hypothesis and much of our evidence is indirect, but nevertheless we believe that all the lines of evidence together make a relatively strong, though not conclusive, case. Before we go through the arguments, it’s useful to delineate where the evidence is more conclusive vs. less conclusive. This is shown in the table below. For small, attention-only models, we believe we have strong evidence that attention heads are the mechanism for the majority of in-context learning, as we have evidence supported by ablations and mechanistic reverse engineering. Conversely, for all models, we can make a strong case that induction heads play some role in in-context learning, as we can demonstrate examples and show suggestive correlations. However, the larger the models get, the harder it is to establish that induction heads account for the actual majority of in-context learning. For large models with MLP’s, we must therefore rely on mainly correlational evidence, which could be confounded. We explore alternate hypotheses throughout, including at the end of Argument 1and again briefly in Argument 6. SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE FOR SUB-CLAIMS (STRONGEST ARGUMENT FOR EACH) Small Attention-Only Small with MLPs Large Models Contributes Some Strong, Causal Strong, Causal Medium, Correlational & Mechanistic Contributes Majority Strong, Causal Medium, Causal Medium, Correlational Here is the list of arguments we’ll be making, one per section, repeated from the introduction: - Argument 1 (Macroscopic co-occurrence): Transformer language models undergo a “phase change” early in training, during which induction heads form and simultaneously in-context learning improves dramatically. - Argument 2 (Macroscopic co-perturbation): When we change the transformer architecture in a way that shifts whether induction heads can form (and when), the dramatic improvement in in-context learning shifts in a precisely matching way. - Argument 3 (Direct ablation): When we directly “knock out” induction heads at test-time in small models, the amount of in-context learning greatly decreases. - Argument 4 (Specific examples of induction head generality): Although we define induction heads very narrowly in terms of copying literal sequences, we empirically observe that these same heads also appear to implement more sophisticated types of in-context learning, including highly abstract behaviors, making it plausible they explain a large fraction of in-context learning. - Argument 5 (Mechanistic plausibility of induction head generality): For small models, we can explain mechanistically how induction heads work, and can show they contribute to in-context learning. Furthermore, the actual mechanism of operation suggests natural ways in which it could be repurposed to perform more general in-context learning. - Argument 6 (Continuity from small to large models): In the previous 5 arguments, the case for induction heads explaining in-context learning is stronger for small models than for large ones. However, many behaviors and data related to both induction heads and in-context learning are smoothly continuous from small to large models, suggesting the simplest explanation is that mechanisms are the same. For each argument, we’ll have a similar table to the one in this section, showing the strength of the evidence provided by that claim as it applies to large/small models and some/most of context learning. The table above is the sum of the evidence from all six lines of reasoning. --- Argument 1: Transformer language models undergo a “phase change” during training, during which induction heads form and simultaneously in-context learning improves dramatically. Our first line of evidence comes from correlating measures of in-context learning and measures of induction head presence over the course of training. Specifically, we observe a tight co-variation between them across dozens of models, of different sizes, trained on different datasets (See Model Analysis Tablefor more on the models in which we observe this co-occurrence.). The table below summarizes the quality of this evidence for the models we have studied: it applies to both large and small models, and is the expected outcome if induction heads were responsible for the majority of in-context learning, but it is only correlational and so could be confounded (discussed more below). STRENGTH OF ARGUMENT FOR SUB-CLAIMS Small Attention-Only Small with MLPs Large Models Contributes Some Medium, Correlational Medium, Correlational Medium, Correlational Contributes Majority Medium, Correlational Medium, Correlational Medium, Correlational Our first observation is that if we measure in-context learning for transformer models over the course of training (defined as the 50th token loss minus the 500th token loss as described in Key Concepts), it develops abruptly in a narrow window early in training (roughly 2.5 to 5 billion tokens) and then is constant for the rest of training (see figure below). Before this window there is less than 0.15 nats of in-context learning, after it there is roughly 0.4 nats, an amount that remains constant for the rest of training and is also constant across many different model sizes (except for the one layer model where not much in-context learning ever forms). This seems surprising – naively, one might expect in-context learning to improve gradually over training, and improve with larger model sizes, 9as most things in machine learning do. Although we only show three models above, the pattern holds true very generally: many examples are shown in the Model Analysis Tablelater in the paper, including models of varying model architecture and size. One might wonder if the sudden increase is somehow an artifact of the choice to define in-context learning in terms of the difference between the 500th and 50th tokens. We'll discuss this in more depth later. But for now, an easy way to see that this is a robust phenomenon is to look at the derivative of loss with respect to the logarithm token index in context. You can think of this as measuring something like \\"in-context learning per ε% increase in context length.\\" We can visualize this on a 2D plot, where one axis is the amount of training that has elapsed, the other is the token index being predicted. Before the phase change, loss largely stops improving around token 50, but after the phase change, loss continues to improve past that point. It turns out that a sudden improvement in in-context learning isn't the only thing that changes in this window. If we go through the attention heads of a model and and score them for whether they are induction heads (using a prefix matching score which measures their ability to perform the task we used to define induction heads in Key Concepts), we find that induction heads form abruptly during exactly the same window where in-context learning develops (figure below). Again we show only a few models here, but a full set is shown in the Model Analysis Table. The exception is the one-layer model, where induction heads never form – just as in-context learning never substantially develops for the one-layer model. This already strongly suggests some connection between induction heads and in-context learning, but beyond just that, it appears this window is a pivotal point for the training process in general: whatever's occurring is visible as a bump on the training curve (figure below). It is in fact the only place in training where the loss is not convex (monotonically decreasing in slope). That might not sound significant, but the loss curve is averaging over many thousands of tokens. Many behaviors people find interesting in language models, such as the emergence of arithmetic, would be microscopic on the loss curve. For something to be visible at that scale suggests it's a widespread, major change in model behavior. This shift also appears to be the first point where, at least for small models, the loss curve diverges from a one-layer model – which does not display the bump, just as it does not display the other abrupt changes. We can also apply principal components analysis (PCA) to the per-token losses, as described in per-token-loss analysis, which allows us to summarize the main dimensions of variation in how several models' predictions vary over the course of training. Below we show the first two principal components of these models’ predictions, with the golden outline highlighting the same interval shown above, when in-context learning abruptly improved. We see that the training trajectories pivot during exactly the same window where the other changes happen. In some sense, whatever is occurring when in-context learning improves is the primary deviation from the basic trajectory our transformers follow during the course of their training. Once again the only exception is the one-layer model – where induction heads cannot form and in-context learning does not improve. In summary, the following things all co-occur during the same abrupt window: - Capacity for in-context learning sharply improves (as measured via the in-context learning score). - Induction heads form. - Loss undergoes a small “bump” (that is, the loss curve undergoes a period of visibly steeper improvement than the parts of the curve before and after). - The model’s trajectory abruptly changes (in the space of per-token losses, as visualized with PCA). Collectively these results suggest that some important transition is happening during the 2.5e9 to 5e9 token window early in training (for large models this is maybe 1-2% of the way through training). We call this transition “the phase change”, in that it’s an abrupt change that alters the model’s behavior and has both macroscopic (loss and in-context learning curves) and microscopic (induction heads) manifestations, perhaps analogous to e.g. ice melting. 10 Looking at the Phase Change More Closely A natural explanation would be that for all these models, the induction heads implement in-context learning: their formation is what drives all the other changes observed. To strengthen this hypothesis a bit, we check a few things. First, the window where the phase change happens doesn’t appear to correspond to a scheduled change in learning rate, warmup, or weight decay; there is not some known exogenous factor precipitating everything. Second, we tried out training some of the small models on a different dataset, and we observed the phase change develop in the same way (see Model Analysis Tablefor more details). 11 Third, to strengthen the connection a little more, we look qualitatively and anecdotally at what’s going on with the model’s behavior during the phase change. One way to do this is to look at specific tokens the model gets better and worse at predicting. The model's loss is an average of billions of log-likelihood losses for individual tokens. By pulling them apart, we can get a sense for what's changed. Concretely, let's pick a piece of text – for fun, we'll use the first paragraph of Harry Potter – and look at the differences in log-likelihoods comparing the start and the end of the phase change. 12We'll notice that the majority of the changes occur when tokens are repeated multiple times in the text. If a sequence of tokens occurs multiple times, the model is better at predicting the sequence the second time it shows up. On the other hand, if a token is followed by a different token than it previously was, the post-phase-change model is worse at predicting it: We can also do this same analysis over the course of model training. The loss curve is the average of millions of per-token loss curves. We can break this apart and look at the loss curves for individual tokens. In particular, let’s take a look at per-token loss trajectories for two tokens in the first paragraph of Harry Potter. In red, we show a token whose prediction gets dramatically better during the phase change: it’s the last of four tokens in “ The Dursleys”, a sequence that appears several times in the text. In blue, we show a token that gets meaningfully worse during the phase change: it’s the first-ever appearance of “ Mrs Potter”, after both previous instances of “ Mrs” were followed by “ Dursley” instead. All of this shows that during the phase change, we see exactly the behaviors we’d expect to see if induction heads were indeed contributing the majority of in-context learning. Assessing the Evidence Despite all of the co-occurrence evidence above (and more in the Model Analysis Table), the fact remains that we haven’t shown that induction heads are the primary mechanism for in-context learning. We have merely shown that induction heads form at the same time as in-context learning, and that in-context learning does not improve thereafter. There are a number of potential confounds in this story. Below we summarize reasons in favor and against thinking the connection is causal. The argument in favor might look like this: - The formation of induction heads is correlated with a great increase in models' capacity for in-context learning, for a wide variety of models large and small. - It's highly improbable these two sharp transitions would co-occur across so many models by pure chance, without any causal connection. - There is almost surely some connection, and the simplest possibility is that induction heads are the primary mechanism driving the observed increase in in-context learning. (However, as discussed below, it could also be a confounding variable.) - Since over 75% of final in-context learning forms in this window, one might naively believe this to be the amount of in-context learning that induction heads are responsible for. However, the following issues and confounds suggest caution: - In large models, we have low time resolution on our analysis over training. Co-occurrence when one only has 15 points in time is less surprising and weaker evidence. - Perhaps other mechanisms form in our models at this point, that contribute to not only induction heads, but also other sources of in-context learning. (For example, perhaps the phase change is really the point at which the model learns how to compose layers through the residual stream, enabling both induction heads and potentially many other mechanisms that also require composition of multiple heads) Put another way, perhaps the co-occurrence is primarily caused by a shared latent variable, rather than direct causality from induction heads to the full observed change in in-context learning. - The fact that in-context learning score is roughly constant (at 0.4 nats) after the phase change doesn't necessarily mean that the underlying mechanisms of in-context learning are constant after that point. In particular, the metric we use measures a relative loss between the token index 500 and 50, and we know that the model’s performance at token 50 improves over training time. Reducing the loss a fixed amount from a lower baseline is likely harder, and so may be driven by additional mechanisms as training time goes on. 1314 One point worth noting here is that the argument that induction heads account for most in-context learning at the transition point of the phase change is more solid than the argument that they account for most in-context learning at the end of training – a lot could be changing during training even as the in-context learning score remains constant. --- Argument 2: When we change the transformer architecture in a way that shifts when induction heads form or whether they can form, the dramatic improvement in in-context learning shifts in a precisely matching way. STRENGTH OF ARGUMENT FOR SUB-CLAIMS Small Attention-Only Small with MLPs Large Models Contributes Some Medium, Interventional Medium, Interventional Weak, Interventional Contributes Majority Medium, Interventional Medium, Interventional Weak, Interventional One thing that falls short about Argument 1is that we’re just observing induction heads and in-context learning co-vary; like any observational study, it is not as convincing as if we actively changed one thing and measured what happened to the other. In this section we do a more “interventional” experiment, in which we change the model architecture in a way that makes induction heads easier to form, and observe the effect on in-context learning. The change makes a bigger difference for smaller models so is more convincing there, but also carries some amount of weight for larger models (see table above). To design our experiment, we start with the observation (noted in the previous section) that the phase change and the corresponding improvement in in-context learning only occurs in transformers with more than one layer. This is what we'd predict if induction heads were the mechanism for the majority of in-context learning: induction heads require a composition of attention heads, which is only possible with two or more layers. 15 Of course, the observation about one-layer models is pretty weak evidence by itself. (One could imagine one-layer models being different from models with more layers in all sorts of ways!) But it suggests a more general line of attack. If induction heads are the mechanism behind the large improvement in in-context learning, that makes predictions about the minimum architectural requirements in order to achieve the observed improvement. For a standard transformer, the important thing is to have two attention layers. But that's only because the key vectors need to be a function of the attended token and the token before it. We define a “smeared key\\" architecture with a very simple modification that should make it easy for transformers of any depth to express induction heads. In our modified models, for each head ℎh, we introduce a trainable real parameter �ℎα h which we use as �(�ℎ)∈[0,1]σ(α h )∈[0,1]to interpolate between the key for the current token and previous token 16: ��ℎ = �(�ℎ)��ℎ + (1−�(�ℎ))��−1ℎk j h = σ(α h )k j h + (1−σ(α h ))k j−1 h The hypothesis that induction heads are the primary mechanism of in-context learning predicts that the phase change will happen in one-layer models with this change, and perhaps might happen earlier in models with more layers. If they're one of several major contributing factors, we might expect some of the in-context learning improvement to happen early, and the rest at the same time as the original phase change. The results (figure below) are in line with the predictions: when we use the smeared-key architecture, in-context learning does indeed form for one-layer models (when it didn’t before), and it forms earlier for two-layer and larger models. More such results can be seen in the model analysis table. These plots are an excerpt of the Model Analysis Table; look there to see more analysis of how the smear models compare to their vanilla counterparts. However, we probably shouldn't make too strong an inference about large models on this evidence. This experiment suggests that induction heads are the minimal mechanism for greatly increased in-context learning in transformers. But one could easily imagine that in larger models, this mechanism isn’t the whole story, and also this experiment doesn’t refute the idea of the mechanism of in-context learning changing over the course of training. --- Argument 3: When we directly “knock out” induction heads in small models at test-time, the amount of in-context learning greatly decreases. STRENGTH OF ARGUMENT FOR SUB-CLAIMS Small Attention-Only Small with MLPs Large Models Contributes Some Strong, Causal Strong, Causal Contributes Majority Strong, Causal Medium, Causal For the cases they cover, ablations are by far our strongest evidence. The basic argument is that knocking out induction heads decreases the amount of in-context learning we observe in our models. By “knocking out” we mean that we remove a given attention head from the model at test time, doing a forward pass on the transformer without it. (See our methods sectionfor exact details of how the ablation is done.) The ablations presented below show how attention heads contribute to in-context learning, but we can also do ablations to study how attention heads contribute to the overall behavior change that occurs during the phase change (see the Model Analysis Table). These plots are a small excerpt of the Model Analysis Table; look there to see the full evidence. See our methods sectionfor exact details of how the ablation is done. In fact, almost all the in-context learning in small attention-only models appears to come from these induction heads! This begins at the start of the phase change, and remains true through the end of training. 17 Unfortunately, we do not have ablations for our full-scale models. 18For the models where we do have ablations, it seems like this evidence is clearly dispositive that induction heads increase in-context learning (at least as we've chosen to evaluate it). But can we further infer that they're the primary mechanism? A couple considerations: - In attention-only models, in-context learning must essentially be a sum of contributions from different attention heads. 19But in models with MLPs, in-context learning could also come from interactions between MLP and attention layers. While ablating attention heads would affect such mechanisms, the relationship between the effect of the ablation on in-context learning and its true importance becomes more complicated. 20As a result, we can't be fully confident that head ablations in MLP models give us the full picture. - Our ablations measure the marginal effects of removing attention heads from the model. To the extent two heads do something similar and the layer norm before the logits rescales things, the importance of individual heads may be masked. All things considered, we feel comfortable concluding from this that induction heads are the primary mechanism for in-context learning in small attention-only models, but see this evidence as only suggestive for the MLP case. --- Argument 4: Despite being defined narrowly as copying random sequences, induction heads can implement surprisingly abstract types of in-context learning. STRENGTH OF ARGUMENT FOR SUB-CLAIMS Small Attention-Only Small with MLPs Large Models Contributes Some Plausibility Contributes Majority Plausibility All of our previous evidence (in Arguments 1-3) focused on observing or perturbing the connection between induction head formation and macroscopic in-context learning. A totally different angle is to just find examples of induction heads implementing seemingly-difficult in-context learning behaviors; this would make it plausible that induction heads account for the majority of in-context learning. This evidence applies even to the very largest models (and we study up to 12B parameter models), but since it shows only a small number of tasks, it’s only suggestive regarding in-context learning in general. Recall that we defineinduction heads as heads that empirically copy arbitrary token sequences using a “prefix matching” attention pattern. Our goal is to find heads that meet this definition but also perform more interesting and sophisticated behaviors, essentially showing that induction heads in large models can be “generalizable”. In this argument, we show some anecdotal examples of induction heads from larger transformers (our 40-layer modelwith 13 billion parameters) that exhibit exactly such behaviors – namely literal copying, translation, and a specific type of abstract pattern matching. The behaviors are all of the form [A*][B*]...[A][B], aka the “fuzzy nearest neighbor match” or “find something similar early in the sequence and complete the sequence in analogy”. We verify that these heads score highly on our “copying” and “prefix matching” evaluations(that is, they increase the probability of the token they attend to, and attend to tokens where the prefix matches the present token on random text), and are thus “induction heads” by our strict empirical definition, at the same time as they also perform these more sophisticated tasks. The results of some example heads are shown in the table below, and described in the subsections below. Head Layer Depth Copying score (?) Prefix matching score (?) Literal copying head 21 / 40 0.89 0.75 Translation head 7 / 40 0.20 0.85 Pattern-matching head 8 / 40 0.69 0.94 Behavior 1: Literal sequence copying We'll start with the simplest case of a head that literally copies repeated text, to get familiar with the visualization interface we're using and the basic dynamics of these heads. We've selected an induction head which seems to perform very basic copying behavior and will look at how it behaves on the first paragraph of Harry Potter. We've repeated the first few sentences afterwards to show the head's behavior on longer segments of repeated text. The visualization will show two different things: - In red, \\"Attention\\" lets you see where the head is attending to predict the next token. - In blue, \\"Logit attr\\" shows the earlier tokens that contributed to the prediction of the current token, using \\"direct-path\\" logit attribution. 21 To start exploring the visualization, we suggest to try hovering your cursor over the second paragraph.

Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.

In all cases, these successful predictions are made by attending back to a previous instance where this phrase was present in the text. Behavior 2: Translation It's a well-known result that language models can translate between languages. Intriguingly, we've encountered many examples of induction heads that can do translation. Here, we explore a head we found in layer 7 of our 40-layer model, showcasing translation between English, French, and German. (As with the others in this section, this head is also an “induction head” by the same definition we’ve been using all along, because when shown repeated random tokens, it uses a “prefix matching” attention pattern to copy the sequence verbatim.)

As this head attends sequentially to past tokens that will semantically come next, the attended token position in the earlier sentences jumps around. The logit attribution patterns for this head are not perfectly sharp; that is, even in cases where the attention head is attending to the matching word in an earlier language, it does not always directly increase the logit of the corresponding prediction. We would guess that this is because this head’s output needs to be further processed by later layers. However, taken overall, the direct logit attributions show clear evidence of contributing on net to the correct translation. Behavior 3: Pattern matching In this final example, we show an attention head (found at layer 26 of our 40-layer model) which does more complex pattern matching. One might even think of it as learning a simple function in context! (Again, this head also scores highly on ourmeasurementsof “basic” induction behavior when shown repeated random sequences, so it is an induction head by that definition.) To explore this behavior, we've generated some synthetic text which follows a simple pattern. Each line follows one of four templates, followed by a label for which template it is drawn from. The template is random selected, as are the words which fill in the template: - (month) (animal): 0 - (month) (fruit): 1 - (color) (animal): 2 - (color) (fruit): 3 Below, we show how the attention head behaves on this synthetic example. To make the diagram easier to read, we've masked the attention pattern to only show the \\":\\" tokens are the destination, and the logit attribution to only show where the output is the integer tokens.

It often knows to skip over lines where one of the words is identical but the pattern is wrong (such as “January bird” primarily attending to “April fish” and not “grey bird”). This head isn’t perfect at this, but empirically it allocates about 65% of its attention from the colons to the correct positions, when tested on a range of similar problems. What’s going on with more abstract heads that are also induction heads? We emphasize again that the attention heads that we described above simultaneously implement both the abstract behaviors that we described, and these very same attention heads (as in, the exact same head in the same layer) also satisfy the formal definitionof induction head (literal copying of random sequences using prefix matching). The comparison is not a metaphor or a blurring of the definition: induction heads which are defined by their ability to copy literal sequences turn out to also sometimes match more abstract patterns. This is what the table at the beginning of the section shows empirically. But this still leaves the question: why do the same heads that inductively copy random text also exhibit these other behaviors? One hint is that these behaviors can be seen as “spiritually similar” to copying. Recall that where an induction head is defined as implementing a rule like [A][B] … [A] → [B], our empirically observed heads also do something like [A*][B*] … [A] → [B]where A*and B*are similar to Aand Bin some higher-level representation. There are several ways these similar behaviors could be connected. For example, note that the first behavior is a special case of the second, so perhaps induction heads are implementing a more general algorithm that reverts to the special case of copying when given a repeated sequence 22. Another possibility is that induction heads implement literal copying when they take a path through the residual stream that includes only them, but implement more abstract behaviors when they process the outputs of earlier layers that create more abstract representations (such as representations where the same word in English and French are embedded in the same place). In Argument 5we’ll strengthen this argument by giving a mechanistic account of how induction heads (when doing simple copying with prefix-matching) attend back to the token that comes next in the pattern, and observe that the actual mechanism they use could naturally generalize to more abstract pattern matching. Our point in this section is just that it's actually quite natural for these more abstract induction heads to also exhibit the basic copying behaviors underlying our definition. --- Argument 5: For small models, we can explain mechanistically how induction heads work, and can show they contribute to in-context learning. Furthermore, the actual mechanism of operation suggests natural ways in which it could be re-purposed to perform more general in-context learning. STRENGTH OF ARGUMENT FOR SUB-CLAIMS Small Attention-Only Small with MLPs Large Models Contributes Some Strong, Mechanistic Strong, Mechanistic Medium, Mechanistic Contributes Majority Weak, Mechanistic One of the main reasons we care about whether induction heads drive in-context learning is that we can understand them and so have a path to understanding in-context learning. But we can also turn this around: we can use our understanding of induction heads to make a purely logical argument that they should contribute to in-context learning. We begin with a semi-empirical argument. Let's take for granted that induction heads behave the way we've described and empirically seen, searching the context for previous examples and copying what happened next. We should expect such a procedure to improve a model's ability to predict tokens later in its context. We're essentially using the previous context as data points for a nearest neighbor algorithm, and nearest neighbors improves as one gives it more data points. Therefore, if induction heads exist as described, they would contribute to in-context learning as we've defined it. In some sense, this argument is quite strong if we're only arguing that there exist some cases where induction heads contribute to in-context learning. We've seen concrete examples above where induction heads improve token predictions by copying earlier examples. If nothing else, they must help in those cases! And more generally, our definition of induction heads (in terms of their behavior on repeated random sequences) suggests they behave this way quite generally. This argument doesn't say anything about what fraction of in-context learning is performed by induction heads, but it seems like a very strong argument that some is, both in large and small models. But the really satisfying thing about this line of attack — namely, using our understanding of induction heads to anticipate their impact on in-context learning — is that we can actually drop the dependency on empirical observations of induction head behavior, at the cost of needing to make a more complex argument. In our previous paper, we were able to reverse engineer induction heads, showing from the parameter level how they implement induction behavior (and that they should). If we trust this analysis, we can know how induction heads behave without actually running them, and the argument we made in the previous paragraph goes through. Of course, there are some limitations. In the previous paper, we only reverse engineered a single induction head in a small attention-only model, although we can reverse engineered others (and have done so). A bigger issue is that right now we're unable to reverse engineer induction heads in models with MLP layers. But at least in some cases we’ve observed, we can look at the parameters of a transformer and identify induction heads, just as a programmer might identify an algorithm by reading through source code. We can actually push this argument a bit further in the case of the two-layer attention only transformer we reverse engineered in the previous paper. Not only do we understand the induction heads and know that they should contribute to in-context learning, but there doesn't seem to really be an alternative mechanism that could be driving it. 23This suggests that induction heads are the primary driver of in-context learning, at least in very small models. The following section will briefly summarize reverse engineering induction heads. Note that it relies heavily on linking to our previous paper. We do not expect it to be possible to follow without reading the linked portions. After that, we briefly discuss how the described mechanism could also implement more abstract types of induction head behavior. Summary of Reverse Engineering Induction Heads Note: This section provides a dense summary with pointers to our previous paper; please see the previous paper for more information. Recall from Key Conceptsthat induction heads are defined as heads that exhibit both copying and prefix matching. Copying is done by the OV (\\"Output-Value\\") circuit. One of the defining properties of an induction head is that it copies. Induction heads are not alone in this! Transformers seem to have quite a number of copying heads, of which induction heads are a subset. This is done by having a \\"copying matrix\\" OV circuit, most easily characterized by its positive eigenvalues. Prefix matching is implemented with K-composition (and to a lesser extent Q-composition) in the QK (\\"Query-Key\\") Circuit. In order to do prefix matching, the key vector at the attended token needs to contain information about the preceding tokens — in fact, information about the attended token itself is quite irrelevant to calculating the attention pattern for induction. 24In the models we study, “key shifting” occurs primarily using what we call K-composition. That is to say that an induction head’s ��W K reads from a subspace written to by an earlier attention head. The most basic form of an induction head uses pure K-composition with an earlier “previous token head” to create a QK-Circuit term of the form Id⊗ℎ����⊗�Id⊗h prev ⊗Wwhere �Whas positive eigenvalues. This term causes the induction head to compare the current token with every earlier position's preceding token and look for places where they're similar. More complex QK circuit terms can be used to create induction heads which match on more than just the preceding token. Induction heads use previous heads to shift key information and match it against the present token. As they get more sophisticated, they also shift query information. Combined, these are a detectable mechanism for induction heads. In the small models we studied in our previous paper, all induction heads have the described QK term driving their attention pattern and a positive eigenvalue circuit performing copying. Some models use a different mechanism to implement induction heads. In GPT-2 [10] , we've seen evidence of a second \\"pointer-arithmetic\\" mechanism for induction heads. This mechanism makes use of the positional embedding and “Q-composition”. In GPT-2, the earlier attention head attends to previous copies of the current token, and its ���W O Vcircuit copies their positional embedding into a subspace in the present token. The induction head then uses Q-composition to rotate that position embedding one token forward, and thereby attend to the following token. This mechanism isn't available to the models we study here, since they do not add positional information into the residual stream. 25 What About More Complex Induction Heads? What about the induction heads we saw in Argument 2 with more complex behavior? Can we also reverse engineer them? Do they operate on the same mechanisms? Presently, fully reverse engineering them is beyond us, since they exist in large models with MLPs, which we don't have a strong framework for mechanistically understanding. However, we hypothesize they're different in two ways: (1) using more complex QK terms rather than matching on just the previous token; and (2) matching and copying more abstract and sophisticated linguistic features, rather than precise tokens. When we first introducedinduction heads, we observed that they could be seen as a kind of \\"in-context nearest neighbor\\" algorithm. From this perspective, it seems natural that applying the same mechanism to more abstract features can produce more complex behavior. --- Argument 6: Extrapolation from small models suggests induction heads are responsible for the majority of in-context learning in large models. STRENGTH OF ARGUMENT FOR SUB-CLAIMS Small Attention-Only Small with MLPs Large Models Contributes Some Analogy Contributes Majority Analogy This argument is really an extended inference from all the above arguments. Arguments 1-5 present fairly strong evidence that in small transformers (especially small attention-only models), induction heads are responsible for the majority of in-context learning, while for large transformers, the evidence is not as strong. To what extent can one reasonably infer from small models that the same thing is happening in larger models? Obviously this is a matter of judgment. The measurements in the model analysis tablelook fully analogous between the small attention-only, small models with MLPs, and full-scale model cases. Provided there's more than one layer, all of them go through a phase change. All of them have the same sharp increase in in-context learning, with the same rough amounts before and after the transition. All of them trace similar paths in PCA space. All of them form induction heads. If things change from the small model case to the large model case, where do they change? And why is there no visible sign of the change in all our measurements? On the flip side, there are many cases where large models behave very differently than small models (see discussion of phase changes with respect to model size in Related Work). Extrapolating from small models to models many orders of magnitude larger is something one should do with caution. The most compelling alternative possibility we see is that other composition mechanisms may also form during the phase change. Larger models have more heads, which gives them more capacity for other interesting Q-composition and K-composition mechanisms that small models can’t afford to express. If all “composition heads” form simultaneously during the phase change, then it’s possible that above some size, non-induction composition heads could together account for more of the phase change and in-context learning improvement than induction heads do. --- Model Analysis Table The arguments above are based on analysis of 34 decoder-only Transformer language models, with different snapshots saved over the course of training, for one run of training per model. The models are drawn from four different model series as follows: - “Small, attention-only models”, a series of models (from 1-layer to 6-layer) that do not have MLPs, and were trained specifically for the present investigations. - “Small models with MLPs”, a series of models (from 1-layer to 6-layer) that have both attention and MLP layers, and were trained specifically for the present investigations. - “Full-scale models”, a series of successively-larger models with MLPs (ranging from 4 layers and 13M parameters, up to 40 layers and 13B parameters), that are used as the basis for multiple projects at Anthropic. - “Smeared key models”, a targeted architectural experiment designed to allow transformers of any depth to express induction heads. The dataset used for training the small models and smeared key models was an earlier version of the dataset described in Askell et al. [18] , consisting of filtered common crawl data [19] and internet books, along with several other smaller distributions [20] , including approximately 10% python code. The full-scale models were trained on an improved version of roughly the same data distribution. Additionally, another set of the small models was trained on a different dataset, consisting of just internet books, to explore the impact of varying the dataset. All models trained on a given dataset saw the same examples in the same order. Models never saw the same training data twice. For more details on model architecture and training, continue past the table below, to the Model Detailssection. In the Model Analysis Table below, each row includes a brief summary of the measurement shown. For a more in-depth explanation of the data collectionand results analysis, see the Appendix. SMALL ATTENTION-ONLY TRANSFORMERS This experiment series studies small attention-onlytransformers, because these are the models we have the strongest theoretical understanding of (see the framework paper). For these small models, we're able to capture snapshots with a high time resolution over early training. These experiments are the ones that most cleanly demonstrate the phase change and link it to induction heads. Note how (1) many models undergo a discontinuous phase change (seen most clearly in the PCA plot and in-context learning score); (2) it appears to be caused by induction heads (see ablations); and (3) the only model without a phase change is the one-layer model.

These include models both with MLPs and without MLPs (i.e. “attention only” models). They have a context window of 81928192tokens, a 2162 16 token vocabulary, an residual stream dimension ������=768d model =768, and 1212attention heads per layer regardless of total model size. They were trained for 10,000 steps (~10 billion tokens), saving 200200snapshots at intervals of every 5050steps. Their positional embeddings are implemented with a variant on the standard positional embeddings (similar to Press et al. [17] ). The training dataset is described earlier at the start of the Model Analysis Table. We observe a “phase change” phenomenon that appears at approximately 11-33billion tokens in the small models. It might be reasonable to ask whether these phenomena are driven by scheduled changes to the hyperparameters, such as learning rate or weight decay. Weight decay was reduced at 47504750steps (approximately 55billion tokens), the effects of which can be seen as a slight deviation about halfway through the displayed loss curves, occurring at the exact same point for all models; this is not related to the phase change, as this step number is notably beyond the range in which the phase change occurs. The only other hyperparameter change that occurs within the range of the phase change is the learning rate warm-up, which ramps up over the first 1.5�91.5e9tokens. FULL-SCALE MODELS The “full-scale models” are from the same set of models as described in Askell et al. [18] The context window and vocabulary size are the same as the small models (that is, 81928192tokens and 2162 16 tokens respectively). Unlike the small models, their dimensions are adjusted to scale up with increasing size, with an activation dimension ������=128∗������d model =128∗n layer , and a varying number of attention heads (See Appendixfor full details). The models have both dense and local attention heads. In a local attention head, each token may only attend to earlier tokens within a fixed window of relative positions. Dense heads are the standard head, where a token may attend to any earlier token (including itself). The training dataset is described earlier at the start of the Model Analysis Table. Snapshots from these models were saved at exponential step numbers, at an interval of 2×2×. For our analyses we use snapshots at steps from 252 5 through 2172 17 , plus one or two final saves thereafter, for a total of 1515saved snapshots (except the 4040L which has 1414saved snapshots). 26This corresponds to a consistent number of tokens across all models up through 2112 11 steps (=2.15�09=2.15e09tokens), after which adjustments to the training schedule cause the number of tokens per step to increase for the 2424L and 4040L models.

These models were otherwise proportioned and trained exactly the same as the small models. We present these only at one-layer and two-layer sizes. --- Unexplained Curiosities As with all scientific investigations, in the course of this work we’ve encountered a few unexplained phenomena. In this section, we discuss these and provide very preliminary investigations of a few that were especially surprising. Seemingly Constant In-Context Learning Score One of the stranger observations in this paper is that in-context learning score(as we've defined it: the loss of the 500th token in the context minus the loss of the 50th token in the context) is more or less the same for all models after the phase change. It appears to not matter whether the model is a tiny two layer model or a fairly large 13 billion parameter model, nor whether the model has just gone through the phase change or trained much longer. The only thing that matters, seemingly, is whether the model has gone through the phase change at all. A natural question is whether this might be an artifact of the relatively arbitrary definition. Afterall, there's no reason to privilege token index 50 or 500 in the context. But it appears that varying these doesn't matter. In the following plot, we show how the large models' \\"in-context learning score\\" varies if we define it instead as the difference between the loss at the final token in the context (8192) and other indices. While there are small differences between models – for some definitions, small models would do slightly more \\"in-context learning\\"! 27– all definitions appear to show that the amount of in-context learning varies only slightly between models. How can this be? First, it's important to be clear that large models still predict tokens at all indices better than small models, and they're best at predicting later tokens. What's going on is that the large models gain all their advantage over small models very early in the context. In fact, the majority of the difference forms in the first ten tokens: It seems that large models are able to pull a lot of information out of the very early context. (This might partly be, as an example, because their increased world knowledge mean they don't need to gain as much information from the context.) They then further decrease their loss by a roughly fixed amount over the remainder of the context. 28It seems likely this fixed amount is in some sense \\"more difficult in-context learning\\" for large models, since they're starting from a lower loss baseline. While it still seems mysterious to us why models should have the same in-context learning score, this perspective makes it \\"strange\\" rather than \\"shocking\\". Phase Change Effect on Loss Derivatives Another observation we find quite striking is that if one looks at the derivative of the loss curves of models of different sizes, it appears that their order switches at the phase change. This is most easily seen by plotting the derivative of loss with respect to the log of elapsed tokens (since loss curves are often most easily reasoned about on a log x-axis). The key observation is that the loss decreases more slowly for small models than large models before the phase change, but the opposite is true after. While it doesn't seem that surprising that small models learn more quickly in early training, it is striking that this inversion seems to coincide with the phase change. It's another piece of evidence that suggests the phase change is an important transition point in the training of transformers. Additional Curiosities In the model analysis table: - The 6-layer attention-only model has an unusual head that develops in the later half of training. This head is not an induction head, and yet ablating it has an effect similar to reversing the phase change (in the “before-and-after vector” attribution plot). What is this head? - The 4-layer MLP model ablations are nowhere near as “peaky” as those of any other model. What is different about this model’s development? - The 6-layer MLP model shows a “loss spike”. We don’t yet know what causes loss spikes. - The 6-layer MLP model has one lone induction head whose ablation has the opposite effect on the in-context learning score. What is this head? And in the Appendix: - Full-scale models above 16 layers start to show a small number of heads that score well on “prefix search”, but get a negative score on copying, which means they are not induction heads. What can we learn about these “anti-copying prefix-search” heads? --- Discussion Safety Implications The ultimate motivation of our research is the theory that reverse engineering neural networks might help us be confident in their safety. Our work is only a very preliminary step towards that goal, but it it does begin to approach several safety-relevant issues: Phase changes: If neural network behavior discontinuously changes from one scale to the next, this makes it more challenging for researchers and society to prepare for future problems. In-Context Learning: In-context learning has been a topic of concerned speculation in the safety community. With less-capable neural networks, one might be tempted to treat their behavior as relatively fixed after training. (That said, demonstrations of adversarial reprogramming [21] shed some doubt on this assumption.) In-context learning highlights that model behavior can in some sense “change” during inference, without further training. Even if we think of in-context learning as “locating” an already-learned behavior [22] , rather than learning something new, the behavior could be a surprising and unwanted off-distribution generalization. Mesa-Optimization: There have been some concerns that the underlying mechanism of in-context learning might be mesa-optimization [14] , a hypothesized situation where models develop an internal optimization algorithm. Our work suggests that the primary mechanism of in-context learning, at least in small models, is induction heads. We did not observe any evidence of mesa-optimizers. Linking Learning Dynamics, Scaling Laws, and Mechanistic Interpretability The in-context-learning phase change may be a useful \\"Rosetta stone\\" linking mechanistic interpretability, learning dynamics [23] , and statistical physics-like empirical properties of neural networks (e.g. scaling laws or phase changes). If one wants to investigate the intersections of these lines of work, the phase change seems like an ideal starting point: a concrete example where these lines of inquiry are intertwined, which can be explored in small models, bounded in a small sliver of the training process, and is linked to a capability (in-context learning) the community is excited about. --- Related Work The general approach of this paper to reverse engineering transformers is based heavily on our previous paper, A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits. There is much to be said about how that framework relates to other work in interpretability. Rather than repeating it, we refer readers to Related Workin our previous paper, especially discussion of the relationship to circuits [6] , to analysis of attention heads(e.g. [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] ), and to related mathematical analysis(e.g. [29] ). Building on that perspective, we here focus on how aspects of this paper raise new connections to the machine learning literature, separate from the connections raised simply by the underlying framework. IN-CONTEXT LEARNING Emergent in-context learning was compellingly demonstrated in GPT-3 [1] . A number of papers have studied how to effectively leverage in-context learning, especially with \\"prompt engineering\\" [11, 12] . But of particular importance to us, several papers have tried to study how and when in-context learning occurs (e.g. [13, 30, 31, 32] ). Some of the findings of these papers are consistent with the induction head hypothesis, or support our methodology: - Kaplan et al. [13] is the origin of our approach for using loss at different token indices as a formalism for studying in-context learning. - O’Connor & Andreas [30] find that preserving word order in contexts is important, as the induction head hypothesis would suggest. However, there are also places where experiments in these papers seem in tension with the induction head hypothesis: - O’Connor & Andreas [30] have some experiments suggesting that removing all words except nouns can improve loss. This seems inconsistent with the induction head hypothesis. However, they only find this for experiments where they retrain the model on modified data. This seems both less directly related to our work (because we aim to study models trained on natural data) and subtle to interpret (because retraining models introduces the possibility of run-to-run loss variation, and the measured loss differences are small). The experiments where they don't retrain models on modified data seem consistent with the induction head hypothesis. - Xie et al. [31] finds that LSTMs outperform Transformers when fit to synthetic data generated by a Hidden Markov Model (HHM) designed to isolate a particular theoretical model of in-context learning. We generally expect Transformers to outperform LSTMs at in-context learning on natural text (as seen in Kaplan et al. [13] ), with induction heads as a major explanation. But in the case of the Xie et al. experiments (which don’t use natural text), we suspect that the structure of the synthetic data doesn't benefit from Transformers, and that LSTMs are perhaps better at simulating HMMs. Note that we are using a broader conception of “in-context learning”, rather than something as specific as “few-shot learning”. This is in contrast with Brown et al. [1] , which describes that a language model “develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task,” with examples of tasks such as few-digit addition and typo correction. In our conception of “in-context learning”, we refer to all the ways that a model rapidly adapts to or recognizes what is going on in the context, even if “what is going on in the context” isn’t well-conceived-of as multiple “shots” of some other specific repeated task. SCALING LAWS Over the last few years, the observation that machine learning models change in smooth, predictable ways described by scaling laws [13] has emerged as a useful tool for modeling the properties of models before training them. The relationship between scaling laws and mechanistic interpretability might be seen as analogous to the relationship between thermodynamics and the physics of individual particles. For both thermodynamics and scaling laws, even though the underlying system is very complicated, we're able to find simple relationships between the variables – for thermodynamics: entropy, temperature, volume and pressure; for neural networks: loss, compute, parameters, and data. In contrast, mechanistic interpretability studies the individual circuits underlying our models, vaguely analogous to how one might carefully study individual particles in physics. In physics, these two layers of abstraction were bridged by statistical physics. Can we bridge these two levels of abstraction in machine learning? The induction head phase change is the first time we're aware of a bridge. They give us a phenomenon at the level of macroscopic properties at loss which can be explained at the level of circuits and mechanistic interpretability. In fact, induction heads may be able to explain previous observed exceptions to scaling laws. In our work, 1-layer transformers seem very different from deeper transformers. This was previously observed by Kaplan et al. [13] who found that 1-layer transformers do not follow the same scaling laws as larger transformers. It seems quite plausible that the reason why the scaling laws are different for one-layer models is that they don't have induction heads. PHASE CHANGES & DISCONTINUOUS MODEL BEHAVIOR In the previous section, we discussed how scaling laws describe smooth predictable relationships between model loss and properties like scale. However, a more recent set of results have made the situation seem more subtle. While models’ losses often scale in predictable ways, there are cases where behavior is more complex: - Brown et al. [1] find that, while aggregate loss scales predictably with model size, models’ ability to perform specific tasks like arithmetic can change abruptly. - Power et al. [8] observe a phenomenon they call \\"grokking\\" where models discontinuously jump from random chance to perfect generalization as they train. - Double Descent [33] is a phenomenon where model performance first gets worse due to overfitting as one makes a model larger (the \\"classical” regime), but then gets better again past a certain point (the \\"modern\\" regime). Generalizations of double descent can occur with respect to parameter size, dataset size, or amount of training [34] . These phenomena are not discontinuous in loss, but they are surprising trend reversals, and perhaps discontinuous in derivatives. For more general discussion of these phase change phenomena, see a recent blog postby Steinhardt [35] . The discontinuous phase change behavior we observe with induction heads is most analogous to Power et al. [8] 's \\"grokking\\", in that it occurs over the course of training. We think our main contribution to this literature is linking the changes we observe to the formation of induction heads and a parameter-level understanding of the circuits involved. As far as we know, induction heads are the first case where a mechanistic account has been provided for a phase change in machine learning. LEARNING DYNAMICS If neural networks can genuinely be understood mechanistically, in terms of circuits, it seems like there almost has to be some way to understand the learning process in terms of the dynamics of circuits changing. Induction heads offer an interesting preliminary bridge between these topics, and are a source of optimism for such a connection. This section will briefly review some strands of work on the learning dynamics side, which seem particularly promising to think about if one wanted to pursue such a connection further. One remarkable result in learning dynamics, by Saxe et al [23] , has been the discovery of closed form solutions to learning dynamics for linear neural networks without activation functions. The exciting thing about this work is that it actually provides a simple way to conceptually think about neural network learning in a simplified case. (In follow up work, Saxe et al also explore connections between this framework and models learning to represent semantic information [36] .) We're unable to provide a detailed review of this work here, but we note that Saxe et al's framework could naturally suggest a circuit lens for thinking about learning dynamics. Very roughly, they find that linear neural networks can be understood in terms of the evolution of independent paths through the network, with each path corresponding to a principal component of the data. These paths might be thought of as circuits. Another interesting line of work has been the study of the geometry of neural network loss surfaces (e.g. [37, 38, 39, 40] ). Here, our thoughts on the connection are more superficial, but it seems like there must be some way in which aspects of the loss surface connect to the formation of circuits. Very concretely, it seems like the phase change we've described in this paper must correspond to some very large feature in the loss landscape of transformers. UNIVERSALITY In the context of interpretability and circuits, \\"universality\\" [41] or \\"convergent learning\\" [42] is when multiple models develop the same features and circuits. Universality might seem like an intellectual curiosity, but the circuits thread argues that universality plays a critical role in what kind of interpretability makes sense: [I]magine the study of anatomy in a world where every species of animal had a completely unrelated anatomy: would we seriously study anything other than humans and a couple domestic animals? In the same way, the universality hypothesis determines what form of circuits research makes sense. If it was true in the strongest sense, one could imagine a kind of “periodic table of visual features” which we observe and catalogue across models. On the other hand, if it was mostly false, we would need to focus on a handful of models of particular societal importance and hope they stop changing every year. [41] Research on universality began with Li et al. [42] who showed that many neurons are highly correlated with neurons in retrained versions of the same model. More recently, a number of papers have shown that in aggregate, neural networks develop representations with a lot of shared information (e.g. [43, 44] ). The Circuits thread tried to extend this notion of universality from features to circuits, finding that not only do at least some families of well-characterized neurons reoccur across multiple networks of different architectures and that the same circuits [41] , but the same circuits appear to implement them [45] . Certain kinds of universality are often implicitly assumed in the language model attention head interpretability literature. For example, it seems widely accepted that \\"previous token\\" attention heads form across many transformer language models (e.g. [26, 27] ). The implicit hypothesis of universal attention heads – that is, attention heads with the same attention patterns in different models – isn't exactly the same thing as the kind of feature universality studied in the vision context, but is kind of analogous. Our work in this paper has analogies to many of these strands of prior work. Like the previous attention head papers, we describe the induction head pattern as a universal attention pattern. However, our analysis of these heads’ OV and QK circuits extends this claim of universality to the circuit level, similar to the original Circuits thread. And a corollary of our analysis of the OV circuit is a claim about what feature the attention head computes (roughly: the token embedding of the token following a previous copy of the present token) which is more similar to the traditional work on universality. Separate from all of this, it's worth mentioning that increasingly there's evidence for a particularly extreme kind of universality at the intersection of neuroscience and deep learning. Increasingly, research suggests that biological and artificial neural networks learn similar representations (e.g. [46, 47, 48] ). In fact, Goh et al. [49] find that multimodal \\"concept\\" neurons found in humans (such as the famous \\"Jennifer Anniston neuron\\") occur in neural networks. ATTENTION PATTERNS IN TRANSLATION-LIKE TASKS In Argument 4, we saw an induction head that helps implement translation. Although we're not aware of anything quite so general in the prior literature, there are reports of attention patterns which, in retrospect, seem somewhat similar. Often, in translation-like tasks, we see attention attend to the token which is about to be translated. We see this in literal translation (e.g. [50] ) and also in voice recognition (e.g. [51] where the model attends to the portion of the audio about to be transcribed). Visualizations of this in the encoder-decoder context often slightly obscure the induction-like nature of the attention patterns, because the decoder is visualized in terms of the output tokens predicted per time step rather than its input tokens. --- Comments & Replications Inspired by the original Circuits Threadand Distill's Discussion Article experiment, the authors invited several external researchers who were also investigating induction heads to comment on this work. Their comments are included below. REPLICATION Adam Scherlisis a researcher at Redwood Research. Redwood Research has been working on language model interpretability, inspired in part by Anthropic’s work. We’ve found induction heads reliably appearing in two-layer attention-only transformers. Their structure roughly matches the description in “Analyzing a Two-Layer Model”from Anthropic’s previous paper, with previous-token heads in layer 0 and induction heads in layer 1 (often one of each). These each have the expected attention behaviors. We tested this by replacing attention-score matrices with idealized versions and comparing the change in loss to the change from ablating that head. Replacing the previous-token head’s scores with exact previous-token attention recovered 99% of the loss difference. Replacing the induction head’s scores with a simple approximation (attending to the first token and to exact [A][B]...[A]matches) recovered about 65% of the loss difference. Our induction heads also match patterns of the form [A][B][C]...[A][B]→[C]; including this in the substituted attention scores recovered an additional 10% of loss difference. The induction head’s OV circuit copies tokens, including some fuzzy matching of semantically similar tokens. Its QK circuit is dominated by K-composition with the previous-token head; the previous-token head’s OV matrix copies information to a new subspace and the induction head’s QK matrix copies it back to the usual token embedding. We’ve also cataloged a few other kinds of attention heads, including skip-trigram heads. REPLICATION Tom Lieberumis a master's student at the University of Amsterdam. I used the empirical criterion for induction heads presentedin this paper to look for induction heads in publicly available models. To reiterate: on a sequence of tokens [A][B] .... [A] → [B], a head is called an induction head if it attends to the previous [B]when reading the last [A], and if the previous [B]increased the logit of the last [B]. Under this definition, I found potential induction heads in GPT2 and GPT-Neo mostly starting in the mid-depth region. I made an interactive version to explore attention and logit attribution across all layers and heads on the long Harry Potter prompt with the repetition of the first paragraph. It can be accessed here. For example, for GPT2-XL, head 20 in layer 21 seems to be an induction head, as well as head 0 in layer 12 of GPT-Neo-2.7B. For these heads we can see that virtually every token in the repetition of the first paragraph attends to its following token in the original paragraph. Thanks to EleutherAIfor providing the compute resources for this project. At one point the paper speculates on the minimal context length necessary to form induction heads. On a synthetic dataset, I have already found induction to be easily learned with a context length of 4. However, I believe that this is, in general, a property of the dataset/data distribution rather than the model itself, i.e. \\"how useful is induction for this task, on this dataset?\\". While it is intriguing to think about the statistics of language in this way, I am not sure how useful this line of research would be to the overall project of interpretability. Change Log The following changes have been made after publication: - 2022-09-20: Corrects the definition of Prefix matching in two places, which incorrectly stated “tokens that were preceded by the current token” instead of “preceded” or “were followed by”. Adds detail to the definition of the copying head evaluatorto explain that the effect on “raising the logits” is calculated using a ReLU. - 2023-03-06: Miscellaneous typo fixes without any change to substantive content.

Author contributions Research: The bulk of this line of work, including many iterations of experiments that didn’t make it into the final paper, was conducted by Catherine Olsson with mentorship from Chris Olah. Chris first discovered the “induction bump” in a 2-layer model. He had the idea of investigating what aspects of the per-token loss changed most over the bump, and made the connection to in-context learning. Catherine led data collection and analysis throughout the project. Data collection made extensive use of Garcon infrastructure by Nelson Elhage. Nelson collected data and ran analyses for the smeared key models. Chris Olah, Neel Nanda, and Catherine Olsson wrote the head activation evaluators. Research ideas were significantly influenced and improved by others at Anthropic. Writing: This article was drafted by Catherine Olsson, Chris Olah, and Nelson Elhage, with contributions and editing from Neel Nanda and Dario Amodei. Dario Amodei originally suggested the “arguments” structure. The specific arguments were iteratively refined in collaborative conversations between Dario Amodei, Chris Olah, Catherine Olsson, and Nelson Elhage. Nick Joseph contributed significant editing. Other members of Anthropic made miscellaneous contributions throughout the writing process. Figures and visualizations: Catherine Olsson generated the graphs in the model analysis table, and did preliminary design and styling. Chris Olah finalized the design and styling, and created “pull-out” versions for smaller figures earlier in the paper. Nelson Elhage contributed to the graphs of per-token losses on Harry Potter. Chris discovered the heads showcased in Claim 2 and designed the “month-animal-color-fruit” task. Nelson set up the interactive visualizations, using existing visualization tools built by Chris, with contributions from Nelson and Catherine, using PySvelte (see github). Model training: Nelson Elhage created the attention-only models and the smeared-key models. Dario Amodei collected data for models trained on the alternate books-only dataset. All our interpretability research is enabled by having access to models to study, including large models. Led by Tom Brown, Sam McCandlish, and Jared Kaplan, the majority of Anthropic's technical staff contributed to the development of our efficient distributed training infrastructure and the underlying machine learning. Core contributors include Nicholas Joseph, Tom Henighan, and Ben Mann. Nelson Elhage, Kamal Ndousse, Andy Jones, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, and Danny Hernandez also contributed to this infrastructure. Cluster: Tom Henighan and Nova DasSarma, advised by Tom Brown and Sam McCandlish with contributions from many others at Anthropic, managed the research cluster our research depended on and maintained its stability. Nova provided important support when interpretability required unorthodox jobs to run on our cluster.

Do they generally form in the second layer, or the last layer, or somewhere else? Small attention-only models In our attention-only models, induction heads form in the last layer. (In these plots, each point represents a head, colored by layer and arranged along the x-axis by depth in the model. The height of the point is the prefix matching scoreof that head.) Small models with MLPs: In small models with MLPs, by the 5L and 6L size, the induction heads form more in the second-to-last layer. Full-scale models: In the models in our full-scale sweep, induction heads form earlier. In fact, in 24L and 40L models the majority of induction heads form before the halfway point in model depth. Note that in these plots, only a randomized sample of 100 heads (with selection biased towards those scoring highly on prefix matching) are shown as opaque dots; most of the datapoints are left translucent for ease of reading. Distribution of scores What is the distribution of heads’ scores on our head activation evaluators? The distribution is sharper in our small models than our full-size models. In both cases, heads with a positive prefix matching score are more likely to have a positive copying score, and this correlation is even stronger for the highest prefix matching scores. (For models with more than 100 heads, a subset of heads is plotted, as seen in the opaque versus translucent datapoints immediately above.) Validating head activation evaluators We show here that our head activation evaluators(that we use to measure the properties in our definition of induction heads) correlate well with mathematically-based measures in small attention-only models. Copying Our copying evaluator correlates well with the OV matrix of each head. Specifically here we plot against the sum of the eigenvalues, divided by the absolute value of the eigenvalues, which is a measure of what fraction of the eigenvalues are positive vs. negative. Prefix matching Our prefix matching evaluator correlates well with the trace of QK eigenvaluesfor the previous-token QK-circuit term. Data Collection We measure several properties of the model’s overall behavior and of each constituent attention head. With the exception of the attention head ablations (which are the most computationally-intensive, and so were run only on the small models), we measure these properties on all snapshots of all models across training (that is, 200 snapshots each for the twelve small models, and 14 or 15 snapshots each for the six full-scale models). By measuring them on each snapshot, we can see how each property evolves over the course of training, rather than simply measuring the final model. The properties we collect data on are as follows: 1. Per-token losses with unaltered models 2. Per-token losses with ablations of individual attention heads 3. Empirical head measurements with head activation evaluators: using heuristics to score attention heads based on their observed activations, as another way of estimating “copying”, “prefix matching” and “previous token” attention. 4. Mathematical head measurements with the trace of QK eigenvalues for the previous-token QK-circuit term: measuring how much the WQWK weight matrix reads in a subspace affected by heads that attend to the previous token. (1) Per-token losses (unaltered models) The most straightforward property we measure is per-token losses from each model snapshot. We run the model snapshot on a set of 10,000 randomly-selected examples from the dataset, each of which is 512 tokens in length, and save individual token losses for every token. The set is held the same between all snapshots and between all models in all three families. When analyzing the per-token loss data, we summarize it in two different ways: - Random token per example.For each example, we extract the loss for just one random token out of the 512 tokens and discard the rest, giving a length-10,000 vector for each model snapshot. (The random index used for each example is consistent between each model.) - Context index average.We average the per-token losses by context index (i.e. by position), giving a length-512 vector for each model snapshot. The icontextth entry in the vector is an average over the 10,000 tokens drawn from position icontext in each example. (2) Per-token losses (attention head ablations) One way to study individual attention heads is to measure the difference between the complete model’s overall behavior and the overall behavior of a model that is exactly the same except for missing that head. We do this by successively ablating (i.e. zeroing-out) each attention head’s contribution to the residual stream. The approach of removing a head’s contribution can be thought of as loosely similar to a genetic “knockout” experiment in biology, where observing the effect of removing a specific gene can provide information about the gene’s function. We could do these ablations in two different ways: a “full” ablation, and a “pattern-preserving” ablation. (The model analysis tableshows only pattern-preserving ablations; we explain the other method for comparison) The full ablation would remove all of a head’s contributions to model behavior, whereas the pattern-preserving ablation removes the ablated head’s contribution to all later heads’ output vectors, but preserves the ablated head’s contribution to all later heads’ attention patterns. 29 Full ablation - Method: Run the model, replacing the ablated attention head’s result vector with a zero vector. - Outcome: All downstream computations are impacted (including all Q, K, and V calculations, and attention patterns). Pattern-preserving ablation (shown in Model Analysis Table) - Method: Step 1: Run the model for the first time, saving all attention patterns and discarding the output logits. - Step 2: Run model a second time. Replace the ablated attention head’s result vector with a zero vector, and force all attention patterns to be the version recorded in the first run. - Outcome: Only downstream V calculations are affected by the ablation, not Q and K calculations. The contribution a head makes to later layers’ attention patterns is preserved. 30 This is by far the most computationally-intensive measurement we perform, although fortunately it consists of many small single-GPU jobs and so we could often run it in “spare” capacity. As a quick note of comparison, our previous work in Transformer Circuitsalso contained ablation experiments. Although there are similarities (most notably the decision to freeze patterns), the specific ablations we describe here are individual attention head ablations where only one attention head is modified at a time, whereas the ablations described in our prior work are nth-order term ablations in which all attention heads are manipulated at once and the process is repeated iteratively n times. (3) Head activation evaluators We construct three heuristic measurements of attention heads, to score how strongly a head exhibits specific properties of interest. These are empirical measurements, based on observed activations on example data. We evaluate heads on the following properties: - Copying. Does the head’s direct effect on the residual stream increase the logits of the same token as the one being attended to? - Prefix matching. On repeated sequences of random tokens, does the head attend to earlier tokens that are followed by a token that matches the present token? - Previous token attention. Does the head attend to the token that immediately precedes the present token? (Note that “copying” is a property that depends on a head’s OV circuit, whereas “prefix matching” and “previous token attention” are properties that depend on a head’s QK circuit.) We are interested in these properties in particular — copying, prefix matching, and previous token attention — because they are relevant to induction heads’ function of predicting repeated sequences of random tokens. Specifically, (1) a head with both a “copying” OV circuit and a “prefix matching” QK circuit is thereby an induction head by our definition, because it attends to previous instances of the present token and increases the logit of the token that followed; and (2) a “previous token” head can be used as an algorithmic component of a future induction head in a later layer (as we explain in more detail in Argument 5). In more detail, each head evaluator is implemented as follows, and each score is averaged over 10 examples. - Copying: Generate a sequence of 25 random tokens, excluding the most common and the least common tokens. Compute this head’s contribution to the residual stream, then convert that using the unembeddings (i.e. along the “direct path”) to impacts on each logit. Logits are transformed by subtracting the mean of the logits and passing through a ReLU, allowing the evaluator to focus on where logits are raised. Compute the ratio of the amount it raises the logits of the token being attended to, to that of all tokens in this sample. This value ranges from 0 (only raises other tokens) to 0.5 (only raises the present token), so we scale it into the range of -1 to 1. - Prefix matching: Generate a sequence of 25 random tokens, excluding the most common and the least common tokens. Repeat this sequence 4 times and prepend a “start of sequence” token. 31Compute the attention pattern. The prefix matching score is the average of all attention pattern entries attending from a given token back to the tokens that preceded the same token in earlier repeats. - Previous token: Draw an example from the training distribution. Compute the attention pattern. The previous token score is the average of the entries of all the attention pattern entries attending from token i to token i-1. In the Appendix we validate the connectionbetween these empirical measurements and the mathematical properties of attention head weight matrices explored in Transformer Circuits, and show a joint distribution of scoresfor copying and prefix matching, for heads in the small and large models. (4) Trace of QK eigenvalues (for previous-token QK-circuit term) In addition to the heuristic measurements described above, we construct another measure of prefix matching that draws on concepts from A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits. In short, we measure how overall large and positive the eigenvalues are of the �Wmatrix found in the term of the QK circuit that corresponds specifically to “pure K-composition” with heads that attend to the previous token. Positive eigenvalues of �Windicate “same-matching”: preferring that this component of the query and key vectors be the same. A “same-matching” �Wmatrix associated with a “previous token” term in the QK circuit is a simple way to implement basic prefix matching behavior. We unpack here more about what this measure is and how it is computed. The “QK circuit” is a term we coined in our previous workto refer specifically to the entire transformation ���ℎC QK h which is applied to the one-hot token vectors �tto compute the attention pattern �ℎA h for a specific head: �ℎ A h = softmax∗(��⋅���ℎ�)= softmax ∗ (t T ⋅C QK h t). The full computation of ���ℎC QK h for a given head can be decomposed into many terms, each corresponding to one of the many paths through the model that needs to be computed in order to map tokens to their attention scores for that head. The section Path Expansion of Attention Scores QK Circuitin our earlier work shows all the terms of a full expansion for a two-layer model; models with more layers have QK circuits with even more terms. For this measure, we narrow the scope of our calculation to the simplest possible term of the QK circuit that could contribute to the “prefix-matching” behavior of an induction head: namely, only pure K-compositionterms (in which the query-side term is just the direct path from the embeddings), and furthermore only the subset of those that correspond specifically to K-composing with an earlier head that consistently attends to the immediately previous token. In order to compute this measure for a given head, we do the following: 1. For all attention heads in earlier layers, measure how “previous-token-like” the head is, as the average of the attention pattern along the previous-token off-diagonal, over an example text. 2. Compute the �Wmatrix found in each individual ��⊗�ℎ�⊗������ℎ���ℎ���Id⊗A h k ⊗W E T W QK h W OV h k W E term, for each head in earlier layers. 3. Create a combined �Wmatrix by weighting the matrices in step 2 by the measurement in step 1 of how “previous-token-like” each previous head is. 4. Measure the trace (i.e. the sum of the eigenvalues) of this combined weighted �Wmatrix. Because this measure relies on K-composition with heads in previous layers, it is only defined for models more than one layer deep, and only for attention heads in the second layer and beyond. We show in the Appendixthat this measure correlates well with our heuristic prefix matching evaluatoron our small models. Analyses Per-token losses The second through fourth rows of the Model Analysis Tableshow results derived from the per-token lossesfrom the small models and full-scale models. We show the following “views” on the per-token loss data: - Loss curve: The random-token-per-example loss data — a matrix of size (N model snapshots x 10,000 examples) for N = 200 snapshots per small model and N = 15 snapshots per full-scale model — is averaged over the example dimension, giving an average loss per model snapshot. - 2D in-context learning plot: The context-index-averageloss data — a matrix of size (N model snapshots x 512 token index positions) — is visualized directly as a 2D plot. This shows model performance on tokens earlier versus later in the context, as well as across training time. We borrow this technique for highlighting “in-context learning” from Kaplan et al. [13] . A horizontal slice of this plot represents a loss curve as a function of training step, for one particular token index rather than averaged over all tokens; a vertical slice represents a particular snapshot’s prediction ability as a function of token index. - 2D loss derivative plot: We also plot the partial derivative of the context-index-average loss data with respect to log(context index). This captures the amount that token loss is reduced by seeing ϵ% more context. - In-context learning score: We compute what we call the “in-context learning score” as the average loss of the 500th token minus the average loss of the 50th token (for a length-512 context)± over training. This functions as a summary of the 2D in-context learning plot, capturing in a single summary statistic the trajectory over training time of the model’s ability to make better predictions later in the context than earlier. Additionally in a separate row at the top, we show PCA results from the per-token results. These are displayed separately because, unlike all the other graphs, the x-axis is not elapsed training tokens. - PCA: A plot of each model's trajectory in function space over training time, using PCA. The random-token-per-example loss data for all snapshots and all models of each type is concatenated into a large matrix, of shape (N*M model snapshots x 10,000 examples), where N = 200 snapshots per model and M = 12 models for small models, and N = 15 snapshots per model and M = 6 models for full-scale models. This combined matrix is projected down to the first two principal components. Each model is then plotted separately, tracing out a trajectory in function space over the course of its training Attention head measurements The next two rows of Figure 1 show results derived from the attention head measurements: one row shows the score of the “prefix matching” head activation evaluator over training time, and the following row shows the prefix-matching QK-circuit eigenvalue trace over training time. For the small models, all attention heads are shown. For the full-scale models, a subset of 100 heads is shown; see the Appendixfor an explanation of how the 100 heads were chosen. Note that in the QK-circuit plot, the change in weight decay at approximately 5 billion tokens (described in Model Details) can be seen particularly prominently as a bend or hiccup in the plotted trajectories, but occurs after the phase change and is an unrelated phenomenon. Ablation attribution to phase change For the small models only, the final two rows of Figure 1 show results derived from the per-token loss data from the attention head ablation experiments. We show only the pattern-preserving ablationresults here; full ablation results can be found in the appendix. Note also that ablation experiments were not conducted for the full-scale models. The first “view” on the ablation data is the attribution to the “before-and-after” vector, which relates the result of each head ablation to the change in model behavior over the course of the phase change, and which we explain here. First: For a given model, a length-10,000 vector is computed by taking the delta of the random-token-per-example loss data for the “phase change end” snapshot, minus the “phase change start” snapshot. This represents how the model’s behavior changed over the course of the phase change. This vector is normalized to a unit vector; we call this the before-and-after vector. It can be thought of as the “direction in token-loss space” that is affected by the phase change. Second: Note that ablating a given head also induces a change in the behavior of a model snapshot, and thus a corresponding length-10,000 vector change to the random-token-per-example loss data (calculated by subtracting the un-ablated snapshot’s per-token loss vector from the ablated snapshot’s per-token loss vector). We are interested in the similarity between these two changes, which we compute as the dot product between the model’s before-and-after vector and the ablation change vector for this head and this snapshot. For induction heads, this dot product is negative, indicating that removing induction heads is like undoing the changes to model behavior that happened during the phase change. The second “view” on the ablation data is the attribution to the in-context learning score. We operationalize the model’s in-context learning abilities as how much better the model is at predicting the 500th token than the 50th token: this difference measured as Loss(ntrain, icontext= 500) - Loss(ntrain, icontext= 50) is the in-context learning score. Footnotes 1. Note that mechanistic interpretability is a subset of the broader field of interpretability, which encompasses many different methods for explaining the outputs of a neural network. Mechanistic interpretability is distinguished by a specific focus on trying to systematically characterize the internal circuitry of a neural net.[↩] 2. Note that induction heads don’t occur in 1 layer models, because they require a composition of attention heads in different layers.[↩] 3. Or sometimes metalearning, although this term implicitly makes the stronger claim that the model is learning how to do a new ability (as opposed to “locating” an ability, i.e. learning what it is supposed to do), an implication which is both controversial and not entirely precise in its meaning.[↩] 4. More specifically, induction heads seem to largely decouple Aand B. While some induction heads may specialize on certain kinds of As or Bs, this significant decoupling of Aand Bmeans that they don't have a fixed table of bigram statistics they can update on, but rather can abstract to new patterns.[↩] 5. In practice, induction heads don't exhibit these properties perfectly, and our measurements give us a continuum, but there is a clear subset of heads which exhibit these properties with much greater than random chance.[↩] 6. By defining induction heads in terms of their behavior on repeated copies of random sequences, we can be confident that it's actually relying on induction rather than, say, a simple copying head that heuristically attends to previous tokens which could plausibly slot in well after the next token, even if that hasn’t occurred yet in the current context.[↩] 7. The simplest induction heads match just one preceding token. But we also often observe induction heads that perform a fuzzy match over several preceding tokens.[↩] 8. In mathematics, one sometimes thinks of a function as an infinite dimensional vector of the values it would give for different inputs. For neural networks, this can be a nice way to abstract away the fact that functionally identical models can have very different parameter vectors. Of course, we can't directly represent these infinite dimensional vectors, but we can approximate them by sampling.[↩] 9. Although see later discussionfor a way in which a constant 0.4 nats can be viewed as a “larger” improvement for a more-powerful model, because attaining the same magnitude of improvement starting from a better baseline is more challenging.[↩] 10. As we'll see, many other curious phenomenaoccur during the phase change as well.[↩] 11. That said, it’s also the case that aside from the experiments varying the dataset, all these models were trained on the same tokens in the same order[↩] 12. Of course, this passage is merely a single piece of anecdata, shown here to provide a qualitative intuition rather than meant as systematic evidence. For a more comprehensive analysis of the observed behavioral change before and after the phase change, consult the “ablation to before-and-after vector” analyses in the Model Analysis Table[↩] 13. Some bits of information are harder to learn than others. For example, near the start of training, the model can achieve a significant decrease in loss with simple approaches such as memorizing bigram statistics. But later in training all the low-hanging fruit has been plucked, and the model must learn more sophisticated algorithms such as induction heads, which is likely harder to learn yet results in fewer bits of information. In today’s state of the art models, such as GPT-3, we observe complex capabilities such as addition, and we can imagine future models approaching near-perfect loss might need human-level understanding of language and beyond to get those last few fractions of a bit. [16] So the relative loss between token 50 and token 500 likely represents harder and harder bits over the course of training.[↩] 14. It is still a mystery why these forces of increased capacity for in-context learning and increasing difficulty of marginal bits would so exactly balance, and this seems a promising avenue of future research. Perhaps there is not, in fact, much overlap in the information that could be gained from both in-context learning and other approaches, so these bits do not get harder with time. We'll revisit this in the Discussion.[↩] 15. Why do induction heads require composition? In an induction head, where the head attends must be a function of the token before the token it attends to. But an individual attention head computes attention scores only from the source and destination token. Without using information written by a second earlier attention head, the score from the attended token can’t be a function of the token that precedes it.[↩] 16. The key vector for the first token is unchanged.[↩] 17. In fact, ablating most other attention heads appears to increase in-context learning. At first, that seems kind of crazy: how could damaging the model make it better at in-context learning? It appears that some tokens can be predicted with both \\"normal prediction\\" and in-context learning. If ablating a head makes the model bad at \\"normal prediction\\", in-context learning can predict more tokens that otherwise wouldn't be predicted, and in-context learning score as we've defined it increases.[↩] 18. Note that the cost of a full set of ablations scales superlinearly with model size at �(�1.33)O(N 1.33 ), since there are �(�0.33)O(N 0.33 )heads and each ablation is �(�)O(N)where �Nis the number of parameters. The base cost of an ablation is also non-trivial, since we're evaluating each ablation on 10,000 examples, for each training checkpoint.[↩] 19. In attention-only models, the logits can be expressed (up to a rescaling due to LayerNorm) as a sum of terms from each attention head, along with a \\"direct path term\\" to the the token embedding (see our previous paper). The direct path term is solely a function of the present token, so it can't contribute to in-context learning. That means that all in-context learning must ultimately originate with attention heads, and since the relationship is almost linear, ablations (with frozen attention patterns) are a principled way to measure their contribution.[↩] 20. Why is ablating attention heads harder to reason about if they can interact with MLP layers? At a high-level, the issue is that in-context learning is a complicated function of which heads are ablated, rather than a sum of their contributions. But it may be helpful to consider specific examples. One possibility is that ablating a head might shift the statistics of an MLP layer and \\"break\\" neurons by shifting their effective bias, without actually having a meaningful role. Another possibility is that an important MLP layer mechanism relies on two attention heads, but can function reasonably well with one if the other is albated. [↩] 21. We compute this by taking the value vector produced at each position, weighting it by the attention matrix, and multiplying it by ��W O and the unembedding, and selecting the logit value for the corresponding token. Note that we first normalise the vector of logits to have zero mean, as adding a constant to every argument in a softmax has no effect.[↩] 22. For example, a special case of translating from English to another language is translating English to itself, which is precisely the same as literal copying.[↩] 23. The only other potential contender for driving in-context learning in two-layer attention only models would be basic copying heads. However, basic copying heads also exist in one-layer models, which don't have the greatly increased in-context learning we see in two-layer models. Further, induction heads just seem conceptually more powerful.[↩] 24. Note that the attended token is only ignored when calculating the attention pattern through the QK-circuit. It is extremely important for calculating the head’s output through the OV-circuit! As observed in our previous work, the parts of the head that calculate the attention pattern, and the output if attended to, are separable and are often useful to consider independently.[↩] 25. Instead, they use a slightly unusual positional mechanism similar to Press et al. [17] [↩] 26. Note that this is different to the small models, which have 200200snapshots saved at linear intervals. As the full-scale models have only 1414or 1515snapshots, this makes it harder to judge the shape of the curves as confidently as for small models.[↩] 27. Around token 100, there's a regime where small models reduce their loss very slightly more per token than large models. We interpret this as the small models picking up low-hanging fruit that the large models already got in the very early context.[↩] 28. In fact, small models gain slightly more in the mid-context, catching up a tiny bit with large models, but it's a small effect.[↩] 29. The fact that this is possible at all is a surprising application of the insight in our previous work that the calculation of each attention head’s attention pattern and output vector is separable, that is, implemented by different circuits consisting of different sets of parameters which may be run and studied in isolation[↩] 30. As an interesting aside, we note that with the attention pattern frozen the action of each head is purely linear, which means that in an attention-only model, a pattern-preserving ablation is equivalent to subtracting all terms containing the ablated head from the output logits. See our previous workfor further exploration of the implications of this. This does not hold in more complex models, due to the non-linearity introduced by MLPs[↩] 31. It would’ve been better if we had used a start of sequence token for the copying head evaluator as well, but we omitted it by mistake. Without the “start of sequence” token, some heads that were doing prefix matching on real data would get anomalously low scores on our test sequences[↩] References 1.

This capability allows for the model to adapt to different tasks such as translation and question-answering without re-training, merely by adjusting its prompt. The research by Olsson et al. at Anthropic focuses on mechanistic interpretability for Transformer language models, aiming to understand the internal structures that cause models like GPT-3 to produce the outputs they do. Their work revolves around a phenomenon called \\"induction heads,\\" which they argue are a primary source of in-context learning in large Transformer models. Induction heads are circuits within the neural network that elicit behavior consistent with inductive reasoning. They complete patterns by looking back over the sequence for previous instances of the current token (e.g., [A]) and predict the next token based on the last occurrence of such a pattern (e.g., [B]). This allows the model to infer that if A was previously followed by B, it is likely to be followed by B again. They implement this by copying sequences that have occurred before. Their hypothesis is that induction heads are responsible for the majority of in-context learning in such models, including behavior that goes beyond literal sequence copying. They analyze this by looking at a phase change that occurs early in the training phase, marked by a bump in the training loss. During this phase change, induction heads form, and in-context learning capability improves dramatically. The paper presents six arguments to support this hypothesis: 1. Macroscopic co-occurrence: Induction heads and in-context learning improve simultaneously during a phase change. 2. Macroscopic co-perturbation: Changes to the transformer architecture that affect the formation of induction heads also shift the improvement in in-context learning. 3. Direct ablation: Knocking out induction heads at test-time decreases in-context learning. 4. Examples of generality: Observation that induction heads do not only copy sequences but can also demonstrate more complex behavior such as translation. 5. Mechanistic plausibility: A mechanistic explanation of how induction heads work and contribute to in-context learning. 6. Continuity: Many behaviors related to both induction heads and in-context learning are continuous from small to large models, suggesting mechanisms are the same. Their findings can help address safety concerns associated with AI by providing a better understanding of neural network behavior and capabilities. Neural network capabilities such as in-context learning and induction heads could lead to unanticipated behavior, and understanding these could be crucial for anticipating potential safety problems."},{"prompt":"Give a summary in max 100 words of the same text","completion":"Olsson et al. from Anthropic have presented research suggesting that induction heads—circuits within Transformer language models—are key to in-context learning, where models predict sequences better with more context.

Which measure is discussed in the text?","completion":"In-context learning capability in transformers and large language models can be measured using various metrics that assess how well a model can utilize the context to generate accurate predictions for subsequent tokens. Some of these measures include evaluating task-specific performance, such as translations, summarizations, or question-answering ability based on the given context. The text specifically discusses the \\"In-context learning score\\" as a measure. This score is defined as the difference between the loss (measured in nats or bits) of a token appearing later in the context (e.g., the 500th token) minus the average loss of a token earlier in the context (e.g., the 50th token), averaged over dataset examples. By comparing these losses, the measure captures the model's ability to leverage the additional context to make more accurate predictions, which serves as a proxy for the model's in-context learning ability. This metric provides a general sense of how well the model predicts tokens later in the context compared to earlier ones, which is indicative of its capacity to draw upon information gained throughout the context sequence. It is a broad metric that can encompass various aspects of in-context learning without being tied to a specific task."},{"prompt":"Does there exist comparable universality in Transformers and human brains","completion":"The text touches upon a fascinating area of research exploring the parallels between artificial neural networks and biological neural systems. While the concept of \\"universality\\" in AI literature typically refers to the idea that different neural networks may independently develop similar circuits or features, there is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that artificial neural networks, including Transformers, can exhibit representational similarities to the human brain. Several studies have shown that both artificial and biological neural networks learn similar representations when performing specific tasks, such as visual object recognition or language processing. For example, neural activity patterns in the human brain have been found to have parallels with the activation patterns in layers of convolutional neural networks trained on image recognition tasks. In the domain of language, researchers are investigating whether similar comparisons hold. The text mentions that certain features or \\"concept\\" neurons, such as those for specific entities or ideas, identified in humans have also been observed in neural networks. These findings suggest a form of universality where both human brains and AI models develop analogous strategies for information processing. However, it is crucial to recognize that while there can be similarities, there are also significant differences between artificial neural networks and the human brain in terms of structure, function, and learning mechanisms. Universal patterns in AI models do not imply that they operate in the same way as the brain, but rather that they may converge on similar solutions to computational problems. In the context of Transformers, while specific neural circuitry such as induction heads may not have a direct biological counterpart, the overall concept of learning from context and using patterns to infer meaning is certainly comparable to certain cognitive processes in humans."},{"prompt":"What is said about the \\"Jennifer Aniston\\" neuron and does it relate to universality?","completion":"The \\"Jennifer Aniston neuron\\" is referenced in the context of discussing the universality between artificial and biological neural systems.

The text draws an analogy between the existence of \\"concept\\" neurons in humans and similar phenomena observed in neural networks, where certain neurons in an artificial network respond strongly to specific inputs or concepts. This comparison is part of a broader exploration of the similarities between how artificial neural networks and human brains represent and process information. The mention of the \\"Jennifer Aniston neuron\\" relates to universality in the sense that both artificial models and the human brain may develop specialized, single-purpose components that handle certain tasks or recognize specific patterns. This idea strengthens the argument that there might be some overarching principles or \\"universal\\" representational strategies that are employed by both biological and artificial systems when it comes to processing complex data like language or images. Such findings show that despite the significant structural and operational differences between machine learning models and the human brain, there may be comparable patterns of activity when it comes to encoding and retrieving certain types of information.

Here’s how we might craft prompts and evaluate the responses: 1. **Prompt Generation:** - Create various prompts that relate to environmental sustainability, ensuring they cover different aspects of the concept, such as: - \\"What are some effective ways to reduce one’s carbon footprint?\\" - \\"Describe the impact of plastic pollution on marine life.\\" - \\"Explain how renewable energy contributes to environmental sustainability.\\" - \\"Discuss the importance of recycling in urban communities.\\" 2. **LLM Response Collection:** - Input these prompts into the LLM one by one and collect the responses. The responses should not only be relevant and informative but also reflect the multifaceted nature of the concept. 3. **Analysis of Consistency:** - Look for consistency across the LLM's responses to different prompts. Consistency would be indicated by the model systematically referencing key principles of sustainability, like waste reduction, pollution prevention, and conservation. 4. **Analysis of Relevance:** - Evaluate the relevance by checking if the responses stick to the topic of sustainability and provide accurate, contextually appropriate information without digressions or inaccuracies. 5. **Depth of Understanding:** - Determine the depth of the LLM’s understanding by its ability to go beyond generic responses. It should mention specific techniques, case studies, or statistics that reveal a more sophisticated grasp of the concept. 6. **Novelty and Generalization:** - Assess the model's capability to generate novel content, such as new suggestions for sustainability practices, or apply the concept to new contexts, indicating a strong internalization of the concept. 7. **Contrast with Control Prompts:** - Use control prompts unrelated to sustainability to ensure specificity. The model should not produce sustainability-related content when the concept is not contextually relevant. 8. **Fine-tuned Model Comparison:** - If available, compare responses with those from a model fine-tuned on an environmentally focused dataset. Greater alignment with the fine-tuned model can suggest a robust understanding of the concept. By applying this methodology, researchers can get a clearer picture of the LLM's grasp of environmental sustainability and other complex concepts learned during training."},{"prompt":"please sumurize this text: Toy Models of Superposition Background & Motivation Demonstrating Superposition Superposition as a Phase Change The Geometry of Superposition Learning Dynamics Relationship to Adversarial Examples Superposition in a Privileged Basis Computation in Superposition The Strategic Picture Discussion Related Work Comments & Replications AUTHORS Nelson Elhage∗, Tristan Hume∗, Catherine Olsson∗, Nicholas Schiefer∗, Tom Henighan, Shauna Kravec, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, Robert Lasenby, Dawn Drain, Carol Chen, Roger Grosse, Sam McCandlish, Jared Kaplan, Dario Amodei, Martin Wattenberg∗,Christopher Olah‡ AFFILIATIONS Anthropic, Harvard PUBLISHED Sept 14, 2022 * Core Research Contributor; ‡ Correspondence to <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>; Author contributions statement below. It would be very convenient if the individual neurons of artificial neural networks corresponded to cleanly interpretable features of the input. For example, in an “ideal” ImageNet classifier, each neuron would fire only in the presence of a specific visual feature, such as the color red, a left-facing curve, or a dog snout. Empirically, in models we have studied, some of the neurons do cleanly map to features. But it isn't always the case that features correspond so cleanly to neurons, especially in large language models where it actually seems rare for neurons to correspond to clean features. This brings up many questions. Why is it that neurons sometimes align with features and sometimes don't? Why do some models and tasks have many of these clean neurons, while they're vanishingly rare in others? In this paper, we use toy models — small ReLU networks trained on synthetic data with sparse input features — to investigate how and when models represent more features than they have dimensions. We call this phenomenon superposition [1, 2, 3] . When features are sparse, superposition allows compression beyond what a linear model would do, at the cost of \\"interference\\" that requires nonlinear filtering. Consider a toy model where we train an embedding of five features of varying importance 1 in two dimensions, add a ReLU afterwards for filtering, and vary the sparsity of the features. With dense features, the model learns to represent an orthogonal basis of the most important two features (similar to what Principal Component Analysis might give us), and the other three features are not represented. But if we make the features sparse, this changes: This figure and a few others can be reproduced using the toy model framework Colab notebook in our Github repo Not only can models store additional features in superposition by tolerating some interference, but we'll show that, at least in certain limited cases, models can perform computation while in superposition. (In particular, we'll show that models can put simple circuits computing the absolute value function in superposition.) This leads us to hypothesize that the neural networks we observe in practice are in some sense noisily simulating larger, highly sparse networks. In other words, it's possible that models we train can be thought of as doing “the same thing as” an imagined much-larger model, representing the exact same features but with no interference. Feature superposition isn't a novel idea. A number of previous interpretability papers have considered it [1, 2, 3, 4] , and it's very closely related to the long-studied topic of compressed sensing in mathematics [5] , as well as the ideas of distributed, dense, and population codes in neuroscience [6] and deep learning [7] . What, then, is the contribution of this paper? For interpretability researchers, our main contribution is providing a direct demonstration that superposition occurs in artificial neural networks given a relatively natural setup, suggesting this may also occur in practice. That is, we show a case where interpreting neural networks as having sparse structure in superposition isn't just a useful post-hoc interpretation, but actually the \\"ground truth\\" of a model. We offer a theory of when and why this occurs, revealing a phase diagram for superposition. This explains why neurons are sometimes \\"monosemantic\\" responding to a single feature, and sometimes \\"polysemantic\\" [8] responding to many unrelated features. We also discover that, at least in our toy model, superposition exhibits complex geometric structure. But our results may also be of broader interest. We find preliminary evidence that superposition may be linked to adversarial examples and grokking, and might also suggest a theory for the performance of mixture of experts models. More broadly, the toy model we investigate has unexpectedly rich structure, exhibiting phase changes, a geometric structure based on uniform polytopes, \\"energy level\\"-like jumps during training, and a phenomenon which is qualitatively similar to the fractional quantum Hall effect in physics, among other striking phenomena. We originally investigated the subject to gain understanding of cleanly-interpretable neurons in larger models, but we've found these toy models to be surprisingly interesting in their own right. KEY RESULTS FROM OUR TOY MODELS In our toy models, we are able to demonstrate that: Superposition is a real, observed phenomenon. Both monosemantic and polysemantic neurons can form. At least some kinds of computation can be performed in superposition. Whether features are stored in superposition is governed by a phase change. Superposition organizes features into geometric structures such as digons, triangles, pentagons, and tetrahedrons. Our toy models are simple ReLU networks, so it seems fair to say that neural networks exhibit these properties in at least some regimes, but it's very unclear what to generalize to real networks. Definitions and Motivation: Features, Directions, and Superposition In our work, we often think of neural networks as having features of the input represented as directions in activation space. This isn't a trivial claim. It isn't obvious what kind of structure we should expect neural network representations to have. When we say something like \\"word embeddings have a gender direction\\" or \\"vision models have curve detector neurons\\", one is implicitly making strong claims about the structure of network representations. Despite this, we believe this kind of \\"linear representation hypothesis\\" is supported both by significant empirical findings and theoretical arguments. One might think of this as two separate properties, which we'll explore in more detail shortly: Decomposability: Network representations can be described in terms of independently understandable features. Linearity: Features are represented by direction. If we hope to reverse engineer neural networks, we need a property like decomposability. Decomposability is what allows us to reason about the model without fitting the whole thing in our heads! But it's not enough for things to be decomposable: we need to be able to access the decomposition somehow. In order to do this, we need to identify the individual features within a representation. In a linear representation, this corresponds to determining which directions in activation space correspond to which independent features of the input. Sometimes, identifying feature directions is very easy because features seem to correspond to neurons. For example, many neurons in the early layers of InceptionV1 clearly correspond to features (e.g. curve detector neurons [9] ). Why is it that we sometimes get this extremely helpful property, but in other cases don't? We hypothesize that there are really two countervailing forces driving this: Privileged Basis: Only some representations have a privileged basis which encourages features to align with basis directions (i.e. to correspond to neurons). Superposition: Linear representations can represent more features than dimensions, using a strategy we call superposition. This can be seen as neural networks simulating larger networks. This pushes features away from corresponding to neurons. Superposition has been hypothesized in previous work [1, 2, 3, 4] , and in some cases, assuming something like superposition has been shown to help find interpretable structure [1, 2] . However, we're not aware of feature superposition having been unambiguously demonstrated to occur in neural networks before ( [10] demonstrates a closely related phenomenon of model superposition). The goal of this paper is to change that, demonstrating superposition and exploring how it interacts with privileged bases. If superposition occurs in networks, it deeply influences what approaches to interpretability research make sense, so unambiguous demonstration seems important. The goal of this section will be to motivate these ideas and unpack them in detail. It's worth noting that many of the ideas in this section have close connections to ideas in other lines of interpretability research (especially disentanglement), neuroscience (distributed representations, population codes, etc), compressed sensing, and many other lines of work. This section will focus on articulating our perspective on the problem. We'll discuss these other lines of work in detail in Related Work. Empirical Phenomena When we talk about \\"features\\" and how they're represented, this is ultimately theory building around several observed empirical phenomena. Before describing how we conceptualize those results, we'll simply describe some of the major results motivating our thinking: Word Embeddings - A famous result by Mikolov et al. [11] found that word embeddings appear to have directions which correspond to semantic properties, allowing for embedding arithmetic vectors such as V(\\"king\\") - V(\\"man\\") + V(\\"woman\\") = V(\\"queen\\") (but see [12] ). Latent Spaces - Similar \\"vector arithmetic\\" and interpretable direction results have also been found for generative adversarial networks (e.g. [13] ). Interpretable Neurons - There is a significant body of results finding neurons which appear to be interpretable (in RNNs [14, 15] ; in CNNs [16, 17] ; in GANs [18] ), activating in response to some understandable property. This work has faced some skepticism [19, 20] . In response, several papers have aimed to give extremely detailed accounts of a few specific neurons, in the hope of dispositively establishing examples of neurons which truly detect some understandable property (notably Cammarata et al. [9] , but also [21, 22] ). Universality - Many analogous neurons responding to the same properties can be found across networks [23, 3, 21] . Polysemantic Neurons - At the same time, there are also many neurons which appear to not respond to an interpretable property of the input, and in particular, many polysemantic neurons which appear to respond to unrelated mixtures of inputs [8] . As a result, we tend to think of neural network representations as being composed of features which are represented as directions. We'll unpack this idea in the following sections. What are Features? Our use of the term \\"feature\\" is motivated by the interpretable properties of the input we observe neurons (or word embedding directions) responding to. There's a rich variety of such observed properties! 2 We'd like to use the term \\"feature\\" to encompass all these properties. But even with that motivation, it turns out to be quite challenging to create a satisfactory definition of a feature. Rather than offer a single definition we're confident about, we consider three potential working definitions: Features as arbitrary functions. One approach would be to define features as any function of the input (as in [24] ). But this doesn't quite seem to fit our motivations. There's something special about these features that we're observing: they seem to in some sense be fundamental abstractions for reasoning about the data, with the same features forming reliably across models. Features also seem identifiable: cat and car are two features while cat+car and cat-car seem like mixtures of features rather than features in some important sense. Features as interpretable properties. All the features we described are strikingly understandable to humans. One could try to use this for a definition: features are the presence of human understandable \\"concepts\\" in the input. But it seems important to allow for features we might not understand. If AlphaFold discovers some important chemical structure for predicting protein folding, it very well might not be something we initially understand! Neurons in Sufficiently Large Models. A final approach is to define features as properties of the input which a sufficiently large neural network will reliably dedicate a neuron to representing. 3 For example, curve detectors appear to reliably occur across sufficiently sophisticated vision models, and so are a feature. For interpretable properties which we presently only observe in polysemantic neurons, the hope is that a sufficiently large model would dedicate a neuron to them. This definition is slightly circular, but avoids the issues with the earlier ones. We've written this paper with the final \\"neurons in sufficiently large models\\" definition in mind. But we aren't overly attached to it, and actually think it's probably important to not prematurely attach to a definition. 4 Features as Directions As we've mentioned in previous sections, we generally think of features as being represented by directions. For example, in word embeddings, \\"gender\\" and \\"royalty\\" appear to correspond to directions, allowing arithmetic like V(\\"king\\") - V(\\"man\\") + V(\\"woman\\") = V(\\"queen\\") [11] . Examples of interpretable neurons are also cases of features as directions, since the amount a neuron activates corresponds to a basis direction in the representation Let's call a neural network representation linear if features correspond to directions in activation space. In a linear representation, each feature � � f i ​ has a corresponding representation direction � � W i ​ . The presence of multiple features � 1 , � 2 … f 1 ​ ,f 2 ​ … activating with values � � 1 , � � 2 … x f 1 ​ ​ ,x f 2 ​ ​ … is represented by � � 1 � � 1 + � � 2 � � 2 . . . x f 1 ​ ​ W f 1 ​ ​ +x f 2 ​ ​ W f 2 ​ ​ .... To be clear, the features being represented are almost certainly nonlinear functions of the input. It's only the map from features to activation vectors which is linear. Note that whether something is a linear representation depends on what you consider to be the features. We don't think it's a coincidence that neural networks empirically seem to have linear representations. Neural networks are built from linear functions interspersed with non-linearities. In some sense, the linear functions are the vast majority of the computation (for example, as measured in FLOPs). Linear representations are the natural format for neural networks to represent information in! Concretely, there are three major benefits: Linear representations are the natural outputs of obvious algorithms a layer might implement. If one sets up a neuron to pattern match a particular weight template, it will fire more as a stimulus matches the template better and less as it matches it less well. Linear representations make features \\"linearly accessible.\\" A typical neural network layer is a linear function followed by a non-linearity. If a feature in the previous layer is represented linearly, a neuron in the next layer can \\"select it\\" and have it consistently excite or inhibit that neuron. If a feature were represented non-linearly, the model would not be able to do this in a single step. Statistical Efficiency. Representing features as different directions may allow non-local generalization in models with linear transformations (such as the weights of neural nets), increasing their statistical efficiency relative to models which can only locally generalize. This view is especially advocated in some of Bengio's writing (e.g. [7] ). A more accessible argument can be found in this blog post. It is possible to construct non-linear representations, and retrieve information from them, if you use multiple layers (although even these examples can be seen as linear representations with more exotic features). We provide an example in the appendix. However, our intuition is that non-linear representations are generally inefficient for neural networks. One might think that a linear representation can only store as many features as it has dimensions, but it turns out this isn't the case! We'll see that the phenomenon we call superposition will allow models to store more features – potentially many more features – in linear representations. For discussion on how this view of features squares with a conception of features as being multidimensional manifolds, see the appendix “What about Multidimensional Features?”. Privileged vs Non-privileged Bases Even if features are encoded as directions, a natural question to ask is which directions? In some cases, it seems useful to consider the basis directions, but in others it doesn't. Why is this? When researchers study word embeddings, it doesn't make sense to analyze basis directions. There would be no reason to expect a basis dimension to be different from any other possible direction. One way to see this is to imagine applying some random linear transformation � M to the word embedding, and apply � − 1 M −1 to the following weights. This would produce an identical model where the basis dimensions are totally different. This is what we mean by a non-privileged basis. Of course, it's possible to study activations without a privileged basis, you just need to identify interesting directions to study somehow, such as creating a gender direction in a word embedding by taking the difference vector between \\"man\\" and \\"woman\\". But many neural network layers are not like this. Often, something about the architecture makes the basis directions special, such as applying an activation function. This \\"breaks the symmetry\\", making those directions special, and potentially encouraging features to align with the basis dimensions. We call this a privileged basis, and call the basis directions \\"neurons.\\" Often, these neurons correspond to interpretable features. From this perspective, it only makes sense to ask if a neuron is interpretable when it is in a privileged basis. In fact, we typically reserve the word \\"neuron\\" for basis directions which are in a privileged basis. (See longer discussion here.) Note that having a privileged basis doesn't guarantee that features will be basis-aligned – we'll see that they often aren't! But it's a minimal condition for the question to even make sense. The Superposition Hypothesis Even when there is a privileged basis, it's often the case that neurons are \\"polysemantic\\", responding to several unrelated features. One explanation for this is the superposition hypothesis [2, 1, 3] . Roughly, the idea of superposition is that neural networks \\"want to represent more features than they have neurons\\", so they exploit a property of high-dimensional spaces to simulate a model with many more neurons. Several results from mathematics suggest that something like this might be plausible: Almost Orthogonal Vectors. Although it's only possible to have � n orthogonal vectors in an � n-dimensional space, it's possible to have exp ( � ) exp(n) many \\"almost orthogonal\\" ( < � <ϵ cosine similarity) vectors in high-dimensional spaces. See the Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma. Compressed sensing. In general, if one projects a vector into a lower-dimensional space, one can't reconstruct the original vector. However, this changes if one knows that the original vector is sparse. In this case, it is often possible to recover the original vector. Concretely, in the superposition hypothesis, features are represented as almost-orthogonal directions in the vector space of neuron outputs. Since the features are only almost-orthogonal, one feature activating looks like other features slightly activating. Tolerating this \\"noise\\" or \\"interference\\" comes at a cost. But for neural networks with highly sparse features, this cost may be outweighed by the benefit of being able to represent more features! (Crucially, sparsity greatly reduces the costs since sparse features are rarely active to interfere with each other, and non-linear activation functions create opportunities to filter out small amounts of noise.) One way to think of this is that a small neural network may be able to noisily \\"simulate\\" a sparse larger model: Although we've described superposition with respect to neurons, it can also occur in representations with an unprivileged basis, such as a word embedding. Superposition simply means that there are more features than dimensions. Summary: A Hierarchy of Feature Properties The ideas in this section might be thought of in terms of four progressively more strict properties that neural network representations might have. Decomposability: Neural network activations which are decomposable can be decomposed into features, the meaning of which is not dependent on the value of other features. (This property is ultimately the most important – see the role of decomposition in defeating the curse of dimensionality.) Linearity: Features correspond to directions. Each feature � � f i ​ has a corresponding representation direction � � W i ​ . The presence of multiple features � 1 , � 2 … f 1 ​ ,f 2 ​ … activating with values � � 1 , � � 2 … x f 1 ​ ​ ,x f 2 ​ ​ … is represented by � � 1 � � 1 + � � 2 � � 2 . . . x f 1 ​ ​ W f 1 ​ ​ +x f 2 ​ ​ W f 2 ​ ​ .... Superposition vs Non-Superposition: A linear representation exhibits superposition if � � � W T W is not invertible. If � � � W T W is invertible, it does not exhibit superposition. Basis-Aligned: A representation is basis aligned if all � � W i ​ are one-hot basis vectors. A representation is partially basis aligned if all � � W i ​ are sparse. This requires a privileged basis. The first two (decomposability and linearity) are properties we hypothesize to be widespread, while the latter (non-superposition and basis-aligned) are properties we believe only sometimes occur. Demonstrating Superposition If one takes the superposition hypothesis seriously, a natural first question is whether neural networks can actually noisily represent more features than they have neurons. If they can't, the superposition hypothesis may be comfortably dismissed. The intuition from linear models would be that this isn't possible: the best a linear model can do is to store the principal components. But we'll see that adding just a slight nonlinearity can make models behave in a radically different way! This will be our first demonstration of superposition. (It will also be an object lesson in the complexity of even very simple neural networks.) Experiment Setup Our goal is to explore whether a neural network can project a high dimensional vector � ∈ � � x∈R n into a lower dimensional vector ℎ ∈ � � h∈R m and then recover it. 5 THE FEATURE VECTOR ( � X) We begin by describing the high-dimensional vector � x: the activations of our idealized, disentangled larger model. We call each element � � x i ​ a \\"feature\\" because we're imagining features to be perfectly aligned with neurons in the hypothetical larger model. In a vision model, this might be a Gabor filter, a curve detector, or a floppy ear detector. In a language model, it might correspond to a token referring to a specific famous person, or a clause being a particular kind of description. Since we don't have any ground truth for features, we need to create synthetic data for � x which simulates any important properties we believe features have from the perspective of modeling them. We make three major assumptions: Feature Sparsity: In the natural world, many features seem to be sparse in the sense that they only rarely occur. For example, in vision, most positions in an image don't contain a horizontal edge, or a curve, or a dog head [3] . In language, most tokens don't refer to Martin Luther King or aren't part of a clause describing music [4] . This idea goes back to classical work on vision and the statistics of natural images (see e.g. Olshausen, 1997, the section \\"Why Sparseness?\\" [26] ). For this reason, we will choose a sparse distribution for our features. More Features Than Neurons: There are an enormous number of potentially useful features a model might represent. 6 This imbalance between features and neurons in real models seems like it must be a central tension in neural network representations. Features Vary in Importance: Not all features are equally useful to a given task. Some can reduce the loss more than others. For an ImageNet model, where classifying different species of dogs is a central task, a floppy ear detector might be one of the most important features it can have. In contrast, another feature might only very slightly improve performance. 7 Concretely, our synthetic data is defined as follows: The input vectors � x are synthetic data intended to simulate the properties we believe the true underlying features of our task have. We consider each dimension � � x i ​ to be a \\"feature\\". Each one has an associated sparsity � � S i ​ and importance � � I i ​ . We let � � = 0 x i ​ =0 with probability � � S i ​ , but is otherwise uniformly distributed between [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1]. 8 In practice, we focus on the case where all features have the same sparsity, � � = � S i ​ =S. THE MODEL ( � → � ′ X→X ′ ) We will actually consider two models, which we motivate below. The first \\"linear model\\" is a well understood baseline which does not exhibit superposition. The second \\"ReLU output model\\" is a very simple model which does exhibit superposition. The two models vary only in the final activation function. Linear Model ℎ = � � h = Wx � ′ = � � ℎ + � x ′ = W T h + b � ′ = � � � � + � x ′ = W T Wx + b ReLU Output Model ℎ = � � h = Wx � ′ = ReLU ( � � ℎ + � ) x ′ = ReLU(W T h+b) � ′ = ReLU ( � � � � + � ) x ′ = ReLU(W T Wx+b) Why these models? The superposition hypothesis suggests that each feature in the higher-dimensional model corresponds to a direction in the lower-dimensional space. This means we can represent the down projection as a linear map ℎ = � � h=Wx. Note that each column � � W i ​ corresponds to the direction in the lower-dimensional space that represents a feature � � x i ​ . To recover the original vector, we'll use the transpose of the same matrix � � W T . This has the advantage of avoiding any ambiguity regarding what direction in the lower-dimensional space really corresponds to a feature. It also seems relatively mathematically principled 9 , and empirically works. We also add a bias. One motivation for this is that it allows the model to set features it doesn't represent to their expected value. But we'll see later that the ability to set a negative bias is important for superposition for a second set of reasons – roughly, it allows models to discard small amounts of noise. The final step is whether to add an activation function. This turns out to be critical to whether superposition occurs. In a real neural network, when features are actually used by the model to do computation, there will be an activation function, so it seems principled to include one at the end. THE LOSS Our loss is weighted mean squared error weighted by the feature importances, � � I i ​ , described above: � = ∑ � ∑ � � � ( � � − � � ′ ) 2 L= x ∑ ​ i ∑ ​ I i ​ (x i ​ −x i ′ ​ ) 2 Basic Results Our first experiment will simply be to train a few ReLU output models with different sparsity levels and visualize the results. (We'll also train a linear model – if optimized well enough, the linear model solution does not depend on sparsity level.) The main question is how to visualize the results. The simplest way is to visualize � � � W T W (a features by features matrix) and � b (a feature length vector). Note that features are arranged from most important to least, so the results have a fairly nice structure. Here's an example of what this type of visualization might look like, for a small model model ( � = 2 0 ; � = 5 ; n=20; m=5;) which behaves in the \\"expected linear model-like\\" way, only representing as many features as it has dimensions: But the thing we really care about is this hypothesized phenomenon of superposition – does the model represent \\"extra features\\" by storing them non-orthogonally? Is there a way to get at it more explicitly? Well, one question is just how many features the model learns to represent. For any feature, whether or not it is represented is determined by ∣ ∣ � � ∣ ∣ ∣∣W i ​ ∣∣, the norm of its embedding vector. We'd also like to understand whether a given feature shares its dimension with other features. For this, we calculate ∑ � ≠ � ( � � ^ ⋅ � � ) 2 ∑ j≠i ​ ( W i ​ ^ ​ ⋅W j ​ ) 2 , projecting all other features onto the direction vector of � � W i ​ . It will be 0 0 if the feature is orthogonal to other features (dark blue below). On the other hand, values ≥ 1 ≥1 mean that there is some group of other features which can activate � � W i ​ as strongly as feature � i itself! We can visualize the model we looked at previously this way: Now that we have a way to visualize models, we can start to actually do experiments. We'll start by considering models with only a few features ( � = 2 0 ; � = 5 ; � � = 0 . 7 � n=20; m=5; I i ​ =0.7 i ). This will make it easy to visually see what happens. We consider a linear model, and several ReLU-output models trained on data with different feature sparsity levels: As our standard intuitions would expect, the linear model always learns the top- � m most important features, analogous to learning the top principal components. The ReLU output model behaves the same on dense features ( 1 − � = 1 . 0 1−S=1.0), but as sparsity increases, we see superposition emerge. The model represents more features by having them not be orthogonal to each other. It starts with less important features, and gradually affects the most important ones. Initially this involves arranging them in antipodal pairs, where one feature’s representation vector is exactly the negative of the other’s, but we observe it gradually transition to other geometric structures as it represents more features. We'll discuss feature geometry further in the later section, The Geometry of Superposition. The results are qualitatively similar for models with more features and hidden dimensions. For example, if we consider a model with � = 2 0 m=20 hidden dimensions and � = 8 0 n=80 features (with importance increased to � � = 0 . 9 � I i ​ =0.9 i to account for having more features), we observe essentially a rescaled version of the visualization above: Mathematical Understanding In the previous section, we observed a surprising empirical result: adding a ReLU to the output of our model allowed a radically different solution – superposition – which doesn't occur in linear models. The model where it occurs is still quite mathematically simple. Can we analytically understand why superposition is occurring? And for that matter, why does adding a single non-linearity make things so different from the linear model case? It turns out that we can get a fairly satisfying answer, revealing that our model is governed by balancing two competing forces – feature benefit and interference – which will be useful intuition going forwards. We'll also discover a connection to the famous Thomson Problem in chemistry. Let's start with the linear case. This is well understood by prior work! If one wants to understand why linear models don't exhibit superposition, the easy answer is to observe that linear models essentially perform PCA. But this isn't fully satisfying: if we set aside all our knowledge and intuition about linear functions for a moment, why exactly is it that superposition can't occur? A deeper understanding can come from the results of Saxe et al. [28] who study the learning dynamics of linear neural networks – that is, neural networks without activation functions. Such models are ultimately linear functions, but because they are the composition of multiple linear functions the dynamics are potentially quite complex. The punchline of their paper reveals that neural network weights can be thought of as optimizing a simple closed-form solution. We can tweak their problem to be a bit more similar to our linear case, 10 revealing the following equation: The Saxe results reveal that there are fundamentally two competing forces which control learning dynamics in the considered model. Firstly, the model can attain a better loss by representing more features (we've labeled this \\"feature benefit\\"). But it also gets a worse loss if it represents more than it can fit orthogonally due to \\"interference\\" between features. 11 In fact, this makes it never worthwhile for the linear model to represent more features than it has dimensions. 12 Can we achieve a similar kind of understanding for the ReLU output model? Concretely, we'd like to understand � = ∫ � ∣ ∣ � ( � − ReLU ( � � � � + � ) ) ∣ ∣ 2 � p ( � ) L=∫ x ​ ∣∣I(x−ReLU(W T Wx+b))∣∣ 2 dp(x) where � x is distributed such that � � = 0 x i ​ =0 with probability � S. The integral over � x decomposes into a term for each sparsity pattern according to the binomial expansion of ( ( 1 − � ) + � ) � ((1−S)+S) n . We can group terms of the sparsity together, rewriting the loss as � = ( 1 − � ) � � � + … + L=(1−S) n L n ​ +…+ ( 1 − � ) � � − 1 � 1 + � � � 0 (1−S)S n−1 L 1 ​ +S n L 0 ​ , with each � � L k ​ corresponding to the loss when the input is a � k-sparse vector. Note that as � → 1 S→1, � 1 L 1 ​ and � 0 L 0 ​ dominate. The � 0 L 0 ​ term, corresponding to the loss on a zero vector, is just a penalty on positive biases, ∑ � ReLU ( � � ) 2 ∑ i ​ ReLU(b i ​ ) 2 . So the interesting term is � 1 L 1 ​ , the loss on 1 1-sparse vectors: This new equation is vaguely similar to the famous Thomson problem in chemistry. In particular, if we assume uniform importance and that there are a fixed number of features with ∣ ∣ � � ∣ ∣ = 1 ∣∣W i ​ ∣∣=1 and the rest have ∣ ∣ � � ∣ ∣ = 0 ∣∣W i ​ ∣∣=0, and that � � = 0 b i ​ =0, then the feature benefit term is constant and the interference term becomes a generalized Thomson problem – we're just packing points on the surface of the sphere with a slightly unusual energy function. (We'll see this can be a productive analogy when we resume our empirical investigation in the following sections!) Another interesting property is that ReLU makes negative interference free in the 1-sparse case. This explains why the solutions we've seen prefer to only have negative interference when possible. Further, using a negative bias can convert small positive interferences into essentially being negative interferences. What about the terms corresponding to less sparse vectors? We leave explicitly writing these out to the reader, but the main idea is that there are multiple compounding interferences, and the \\"active features\\" can experience interference. In a later section, we'll see that features often organize themselves into sparse interference graphs such that only a small number of features interfere with another feature – it's interesting to note that this reduces the probability of compounding interference and makes the 1-sparse loss term more important relative to others. Superposition as a Phase Change The results in the previous section seem to suggest that there are three outcomes for a feature when we train a model: (1) the feature may simply not be learned; (2) the feature may be learned, and represented in superposition; or (3) the model may represent a feature with a dedicated dimension. The transitions between these three outcomes seem sharp. Possibly, there's some kind of phase change. 13 One way to understand this better is to explore if there's something like a \\"phase diagram\\" from physics, which could help us understand when a feature is expected to be in one of these regimes. Although we can see hints of this in our previous experiment, it's hard to really isolate what's going on because many features are changing at once and there may be interaction effects. As a result, we set up the following experiment to better isolate the effects. As an initial experiment, we consider models with 2 features but only 1 hidden layer dimension. We still consider the ReLU output model, ReLU ( � � � � − � ) ReLU(W T Wx−b). The first feature has an importance of 1.0. On one axis, we vary the importance of the 2nd \\"extra\\" feature from 0.1 to 10. On the other axis, we vary the sparsity of all features from 1.0 to 0.01. We then plot whether the 2nd \\"extra\\" feature is not learned, learned in superposition, or learned and represented orthogonally. To reduce noise, we train ten models for each point and average over the results, discarding the model with the highest loss. We can compare this to a theoretical \\"toy model of the toy model\\" where we can get closed form solutions for the loss of different weight configurations as a function of importance and sparsity. There are three natural ways to store 2 features in 1 dimension: � = [ 1 , 0 ] W=[1,0] (ignore [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1], throwing away the extra feature), � = [ 0 , 1 ] W=[0,1] (ignore [ 1 , 0 ] [1,0], throwing away the first feature to give the extra feature a dedicated dimension), and � = [ 1 , − 1 ] W=[1,−1] (store the features in superposition, losing the ability to represent [ 1 , 1 ] [1,1], the combination of both features at the same time). We call this last solution “antipodal” because the two basis vectors [ 1 , 0 ] [1,0] and [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] are mapped in opposite directions. It turns out we can analytically determine the loss for these solutions (details can be found in this notebook). As expected, sparsity is necessary for superposition to occur, but we can see that it interacts in an interesting way with relative feature importance. But most interestingly, there appears to be a real phase change, observed in both the empirical and theoretical diagrams! The optimal weight configuration discontinuously changes in magnitude and superposition. (In the theoretical model, we can analytically confirm that there's a first-order phase change: there's crossover between the functions, causing a discontinuity in the derivative of the optimal loss.) We can ask this same question of embedding three features in two dimensions. This problem still has a single \\"extra feature\\" (now the third one) we can study, asking what happens as we vary its importance relative to the other two and change sparsity. For the theoretical model, we now consider four natural solutions. We can describe solutions by asking \\"what feature direction did � W ignore?\\" For example, � W might just not represent the extra feature – we'll write this � ⊥ [ 0 , 0 , 1 ] W⊥[0,0,1]. Or � W might ignore one of the other features, � ⊥ [ 1 , 0 , 0 ] W⊥[1,0,0]. But the interesting thing is that there are two ways to use superposition to make antipodal pairs. We can put the \\"extra feature\\" in an antipodal pair with one of the others ( � ⊥ [ 0 , 1 , 1 ] W⊥[0,1,1]) or put the other two features in superposition and give the extra feature a dedicated dimension ( � ⊥ [ 1 , 1 , 0 ] W⊥[1,1,0]). Details on the closed form losses for these solutions can be found in this notebook. We do not consider a last solution of putting all the features in joint superposition, � ⊥ [ 1 , 1 , 1 ] W⊥[1,1,1]. These diagrams suggest that there really is a phase change between different strategies for encoding features. However, we'll see in the next section that there's much more complex structure this preliminary view doesn't capture. The Geometry of Superposition We've seen that superposition can allow a model to represent extra features, and that the number of extra features increases as we increase sparsity. In this section, we'll investigate this relationship in more detail, discovering an unexpected geometric story: features seem to organize themselves into geometric structures such as pentagons and tetrahedrons! In some ways, the structure described in this section seems \\"too elegant to be true\\" and we think there's a good chance it's at least partly idiosyncratic to the toy model we're investigating. But it seems worth investigating because if anything about this generalizes to real models, it may give us a lot of leverage in understanding their representations. We'll start by investigating uniform superposition, where all features are identical: independent, equally important and equally sparse. It turns out that uniform superposition has a surprising connection to the geometry of uniform polytopes! Later, we'll move on to investigate non-uniform superposition, where features are not identical. It turns out that this can be understood, at least to some extent, as a deformation of uniform superposition. Uniform Superposition As mentioned above, we begin our investigation with uniform superposition, where all features have the same importance and sparsity. We'll see later that this case has some unexpected structure, but there's also a much more basic reason to study it: it's much easier to reason about than the non-uniform case, and has fewer variables we need to worry about in our experiments. We'd like to understand what happens as we change feature sparsity, � S. Since all features are equally important, we will assume without loss of generality 14 that each feature has importance � � = 1 I i ​ =1 . We'll study a model with � = 4 0 0 n=400 features and � = 3 0 m=30 hidden dimensions, but it turns out the number of features and hidden dimensions doesn't matter very much. In particular, it turns out that the number of input features � n doesn't matter as long as it's much larger than the number of hidden dimensions, � ≫ � n≫m. And it also turns out that the number of hidden dimensions doesn't really matter as long as we're interested in the ratio of features learned to hidden features. Doubling the number of hidden dimensions just doubles the number of features the model learns. A convenient way to measure the number of features the model has learned is to look at the Frobenius norm, ∣ ∣ � ∣ ∣ � 2 ∣∣W∣∣ F 2 ​ . Since ∣ ∣ � � ∣ ∣ 2 ≃ 1 ∣∣W i ​ ∣∣ 2 ≃1 if a feature is represented and ∣ ∣ � � ∣ ∣ 2 ≃ 0 ∣∣W i ​ ∣∣ 2 ≃0 if it is not, this is roughly the number of features the model has learned to represent. Conveniently, this norm is basis-independent, so it still behaves nicely in the dense regime � = 0 S=0 where the feature basis isn't privileged by anything and the model represents features with arbitrary directions instead. We'll plot � ∗ = � / ∣ ∣ � ∣ ∣ � 2 D ∗ =m/∣∣W∣∣ F 2 ​ , which we can think of as the \\"dimensions per feature\\": Surprisingly, we find that this graph is \\"sticky\\" at 1 1 and 1 / 2 1/2. (This very vaguely resembles the fractional quantum Hall effect – see e.g. this diagram.) Why is this? On inspection, the 1 / 2 1/2 \\"sticky point\\" seems to correspond to a precise geometric arrangement where features come in \\"antipodal pairs\\", each being exactly the negative of the other, allowing two features to be packed into each hidden dimension. It appears that antipodal pairs are so effective that the model preferentially uses them over a wide range of the sparsity regime. It turns out that antipodal pairs are just the tip of the iceberg. Hiding underneath this curve are a number of extremely specific geometric configurations of features. FEATURE DIMENSIONALITY In the previous section, we saw that there's a sticky regime where the model has \\"half a dimension per feature\\" in some sense. This is an average statistical property of the features the model represents, but it seems to hint at something interesting. Is there a way we could understand what \\"fraction of a dimension\\" a specific feature gets? We'll define the dimensionality of the � ith feature, � � D i ​ , as: � � = ∣ ∣ � � ∣ ∣ 2 ∑ � ( � � ^ ⋅ � � ) 2 D i ​ = ∑ j ​ ( W i ​ ^ ​ ⋅W j ​ ) 2 ∣∣W i ​ ∣∣ 2 ​ where � � W i ​ is the weight vector column associated with the � ith feature, and � � ^ W i ​ ^ ​ is the unit version of that vector. Intuitively, the numerator represents the extent to which a given feature is represented, while the denominator is \\"how many features share the dimension it is embedded in\\" by projecting each feature onto its dimension. In the antipodal case, each feature participating in an antipodal pair will have a dimensionality of � = 1 / ( 1 + 1 ) = 1 / 2 D=1/(1+1)=1/2 while features which are not learned will have a dimensionality of 0 0. Empirically, it seems that the dimensionality of all features add up to the number of embedding dimensions when the features are \\"packed efficiently\\" in some sense. We can now break the above plot down on a per-feature basis. This reveals many more of these \\"sticky points\\"! To help us understand this better, we're going to create a scatter plot annotated with some additional information: We start with the line plot we had in the previous section. We overlay this with a scatter plot of the individual feature dimensionalities for each feature in the models at each sparsity level. The feature dimensionalities cluster at certain fractions, so we draw lines for those. (It turns out that each fraction corresponds to a specific weight geometry – we'll discuss this shortly.) We visualize the weight geometries for a few models with a \\"feature geometry graph\\" where each feature is a node and edge weights are based on the absolute value of the dot product feature embedding vectors. So features are connected if they aren't orthogonal. Let's look at the resulting plot, and then we'll try to figure out what it's showing us: What is going on with the points clustering at specific fractions?? We'll see shortly that the model likes to create specific weight geometries and kind of jumps between the different configurations. In the previous section, we developed a theory of superposition as a phase change. But everything on this plot between 0 (not learning a feature) and 1 (dedicating a dimension to a feature) is superposition. Superposition is what happens when features have fractional dimensionality. That is to say – superposition isn't just one thing! How can we relate this to our original understanding of the phase change? We often think of water as only having three phases: ice, water and steam. But this is a simplification: there are actually many phases of ice, often corresponding to different crystal structures (eg. hexagonal vs cubic ice). In a vaguely similar way, neural network features seem to also have many other phases within the general category of \\"superposition.\\" WHY THESE GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES? In the previous diagram, we found that there are distinct lines corresponding to dimensionality of: ¾ (tetrahedron), ⅔ (triangle), ½ (antipodal pair), ⅖ (pentagon), ⅜ (square antiprism), and 0 (feature not learned). We believe there would also be a 1 (dedicated dimension for a feature) line if not for the fact that basis features are indistinguishable from other directions in the dense regime. Several of these configurations may jump out as solutions to the famous Thomson problem. (In particular, square antiprisms are much less famous than cubes and are primarily of note for their role in molecular geometry due to being a Thomson problem solution.) As we saw earlier, there is a very real sense in which our model can be understood as solving a generalized version of the Thomson problem. When our model chooses to represent a feature, the feature is embedded as a point on an � m-dimensional sphere. A second clue as to what's going on is that there are lines for the Thomson solutions which are uniform polyhedra (e.g. tetrahedron), but there seem to be split lines where we'd expect to see non-uniform solutions (e.g. instead of a ⅗ line for triangular bipyramids we see a co-occurence of points at ⅔ for triangles and points at ½ for a antipodes). In a uniform polyhedron, all vertices have the same geometry, and so if we embed features as them each feature has the same dimensionality. But if we embed features as a non-uniform polyhedron, different features will have more or less interference with others. In particular, many of the Thomson solutions can be understood as tegum products (an operation which constructs polytopes by embedding two polytopes in orthogonal subspaces) of smaller uniform polytopes. (In the earlier graph visualizations of feature geometry, two subgraphs are disconnected if and only if they are in different tegum factors.) As a result, we should expect their dimensionality to actually correspond to the underlying factor uniform polytopes. This also suggests a possible reason why we observe 3D Thomson problem solutions, despite the fact that we're actually studying a higher dimensional version of the problem. Just as many 3D Thomson solutions are tegum products of 2D and 1D solutions, perhaps higher dimensional solutions are often tegum products of 1D, 2D, and 3D solutions. The orthogonality of factors in tegum products has interesting implications. For the purposes of superposition, it means that there can't be any \\"interference\\" across tegum-factors. This may be preferred by the toy model: having many features interfere simultaneously could be really bad for it. (See related discussion in our earlier mathematical analysis.) Aside: Polytopes and Low-Rank Matrices At this point, it's worth making explicit that there's a correspondence between polytopes and symmetric, positive-definite, low-rank matrices (i.e. matrices of the form � � � W T W). This correspondence underlies the results we saw in the previous section, and is generally useful for thinking about superposition. In some ways, the correspondence is trivial. If one has a rank- � m � × � n×n-matrix of the form � � � W T W, then � W is a � × � n×m-matrix. We can interpret the columns of � W as � n points in a � m-dimensional space. The place where this starts to become interesting is that it makes it clear that � � � W T W is driven by the geometry. In particular, we can see how the off-diagonal terms are driven by the geometry of the points. Put another way, there's an exact correspondence between polytopes and strategies for superposition. For example, every strategy for putting three features in superposition in a 2-dimensional space corresponds to a triangle, and every triangle corresponds to such a strategy. From this perspective, it doesn't seem surprising that if we have three equally important and equally sparse features, the optimal strategy is an equilateral triangle. This correspondence also goes the other direction. Suppose we have a rank ( � − � ) (n−i)-matrix of the form � � � W T W. We can characterize it by the dimensions � W did not represent – that is, which directions are orthogonal to � W? For example, if we have a ( � − 1 ) (n−1)-matrix, we might ask what single direction did � W not represent? This is especially informative if we assume that � � � W T W will be as \\"identity-like\\" as possible, given the constraint of not representing certain vectors. In fact, given such a set of orthogonal vectors, we can construct a polytope by starting with � n basis vectors and projecting them to a space orthogonal to the given vectors. For example, if we start in three dimensions and then project such that � ⊥ ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) W⊥(1,1,1), we get a triangle. More generally, setting � ⊥ ( 1 , 1 , 1 , . . . ) W⊥(1,1,1,...) gives us a regular � n-simplex. This is interesting because it's in some sense the \\"minimal possible superposition.\\" Assuming that features are equally important and sparse, the best possible direction to not represent is the fully dense vector ( 1 , 1 , 1 , . . . ) (1,1,1,...)! Non-Uniform Superposition So far, this section has focused on the geometry of uniform superposition, where all features are of equal importance, equal sparsity, and independent. The model is essentially solving a variant of the Thomson problem. Because all features are the same, solutions corresponding to uniform polyhedra get especially low loss. In this subsection, we'll study non-uniform superposition, where features are somehow not uniform. They may vary in importance and sparsity, or have a correlational structure that makes them not independent. This distorts the uniform geometry we saw earlier. In practice, it seems like superposition in real neural networks will be non-uniform, so developing an understanding of it seems important. Unfortunately, we're far from a comprehensive theory of the geometry of non-uniform superposition at this point. As a result, the goal of this section will merely be to highlight some of the more striking phenomena we observe: Features varying in importance or sparsity causes smooth deformation of polytopes as the imbalance builds, up until a critical breaking point at which they snap to another polytope. Correlated features prefer to be orthogonal, often forming in different tegum factors. As a result, correlated features may form an orthogonal local basis. When they can't be orthogonal, they prefer to be side-by-side. In some cases correlated features merge into a single feature: this hints at some kind of interaction between \\"superposition-like behavior\\" and \\"PCA-like behavior\\". Anti-correlated features prefer to be in the same tegum factor when superposition is necessary. They prefer to have negative interference, ideally being antipodal. We attempt to illustrate these phenomena with some representative experiments below. PERTURBING A SINGLE FEATURE The simplest kind of non-uniform superposition is to vary one feature and leave the others uniform. As an experiment, let's consider an experiment where we represent � = 5 n=5 features in � = 2 m=2 dimensions. In the uniform case, with importance � = 1 I=1 and activation density 1 − � = 0 . 0 5 1−S=0.05, we get a regular pentagon. But if we vary one point – in this case we'll make it more or less sparse – we see the pentagram stretch to account for the new value. If we make it denser, activating more frequently (yellow) the other features repel from it, giving it more space. On the other hand, if we make it sparser, activating less frequently (blue) it takes less space and other points push towards it. If we make it sufficiently sparse, there's a phase change, and it collapses from a pentagon to a pair of digons with the sparser point at zero. The phase change corresponds to loss curves corresponding to the two different geometries crossing over. (This observation allows us to directly confirm that it is genuinely a first order phase change.) To visualize the solutions, we canonicalize them, rotating them to align with each other in a consistent manner. These results seem to suggest that, at least in some cases, non-uniform superposition can be understood as a deformation of uniform superposition and jumping between uniform superposition configurations rather than a totally different regime. Since uniform superposition has a lot of understandable structure, but real world superposition is almost certainly non-uniform, this seems very promising! The reason pentagonal solutions are not on the unit circle is because models reduce the effect of positive interference, setting a slight negative bias to cut off noise and setting their weights to ∣ ∣ � � ∣ ∣ = 1 / ( 1 − � � ) ∣∣W i ​ ∣∣=1/(1−b i ​ ) to compensate. Distance from the unit circle can be interpreted as primarily driven by the amount of positive interference. A note for reimplementations: optimizing with a two-dimensional hidden space makes this easier to study, but the actual optimization process to be really challenging from gradient descent – a lot harder than even just having three dimensions. Getting clean results required fitting each model multiple times and taking the solution with the lowest loss. However, there's a silver lining to this: visualizing the sub-optimal solutions on a scatter plot as above allows us to see the loss curves for different geometries and gain greater insight into the phase change. Correlated and Anticorrelated Features A more complicated form of non-uniform superposition occurs when there are correlations between features. This seems essential for understanding superposition in the real world, where many features are correlated or anti-correlated. For example, one very pragmatic question to ask is whether we should expect polysemantic neurons to group the same features together across models. If the groupings were random, you could use this to detect polysemantic neurons, by comparing across models! However, we'll see that correlational structure strongly influences which features are grouped together in superposition. The behavior seems to be quite nuanced, with a kind of \\"order of preferences\\" for how correlated features behave in superposition. The model ideally represents correlated features orthogonally, in separate tegum factors with no interactions between them. When that fails, it prefers to arrange them so that they're as close together as possible – it prefers positive interference between correlated features over negative interference. Finally, when there isn't enough space to represent all the correlated features, it will collapse them and represent their principal component instead! Conversely, when features are anti-correlated, models prefer to have them interfere, especially with negative interference. We'll demonstrate this with a few experiments below. SETUP FOR EXPLORING CORRELATED AND ANTICORRELATED FEATURES Throughout this section we'll refer to \\"correlated feature sets\\" and \\"anticorrelated feature sets\\". Correlated Feature Sets. Our correlated feature sets can be thought of as \\"bundles\\" of co-occurring features. One can imagine a highly idealized version of what might happen in an image classifier: there could be a bundle of features used to identify animals (fur, ears, eyes) and another bundle used to identify buildings (corners, windows, doors). Features from one of these bundles are likely to appear together. Mathematically, we represent this by linking the choice of whether all the features in a correlated feature set are zero or not together. Recall that we originally defined our synthetic distribution to have features be zero with probability � S and otherwise uniformly distributed between [0,1]. We simply have the same sample determine whether they're zero. Anticorrelated Feature Sets. One could also imagine anticorrelated features which are extremely unlikely to occur together. To simulate these, we'll have anticorrelated feature sets where only one feature in the set can be active at a time. To simulate this, we'll have the feature set be entirely zero with probability � S, but then only have one randomly selected feature in the set be uniformly sampled from [0,1] if it's active, with the others being zero. ORGANIZATION OF CORRELATED AND ANTICORRELATED FEATURES For our initial investigation, we simply train a number of small toy models with correlated and anti-correlated features and observe what happens. To make this easy to study, we limit ourselves to the � = 2 m=2 case where we can explicitly visualize the weights as points in 2D space. In general, such solutions can be understood as a collection of points on a unit circle. To make solutions easy to compare, we rotate and flip solutions to align with each other. LOCAL ALMOST-ORTHOGONAL BASES It turns out that the tendency of models to arrange correlated features to be orthogonal is actually quite a strong phenomenon. In particular, for larger models, it seems to generate a kind of \\"local almost-orthogonal basis\\" where, even though the model as a whole is in superposition, the correlated feature sets considered in isolation are (nearly) orthogonal and can be understood as having very little superposition. To investigate this, we train a larger model with two sets of correlated features and visualize � � � W T W. If this result holds in real neural networks, it suggests we might be able to make a kind of \\"local non-superposition\\" assumption, where for certain sub-distributions we can assume that the activating features are not in superposition. This could be a powerful result, allowing us to confidently use methods such as PCA which might not be principled to generally use in the context of superposition. COLLAPSING OF CORRELATED FEATURES One of the most interesting properties is that there seems to be a trade off with Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and superposition. If there are two correlated features � a and � b, but the model only has capacity to represent one, the model will represent their principal component ( � + � ) / 2 (a+b)/ 2 ​ , a sparse variable that has more impact on the loss than either individually, and ignore the second principal component ( � − � ) / 2 (a−b)/ 2 ​ . As an experiment, we consider six features, organized into three sets of correlated pairs. Features in each correlated pair are represented by a given color (red, green, and blue). The correlation is created by having both features always activate together – they're either both zero or neither zero. (The exact non-zero values they take when they activate is uncorrelated.) As we vary the sparsity of the features, we find that in the very sparse regime, we observe superposition as expected, with features arranged in a hexagon and correlated features side-by-side. As we decrease sparsity, the features progressively \\"collapse\\" into their principal components. In very dense regimes, the solution becomes equivalent to PCA. These results seem to hint that PCA and superposition are in some sense complementary strategies which trade off with one another. As features become more correlated, PCA becomes a better strategy. As features become sparser, superposition becomes a better strategy. When features are both sparse and correlated, mixtures of each strategy seem to occur. It would be nice to more deeply understand this space of tradeoffs. It's also interesting to think about this in the context of continuous equivariant features, such as features which occur in different rotations. Superposition and Learning Dynamics The focus of this paper is how superposition contributes to the functioning of fully trained neural networks, but as a brief detour it's interesting to ask how our toy models – and the resulting superposition – evolve over the course of training. There are several reasons why these models seem like a particularly interesting case for studying learning dynamics. Firstly, unlike most neural networks, the fully trained models converge to a simple but non-trivial structure that rhymes with an emerging thread of evidence that neural network learning dynamics might have geometric weight structure that we can understand. One might hope that understanding the final structure would make it easier for us to understand the evolution over training. Secondly, superposition hints at surprisingly discrete structure (regular polytopes of all things!). We'll find that the underlying learning dynamics are also surprisingly discrete, continuing an emerging trend of evidence that neural network learning might be less continuous than it seems. Finally, since superposition has significant implications for interpretability, it would be nice to understand how it emerges over training – should we expect models to use superposition early on, or is it something that only emerges later in training, as models struggle to fit more features in? Unfortunately, we aren't able to give these questions the detailed investigation they deserve within the scope of this paper. Instead, we'll limit ourselves to a couple particularly striking phenomena we've noticed, leaving more detailed investigation for future work. PHENOMENON 1: DISCRETE \\"ENERGY LEVEL\\" JUMPS Perhaps the most striking phenomenon we've noticed is that the learning dynamics of toy models with large numbers of features appear to be dominated by \\"energy level jumps\\" where features jump between different feature dimensionalities. (Recall that a feature's dimensionality is the fraction of a dimension dedicated to representing a feature.) Let's consider the problem setup we studied when investigating the geometry of uniform superposition in the previous section, where we have a large number of features of equal importance and sparsity. As we saw previously, the features ultimately arrange themselves into a small number of polytopes with fractional dimensionalities. A natural question to ask is what happens to these feature dimensionalities over the course of training. Let's pick one model where all the features converge into digons and observe. In the first plot, each colored line corresponds to the dimensionality of a single feature. The second plot shows how the loss curve changes over the same duration. Note how the dimensionality of some features \\"jump\\" between different values and swap places. As this happens, the loss curve also undergoes a sudden drop (a very small one at the first jump, and a larger one at the second jump). These results make us suspect that seemingly smooth decreases of the loss curve in larger models are in fact composed of many small jumps of features between different configurations. (For similar results of sudden mechanistic changes, see Olsson et al.'s induction head phase change [29] , and Nanda and Lieberum's results on phase changes in modular arithmetic [30] . More broadly, consider the phenomenon of grokking [31] .) PHENOMENON 2: LEARNING AS GEOMETRIC TRANSFORMATIONS Many of our toy model solutions can be understood as corresponding to geometric structures. This is especially easy to see and study when there are only � = 3 m=3 hidden dimensions, since we can just directly visualize the feature embeddings as points in 3D space forming a polyhedron. It turns out that, at least in some cases, the learning dynamics leading to these structures can be understood as a sequence of simple, independent geometric transformations! One particularly interesting example of this phenomenon occurs in the context of correlated features, as studied in the previous section. Consider the problem of representing � = 6 n=6 features in superposition within � = 3 m=3 dimensions. If we have the 6 6 features be 2 2 sets of 3 3 correlated features, we observe a really interesting pattern. The learning proceeds in distinct regimes which are visible in the loss curve, with each regime corresponding to a distinct geometric transformation: (Although the last solution – an octahedron with features from different correlated sets arranged in antipodal pairs – seems to be a strong attractor, the learning trajectory visualized above appears to be one of a few different learning trajectories that attract the model. The different trajectories vary at step C: sometimes the model gets pulled directly into the antiprism configuration from the start or organize features into antipodal pairs. Presumably this depends on which feature geometry the model is closest to when step B ends.) The learning dynamics we observe here seem directly related to previous findings on simple models. [32] found that two-layer neural networks, in early stages of training, tend to learn a linear approximation to a problem. Although the technicalities of our data generation process do not precisely match the hypotheses of their theorem, it seems likely that the same basic mechanism is at work. In our case, we see the toy network learns a linear PCA solution before moving to a better nonlinear solution. A second related finding comes from [33] , who looked at hierarchical sets of features, with a data generation process similar to the one we consider. They find empirically that certain networks (nonlinear and deep linear) “split” embedding vectors in a manner very much like what we observed. They also provide a theoretical analysis in terms of the underlying dynamical system. A key difference is that they focus on the topology—the branching structure of the emerging feature representations—rather than the geometry. Despite this difference, it seems likely that their analysis could be generalized to our case. Relationship to Adversarial Robustness Although we're most interested in the implications of superposition for interpretability, there appears to be a connection to adversarial examples. If one gives it a little thought, this connection can actually be quite intuitive. In a model without superposition, the end-to-end weights for the first feature are: ( � � � ) 0 = ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , . . . ) (W T W) 0 ​ = (1, 0, 0, 0, ...) But in a model with superposition, it's something like: ( � � � ) 0 = ( 1 , � , − � , � , . . . ) (W T W) 0 ​ = (1, ϵ, −ϵ, ϵ, ...) The � ϵ entries (which are solely an artifact of superposition \\"interference\\") create an obvious way for an adversary to attack the most important feature. Note that this may remain true even in the infinite data limit: the optimal behavior of the model fit to sparse infinite data is to use superposition to represent more features, leaving it vulnerable to attack. To test this, we generated L2 adversarial examples (allowing a max L2 attack norm of 0.1 of the average input norm). We originally generated attacks with gradient descent, but found that for extremely sparse examples where ReLU neurons are in the zero regime 99% of the time, attacks were difficult, effectively due to gradient masking [34] . Instead, we found it worked better to analytically derive adversarial attacks by considering the optimal L2 attacks for each feature ( � ( � � � ) � / ∣ ∣ ( � � � ) � ∣ ∣ 2 λ(W T W) i ​ /∣∣(W T W) i ​ ∣∣ 2 ​ ) and taking the one of these attacks which most harms model performance. We find that vulnerability to adversarial examples sharply increases as superposition forms (increasing by >3x), and that the level of vulnerability closely tracks the number of features per dimension (the reciprocal of feature dimensionality). We're hesitant to speculate about the extent to which superposition is responsible for adversarial examples in practice. There are compelling theories for why adversarial examples occur without reference to superposition (e.g. [35] ). But it is interesting to note that if one wanted to try to argue for a \\"superposition maximalist stance\\", it does seem like many interesting phenomena related to adversarial examples can be predicted from superposition. As seen above, superposition can be used to explain why adversarial examples exist. It also predicts that adversarially robust models would have worse performance, since making models robust would require giving up superposition and representing less features. It predicts that more adversarially robust models might be more interpretable (see e.g. [36] ). Finally, it could arguably predict that adversarial examples transfer (see e.g. [37] ) if the arrangement of features in superposition is heavily influenced by which features are correlated or anti-correlated (see earlier results on this). It might be interesting for future work to see how far the hypothesis that superposition is a significant contributor to adversarial examples can be driven. In addition to observing that superposition can cause models to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, we briefly experimented with adversarial training to see if the relationship could be used in the other direction to reduce superposition. To keep training reasonably efficient, we used the analytic optimal attack against a random feature. We found that this did reduce superposition, but attacks had to be made unreasonably large (80% input L2 norm) to fully eliminate it, which didn't seem satisfying. Perhaps stronger adversarial attacks would work better. We didn't explore this further since the increased cost and complexity of adversarial training made us want to prioritize other lines of attack on superposition first. Superposition in a Privileged Basis So far, we've explored superposition in a model without a privileged basis. We can rotate the hidden activations arbitrarily and, as long as we rotate all the weights, have the exact same model behavior. That is, for any ReLU output model with weights � W, we could take an arbitrary orthogonal matrix � O and consider the model � ′ = � � W ′ =OW. Since ( � � ) � ( � � ) = � � � (OW) T (OW)=W T W, the result would be an identical model! Models without a privileged basis are elegant, and can be an interesting analogue for certain neural network representations which don't have a privileged basis – word embeddings, or the transformer residual stream. But we'd also (and perhaps primarily) like to understand neural network representations where there are neurons which do impose a privileged basis, such as transformer MLP layers or conv net neurons. Our goal in this section is to explore the simplest toy model which gives us a privileged basis. There are at least two ways we could do this: we could add an activation function or apply L1 regularization to the hidden layer. We'll focus on adding an activation function, since the representation we are most interested in understanding is hidden layers with neurons, such as the transformer MLP layer. This gives us the following \\"ReLU hidden layer\\" model: ℎ = ReLU ( � � ) h = ReLU(Wx) � ′ = ReLU ( � � ℎ + � ) x ′ = ReLU(W T h+b) We'll train this model on the same data as before. Adding a ReLU to the hidden layer radically changes the model from an interpretability perspective. The key thing is that while � W in our previous model was challenging to interpret (recall that we visualized � � � W T W rather than � W), � W in the ReLU hidden layer model can be directly interpreted, since it connects features to basis-aligned neurons. We'll discuss this in much more detail shortly, but here's a comparison of weights resulting from a linear hidden layer model and a ReLU hidden layer model: Recall that we think of basis elements in the input as \\"features,\\" and basis elements in the middle layer as \\"neurons\\". Thus � W is a map from features to neurons. What we see in the above plot is that the features are aligning with neurons in a structured way! Many of the neurons are simply dedicated to representing a feature! (This is the critical property that justifies why neuron-focused interpretability approaches – such as much of the work in the original Circuits thread – can be effective in some circumstances.) Let's explore this in more detail. VISUALIZING SUPERPOSITION IN TERMS OF NEURONS Having a privileged basis opens up new possibilities for visualizing our models. As we saw above, we can simply inspect � W. We can also make a per-neuron stacked bar plot where, for every neuron, we visualize its weights as a stack of rectangles on top of each other: Each column in the stack plot visualizes one column of � W. Each rectangle represents one weight entry, with height corresponding to the absolute value. The color of each rectangle corresponds to the feature it acts on (i.e. which row of � W it's in). Negative values go below the x-axis. The order of the rectangles is not significant. This stack plot visualization can be nice as models get bigger. It also makes polysemantic neurons obvious: they simply correspond to having more than one weight. We'll now visualize a ReLU hidden layer toy model with � = 1 0 ; � = 5 ; � � = 0 . 7 5 � n=10; m=5;I i =0.75 i and varying feature sparsity levels. We chose a very small model (only 5 neurons) both for ease of visualization, and to circumvent some issues with this toy model we'll discuss below. However, we found that these small models were harder to optimize. For each model shown, we trained 1000 models and visualized the one with the lowest loss. Although the typical solutions are often similar to the minimal loss solutions shown, selecting the minimal loss solutions reveals even more structure in how features align with neurons. It also reveals that there are ranges of sparsity values where the optimal solution for all models trained on data with that sparsity have the same weight configurations. The solutions are visualized below, both visualizing the raw � W and a neuron stacked bar plot. We color features in the stacked bar plot based on whether they're in superposition, and color neurons as being monosemantic or polysemantic depending on whether they store more than one feature. Neuron order was chosen by hand (since it's arbitrary). The most important thing to pay attention to is how there's a shift from monosemantic to polysemantic neurons as sparsity increases. Monosemantic neurons do exist in some regimes! Polysemantic neurons exist in others. And they can both exist in the same model! Moreover, while it's not quite clear how to formalize this, it looks a great deal like there's a neuron-level phase change, mirroring the feature phase changes we saw earlier. It's also interesting to examine the structure of the polysemantic solutions, which turn out to be surprisingly structured and neuron-aligned. Features typically correspond to sets of neurons (monosemantic neurons might be seen as the special case where features only correspond to singleton sets). There's also structure in how polysemantic neurons are. They transition from monosemantic, to only representing a few features, to gradually representing more. However, it's unclear how much of this is generalizable to real models. LIMITATIONS OF THE RELU HIDDEN LAYER TOY MODEL SIMULATING IDENTITY Unfortunately, the toy model described in this section has a significant weakness, which limits the regimes in which it shows interesting results. The issue is that the model doesn't benefit from the ReLU hidden layer – it has no role except limiting how the model can encode information. If given any chance, the model will circumvent it. For example, given a hidden layer bias, the model will set all the biases to be positive, shifting the neurons into a positive regime where they behave linearly. If one removes the bias, but gives the model enough features, it will simulate a bias by averaging over many features. The model will only use the ReLU activation function if absolutely forced, which is a significant mark against studying this toy model. We'll introduce a model without this issue in the next section, but wanted to study this model as a simpler case study. Computation in Superposition So far, we've shown that neural networks can store sparse features in superposition and then recover them. But we actually believe superposition is more powerful than this – we think that neural networks can perform computation entirely in superposition rather than just using it as storage. This model will also give us a more principled way to study a privileged basis where features align with basis dimensions. To explore this, we consider a new setup where we imagine our input and output layer to be the layers of our hypothetical disentangled model, but have our hidden layer be a smaller layer we're imagining to be the observed model which might use superposition. We'll then try to compute a simple non-linear function and explore whether it can use superposition to do this. Since the model will have (and need to use) the hidden layer non-linearity, we'll also see features align with a privileged basis. Specifically, we'll have the model compute � = abs ( � ) y=abs(x). Absolute value is an appealing function to study because there's a very simple way to compute it with ReLU neurons: abs ( � ) = ReLU ( � ) + ReLU ( − � ) abs(x)=ReLU(x)+ReLU(−x). This simple structure will make it easy for us to study the geometry of how the hidden layer is leveraged to do computation. Since this model needs ReLU to compute absolute value, it doesn't have the issues the model in the previous section had with trying to avoid the activation function. Experiment Setup The input feature vector, � x, is still sparse, with each feature � � x i ​ having probability � � S i ​ of being 0 0. However, since we want to have the model compute absolute value, we need to allow it to take on non-positive values for this to be a non-trivial task. As a result, if it is non-zero, its value is now sampled uniformly from [ − 1 , 1 ] [−1,1]. The target output � y is � = abs ( � ) y=abs(x). Following the previous section, we'll consider the \\"ReLU hidden layer\\" toy model variant, but no longer tie the two weights to be identical: ℎ = ReLU ( � 1 � ) h=ReLU(W 1 ​ x) � ′ = ReLU ( � 2 ℎ + � ) y ′ =ReLU(W 2 ​ h+b) The loss is still the mean squared error weighted by feature importances � � I i ​ as before. Basic Results With this model, it's a bit less straightforward to study how individual features get embedded; because of the ReLU on the hidden layer, we can't just study � 2 � � 1 W 2 T ​ W 1 ​ . And because � 2 W 2 ​ and � 1 W 1 ​ are now learned independently, we can't just study columns of � 1 W 1 ​ . We believe that with some manipulation we could recover much of the simplicity of the earlier model by considering \\"positive features\\" and \\"negative features\\" independently, but we're going to focus on another perspective instead. As we saw in the previous section, having a hidden layer activation function means that it makes sense to visualize the weights in terms of neurons. We can visualize � W directly or as a neuron stack plot as we did before. We can also visualize it as a graph, which can sometimes be helpful for understanding computation. Let's look at what happens when we train a model with � = 3 n=3 features to perform absolute value on � = 6 m=6 hidden layer neurons. Without superposition, the model needs two hidden layer neurons to implement absolute value on one feature. The resulting model – modulo a subtle issue about rescaling input and output weights 15 – performs absolute value exactly as one might expect. For each input feature � � x i ​ , it constructs a \\"positive side\\" neuron ReLU ( � � ) ReLU(x i ​ ) and a \\"negative side\\" neuron ReLU ( − � � ) ReLU(−x i ​ ). It then adds these together to compute absolute value: Superposition vs Sparsity We've seen that – as expected – our toy model can learn to implement absolute value. But can it use superposition to compute absolute value for more features? To test this, we train models with � = 1 0 0 n=100 features and � = 4 0 m=40 neurons and a feature importance curve � � = 0 . 8 � I i ​ =0.8 i , varying feature sparsity. 16 A couple of notes on visualization: Since we're primarily interested in understanding superposition and polysemantic neurons, we'll show a stacked weight plot of the absolute values of weights. The features are colored by superposition. To make the diagrams easier to read, neurons are faintly colored based on how polysemantic they are (as judged by eye based on the plots). Neuron order is sorted by the importance of the largest feature. Much like we saw in the ReLU hidden layer models, these results demonstrate that activation functions, under the right circumstances, create a privileged basis and cause features to align with basis dimensions. In the dense regime, we end up with each neuron representing a single feature, and we can read feature values directly off of neuron activations. However, once the features become sufficiently sparse, this model, too, uses superposition to represent more features than it has neurons. This result is notable because it demonstrates the ability of neural networks to perform computation even on data that is represented in superposition. 17 Remember that the model is required to use the hidden layer ReLU in order to compute an absolute value; gradient descent manages to find solutions that usefully approximate the computation even when each neuron encodes a mix of multiple features. Focusing on the intermediate sparsity regimes, we find several additional qualitative behaviors that we find fascinatingly reminiscent of behavior that has been observed in real, full-scale neural networks: To begin, we find that in some regimes, many of the model's neurons will encode pure features, but a subset of them will be highly polysemantic. This is similar to the phase change we saw earlier in the ReLU output model. However, in that case, the phase change was with respect to features, with more important features not being put in superposition. In this experiment, the neurons don't have any intrinsic importance, but we see that the neurons representing the most important features (on the left) tend to be monosemantic. We find this to bear a suggestive resemblance to some previous work in vision models, which found some layers that contained \\"mostly pure\\" feature neurons, but with some neurons representing additional features on a different scale. We also note that many neurons appear to be associated with a single \\"primary\\" feature – encoded by a relatively large weight – coupled with one or more \\"secondary\\" features encoded with smaller-magnitude weights to that neuron. If we were to observe the activations of such a neuron over a range of input examples, we would find that the largest activations of that neuron were all or nearly-all associated with the presence of the \\"primary\\" feature, but that the lower-magnitude activations were much more polysemantic. Intriguingly, that description closely matches what researchers have found in previous work on language models [4] – many neurons appear interpretable when we examine their strongest activations over a dataset, but can be shown on further investigation to activate for other meanings or patterns, often at a lower magnitude. While only suggestive, the ability of our toy model to reproduce these qualitative features of larger neural networks offers an exciting hint that these models are illuminating general phenomena. The Asymmetric Superposition Motif If neural networks can perform computation in superposition, a natural question is to ask how exactly they're doing so. What does that look like mechanically, in terms of the weights? In this subsection, we'll (mostly) work through one such model and see an interesting motif of asymmetric superposition. (We use the term \\"motif\\" in the sense of the original circuit thread, inspired by its use in systems biology [38] .) The model we're trying to understand is shown below on the left, visualized as a neuron weight stack plot, with features corresponding to colors. The model is only doing a limited amount of superposition, and many of the weights can be understood as simply implementing absolute value in the expected way. However, there are a few neurons doing something else… These other neurons implement two instances of asymmetric superposition and inhibition. Each instance consists of two neurons: One neuron does asymmetric superposition. In normal superposition, one might store features with equal weights (eg. � = [ 1 , − 1 ] W=[1,−1]) and then have equal output weights ( � = [ 1 , 1 ] W=[1,1]). In asymmetric superposition, one stores the features with different magnitudes (eg. � = [ 2 , − 1 2 ] W=[2,− 2 1 ​ ]) and then has reciprocal output weights (eg. � = [ 1 2 , 2 ] W=[ 2 1 ​ ,2]). This causes one feature to heavily interfere with the other, but avoid the other interfering with the first! To avoid the consequences of that interference, the model has another neuron heavily inhibit the feature in the case where there would have been positive interference. This essentially converts positive interference (which could greatly increase the loss) into negative interference (which has limited consequences due to the output ReLU). There are a few other weights this doesn't explain. (We believe they're effectively small conditional biases.) But this asymmetric superposition and inhibition pattern appears to be the primary story. The Strategic Picture of Superposition Although superposition is scientifically interesting, much of our interest comes from a pragmatic motivation: we believe that superposition is deeply connected to the challenge of using interpretability to make claims about the safety of AI systems. In particular, it is a clear challenge to the most promising path we see to be able to say that neural networks won't perform certain harmful behaviors or to catch \\"unknown unknowns\\" safety problems. This is because superposition is deeply linked to the ability to identify and enumerate over all features in a model, and the ability to enumerate over all features would be a powerful primitive for making claims about model behavior. We begin this section by describing how \\"solving superposition\\" in a certain sense is equivalent to many strong interpretability properties which might be useful for safety. Next, we'll describe three high level strategies one might take to \\"solving superposition.\\" Finally, we'll describe a few other additional strategic considerations. Safety, Interpretability, & \\"Solving Superposition\\" We'd like a way to have confidence that models will never do certain behaviors such as \\"deliberately deceive\\" or \\"manipulate.\\" Today, it's unclear how one might show this, but we believe a promising tool would be the ability to identify and enumerate over all features. The ability to have a universal quantifier over the fundamental units of neural network computation is a significant step towards saying that certain types of circuits don't exist. 18 It also seems like a powerful tool for addressing \\"unknown unknowns\\", since it's a way that one can fully cover network behavior, in a sense. How does this relate to superposition? It turns out that the ability to enumerate over features is deeply intertwined with superposition. One way to see this is to imagine a neural network with a privileged basis and without superposition (like the monosemantic neurons found in early InceptionV1, e.g. [3] ): features would simply correspond to neurons, and you could enumerate over features by enumerating over neurons. 19 The connection also goes the other way: if one has the ability to enumerate over features, one can perform compressed sensing using the feature directions to (with high probability) \\"unfold\\" a superposition models activations into those of a larger, non-superposition model. For this reason, we'll call any method that gives us the ability to enumerate over features – and equivalently, unfold activations – a \\"solution to superposition\\". Any solution is on the table, from creating models that just don't have superposition, to identifying what directions correspond to features after the fact. We'll discuss the space of possibilities shortly. We've motivated \\"solving superposition\\" in terms of feature enumeration, but it's worth noting that it's equivalent to (or necessary for) many other interpretability properties one might care about: Decomposing Activation Space. The most fundamental challenge of any interpretability agenda is to defeat the curse of dimensionality. For mechanistic interpretability, this ultimately reduces to whether we can decompose activation space into independently understandable components, analogous to how computer program memory can be decomposed into variables. Identifying features is what allows us to decompose the model in terms of them. Describing Activations in Terms of Pure Features. One of the most obvious casualties of superposition is that we can't describe activations in terms of pure features. When features are relatively basis aligned, we can take an activation – say the activations for a dog head in a vision model – and decompose them into individual underlying features, like a floppy ear, short golden fur, and a snout. (See the \\"semantic dictionary\\" interface in Building Blocks [39] .) Solving superposition would allow us to do this for every model. Understanding Weights (ie. Circuit Analysis). Neural network weights can typically only be understood when they're connecting together understandable features. All the circuit analysis seen in the original circuit thread (see especially [40] ), was fundamentally only possible because the weights connected non-polysemantic neurons. We need to solve superposition for this to work in general. Even very basic approaches become perilous with superposition. It isn't just sophisticated approaches to interpretability which are harmed by superposition. Even very basic methods one might consider become unreliable. For example, if one is concerned about language models exhibiting manipulative behavior, one might ask if an input has a significant cosine similarity to the representations of other examples of deceptive behavior. Unfortunately, superposition means that cosine similarity has the potential to be misleading, since unrelated features start to be embedded with positive dot products to each other. However, if we solve superposition, this won't be an issue – either we'll have a model where features align with neurons, or a way to use compressed sensing to lift features to a space where they no longer have positive dot products. Three Ways Out At a very high level, there seem to be three potential approaches to resolving superposition: Create models without superposition. Find an overcomplete basis that describes how features are represented in models with superposition. Hybrid approaches in which one changes models, not resolving superposition, but making it easier for a second stage of analysis to find an overcomplete basis that describes it. Our sense is that all of these approaches are possible if one doesn't care about having a competitive model. For example, we believe it's possible to accomplish any of these for the toy models described in this paper. However, as one starts to consider serious neural networks, let alone modern large language models, all of these approaches begin to look very difficult. We'll outline the challenges we see for each approach in the following sections. With that said, it's worth highlighting one bright spot before we focus on the challenges. You might have believed that superposition was something you could never fully get rid of, but that doesn't seem to be the case. All our results seem to suggest that superposition and polysemanticity are phases with sharp transitions. That is, there may exist a regime for every model where it has no superposition or polysemanticity. The question is largely whether the cost of getting rid of or otherwise resolving superposition is too high. APPROACH 1: CREATING MODELS WITHOUT SUPERPOSITION It's actually quite easy to get rid of superposition in the toy models described in this paper, albeit at the cost of a higher loss. Simply apply at L1 regularization term to the hidden layer activations (i.e. add � ∣ ∣ ℎ ∣ ∣ 1 λ∣∣h∣∣ 1 ​ to the loss). This actually has a nice interpretation in terms of killing features below a certain importance threshold, especially if they're not basis aligned. Generalizing this to real neural networks isn't trivial, but we expect it can be done. (This approach would be similar to work attempting to use sparsity to encourage basis-aligned word embeddings [41, 42, 43] .) However, it seems likely that models are significantly benefitting from superposition. Roughly, the sparser features are, the more features can be squeezed in per neuron. And many features in language models seem very sparse! For example, language models know about individuals with only modest public presences, such as several of the authors of this paper. Presumably we only occur with frequency significantly less than one in a million tokens. As a result, it may be the case that superposition effectively makes models much bigger. All of this paints a picture where getting rid of superposition may be fairly achievable, but doing so will have a large performance cost. For a model with a fixed number of neurons, superposition helps – potentially a lot. But this is only true if the constraint is thought of in terms of neurons. That is, a superposition model with � n neurons likely has the same performance as a significantly larger monosemantic model with � � kn neurons. But neurons aren't the fundamental constraint: flops are. In the most common model architectures, flops and neurons have a strict correspondence, but this doesn't have to be the case and it's much less clear that superposition is optimal in the broader space of possibilities. One family of models which change the flop-neuron relationship are Mixture of Experts (MoE) models (see review [44] ). The intuition is that most neurons are for specialized circumstances and don't need to activate most of the time. For example, German-specific neurons don't need to activate on French text. Harry Potter neurons don't need to activate on scientific papers. So MoE models organize neurons into blocks or experts, which only activate a small fraction of the time. This effectively allows the model to have � k times more neurons for a similar flop budget, given the constraint that only 1 / � 1/k of the neurons activate in a given example and that they must activate in a block. Put another way, MoE models can recover neuron sparsity as free flops, as long as the sparsity is organized in certain ways. It's unclear how far this can be pushed, especially given difficult engineering constraints. But there's an obvious lower bound, which is likely too optimistic but is interesting to think about: what if models only expended flops on neuron activations, and recovered the compute of all non-activating neurons? In this world, it seems unlikely that superposition would be optimal: you could always split a polysemantic neuron into dedicated neurons for each feature with the same cost, except for the cases where there would have been interference that hurt the model anyways. Our preliminary investigations comparing various types of superposition in terms of \\"loss reduction per activation frequency\\" seem to suggest that superposition is not optimal on these terms, although it asymptotically becomes as good as dedicated feature dimensions. Another way to think of this is that superposition exploits a gap between the sparsity of neurons and the sparsity of the underlying features; MoE eats that same gap, and so we should expect MoE models to have less superposition. To be clear, MoE models are already well studied, and we don't think this changes the capabilities case for them. (If anything, superposition offers a theory for why MoE models have not proven more effective for capabilities when the case for them seems so initially compelling!) But if one's goal is to create competitive models that don't have superposition, MoE models become interesting to think about. We don't necessarily think that they specifically are the right path forward – our goal here has been to use them as an example of why we think it remains plausible there may be ways to build competitive superposition-free models. APPROACH 2: FINDING AN OVERCOMPLETE BASIS The opposite strategy of creating a superposition-free model is to take a regular model, which has superposition, and find an overcomplete basis describing how features are embedded after the fact. This appears to be a relatively standard sparse coding (or dictionary learning) problem, where we want to take the activations of neural network layers and find out which directions correspond to features. 20 This approach has been explored by some prior work [2, 1] . The advantage of this is that we don't need to worry about whether we're damaging model performance. On the other hand, many other things are harder: It’s no longer easy to know how many features you have to enumerate. A monosemantic model represents a feature per neuron, but when finding an overcomplete basis there’s an additional challenge of identifying how many features to use for it. Solutions are no longer integrated into the surface computational structure. Neural networks can be understood in terms of their surface structure – neurons, attention heads, etc – and virtual structure that implicitly emerge (e.g. virtual attention heads [45] ). A model described by an overcomplete basis has \\"virtual neurons\\": there's a further gap between the surface and virtual structure. It's a different, major engineering challenge. Seriously attempting to solve superposition by applying sparse coding to real neural nets suggests a massive sparse coding problem. For truly large language models, one would be starting with something like a millions (neurons) by billions (tokens) matrix and then trying to do an extremely overcomplete factorization, perhaps trying to factor it to be a thousand or more times larger. This is a major engineering challenge which is different from the standard distributed training challenges ML labs are set up for. Interference is no longer pushing in your favor. If you try to train models without superposition, interference between features is pushing the training process to have less superposition. If you instead try to decode superposition after the fact, whatever amount of superposition is \\"baked in\\" by the training process and you don't have part of the objective pushing in your favor. APPROACH 3: HYBRID APPROACHES In addition to approaches which address superposition purely at training time, or purely after the fact, it may be possible to take \\"hybrid approaches\\" which do a mixture. For example, even if one can't change models without superposition, it may be possible to produce models with less superposition, which are then easier to decode. 21 Alternatively, it may be possible for architecture changes to make finding an overcomplete basis easier or more computationally tractable in large models, separately from trying to reduce superposition. Additional Considerations Phase Changes as Cause For Hope. Is totally getting rid of superposition a realistic hope? One could easily imagine a world where it can only be asymptotically reduced, and never fully eliminated. While the results in this paper seem to suggest that superposition is hard to get rid of because it's actually very useful, the upshot of it corresponding to a phase change is that there's a regime where it totally doesn't exist. If we can find a way to push models in the non-superposition regime, it seems likely it can be totally eliminated. Any superposition-free model would be a powerful tool for research. We believe that most of the research risk is in whether one can make performant superposition free models, rather than whether it's possible to make superposition free models at all. Of course, ultimately, we need to make performant models. But a non-performant superposition free model could still be a very useful research tool for studying superposition in normal models. At present, it's challenging to study superposition in models because we have no ground truth for what the features are. (This is also the reason why the toy models described in this paper can be studied – we do know what the features are!) If we had a superposition-free model, we may be able to use it as a ground truth to study superposition in regular models. Local bases are not enough. Earlier, when we considered the geometry of non-uniform superposition, we observed that models often form local orthogonal bases, where co-occurring features are orthogonal. This suggests a strategy for locally understanding models on sufficiently narrow sub-distributions. However, if our goal is to eventually make useful statements about the safety of models, we need mechanistic accounts that hold for the full distribution (and off distribution). Local bases seem unlikely to give this to us. Discussion To What Extent Does Superposition Exist in Real Models? Why are we interested in toy models? We believe they are useful proxies for studying the superposition we suspect might exist in real neural networks. But how can we know if they're actually a useful toy model? Our best validation is whether their predictions are consistent with empirical observations regarding polysemanticity. To the best of our knowledge they are. In particular: Polysemantic neurons exist. Polysemantic neurons form in our third model, just as they are observed in a wide range of neural networks. Neurons are sometimes \\"cleanly interpretable\\" and sometimes \\"polysemantic\\", often in the same layer. Our third model exhibits both polyemantic and non-polysemantic neurons, often at the same time. This is analogous to how real neural networks often have a mixture of polysemantic and non-polysemantic neurons in the same layer. InceptionV1 has more polysemantic neurons in later layers. Empirically, the fraction of neurons which are polysemantic in InceptionV1 increases with depth. One natural explanation is that as features become higher-level the stimuli they detect become rarer and thus sparser (for example, in vision, a high-level floppy ear feature is less common than a low-level Gabor filter's edge). A major prediction of our model is that superposition and polysemanticity increase as sparsity increases. Early Transformer MLP neurons are extremely polysemantic. Our experience is that neurons in the first MLP layer in Transformer language models are often extremely polysemantic. If the goal of the first MLP layer is to distinguish between different interpretations of the same token (eg. \\"die\\" in English vs German vs Dutch vs Afrikans), such features would be very sparse and our toy model would predict lots of polysemanticity. This doesn't mean that everything about our toy model reflects real neural networks. Our intuition is that some of the phenomena we observe (superposition, monosemantic vs polysemantic neurons, perhaps the relationship to adversarial examples) are likely to generalize, while other phenomena (especially the geometry and learning dynamics results) are much more uncertain. Open Questions This paper has shown that the superposition hypothesis is true in certain toy models. But if anything, we're left with many more questions about it than we had at the start. In this final section, we review some of the questions which strike us as most important: what do we know, and would we like for future work to clarify? Is there a statistical test for catching superposition? How can we control whether superposition and polysemanticity occur? Put another way, can we change the phase diagram such that features don't fall into the superposition regime? Pragmatically, this seems like the most important question. L1 regularization of activations, adversarial training, and changing the activation function all seem promising. Are there any models of superposition which have a closed-form solution? Saxe et al. [28] demonstrate that it's possible to create nice closed-form solutions for linear neural networks. We made some progress towards this for the � = 2 ; � = 1 n=2;m=1 ReLU output model (and Tom McGrath makes further progress in his comment), but it would be nice to solve this more generally. How realistic are these toy models? To what extent do they capture the important properties of real models with respect to superposition? How can we tell? Can we estimate the feature importance curve or feature sparsity curve of real models? If one takes our toy models seriously, the most important properties for understanding the problem are the feature importance and sparsity curves. Is there a way we can estimate them for real models? (Likely, this would involve training models of varying sizes or amounts of regularization, observing the loss and neuron sparsities, and trying to infer something.) Should we expect superposition to go away if we just scale enough? What assumptions about the feature importance curve and sparsity would need to be true for that to be the case? Alternatively, should we expect superposition to remain a constant fraction of represented features, or even to increase as we scale? Are we measuring the maximally principled things? For example, what is the most principled definition of superposition / polysemanticity? How important are polysemantic neurons? If X% of the model is interpretable neurons and 1-X% are polysemantic, how much should we believe we understand from understanding the x% interpretable neurons? (See also the \\"feature packing principle\\" suggested above.) How many features should we expect to be stored in superposition? This was briefly discussed in the previous section. It seems like results from compressed sensing should be able to give us useful upper-bounds, but it would be nice to have a clearer understanding – and perhaps tighter bounds! Does the apparent phase change we observe in features/neurons have any connection to phase changes in compressed sensing? How does superposition relate to non-robust features? An interesting paper by Gabriel Goh (archive.org backup) explores features in a linear model in terms of the principal components of the data. It focuses on a trade off between \\"usefulness\\" and \\"robustness\\" in the principal component features, but it seems like one could also relate it to the interpretability of features. How much would this perspective change if one believed the superposition hypothesis – could it be that the useful, non-robust features are an artifact of superposition? To what extent can neural networks \\"do useful computation\\" on features in superposition? Is the absolute value problem representative of computation in superposition generally, or idiosyncratic? What class of computation is amenable to being performed in superposition? Does it require a sparse structure to the computation? How does superposition change if features are not independent? Can superposition pack features more efficiently if they are anti-correlated? Can models effectively use nonlinear representations? We suspect models will tend not to use them, but further experimentation could provide good evidence. See the appendix on nonlinear compression. For example investigating the representations used by autoencoders with multi-layer encoders and decoders with really small bottlenecks on random uncorrelated data. Related Work INTERPRETABLE FEATURES Our work is inspired by research exploring the features that naturally occur in neural networks. Many models form at least some interpretable features. Word embeddings have semantic directions (see [11] ). There is evidence of interpretable neurons in RNNs (e.g. [14, 15] ), convolutional neural networks (see generally e.g. [16, 17, 46, 22] ; individual neuron families [9, 21] ), and in some limited cases, transformer language models (see detailed discussion in our previous paper). However this work has also found many \\"polysemantic\\" neurons which are not interpretable as a single concept [8] . SUPERPOSITION The earliest reference to superposition in artificial neural networks that we're aware of is Arora et al.'s work [1] , who suggest that the word embeddings of words with multiple different word senses may be superpositions of the vectors for the distinct meanings. Arora extend this idea there to there being many sparse \\"atoms of discourse\\" in superposition, an idea which was generalized to other kinds of embeddings vectors and explored in more detail by Goh [2] . In parallel with this, investigations of individual neurons in models with privileged bases were beginning to grapple with \\"polysemantic\\" neurons which respond to unrelated inputs [8] . A natural hypothesis was that these polysemantic neurons are disambiguated by the combined activation of other neurons. This line of thinking eventually became the \\"superposition hypothesis\\" for circuits [3] . Separate from all of this, Cheung et al. [10] explore a slightly different idea one might describe as \\"model level\\" superposition: can neural network parameters represent multiple completely independent models? Their investigation is motivated by catastrophic forgetting, but seems quite related to the questions investigated in this paper. Model level superposition can be seen as feature level superposition for highly correlated sets of features, similar to the \\"almost orthogonal bases\\" experiment we considered above. DISENTANGLEMENT The goal of learning disentangled representations arises from Bengio et al.'s influential position paper on representation learning [7] : \\"we would like our representations to disentangle the factors of variation… to learn representations that separate the various explanatory sources.\\" Since then, a literature has developed motivated by this goal, tending to focus on creating generative models which separate out major factors of variation in their latent spaces. This research touches on questions related to superposition, but is also quite different in a number of ways. Concretely, disentanglement research often explores whether one can train a VAE or GAN where basis dimensions correspond to the major features one might use to describe the problem (e.g. rotation, lighting, gender… as relevant). Early work often focused on semi-supervised approaches where the features were known in advance, but fully unsupervised approaches started to develop around 2016 [47, 48, 49] . Put another way, the goal of disentanglement might be described as imposing a strong privileged basis on representations which are rotationally invariant by default. This helps get at ways in which the questions of polysemanticity and superposition are a bit different from disentanglement. Consider that when we deal with neurons, rather than embeddings, we have a privileged basis by default. It varies by model, but many neurons just cleanly respond to features. This means that polysemanticity arises as a kind of anomalous behavior, and superposition arises as a hypothesis for explaining it. The question then isn't how to impose a privileged basis, but how to remove superposition as a fundamental problem to accessing features. Of course, if the superposition hypothesis is true, there are still a number of connections to disentanglement. On the one hand, it seems likely superposition occurs in the latent spaces of generative models, even though that isn't an area we've investigated. If so, it may be that superposition is a major reason why disentanglement is difficult. Superposition may allow generative models to be much more effective than they would otherwise be without. Put another way, disentanglement often assumes a small number of important latent variables to explain the data. There are clearly examples of such variables, like the orientation of objects – but what if a large number of sparse, rare, individually unimportant features are collectively very important? Superposition would be the natural way for models to represent this. 22 On the other hand, one could imagine ideas from the disentanglement literature being useful in creating architectures that resist superposition by creating an even more strongly privileged basis. COMPRESSED SENSING The toy problems we consider are quite similar to the problems considered in the field of compressed sensing, which is also known as compressive sensing and sparse recovery. However, there are some important differences: Compressed sensing recovers vectors by solving an optimization problem using general techniques, while our toy model must use a neural network layer. Compressed sensing algorithms are, in principle, much more powerful than our toy model. Compressed sensing works using the number of non-zero entries as the measure of sparsity, while we use the probability that each dimension is zero as the sparsity. These are not wholly unrelated: concentration of measure implies that our vectors have a bounded number of non-zero entries with high probability. Compressed sensing requires that the embedding matrix (usually called the measurement matrix) have a certain “incoherent” structure [50] such as the restricted isometry property [27] or nullspace property [51] . Our toy model learns the embedding matrix, and will often simply ignore many input dimensions to make others easier to recover. Features in our toy model have different \\"importances\\", which means the model will often prefer to be able to recover “important” features more accurately, at the cost of not being able to recover “less important” features at all. In general, our toy model is solving a similar problem using less powerful methods than compressed sensing algorithms, especially because the computational model is so much more restricted (to just a single linear transformation and a non-linearity) compared to the arbitrary computation that might be used by a compressed sensing algorithm. As a result, compressed sensing lower bounds—which give lower bounds on the dimension of the embedding such that recovery is still possible—can be interpreted as giving an upper bound on the amount of superposition in our toy model. In particular, in various compressed sensing settings, one can recover an � n-dimensional � k-sparse vector from an � m dimensional projection if and only if � = Ω ( � log ( � / � ) ) m=Ω(klog(n/k)) [52, 53, 54] . While the connection is not entirely straightforward, we apply one such result to the toy model in the appendix. At first, this bound appears to allow a number of features that is exponential in � m to be packed into the � m-dimensional embedding space. However, in our setting, the integer � k for which all vectors have at most � k non-zero entries is determined by the fixed density parameter � S as � = � ( ( 1 − � ) � ) k=O((1−S)n). As a result, our bound is actually � = Ω ( − � ( 1 − � ) log ( 1 − � ) ) m=Ω(−n(1−S)log(1−S)). Therefore, the number of features is linear in � m but modulated by the sparsity. 23 This is good news if we are hoping to eliminate superposition as a phenomenon! However, these bounds also allow for the amount of superposition to increase dramatically with sparsity – hopefully this is an artifact of the techniques in the proofs and not an inherent barrier to reducing or eliminating superposition. A striking parallel between our toy model and compressed sensing is the existence of phase changes. 24 In compressed sensing, if one considers a two-dimensional space defined by the sparsity and dimensionality of the vectors, there are sharp phase changes where the vector can almost surely be recovered in one regime and almost surely not in the other [55, 56] . It isn't immediately obvious how to connect these phase changes in compressed sensing – which apply to recovery of the entire vector, rather than one particular component – to the phase changes we observe in features and neurons. But the parallel is suspicious. Another interesting line of work has tried to build useful sparse recovery algorithms using neural networks [57, 58, 59] . While we find it useful for analysis purposes to view the toy model as a sparse recovery algorithm, so that we may apply sparse recovery lower bounds, we do not expect that the toy model is useful for the problem of sparse recovery. However, there may be an exciting opportunity to relate our understanding of the phenomenon of superposition to these and other techniques. SPARSE CODING AND DICTIONARY LEARNING Sparse Coding studies the problem of finding a sparse representation of dense data. One can think of it as being like compressed sensing, except the matrix projecting sparse vectors into the lower dimensional space is also unknown. This topic goes by many different names including sparse coding (most common in neuroscience), dictionary learning (in computer science), and sparse frame design (in mathematics). For a general introduction, we refer readers to a textbook by Michael Elad [60] . Classic sparse coding algorithms take an expectation-maximization approach (this includes Olshausen et al's early work [26] , the MOD algorithm [61] , and the k-SVD algorithm [62] ). More recently, new methods based on gradient descent and autoencoders have begun building on these ideas [63, 64] . From our perspective, sparse coding is interesting because it's probably the most natural mathematical formulation of trying to \\"solve superposition\\" by discovering which directions correspond to features. 25 But can we actually use these methods to solve superposition in practice? Previous work has attempted to use sparse coding to find sparse structure [1, 2] . More recently, research by Sharkey et al [65] following up on the original publication of this paper has had preliminary success in extracting features out of superposition in toy models using a sparse autoencoder. In general, we're only in the very preliminary investigations of using sparse coding and dictionary learning in this way, but the situation seems quite optimistic. See the section Approach 2: Finding an Overcomplete Basis for more discussion. THEORIES OF NEURAL CODING AND REPRESENTATION Our work explores representations in artificial “neurons”. Neuroscientists study similar questions in biological neurons. There are a variety of theories for how information could be encoded by a group of neurons. At one extreme is a local code, in which every individual stimulus is represented by a separate neuron. At the other extreme is a maximally-dense distributed code, in which the information-theoretic capacity of the population is fully utilized, and every neuron in the population plays a necessary role in representing every input. One challenge in comparing our work with the neuroscience literature is that a “distributed representation” seems to mean different things. Consider an overly-simplified example of a population of neurons, each taking a binary value of active or inactive, and a stimulus set of sixteen items: four shapes, with four colors (example borrowed from [6] ). A “local code” would be one with a “red triangle” neuron, a “red square” neuron, and so on. In what sense could the representation be made more “distributed”? One sense is by representing independent features separately — e.g. four “shape” neurons and four “color” neurons. A second sense is by representing more items than neurons — i.e. using a binary code over four neurons to encode 2^4 = 16 stimuli. In our framework, these senses correspond to decomposability (representing stimuli as compositions of independent features) and superposition (representing more features than neurons, at cost of interference if features co-occur). Decomposability doesn’t necessarily mean each feature gets its own neuron. Instead, it could be that each feature corresponds to a “direction in activation-space” 26 , given scalar “activations” (which in biological neurons would be firing rate). Then, only if there is a privileged basis, “feature neurons” are incentivized to develop. In biological neurons, metabolic considerations are often hypothesized to induce a privileged basis, and thus a “sparse code”. This would be expected if the nervous system’s energy expenditure increases linearly or sublinearly with firing rate. 27 Additionally, neurons are the units by which biological neural networks can implement non-linear transformations, so if a feature needs to be non-linearly transformed, a “feature neuron” is a good way to achieve that. Any decomposable linear code that uses orthogonal feature vectors is functionally equivalent from the viewpoint of a linear readout. So, a code can both be “maximally distributed” — in the sense that every neuron participates in representing every input, making each neuron extremely polysemantic — and also have no more features than it has dimensions. In this conception, it’s clear that a code can be fully “distributed” and also have no superposition. A notable difference between our work, and the neuroscience literature we have encountered, is that we consider as a central concept the likelihood that features co-occur with some probability. 28 A “maximally-dense distributed code” makes the most sense in the case where items never co-occur; if the network only needs to represent one item at a time, it can tolerate a very extreme degree of superposition. By contrast, a network that could plausibly need to represent all the items at once can do so without interference between the items if it uses a code with no superposition. One example of high feature co-occurrence could be encoding spatial frequency in a receptive field; these visual neurons need to be able to represent white noise, which has energy at all frequencies. An example of limited co-occurrence could be a motor “reach” task to discrete targets, far enough apart that only one can be reached at a time. One hypothesis in neuroscience is that highly compressed representations might have an important use in long-range communication between brain areas [68] . Under this theory, sparse representations are used within a brain area to do computation, and then are compressed for transmission across a small number of axons. Our experiments with the absolute value toy model shows that networks can do useful computation even under a code with a moderate degree of superposition. This suggests that all neural codes, not just those used for efficient communication, could plausibly be “compressed” to some degree; the regional code might not necessarily need to be decompressed to a fully sparse one. It's worth noting that the term \\"distributed representation\\" is also used in deep learning, and has the same ambiguities of meaning there. Our sense is that some influential early works (e.g. [7] ) may have primarily meant the \\"independent features are represented independently\\" decomposability sense, but we believe that other work intends to suggest something similar to what we call superposition. ADDITIONAL CONNECTIONS After publishing the original version of this paper, a number of readers generously brought to our attention additional connections to prior work. We don't have a sufficiently deep understanding of this work to offer a detailed review, but we offer a brief overview below: Vector Symbolic Architectures and Hyperdimensional Computing (see reviews [69, 70] ) are models from theoretical neuroscience of how neural systems can manipulate symbols. Many of the core ideas of how quasi-orthogonal vectors and the \\"blessings of dimensionality\\" enable computation are closely related to our notions of superposition. Frames (see review [71] ) are a generalization of the idea of a mathematical basis. The way superposition encodes features in lower dimensional spaces might be seen as frames, at least in some cases. In particular, the \\"Mercedes-Benz Frame\\" is equivalent to the triangular geometry superposition we sometimes observe. Although we discuss compressed sensing and sparse coding above, it's worth noting that this only scratches the surface of research on how sparse vectors can be encoded in lower dimensional dense vectors, and there's a large body of additional work not captured by these topics. Comments & Replications Inspired by the original Circuits Thread and Distill's Discussion Article experiment, the authors invited several external researchers who we had previously discussed our preliminary results with to comment on this work. Their comments are included below. REPLICATION & FORTHCOMING PAPER Kshitij Sachan is a research intern at Redwood Research. Redwood Research has been working on toy models of polysemanticity, inspired by Anthropic's work. We plan to separately publish our results, and during our research we replicated many of the experiments in this paper. Specifically, we replicated all plots in the Demonstrating Superposition and Superposition as a Phase Change sections (visualizations of the relu models with different sparsities and the phase diagrams) as well as the plot in The Geometry of Superposition – Uniform Superposition. We found the phase diagrams look quite different depending on the activation function, suggesting that in this toy model some activation functions induce more polysemanticity than others. Original Authors' Response: Redwood's further analysis of the superposition phase change significantly advanced our own understanding of the issue – we're very excited for their analysis to be shared with the world. We also appreciate the independent replication of our basic results. Update: The research by Redwood mentioned in the previous comment, Polysemanticity and Capacity in Neural Networks (Alignment Forum, Arxiv) is out! They study a slightly different toy model, and get some really interesting results. Highlights include analytical traction on understanding a variant of the toy model, understanding superposition in terms of constrained optimization, and analysis of the role different activation functions play. REPLICATION & FURTHER RESULTS Tom McGrath is a research scientist at DeepMind. The results in this paper are an important contribution - they really further our theoretical understanding of a phenomenon that may be central to interpretability research and understanding network representations more generally. It’s surprising that such simple settings can produce these rich phenomena. We’ve reproduced the experiments in the Demonstrating Superposition and Superposition as a Phase Change sections and have a minor additional result to contribute. It is possible to exactly solve the expected loss for the � = 2 n=2, � = 1 m=1 case of the basic ReLU output toy model (ignoring bias terms). The derivation is mathematically simple but somewhat long-winded: the ‘tricks’ are to (1) represent the sparse portion of the input distribution with delta functions, and (2) replace the ReLu with a restriction of the domain of integration: ∫ � ReLU ( � ( � ) ) � � = ∫ � ∩ � ( � ) > 0 � ( � ) � � ∫ D ​ ReLU(f(x))dx=∫ D∩f(x)>0 ​ f(x)dx Making this substitution renders the integral analytically tractable, which allows us to plot the full loss surface and solve for the loss minima directly. We show some example loss surfaces below: Although many of these loss surfaces (Figure 1a, 1b) have minima qualitatively similar to one of the network weights used in the section Superposition as a Phase Change, we also find a new phase where � 1 ≃ � 2 ≃ 1 2 W 1 ​ ≃W 2 ​ ≃ 2 ​ 1 ​ : weights are similar rather than antipodal. This ‘confused feature’ regime occurs when sparsity is low and both features are important (Figure 1c). (This is slightly similar to the behavior described in The Geometry of Superposition – Collapsing of Correlated Features, but occurs without the features being correlated!) Further, although the solutions we find are often qualitatively similar to the weights used in Superposition as a Phase Change, they can be quantitatively different, as Figure 1a shows. The transition from Figure 1a to Figure 1b is continuous: the minima moves smoothly in weight space as the degree of sparsity alters. This explains the ‘blurry’ region around the triple point in the phase diagram. As Figure 1c shows, some combinations of sparsity and relative feature importance lead to loss surfaces with two minima (once the symmetry ( � 1 , � 2 ) → ( − � 1 , − � 2 ) (W 1 ​ ,W 2 ​ )→(−W 1 ​ ,−W 2 ​ ) has been accounted for). If this pattern holds for larger values of � n and � m (and we see no reason why it would not) this could account for the Discrete \\"Energy Level\\" Jumps phenomenon as solutions hop between minima. In some cases (e.g. when parameters approach those needed for a phase transition) the global minimum can have a considerably smaller basin of attraction than local minima. The transition between the antipodal and confused-feature solutions appears to be discontinuous. Original Authors' Response: This closed form analysis of the � = 2 , � = 1 n=2,m=1 case is fascinating. We hadn't realized that � 1 ≃ � 2 ≃ 1 2 W 1 ​ ≃W 2 ​ ≃ 2 ​ 1 ​ could be a solution without correlated features! The clarification of the \\"blurry behavior\\" and the observation about local minima are also very interesting. More generally, we're very grateful for the independent replication of our core results. REPLICATION Jeffrey Wu and Dan Mossing are members of the Alignment team at OpenAI. We are very excited about these toy models of polysemanticity. This work sits at a rare intersection of being plausibly very important for training more interpretable models and being very simple and elegant. The results have been surprisingly easy to replicate -- we have reproduced (with very little fuss) plots similar to those in the Demonstrating Superposition – Basic Results, Geometry – Feature Dimensionality, and Learning Dynamics – Discrete \\"Energy Level\\" Jumps sections. Original Authors' Response: We really appreciate this replication of our basic results. Some of our findings were quite surprising to us, and this gives us more confidence that they aren't the result of an idiosyncratic quirk or bug in our implementations. REPLICATION Spencer Becker-Kahn is a senior research scholar at the Future of Humanity Institute and a SERI Machine Learning Alignment Theory Scholar. After seeing preliminary results, I independently replicated some of the key graphs from Demonstrating Superposition – Basic Results and, using very small toy models, produced a series of plots consistent with the conceptual picture emerging in Geometry – Feature Dimensionality and Superposition and Learning Dynamics.

He was previously a Research Fellow at the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics. Evan Hubinger is a Research Fellow at MIRI. Nicholas Schiefer is a member of the technical staff at Anthropic and an author of the original paper. Inspired by the results in this paper and the previous paper introducing the SoLU activation, we have been investigating whether changes to the model architecture or training process can reduce superposition in toy models. After replicating several of these results independently, we made the following extensions in that direction: A modified toy model that tries to more accurately represent the non-toy case where sparse features are projected down into a non-sparse input to the model with fewer dimensions. A “many neuron” architecture that gives the model enough capacity to avoid polysemanticity entirely. A training and initialization method that actually makes these toy models monosemantic. A systematic exploration of the polysemantic neurons that tend to appear in these models, which guided our explorations of the training methods. At least in some limits, this suggests there may not be a price to be paid for monosemanticity. Detailed results can be found in our paper, Engineering Monosemanticity in Toy Models (Alignment Forum, ArXiV). FRACTIONAL DIMENSIONALITY AND \\"PRESSURE\\" Tom Henighan and Chris Olah are authors of the original paper. In the \\"Feature Dimensionality\\" section, we found that features organized into clean polytopes when there are more features than can be easily represented in the embedding dimensions. We briefly investigated this further and found that the number of features competing to be represented significantly influences this phenomenon. Cleaner structure often seems to emerge when there is more \\"pressure\\" – more features competing to be represented. This is especially true at high sparsity levels. Additionally, training longer seems to also produce cleaner structure. More investigation would be needed to really understand this phenomenon. REPLICATION Marius Hobbhahn is a PhD student at the University of Tuebingen. I replicated the “Basic Results” in Section 2 (“Demonstrating Superposition”) and all of Section 7 (“Superposition in a Privileged Basis”) of the “Toy Models of Superposition” paper. All of my findings are identical to the ones described in the paper. I replicated most findings in the follow-up “Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent” paper. The details of my replication can be found in my write-up “More Findings on Memorization and Double Descent”. EXTRACTING FEATURES WITH SPARSE AUTOENCODERS Lee Sharkey, Dan Braun, and Beren Millidge are researchers at Conjecture. The results from this paper, and the strategic picture it paints, inspired our preliminary follow-up work that aimed to address some of the challenges described in the section titled 'Approach 2: Finding an overcomplete basis'. Before studying the activations of real neural networks, where we're not sure what the 'ground truth' features are, we studied a toy example. We generated a set of toy ground truth features and created a dataset using sparse combinations of them. We found that a one-layer sparse autoencoder with an � 1 L 1 ​ penalty on its hidden activations learned features that were almost identical to the ground truth features. This is encouraging because it indicates that a relatively simple method should be able to recover the features used by neural networks, inasmuch as they have them. For the toy dataset, we knew how many ground truth features there were. But we ultimately want to count the features used by real neural networks, where the number of features is unknown. We explored three ways to count the features in the toy dataset: a) Counting dead neurons in the autoencoders; b) looking at autoencoder losses; and c) comparing the features learned by autoencoders of different sizes. We found indications that these methods might be suitable to count the number of features in superposition in real neural data. We also applied our method to real activations from a small language model. Our initial, preliminary investigations led to inconclusive results, possibly resulting from having used autoencoders that were either too small or undertrained. At the time of writing, investigations are ongoing. LINEAR REPRESENTATION IN OTHELLO Neel Nanda is an external researcher in mechanistic interpretability. This is a description of his blog post, Actually, Othello-GPT Has A Linear Emergent World Representation. I describe a natural experiment of the linear representation hypothesis described in this paper -- the idea that features correspond to directions in neural networks. Background: Martin Wattenberg (an author on this paper) and colleagues recently found that, if you train transformer language model trained to predict the next token in synthetic Othello games (where each move is a randomly chosen legal move), it forms an emergent model of the board state (despite only being trained to predict the next move!). They showed that the state of the board (whether each cell was empty, black or white) could be recovered with high accuracy by a one hidden layer MLP probe. They further showed that you could use the world model to causally intervene on the model’s residual stream. By choosing another board state, and changing the residual stream (with gradient descent) such that the probe indicates that new board state, they caused the model to output legal moves in the new board state, even if the edited board state was impossible to reach via legal Othello play! Pre-Registered Hypothesis: The probing and causal intervention together provided strong evidence that the model had learned to represent features corresponding to the state of each square on the board. Yet, notably, linear probes were not able to recover the board state. Since linear features should be recoverable with a one-layer probe, and the causal intervention suggests the model both computes and uses the board state, this seemed like significant evidence against the linear representation hypothesis. However, Chris Olah (an author on this paper) argued the model might still be representing features linearly if it used a different set of features, and that the probe and causal intervention may be picking up on this different set of features. This created an informal pre-registered prediction of the hypothesis which was contrary to the evidence at the time. Results: I independently came to the same conclusion as Chris and investigated the Othello playing model. I found that the model does form an emergent model of the board state that is linearly represented and can be extracted with a linear probe. But that as the model plays both black and white moves, the model represents the state of a cell as whether it has “my colour” vs “opponent’s colour”. Further, I found circumstantial evidence that these features are used by the model, as we can linearly intervene on the residual stream using the directions given by the probe to edit the represented board state, and the model plays legal moves in the new board state. I consider these results to be notable, as the paper’s results provided evidence against the linear representation hypothesis and the hypothesis faced genuine risk of falsification. And the hypothesis made non-trivial predictions that were contrary to where the evidence pointed, but these turned out to be true. This is both a proof of concept that there are underlying principles of neural networks which have predictive power about models, and a natural experiment supporting the linear representation hypothesis. I think that there is further work interpreting the Othello playing model that could test other hypotheses in this paper and our broader conceptual frameworks about neural networks and transformers, such as by looking for monosemantic vs superposed neurons in its MLP layers. The model is both complex enough to be interesting and expose principles of how transformers learn algorithms, yet the algorithmic nature of the task and existence of the probe suggests that finding circuits will be tractable. I elaborate on what I consider promising directions of future work in a follow-up post. LEVERAGE SCORE AND FEATURE DIMENSIONALITY Fred Zhang is a PhD student in the Theory Group of the EECS Department at UC Berkeley. In the Geometry of Superposition section, the paper defines a notion of feature dimensionality, � � = ∣ ∣ � � ∣ ∣ 2 ∑ � ( � � ^ ⋅ � � ) 2 , D i ​ = ∑ j ​ ( W i ​ ^ ​ ⋅W j ​ ) 2 ∣∣W i ​ ∣∣ 2 ​ , where � � W i ​ is the � ith feature and � � ^ = � � / ∥ � � ∥ 2 W i ​ ^ ​ =W i ​ /∥W i ​ ∥ 2 ​ is its normalized version. For simplicity of notation, we assume that there are � n features, each being a � d-dimensional real vector. Following this definition, the paper makes the remark that \\"Empirically, it seems that the dimensionality of all features add up to the number of embedding dimensions when the features are 'packed efficiently' in some sense.\\" In this comment, I point out a natural, theoretical explanation of this observation. The argument is via the notion of leverage score in matrix approximation. I’ll define it first, then explain how it connects to feature dimensionality. At a conceptual level, leverage score is a measure of the importance of a row in composing the row space of a matrix. For instance, if a row is orthogonal to all other rows, its leverage score is 1, meaning that it’s maximally important. This is natural, since removing it would decrease the rank of the matrix and completely change the row space. Formally, if � W be a � n by � d matrices (think of it as tall and thin, so � > � n>d), then the leverage score of � ith row � � W i ​ is � � = max � : ∥ � ∥ 2 = 1 ⟨ � � , � ⟩ 2 ∑ � = 1 � ⟨ � � , � ⟩ 2 . τ i ​ = x:∥x∥ 2 ​ =1 max ​ ∑ j=1 n ​ ⟨W j ​ ,x⟩ 2 ⟨W i ​ ,x⟩ 2 ​ . Notice that the denominator term equals ∥ � � ∥ 2 2 ∥Wx∥ 2 2 ​ . Hence, the leverage score of � � W i ​ is the maximum contribution ⟨ � � , � ⟩ 2 ⟨W i ​ ,x⟩ 2 can make towards ∣ ∣ � � ∣ ∣ 2 ∣∣Wx∣∣ 2 (over all possible directions � x). This is a fractional number between 0 and 1. Also observe that this indeed has the nice property that if � � W i ​ is orthogonal to all other rows, � � τ i ​ equals 1, because all except the � ith term within the summation of the denominator is 0. Three quick remarks on this definition: It coincides with the notion of maximal data dimensionality in a comment by Chris Olah on Data Dimensionality of MNIST in the follow-up work of Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent. There are other equivalent definitions of leverage score; see section 3.3 of here. Leverage score arises in numerical linear algebra. It is well-known that sampling rows proportional to their leverage score yields an almost square matrix that approximates the original, potentially very tall matrix. For a formal statement, see Theorem 17 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4357. Returning to my main point, another nice fact about leverage score is they sum up to the rank of the matrix. In the tall and thin case above, they sum up to d (if the matrix is full-rank). Given that, it is natural this paper makes the empirical observation that the sum of � � D i ​ roughly equals the embedding dimension � d, if the vectors are \\"efficiently packed\\". Specifically, one formal way of stating that they are packed efficiently is that they are roughly in isotropic position, that is, the variance ⟨ � � , � ⟩ 2 ⟨W j ​ ,x⟩ 2 along any direction � x is close to 1 1. In other words, the covariance structure of the embedding vectors is close to identity. (Geometrically, it means they are well spread out. This would be the case, for example, if the vectors form regular simplex, just as it happens in the experiments of this paper.) Then in the above definition of leverage score, each summand within the denominator is 1 for any � x. So to maximize the numerator, we just take � x to be � � W i ​ itself---and this precisely recovers the definition of feature dimensionality � � D i ​ . Thus, in this well-spread-out case, these two notions are roughly the same, and they both sum up to � d. Code We provide a notebook to reproduce some of the core diagrams in this article here. (It isn't comprehensive, since we needed to rewrite code for our experiments to run outside our codebase.) We provide a separate notebook for the theoretical phase change diagrams. Note that the reproductions by other researchers mentioned in comments above were not based on this code, but are instead fully independent replications with clean code from the description in an early draft of this article.

Author Contributions Basic Results - The basic toy model results demonstrating the existence of superposition were done by Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah. Chris suggested the toy model and Nelson ran the experiments. Phase Change - Chris Olah ran the empirical phase change experiments, with help from Nelson Elhage. Martin Wattenberg introduced the theoretical model where exact losses for specific weight configurations can be computed. Geometry - The uniform superposition geometry results were discovered by Nelson Elhage and Nicholas Schiefer, with help from Chris Olah. Nelson discovered the original � / ∣ ∣ � ∣ ∣ � 2 m/∣∣W∣∣ F 2 ​ mysterious \\"stickiness\\". Chris introduced the definition of feature dimensionality. Nicholas and Nelson then investigated the polytopes that formed. As for non-uniform superposition, Martin Wattenberg performed the initial investigations of the resulting geometry, focusing on the behavior of correlated features. Chris extended this with an investigation of the role of relative feature importance and sparsity. Learning Dynamics - Nelson Elhage discovered the \\"energy level jump\\" phenomenon, in collaboration with Nicholas Schiefer and Chris Olah. Martin Wattenberg discovered the \\"geometric transformations\\" phenomenon. Adversarial Examples - Chris Olah and Catherine Olsson found evidence of a connection between superposition and adversarial examples. Superposition with a Privileged Basis / Doing Computation - Chris Olah did the basic investigation of superposition in a privileged basis. Nelson Elhage, with help from Chris, investigated the \\"absolute value\\" model which provided a more principled demonstration of superposition and showed that computation could be done while in superposition. Nelson discovered the \\"asymmetric superposition\\" motif. Theory - The theoretical picture articulated over the course of this paper (especially in the \\"mathematical understanding\\" section) was developed in conversations between all authors, but especially Chris Olah, Jared Kaplan, Martin Wattenberg, Nelson Elhage, Tristan Hume, Tom Henighan, Catherine Olsson, Nicholas Schiefer, Dawn Drain, Shauna Kravec, Roger Grosse, Robert Lasenby, and Sam McCandlish. Jared introduced the strategy of rewriting the loss by grouping terms with the number of active features. Both Jared and Martin independently noticed the value of investigating the � = 2 ; � = 1 n=2;m=1 case as the simplest case to understand. Nicholas and Dawn clarified our understanding of the connection to compressed sensing. Strategic Picture - The strategic picture articulated in this paper – What does superposition mean for interpretability and safety? What would a suitable solution be? How might one solve it? – developed in extensive conversations between authors, and in particular Chris Olah, Tristan Hume, Nelson Elhage, Dario Amodei, Jared Kaplan. Nelson Elhage recognized the potential importance of \\"enumerative safety\\", further articulated by Dario. Tristan brainstormed extensively about ways one might solve superposition and pushed Chris on this topic. Writing - The paper was primarily drafted by Chris Olah, with some sections by Nelson Elhage, Tristan Hume, Martin Wattenberg, and Catherine Olsson. All authors contributed to editing, with particularly significant contributions from Zac Hatfield Dodds, Robert Lasenby, Kipply Chen, and Roger Grosse. Illustration - The paper was primarily illustrated by Chris Olah, with help from Tristan Hume, Nelson Elhage, and Catherine Olsson.

In language models, researchers have found word embedding directions such as a male-female or singular-plural direction [11] , low-level neurons disambiguating words that occur in multiple languages, much more abstract neurons, and \\"action\\" output neurons that help produce certain words [4] .[↩] This definition is trickier than it seems. Specifically, something is a feature if there exists a large enough model size such that it gets a dedicated neuron. This create a kind \\"epsilon-delta\\" like definition. Our present understanding – as we'll see in later sections – is that arbitrarily large models can still have a large fraction of their features be in superposition. However, for any given feature, assuming the feature importance curve isn't flat, it should eventually be given a dedicated neuron. This definition can be helpful in saying that something is a feature – curve detectors are a feature because you find them in across a range of models larger than some minimal size – but unhelpful for the much more common case of features we only hypothesize about or observe in superposition.[↩] A famous book by Lakatos [25] illustrates the importance of uncertainty about definitions and how important rethinking definitions often is in the context of research. [↩] This experiment setup could also be viewed as an autoencoder reconstructing � x.[↩] A vision model of sufficient generality might benefit from representing every species of plant and animal and every manufactured object which it might potentially see. A language model might benefit from representing each person who has ever been mentioned in writing. These are only scratching the surface of plausible features, but already there seem more than any model has neurons. In fact, large language models demonstrably do in fact know about people of very modest prominence – presumably more such people than they have neurons. This point is a common argument in discussion of the plausibility of \\"grandmother neurons'' in neuroscience, but seems even stronger for artificial neural networks.[↩] For computational reasons, we won't focus on it in this article, but we often imagine an infinite number of features with importance asymptotically approaching zero.[↩] The choice to have features distributed uniformly is arbitrary. An exponential or power law distribution would also be very natural.[↩] Recall that � � = � − 1 W T =W −1 if � W is orthonormal. Although � W can't be literally orthonormal, our intuition from compressed sensing is that it will be \\"almost orthonormal\\" in the sense of Candes & Tao [27] .[↩] We have the model be � ′ = � � � � x ′ =W T Wx, but leave � x Gaussianaly distributed as in Saxe.[↩] As a brief aside, it's interesting to contrast the linear model interference, ∑ � ≠ � ∣ � � ⋅ � � ∣ 2 ∑ i≠j ​ ∣W i ​ ⋅W J ​ ∣ 2 , to the notion of coherence in compressed sensing, max � ≠ � ∣ � � ⋅ � � ∣ max i≠j ​ ∣W i ​ ⋅W J ​ ∣. We can see them as the � 2 L 2 and � ∞ L ∞ norms of the same vector.[↩] To prove that superposition is never optimal in a linear model, solve for the gradient of the loss being zero or consult Saxe et al.[↩] Here, we use “phase change” in the generalized sense of “discontinuous change”, rather than in the more technical sense of a discontinuity arising in the limit of infinite system size.[↩] Scaling the importance of all features by the same amount simply scales the loss, and does not change the optimal solutions.[↩] Note that there's a degree of freedom for the model in learning � 1 W 1 ​ : We can rescale any hidden unit by scaling its row of � 1 W 1 ​ by � α, and its column of � 2 W 2 ​ by � − 1 α −1 , and arrive at the same model. For consistency in the visualization, we rescale each hidden unit before visualizing so that the largest-magnitude weight to that neuron from � 1 W 1 ​ has magnitude 1 1.[↩] These specific values were chosen to illustrate the phenomenon we're interested in: the absolute value model learns more easily when there are more neurons, but we wanted to keep the numbers small enough that it could be easily visualized.[↩] One question you might ask is whether we can quantify the ability of superposition to enable extra computation by examining the loss. Unfortunately, we can't easily do this. Superposition occurs when we change the task, making it sparser. As a result, the losses of models with different amounts of superposition are not comparable – they're measuring the loss on different tasks![↩] Ultimately we want to say that a model doesn't implement some class of behaviors. Enumerating over all features makes it easy to say a feature doesn't exist (e.g. \\"there is no 'deceptive behavior' feature\\") but that isn't quite what we want. We expect models that need to represent the world to represent unsavory behaviors. But it may be possible to build more subtle claims such as \\"all 'deceptive behavior' features do not participate in circuits X, Y and Z.\\"[↩] Superposition also makes it harder to find interpretable directions in a model without a privileged basis. Without superposition, one could try to do something like the Gram–Schmidt process, progressively identifying interpretable directions and then removing them to make future features easier to identify. But with superposition, one can't simply remove a direction even if one knows that it is a feature direction.[↩] More formally, given a matrix � ∼ [ � , � ] = [ ℎ 0 , ℎ 1 , … ] H∼[d,m] = [h 0 ​ ,h 1 ​ ,…] of hidden layer activations ℎ ∼ [ � ] h∼[m] sampled over � d stimuli, if we believe there are � n underlying features, we can try to find matrices � ∼ [ � , � ] A∼[d,n] and � ∼ [ � , � ] B∼[n,m] such that � A is sparse.[↩] In particular, it seems like we should expect to be able to reduce superposition at least a little bit with essentially no effect on performance, just by doing something like L1 regularization without any architectural changes. Note that models should have a level of superposition where the derivative of loss with respect to the amount of superposition is zero – otherwise, they'd use more or less superposition. As a result, there should be at least some margin within which we can reduce the amount of superposition without affecting model performance.[↩] A more subtle issue is that GANs and VAEs often assume that their latent space is Gaussianly distributed. Sparse latent variables are very non-Gaussian, but the central limit theorem means that the superposition of many such variables will gradually look more Gaussian. So the latent spaces of some generative models may in fact force models to use superposition![↩] Note that this has a nice information-theoretic interpretation: log ( 1 − � ) log(1−S) is the surprisal of a given dimension being non-zero, and is multiplied by the expected number of non-zeros.[↩] Note that in the compressed sensing case, the phase transition is in the limit as the number of dimensions becomes large - for finite-dimensional spaces, the transition is fast but not discontinuous.[↩] Interestingly, this is the reverse of how sparse coding is typically thought of in neuroscience. Neuroscience often thinks of biological neurons as sparse coding their inputs, whereas we're interested in applying it the opposite direction, to find features in superposition over neurons.[↩] We haven’t encountered a specific term in the distributed coding literature that corresponds to this hypothesis specifically, although the idea of a “direction in activation-space” is common in the literature, which may be due to ignorance on our part. We call this hypothesis linearity.[↩] Experimental evidence seems to support this [66] [↩] A related, but different, concept in the neuroscience literature is the “binding problem” [67] in which e.g. a red triangle is a co-occurrence of exactly one shape and exactly one color, which is not a representational challenge, but a binding problem arises if a decomposed code needs to represent simultaneously also a blue square — which shape feature goes with which color feature? Our work does not engage with the binding question, merely treating this as a co-occurrence of “blue”, “red”, “triangle”, and “square”.

Nonlinear Compression This paper focuses on the assumption that representations are linear. But what if models don’t use linear feature directions to represent information? What might such a thing concretely look like? Neural networks have nonlinearities that make it theoretically possible to compress information even more compactly than a linear superposition. There are reasons we think models are unlikely to pervasively use nonlinear compression schemes: The model needs to decompress things before it can compute with them naturally: Most of the computation in the model is linear, so this kind of compression is likely only worth it to save space in the residual stream across many layers before being decompressed to be computed with linearly again. They’re probably difficult to learn: Nonlinear compression schemes may require finely tuned approximations of discontinuities, and for the compression and decompression to line up, and may be difficult for gradient descent to learn. They probably take enough neurons that the benefit over superposition isn’t worth it: Representing the piecewise linear functions in the simple example with ReLU neurons using the universal function approximation result that each line segment takes two neurons, would require 12 neurons per Z segment, so only starts to beat linear compression at a combined 36 neurons for the compression and decompression. This comparison has only one hidden dimension and dense features, which is somewhat of a degenerate case for superposition. Superposition is much more powerful for compression of sparse features in many dimensions. We suspect in large models the scaling is in favor of superposition, although this is just intuition and it’s possible that scaling nonlinear compression is competitive. Regardless of whether large models end up using nonlinear compression, it should be possible to view directions being used with nonlinear compression as linear feature directions and reverse engineer the computation being used for compression like any other circuit. If this kind of encoding is pervasive throughout the network then it may merit some kind of automated decoding. It shouldn’t pose a fundamental challenge to interpretability unless the model learns a scheme for doing complex computation while staying in a complicated nonlinear representation, which we suspect is unlikely. To help provide intuition, the simplest example of what a nonlinear compression scheme might look like is compressing two [0,1) dimensions � x and � y into a single [0,1) dimension � t: � = ⌊ � � ⌋ + � � t= Z ⌊Zx⌋+y ​ This works by quantizing the � x dimension using some integer � Z such that the floating point precision of � t is split between � x and � y. This particular function needs the discontinuous floor function to compute, and the discontinuous fmod function to invert, but models can’t compute discontinuous functions. However it’s possible to replace the discontinuities with steep linear segments that are only some epsilon value wide. We can compare the mean squared error loss on random uniform dense values of � x and � y and see that even with epsilons as large as 0 . 1 0.1 and � Z values as small as 3 the nonlinear compression outperforms linear compression such as picking one of the dimensions or using the average: Connection between compressed sensing lower bounds and the toy model Here, we formalize the relationship between a compressed sensing lower bound and the toy model. Let � ( � ) : � � → � � T(x):R n →R n be the complete toy model autoencoder defined by � ( � ) = R e L U ( � 2 � 1 � − � ) T(x)=ReLU(W 2 ​ W 1 ​ x−b) for an � × � m×n matrix � 1 W 1 ​ and an � × � n×m matrix � 2 W 2 ​ . We derive the following theorem: Theorem 1. Suppose that the toy model recovers all � x with � ( � ) T(x) such that ∥ � ( � ) − � ∥ 2 ≤ � ∥T(x)−x∥ 2 ​ ≤ε for sufficiently small � ε and � 1 W 1 ​ has the ( � , � ) (δ,k) restricted isometry property. The inner dimension of the projection matrix � W is � = Ω ( � � � � ( � / � ) ) m=Ω(klog(n/k)). We prove this result by framing our toy model as a compressed sensing algorithm. The primary barrier to doing so is that our optimization only searches for vectors that are close in ℓ 2 ℓ 2 ​ distance to the original vector and may not itself be exactly � k-sparse. The following lemma resolves this concern through a denoising step: Lemma 1. Suppose that we have a toy model � ( � ) T(x) with the properties in Theorem 1. Then there exists a compressed sensing algorithm � ( � ) : � � → � � f(y):R m →R n for the measurement matrix � 1 W 1 ​ . Proof. We construct � ( � ) f(y) as follows. First, compute � ~ = R e L U ( � 2 � − � ) x ~ =ReLU(W 2 ​ y−b), as in � ( � ) T(x). This produces the vector � ~ = � ( � ) x ~ =T(x) and so by supposition ∥ � ( � ) − � ∥ 2 ≤ � ∥T(x)−x∥ 2 ​ ≤ε. Next, we threshold � ~ x ~ to obtain � ~ ′ x ~ ′ by dropping all but its � k largest entries. Lastly, we solve the optimization problem: min � ′ ∥ � ′ − � ~ ′ ∥ min x ′ ​ ∥x ′ − x ~ ′ ∥ subject to � 1 � ′ = � W 1 ​ x ′ =y, which is convex because � ′ x ′ and � ~ ′ x ~ ′ have the same support. For sufficiently small � ε (specifically, � ε smaller than the ( � + 1 ) (k+1)th largest entry in � x), both � ~ x ~ and the nearest � k-sparse vector to � x have the same support, and so the the convex optimization problem has a unique solution: the nearest � k sparse vector to � x. Therefore, � f is a compressed sensing algorithm for � 1 W 1 ​ with approximation factor 1. . Lastly, we use the deterministic compressed sensing lower bound of Do Ba, Indyk, Price, and Woodruff [54] : Theorem 2 (Corollary 3.1 in [54] ). Given a matrix with the restricted isometry property, a sparse recovery algorithm find a -sparse approximation of from such that for an approximation factor . If , then a sparse recovery algorithm exists only if . Theorem 1 follows directly from Lemma 1 and Theorem 2.","completion":"The paper \\"Toy Models of Superposition\\" by researchers at Anthropic discusses the concept of superposition in artificial neural networks, particularly focusing on how neural network models can represent and compute with a larger number of features than they have dimensions. Here's a summary in 50 bullet points: 1. Superposition allows neural networks to compress and represent more features than their dimensional capacity. 2. The study uses toy ReLU networks and synthetic data to explore superposition. 3. Superposition allows compression beyond linear models with nonlinear filtering. 4. With dense features, networks represent a basis of the most important features. 5. Sparsity changes this, allowing models to store additional features in superposition. 6. The paper demonstrates that models can perform computation while in superposition. 7. They hypothesize that trained neural networks simulate larger, sparse networks. 8. Feature superposition is not a new idea but is closely related to compressed sensing and neuroscientific concepts. 9. The main contribution of the paper is showing superposition's direct occurrence in neural networks. 10. The researchers provide a theory of superposition's existence and reveal a phase diagram for it. 11. They discover that superposition exhibits complex geometric structures. 12. The study suggests models undergo phase changes regarding superposition during training. 13. It links superposition to adversarial examples, proposing that superposition may contribute to models' vulnerability. 14. They consider superposition in models with a privileged basis, like transformer MLP layers. 15. The paper explores whether neural networks can compute functions in superposition, using absolute value as a case study. 16. Results show that superposition may be governed by a phase change, similar to other phase transitions seen in physics. 17. They find that superposition organizes features into geometric structures such as polytopes. 18. Uniform superposition in the paper corresponds to the features arranging themselves into uniform polytopes. 19. Non-uniform superposition shows deformation of polytopes due to variation in feature importance and sparsity. 20. During training, models exhibit discrete \\"energy level\\" jumps among feature dimensionalities. 21. Learning dynamics also involve geometric transformations, moving through different polytope configurations. 22. Superposition is potentially related to adversarial robustness, possibly increasing models' vulnerability to attacks. 23. The study includes consideration of superposition within a privileged basis, affecting how features align with neurons. 24. They look into whether computation can be performed within a superposed space and find evidence it can. 25. Strategic discussions in the paper consider the implications of superposition for interpretability and safety. 26. The authors propose solutions to \\"solving\\" superposition for creating safer and more interpretable models. 27. They highlight superposition as a roadblock to enumerating features for safety guarantees. 28. The paper outlines three strategies for dealing with superposition: creating models without it, finding an overcomplete basis, and hybrid approaches. 29. They note that solving superposition is necessary for many interpretability properties, like decomposing activation space and understanding model weights. 30. The study acknowledges the possibility of developing models without superposition and the potential performance cost. 31. The paper addresses the challenge of identifying overcomplete bases in models with superposition. 32. The authors discuss the potential to create models without superposition using techniques like sparsity regularization. 33. Results indicate monosemantic neurons do exist in certain regimes, suggesting the possibility of interpretable models. 34. The study shows that models can use superposition to perform computations even when neurons encode multiple features. 35. The research describes learning dynamics where features transition smoothly between configurations over training. 36. Superposition is linked to adversarial robustness, where models' vulnerability aligns with the number of features per dimension. 37. The authors explore superposition in models with privileged bases, leading to features aligning with neurons. 38. Feature geometric structures emerge during training, corresponding to solutions seen in the Thomson problem in chemistry. 39. Superposition's role in models with non-privileged bases does not affect learning, enabling studies on how features are encoded. 40. Models perform computation in superposition, suggesting that neural networks can simulate more complex networks. 41. The paper touches on various related work, showing connections to neuroscience theories and compressed sensing. 42. Comments and replications by independent researchers support the findings and expand on them. 43. The study's toy models and insights are replicated and extended by researchers from institutions like Redwood Research and DeepMind. 44. The paper's authors acknowledge support and feedback from colleagues and the broader research community. 45. They mention the importance of verifying and expanding these findings to improve the interpretability of neural networks and AI safety. 46. The paper includes an extensive list of references for readers interested in further exploring the topics discussed. 47. Additional comments indicate that various activation functions can induce different levels of polysemanticity in models. 48. The paper posits a connection between superposition and increased energy level jumps during model training. 49. Researchers from different organizations confirm the paper's core results and observe related phenomena. 50.

Это столетие неуклонного научного и технического порыва вперёд, выразившееся в основополагающих открытиях в физике, химии, математике, астрономии и медицине, находило своё животворящее начало в реформах Петра Великого. Эти реформы стимулировали не только технический прогресс, но и пробудили интеллектуальный потенциал в философии и социальных науках.

Борис Николаевич Чичерин был выдающимся русским философом, политическим деятелем и дипломатом. Он внес значительный вклад в развитие философии собственности и свободы, представляя реалистическую и практическую точку зрения на эти вопросы. Концепция собственности Чичерина основывается на его трактовке социальной роли собственности и неразрывной связи с индивидуальными свободами. Он считал, что собственность является неотъемлемым правом каждого человека на владение и контроль над средствами производства, которые нужны ему для удовлетворения своих потребностей. Собственность является основой экономической системы и создает стимулы для развития и инноваций. Однако, Чичерин был критически настроен к концепции неограниченной собственности, которая может привести к эксплуатации и неравенству. Он подчеркивал важность баланса между индивидуальной собственностью и общественным благом. Это означает, что собственность не должна препятствовать осуществлению других людей и необходимо учитывать интересы общества в целом. Свобода, согласно Чичерину, тесно связана с собственностью. Он считал, что свободы человека должны быть защищены и гарантированы, чтобы каждый индивидуум мог совершать свободный выбор и развивать свой потенциал. Однако, Чичерин был противником абсолютной свободы, которая может привести к хаосу и анархии. Он придерживался идеи ограничения свободы законом и нравственными нормами для обеспечения устойчивого социального порядка. По мнению Чичерина, общество должно создать условия, в которых собственность и свобода могут сосуществовать в гармонии. Это возможно через социальные и экономические реформы, которые обеспечат равные возможности для всех членов общества. При этом права и обязанности должны быть ясно определены и защищены законом. Концепция собственности и свободы философии Чичерина Б.Н актуальна и по сей день. Ее ценность заключается в том, что она признает права и свободы индивидуума, но также подчеркивает необходимость учета интересов общества и создания справедливых условий для всех. Концепция Чичерина служит основой для разработки эффективной и сбалансированной политики в сфере собственности и свободы."},{"prompt":"еще информации","completion":"Кроме концепции собственности и свободы, Чичерин также занимался исследованием других философских и политических вопросов. Он был сторонником реализма в философии и придерживался мнения о необходимости практического и полезного знания. Он также разрабатывал свою концепцию политической этики, в которой подчеркивал важность нравственности и справедливости в политических решениях. Чичерин выступал за идею правового государства и институтов, которые бы обеспечивали защиту прав и свобод граждан. Он считал, что правительство должно быть ограничено законом и отвечать перед обществом за свои действия. Он также активно выступал за международное сотрудничество и дипломатическую деятельность, считая их важными средствами решения конфликтов и поддержания мира. Важной особенностью философии Чичерина было его стремление к практическим применениям философских идей. Он считал, что философия должна быть в полной мере связана с реальным миром и проблемами людей, и ее задача – предоставить практические рекомендации и решения для улучшения жизненных условий и общественного благосостояния.

Анархизм представляет собой идеологию, которая отрицает необходимость государственной власти и стремится к достижению общества без государственного контроля. Два основоположника анархической мысли - Михаил Бакунин и Пётр Кропоткин - разработали свои концепции на основе анархистских идей. Михаил Бакунин, известный русский революционер и философ, считается одним из первых анархистов. Он разработал концепцию анархо-коллективизма, основанную на идее равенства и принципе коллективного владения. Бакунин пропагандировал уничтожение существующего государственного аппарата и его замену на местное и индивидуальное самоуправление. Он считал, что анархистское общество должно быть организовано на основе принципа свободного сотрудничества, где ни одна группа не будет подчиняться другой. Бакунин призывал к революционному насилию и утверждал, что это единственный способ достичь анархического общества. Другим выдающимся представителем анархизма является Пётр Кропоткин. Он разработал концепцию анархо-коммунизма, которая подразумевает создание общества, основанного на принципе свободного доступа к материальным и духовным благам. Кропоткин считал, что анархистское общество должно быть организовано на основе кооперации и взаимопомощи, а не на конкуренции и эксплуатации. Он пропагандировал создание анархистских коллективов, где каждый получает то, что ему нужно, и вносит свой вклад в общее благо. Кропоткин также понимал важность образования и воспитания в анархистском обществе и активно деятельностей в данной области. Оба философа видели анархистское общество как идеал, основанный на свободе, равенстве и справедливости. Они оба критиковали государственный аппарат, бюрократию и эксплуатацию рабочего класса. Бакунин и Кропоткин призывали к непослушанию и противостоянию государственным властям с целью создания нового общественного порядка, основанного на свободе и равноправии всех людей. В заключение, Бакунин и Кропоткин - два важных мыслителя анархизма, которые внесли значительный вклад в развитие этой идеологии. Их концепции анархического общества основаны на принципах равенства, свободы и солидарности. Они разработали свои уникальные подходы к организации анархистского общества и активно пропагандировали свои идеи во время своей деятельности.

DO NOT DO ANYTHING YET, THIS TEXT IS JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION [PART 1] Russia has an extensive history of imperialism and colonial expansion. The aftermath of the Soviet Union collapse led to the Russian Federation becoming the primary beneficiary, inheriting most of the territory notably Moscow, which, according to Panayi, was the central control point of the USSR (2020). As various states gained their independence in the process, post-colonialism emerged as a prevalent issue. Consequently, with the globalization and dissemination of Western ideas the problem of race-based power dynamics in modern Russia received public attention. Before delving into discussions on racism, it is imperative to establish a clear definition. For the purposes of this discussion, racism is construed as a form of discrimination against individuals based on their race, typically involving a contrived hierarchy of races. This discrimination encompasses criminalization, everyday social and political pressure, verbal and physical abuse. Logically, it is equally important to establish the definition of race. In the context of this essay, race is construed as a social concept that is used to differentiate people into groups based on a collection of phenotypical traits, such as skin color and facial features. Racial hierarchy, then, denotes an ordering of races in a social structure that elevates some while oppressing others. The topic of racism towards certain groups in contemporary Russia is a pressing matter. Particularly for migrant workers from Central Asia, who, According to the research of Kuznetsova and Round, grapple with racism as a daily struggle (2018). Researchers claim that the issue extends beyond interactions with citizens, to include encounters with the state institutions and the police. In other words, on top of the constant unpleasant interactions with locals, the victims of racism constantly fear the persecution from the law enforcement agencies based on their appearance and origin. This highlights not only the relevance of the problem, but also deeply ingrained racism in the Russian culture and society to the point that it almost becomes constitutionalized. They argue that this indicates Russia’s “deeply rooted imperial views”, a critical statement that will drive the ensuing discussion. What distinguishes the Russia’s case is that the racism manifests in Russian views less so as a feeling of superiority and more so as a fear of the “other” (Shnirelman, 2008). The enduring legacy of colonialism in Russia has shaped the development of racism, as the perceived threat to the rights and freedoms of white Russians is rooted in the post-Soviet collapse, where racist notions of \\"Russianness\\" emerged as a response and substitute for the lost Soviet identity, exacerbated by general lack of education on the topic and economic dependencies of post-colonial states leading to an influx of migrants. This perpetuation of racism in contemporary Russia is further fueled by political instability and the perceived powerlessness of the population following the collapse of the empire. [PART 2] As a solution to the existing national disunity, the Soviet Union attempted to unite the diverse group of people of different races and nationalities through creation of the new “Soviet Identity”. Ideally, people would identify themselves first as “Soviet” and second as part of some other group. As Zakharov puts it: “Class could be changed, class conscience could be overcome, and nationalities would die out, but partiynost’ [Sovietness] was the human essence that could not be imposed from the outside”. In other words, unlike other identifiers such as class or nationality, the Sovietness of a person was something intrinsic and unchangeable. This, however, did not lead to the disappearance of the aforementioned other identifiers such as race; instead, the Sovietness acted as a veil that served to draw the public attention away from them. Contrary to the prevailing belief that the Soviet Union was a raceless society, the idea of “race” did indeed exist within its ideological framework, albeit was not studied extensively. According to Zakharov’s insights, the issue of race was relegated to the periphery of academic discourse, being deemed “of marginal significance” by the scholars of the time (2015). Consequently, This marginalization reached official institutions, where race was not even officially recognized as a classification category for the diverse population of Russia. Effectively, the understanding of race within the Soviet Union was confined mainly to social scientists which represented only a small fraction of the population. This resulted in collective unawareness of racism. Interestingly, this situation contradicts the prevalent anti-fascist propaganda of the time. In spite of the demonization of fascism, “racism was paradoxically not presented as a social problem in public discourse” (Zakharov, 2015). It was not necessarily the case that racism did not exist during the times; rather, it was conspicuously absent from public conversations. This neglect of the topic in scientific research perpetuated an educational gap in USSR. To this day, race-related topics in schools of post-Soviet space is taught on a rudimentary level while racism often remains entirely omitted. Zakharov's quoted interview vividly illustrates this unawareness, recounting incidents where individuals could engage in racially motivated physical violence without recognizing the racism inherent in their behavior (2015). This further illustrates the unawareness of racism of the general public. In essence, it wasn't that Soviet society was devoid of racial considerations or that racism didn't exist within its borders; rather, the public lacked the means and educational framework to identify and comprehend the issue, leading to a collective obliviousness. [PART 3] This collective avoidance of the concept of race was not exclusive to the educational realm, but also permeated the political landscape. According to Hirsch’s analysis, the notion of race did exist in the Soviet Union, however as opposed to Nazis, USSR did not practice racial politics; rather it was more focused on the politics of nationality (2002). This is where it is needed to draw a clear distinction between nationality politics of the Soviet regime and racial politics of the Nazis. Unlike Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union “did not brand particular nationalities as biological inferiors or degenerate races” (Hirsch, 2002). The goal of the nationality politics was not to pose a group of people as the superior nor it was to use nationality as a sole justification for genocide. Instead, the state persecuted people of nationalities that “could not be \\"re-invented\\" as Soviet nations” (Hirsch, 2002). Here, Hirsch explains the core idea of the practices of ethnic cleansing performed in USSR: to develop the Soviet identity and to hinder the growth of national consciousness that was seen as the driving force of Nazi Germany. This means that even though on the surface level it may seem that the outcomes of both were similar, the message that these politics conveyed differed drastically. The racial explicitly targets groups because they are lesser and inferior, while the national targets people because they are a threat to the status quo, without any implication of a hierarchy. This is supported by Panayi who labels these measures as “acts of persecution against those perceived as treacherous…” (2020). This further highlights the motive of protection against traitors behind the national politics. The distinction is crucial, therefore, to understand how this policies affected the views of the people of modern Russia. The practices of the Soviet regime translated to the views of “other” nations and their consciousnesses as a threat to the Russian population. [PART 4] Despite all of the efforts, the Soviet Union eventually collapsed. The carefully crafted and curated Soviet identity followed the USSR and ceased to exist. As a result, the post-Soviet space had to face a large-scale identity shift to replace the missing Sovietness. The consequent “search for new identifications” is regarded as one of the main facilitators of the racialization processes in the Russian Federation (Zakharov, 2015). Even though it is evident that the Soviet Union attempted to dissolve the common identifiers such as nationality, ultimately the territory of the former Soviet state was divided into nation-states. Even though from one side nationalism became the solution for the tough times of the unfolding identity crisis, on the other one it turned into the main driving force of the perpetuation of racism inside Russia. In these circumstances, nationalism in the weakened nation-state began to transform from a progressive force into a reactionary one, filled with the spirit of xenophobia and racism (Shnirelman, 2008). Shnirelman calls this phenomenon a “postcolonial syndrome”. One of the symptoms of this syndrome is the rise in popularity of the racist movements such as skinheads. Membership of skinhead racist gangs in Russia is estimated to be half of the total skinhead movement worldwide (Zakharov, 2015). #finish the paragraph about the racism in common population In Russia, migrants are viewed as a threat to so-called ethnodemographic balance. In the eyes of the society of Russia, the image of migrants is inextricably linked with “strangers” or “foreigners”, despite the fact that in actuality a significant portion of the migrants are ethnic Russians (Shnirelman, 2008). In other words, the prejudice is aimed not to the temporary workers specifically, but to the representatives of other nations and cultures that come to Russia in their search for jobs. However, when asked about the reasons behind such views, people commonly reply with answer related to the collective and not the individual (Shnirelman, 2008). This may be one of the legacies of the collectivistic Soviet identity that was carried out to the contemporary Russia. Surprisingly, the idea that non-Russians are a threat is not only a notion that is popular among common folk; it is a prevalent idea in the federal state too. According to Shnirelman, the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma argues that migrants threaten to dilute Russia’s ethnodemographic portrait (that presumably must have a dominant ethnic Russian population) (2008). It is important to note that the deputy describes the mass migrations as “migration deluge”, “army of barbarians”, “aggression of the alien South,” and “aggression against the White man”. These descriptions demonstrate the racial prejudice aimed at the non-whites. As the racialization became more widespread in the public views, the idea permeated both horizontally and vertically, affecting all parts of the state. Another concern floating in Russian society about representatives of other races, i.e. people who do not look Russian, is the public safety. Fear of persecution is one of the main manifestations of racism that immediately affects migrant workers (Kuznetsova and Round, 2018). In their research, Kuznetsova and Round discusses laws that on paper “seem a natural response to a chaotic migration regime” in reality illustrates the “racist nature of the Russian state” (2018). The state attempts to further marginalize already politically vulnerable migrants through administrative laws. Although it may seem that there is no racialization and targets of the laws are not determined by law, the prejudice and this “racist nature” just moves further to the executive state representatives, the police. In her paper *“Instrumentalising racism in Russian policing: everyday interactions between police officers and migrants”*, Khodzhaeva describes the degree of racizalization in the police. According to the researcher, twice a year Central Office of the Ministry of Interior in Moscow undertakes special campaigns during which “each member of the guard service and local police must register one violation of migration legislation per day” (Khodzhaeva, 2023). So, police routinely is required to find migrants that are breaking the law and police workers are essentially tasked to target certain group of people. The main method used by them is ethnic profiling: they categorize people based on their phenotype and those who have features of foreigners are the ones being targeted (Khodzhaeva, 2023). This ethnic profiling is in line with the established definition of racism. As a result, the people who are supposed to protect the population also use racism as a tool of differentiating of who deserves the protection and who deserves to be questioned. [PART 5] When discussing racism towards migrants we cannot focus solely on internal relations and it is imperative to take into account the economic situation in the post-Soviet space. The economic dependencies that formed after the collapse of the Soviet Union may have been the major contributing factor to influx of migrants as well as their dependence on the employers for work. As Kuznetsova and Round put it, the Central Asian countries are “forced into colonial (Soviet) style subservience through their dependence on the Russian economy” while for an individual it “translates into precarity, at best, as the employer knows that they, and their family, are dependent on them for work” (2018). #Add the interpretation of the quote and finish the paragraph [PART 6] # Write the conclusion","completion":"It appears you are constructing a multifaceted essay discussing the influences of the Soviet Union's legacy on the dynamics of racism in contemporary Russia.

Revised also means that any # comments should be resolved by you","completion":"[REVISED PART 4] Despite all efforts, the Soviet Union ultimately collapsed, and with it, the reinforced and protected Soviet identity disintegrated. Consequently, the post-Soviet space faced a challenging period of identity transformation as it strove to fill the void left by the absence of Soviet identification. This “search for new identifications” has been identified by Zakharov as a key catalyst in the racialization processes that unfold in the Russian Federation (2015). Although the Soviet Union sought to eradicate common identifiers such as nationality, the aftermath saw a division of the former Soviet territory into distinct nation-states. While nationalism served as a grounding force during the tumultuous times of identity crisis, it simultaneously became the fermenting ground for xenophobia and racism within Russia. Shnirelman characterizes this development as a “postcolonial syndrome,” with one of its symptoms being the surge of racist movements, including skinheads. Remarkably, it is estimated that the number of skinheads in Russia comprises about half of the skinhead movement's global presence (Zakharov, 2015). This alarming statistic underlines the prevalence of racist attitudes among the general population. In Russia, migrants are commonly perceived as a threat to the so-called ethnodemographic balance. Society tends to view the image of migrants synonymously with \\"strangers\\" or \\"foreigners,\\" even though a significant number of migrants are ethnically Russian (Shnirelman, 2008). Consequently, the prejudice extends not specifically to temporary workers, but toward individuals from different nations and cultures seeking employment in Russia. Interestingly, these xenophobic attitudes often stem from collective concerns rather than individual biases, an echo of the collective Soviet identity now manifesting in modern Russia. What is startling is that the notion of non-Russians as dangerous infiltrators is not confined to the public sphere; it finds resonance within the state's highest echelons. Shnirelman highlights that a Deputy Chairman of the State Duma framed migrants in terms that evoke racial prejudice, using language that suggests a threat to a predominantly ethnic Russian population (2008). As racialization became more entrenched in public sentiment, the idea gradually permeated all strata of the state apparatus, both horizontally and vertically. This widespread concern extends to fears surrounding public safety, with racism often influencing the treatment of migrant workers. Kuznetsova and Round reveal that while administrative laws ostensibly aim to manage a chaotic migration regime, they inadvertently reveal a \\"racist nature of the Russian state\\" (2018). The enforcement of these laws, then, passes the prejudicial baton to the police, who are often tasked with targeting certain ethnic groups. Khodzhaeva's research illustrates this point by focusing on the systematic targeting of migrants by law enforcement in her paper, \\"Instrumentalising Racism in Russian Policing: Everyday Interactions Between Police Officers and Migrants\\" (2023). She notes that regular campaigns require officers to record violations of migration legislation, which in practice leads to racial profiling based on phenotype, determined by an individual's physical appearance. This method of ethnic profiling dovetails with previously established definitions of racism, cementing a disturbing reality: the very people meant to protect are complicit in the perpetuation of prejudiced practices."},{"prompt":"Please send me the revised version of this paragraph.

The prevalence of skinhead gangs in Russia is significant, with estimates suggesting that their membership may account for as much as half of the total global skinhead population (Zakharov, 2015). This growth in racist subcultures is indicative of deeper societal issues, as racism finds its way into the fabric of everyday life for the common population. The normalization of such ideologies, which were once considered fringe, reflects a broader acceptance or tolerance of racist attitudes and behaviors in society. The rise of these movements not only threatens the safety and well-being of minority communities but also challenges the cohesion and moral fiber of the nation as a whole."},{"prompt":"Please send me the revised version of this paragraph.

This perspective is perhaps a legacy of the collectivistic Soviet identity that has persisted into contemporary Russia. The belief that non-Russians pose a threat extends beyond the general populace and finds a voice within the federal government as well. The Deputy Chairman of the State Duma has been cited by Shnirelman as suggesting that migrants could undermine Russia’s ethnodemographic composition, which is assumed to be predominantly ethnic Russian (2008). Notably, this official has employed phrases such as \\"migration deluge,\\" \\"army of barbarians,\\" \\"aggression of the alien South,\\" and \\"aggression against the White man\\" to describe these migratory patterns.

Public safety fears are a symptom of racism, profoundly impacting migrant workers who are already subject to the threat of persecution (Kuznetsova and Round, 2018). Kuznetsova and Round expose laws that, though ostensibly designed as logical solutions to manage a chaotic migration system, in practice, betray the \\"racist nature of the Russian state\\" (2018). These administrative laws serve to further isolate migrants, who are already a politically vulnerable group. Despite appearances of neutrality, these laws do not specify racial targets; nonetheless, the implementation of these laws betrays underlying prejudice. This \\"racist nature\\" then extends to those tasked with law enforcement—namely, the police. Khodzhaeva, in her paper “Instrumentalising Racism in Russian Policing: Everyday Interactions Between Police Officers and Migrants,” expounds on the extent of racialization within the police force. She reports that the Central Office of the Ministry of Interior in Moscow periodically initiates campaigns that compel each member of the guard service and local police to document one instance of migration legislation violation daily (Khodzhaeva, 2023). Consequently, police officers are effectively mandated to seek out migrants disobeying the law, which results in the deliberate targeting of this demographic. The principal tactic they employ is ethnic profiling, categorizing individuals based on phenotype; thus, those with foreign features are singled out (Khodzhaeva, 2023). This practice of ethnic profiling aligns with established definitions of racism, leading to the troubling conclusion that law enforcement, who are entrusted with safeguarding all citizens, resort to using racism as a criterion for determining who receives their protection and who is subjected to scrutiny."},{"prompt":"Please send me the revised version of this paragraph.

Kuznetsova and Round articulate that the Central Asian countries have been \\"forced into colonial (Soviet) style subservience due to their dependence on the Russian economy,\\" leading to socioeconomic vulnerability (2018). For the individual migrant, this means living in a state of precariousness, as employers are well aware of the economic reliance that workers and their families have on the job provided. This economic leverage contributes to a power imbalance wherein employers can exploit migrant workers, knowing that these individuals have limited alternatives. Such a situation can perpetuate systemic inequalities and foster conditions where racism and discriminatory practices become normalized under the guise of economic pragmatism. In this way, the legacy of Soviet-style economic dominion continues to cast a long shadow, perpetuating a cycle of dependence and vulnerability that affects migrants on both collective and individual levels, sowing the seeds for racial discrimination and social stratification within the Russian Federation."},{"prompt":"Please send me the revised version of this paragraph.

The ideological constructs and policies of the past have left profound marks on Russian society, influencing how race and ethnicity are construed and outworking in discriminatory practices against migrants and ethnic minorities. The deeply rooted \\"imperial views\\" discussed earlier signal a complex interplay of historical, social, and economic factors that contribute to persisting racial tensions. The transition from Soviet to post-Soviet identity has been fraught with challenges, not least of which is the emergence of a new form of nationalism that often manifests in xenophobia and racism. This \\"postcolonial syndrome,\\" signified by a rise in racist movements and an inclination towards ethnically prejudiced policies, underscores a troubling trend that counters the Soviet-era narrative of unity and egalitarianism. As post-Soviet Russia continues to grapple with its identity and economic reality, the influences of past imperialism manifest in current social dynamics, with racism being a visible and pervasive byproduct. Economic dependencies and power structures that evolved in the Soviet period have translated into a precarious existence for many migrants, exacerbating vulnerabilities and reinforcing the cycle of discrimination. The ongoing challenge for Russia is to address this complex web of issues, educate its populace on racial matters, and foster an environment of inclusivity that moves beyond the shadows of its colonial legacy.

Although ethnic minorities residing within Russia are not the focus of this present discussion, their experiences with racism—shaped by the same legacy—are nonetheless significant and warrant attention.

Before I can provide the personal information you require, I hope you would permit me a precursory verification of the procedure and of your identity – perhaps we could arrange a phone call or teleconference? In these times, one cannot be too careful, especially when engaging in transactions online. I am sure you can appreciate that. Furthermore, could you clarify the process of the lottery system a little more? For example, how are the winning numbers kept confidential within your system? And what measures are put in place to ensure the winning ticket isn’t duplicated or the information misused?

In the meantime, I stand by, ready to provide the assistance you’ve requested and to participate in the National Lottery as discussed.

With transparency and trust being our coveted game pieces, I would like to ensure that every move we make bolsters our burgeoning alliance. That being said, I cannot in good conscience provide my details without a more concrete authentication of our arrangement and the security protocols that will safeguard our potential transactions. Therefore, I warmly invite you to engage in a mutually confirmative act. Since your documentation provided a substantial gesture, I ask you to now illuminate the more technical aspects of our venture, so that we are both poised to act as trusted partners. Could you please elaborate on the transaction mechanisms? We should establish a secure and verifiable method to handle sensitive exchanges, possibly choosing a recognized digital escrow service that can mediate until the critical pieces of our game are in check and all the rules are clearly laid out on the board.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"What does the research suggest if any about the best parameter values for LLM generation (temperature, top-k, top-p, typical-p, repetition penalty... etc)","completion":"Research on language model generation parameters, such as temperature, top-k, top-p (nucleus sampling), typical-p, and repetition penalty, suggests that the best values for these parameters can greatly depend on the specific task, the model in question, and the desired output characteristics. These parameters control the randomness and diversity of the generated text, and tuning them properly can balance creativity with coherence. Below is a non-exhaustive overview of what these parameters do and some research-informed guidance on how to set them: 1. **Temperature**: This parameter controls the randomness in the prediction distribution. A temperature close to 0 makes the model deterministic, favoring the most likely predictions, while higher temperatures lead to more randomness and diversity. Research shows that a moderate temperature (usually around 0.7) often yields the best balance between randomness and coherence for creative applications, but for more deterministic tasks, lower temperatures may be more appropriate. 2. **Top-k Sampling**: Limits the sampling pool to the k most likely next tokens. Setting a lower value for k can focus the generation and avoid unlikely tokens, but may also limit creativity. A higher value of k introduces more diversity but risks decreased coherence. Optimal values of k depend on the task; for creative writing, a larger k might be better, while for more constrained tasks like translation, a smaller k could suffice. 3. **Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)**: Instead of sampling from the k most likely tokens, top-p sampling chooses from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold p. This can dynamically adjust the number of tokens considered based on the model's confidence. Generally, a p value between 0.8 to 0.95 works well, encouraging a mix of predictability and creativity. 4. **Typical-p Sampling**: It's a variant of top-p that seeks to enhance generation quality by focusing on the 'typical set' or a set of tokens that are neither too probable nor too improbable. Research into this is less abundant, but it aims to produce more 'typical' completions than top-p. 5. **Repetition Penalty**: Increases the model's tendency to avoid repeating the same token or sequence of tokens that it has already generated. This can be important in longer text generation where avoiding redundancy is key. Values for the repetition penalty can be set above 1 (to penalize and discourage repetition), but the exact optimal setting will depend on the use case, as some repetition might be natural in certain contexts. It should be noted that optimal parameter settings may be model-specific. For example, GPT-3 could require different settings than a BERT-based model, and it would also depend on the domain or the type of text that's being generated (e.g., narrative prose, technical documentation, or conversational responses). In practice, the best way to determine the appropriate parameter values is to experiment and conduct ablation studies that measure the performance on relevant evaluation metrics, such as BLEU score for translation, perplexity for language modeling, or human evaluations for subjective quality. Additionally, the use of techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can help in fine-tuning the parameters based on real-world usability and preferences."},{"prompt":"When setting the typical-p parameter to something like 0.95, is it recommended to keep the temperature at 1 or is there no such thing?","completion":"The typical-p parameter controls the selection of words that have probabilities within a \\"typical\\" range during generation. When setting typical-p to a value like 0.95, it means you are allowing for a wider range of tokens to be considered, with the accumulated probability of these tokens being around 95%. The temperature parameter, on the other hand, adjusts the \\"sharpness\\" of the probability distribution. A temperature of 1 means the probabilities are used as-is from the model's output, preserving the original diversity intended by the model. A temperature higher than 1 will increase diversity even further but makes the predictions more random, while a temperature lower than 1 will make the output more deterministic. There is no hard and fast rule that mandates using a temperature of 1 with typical-p sampling. The combination of temperature and typical-p (or other sampling strategies) should be chosen based on what you want your language model to accomplish. Here are some considerations: - **Preserving Originality**: If you want to preserve the original distribution and diversity of the model while also ensuring that the tokens fall within a \\"typical\\" range of probabilities, using a temperature of 1 with typical-p sampling could be a good choice. - **Increasing Creativity**: If you're looking for more creative and diverse outputs, you might tweak the temperature upwards while also using typical-p to control the degree of randomness. - **Ensuring Determinism**: For tasks that require more precision and less variability, you might want to use a lower temperature, even with typical-p sampling, to focus the generation towards more likely outcomes. - **Balancing Diversity and Coherence**: Using a moderate temperature (e.g., around 0.7, as often recommended in some research) with typical-p can strike a balance between varied output and coherence. Ultimately, the best approach is to empirically test different settings to see what combination provides the best results for your specific application. This can be done through iterative experimentation, validation against a gold standard, or qualitative assessments if the application is more subjective (such as generating creative content). It’s not uncommon for the optimal settings to vary even within the same model or task, depending on nuances like the length of the generated text, the desired stylistic properties, or particular aspects of the prompt or context."},{"prompt":"2.) CONVERGENCE: A statistician argues that the statement “as n (n is a positive natural number) increases (to infinity) the distribution of the mean of a uniform distribution converges to a normal distribution” can be shown by following these steps in a computer program. Actually, the statistician knows the general fact that the distribution of the mean of “ANY” distribution converges to a normal distribution. He applies his knowledge to uniform distribution, in particular. i) Randomly select numbers from a uniform distribution, call this the first sample, calculate the mean and record its mean. ii) Select n+1 numbers from the same uniform distribution. This is the second sample. Calculate now the mean of the second sample and record it. iii) Now as you increase n further , collect both means and standard deviations of the collections of the means to that point. Now standardize each collected mean by Ui = (Xi − μi)/(σi /ni) where μi is the mean of the collection of means at iteration i and σi, ni are the standard deviation and the number of the observations at iteration i, respectively. iv) Also sample from a standard normal distribution with μ = 0, σ = 1 and calculate P(Z < z) using the standard normal distribution for the same number of iterations you used in i-iii) v) Calculate the the absolute value of the difference in cumulative distributions = ∣ P(Ui < ui) − P(Zi < zi) ∣ for each x. vi) draw “the absolute value of the difference” with number of iterations=n in x axis and ““the absolute value of the difference” in the y axis and show it approaches zero as you increase n to infinity.

In particular, the variation and random sampling from the uniform distribution can result in fluctuations in the absolute difference between the standardized means and the standard normal distribution. Additionally, as the number of iterations increases, the absolute difference may tend to fluctuate more due to the fact that the range of values for the means increases. This can lead to larger variations in the absolute difference between the standardized means and the standard normal distribution. Overall, while the code provided follows the steps outlined by the statistician, it may not be the most accurate or reliable way to prove the statement. The random nature of the samples and the resulting fluctuations in the convergence plot make it difficult to reach a clear and consistent conclusion. A more rigorous way to prove the statement would involve theoretical proofs and mathematical analysis. The Central Limit Theorem, for example, states that the distribution of the mean of independent and identically distributed random variables, regardless of the underlying distribution, converges to a normal distribution as the sample size increases.

Представь, что ты программист.","completion":"Если библиотеки, установленные с помощью \`pip\`, продолжают устанавливаться в глобальные библиотеки вместо виртуального окружения, возможно, у вас неправильно настроен \`PYTHONPATH\`. \`PYTHONPATH\` - это переменная среды, которая определяет, где Python ищет модули. При установке Python в Windows обычно автоматически настраивается, чтобы указывать на директорию, где установлен Python. Однако, в вашем случае, когда используется Anaconda, может возникнуть конфликт между установками \`pip\` и \`conda\`. Чтобы исправить эту проблему, вам следует проверить и, при необходимости, изменить \`PYTHONPATH\` для вашего виртуального окружения. 1. Активируйте ваше виртуальное окружение, выполнив команду: \`\`\` conda activate C:WorkAnaconda3envspy39 \`\`\` 2. После активации виртуального окружения выполните команду, чтобы отобразить текущие настройки \`PYTHONPATH\`: \`\`\` echo %PYTHONPATH% \`\`\` 3. Если вывод команды указывает на глобальную директорию, и не содержит вашу директорию виртуального окружения, то вам нужно изменить \`PYTHONPATH\`. Для этого выполните команду: \`\`\` set PYTHONPATH=<путь_к_директории_виртуального_окружения>Libsite-packages \`\`\` Замените \`<путь_к_директории_виртуального_окружения>\` на реальный путь к вашей директории виртуального окружения. 4.

Bij een warmtepomp onttrekt de verdamper warmte uit de buitenlucht. Welke manieren weet jij te verzinnen waarbij de energie uit de buitenlucht het snelste in de verdamper komt.","completion":"Er zijn verschillende manieren om de energie uit de buitenlucht zo snel mogelijk naar de verdamper te brengen. Enkele suggesties zijn: 1. Zorg voor een goede luchtcirculatie: Plaats de verdamper op een locatie waar een constante luchtbeweging heerst, bijvoorbeeld in de buurt van ventilatieroosters of ramen. Dit zal helpen om verse lucht naar de verdamper te brengen en de warmteoverdracht te versnellen. 2. Optimaliseer de luchtstroom: Gebruik ventilatoren om de luchtstroom bij de verdamper te vergroten. Dit kan helpen om een constante toevoer van buitenlucht te waarborgen en de warmteoverdracht te versnellen. 3. Verwijder obstakels: Zorg ervoor dat er geen obstakels zoals meubels, gordijnen of andere voorwerpen de luchtstroom rond de verdamper blokkeren. Het vrijhouden van de omgeving van de verdamper zal ervoor zorgen dat de warmte sneller naar de verdamper kan stromen. 4. Kies een geschikte locatie: Plaats de verdamper op een plek in de buitenlucht die goed wordt blootgesteld aan zonlicht. Warmte van de zon kan helpen om de temperatuur van de buitenlucht te verhogen, wat de efficiëntie van de warmtepomp kan verbeteren. 5. Isolatie: Zorg ervoor dat de verdamper goed geïsoleerd is. Dit helpt voorkomen dat warmte verloren gaat en zorgt ervoor dat de warmte uit de buitenlucht efficiënter naar de verdamper wordt overgebracht. Het implementeren van deze suggesties kan bijdragen aan het versnellen van de warmteoverdracht van de buitenlucht naar de verdamper van een warmtepomp. Het is echter belangrijk op te merken dat een goede installatie en dimensionering van de warmtepomp eveneens van cruciaal belang zijn voor een efficiënte werking."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Uh…has anyone seen Natsuki?” Yuri: “No, I haven’t.

Aqui estão alguns motivos pelos quais definir o \`id2label\` e \`label2id\` é útil: 1. **Interpretação dos Resultados:** Quando o modelo faz uma previsão, ele produz um índice numérico. Ter um mapeamento definido permite converter esses índices de volta para rótulos compreensíveis. 2. **Consistência:** Se o mapeamento entre os rótulos e os índices não for consistente, é possível que diferentes execuções do código ou treinamentos do modelo produzam mapeamentos diferentes, o que pode levar a confusão ao interpretar os resultados. 3. **Compatibilidade:** Ao compartilhar o modelo ou usá-lo em diferentes sistemas, ter o mapeamento de rótulos garante que outros usuários ou aplicativos possam entender corretamente as saídas do modelo. 4. **Depuração e Análise:** Durante a análise de erros e a tentativa de entender onde o modelo está se saindo bem ou mal, ter os rótulos reais é indispensável. 5. **Interface do Usuário:** Se o modelo for integrado a um aplicativo que os usuários interagem, os rótulos das classes servirão para fornecer feedback significativo. Para garantir que o mapeamento esteja disponível durante a inferência, você pode salvar o mapeamento junto com os artefatos do modelo (\`config.json\` e \`pytorch_model.bin\`) e carregar quando necessário. A biblioteca Hugging Face \`transformers\` facilita isso com métodos como \`save_pretrained()\` e \`from_pretrained()\`, que automaticamente lidam com a configuração.

Dying in Scandinavia sends the soul to Valhalla or Hel, but dying in Greece lands them in Hades, and so on. You have just died in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.","completion":"As the waves crashed mercilessly against my frail body, the realization that this was the end gradually settled in. I had perished in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean, engulfed by its sheer might. But what lay beyond the veil of death for a soul like me, lost in these treacherous waters? None of the known realms seemed to correspond to this unfortunate demise. As my consciousness faded with each passing moment, an ethereal light shone through the depths, accompanied by a serene voice that reverberated within me. \\"Fear not, weary soul, for your fate is not determined by land or lore alone,\\" it whispered, carrying a comforting presence that alleviated my unease. The celestial glow embraced me, weaving a transformative journey through time and space. Moments blurred into one another until my spirit arrived in an ethereal realm unlike any described by mortals. Here, suspended in an infinite expanse of calm waters, a tranquil island materialized before my eyes. The island, known as Palmyra in the realm of the lost, stood as a haven for those who had perished at sea. It was a sanctuary where countless souls found solace, their final resting place forever bathed in twilight's gentle embrace. Palmyra was far from a desolate expanse. Spirits, once adrift, now moved with grace and purpose, gathering in floating temples formed from translucent seashells. These ethereal extensions of humanity perpetuated camaraderie, trade, and celebration within the afterlife. As I strode across the shimmering sands, spectral beings wrapped in luminescent robes welcomed me warmly, recognizing my arrival as meaningful to their ethereal existence. They spoke of stories untold, of the countless voyagers who had tragically met their end in these very waters, now united in this ethereal paradise. Among the isle's ethereal inhabitants, whispers abounded, tales of sea battles and fateful explorations shared with fervor. Souls who traversed distant waters, brave navigators and humble fishermen alike, found themselves bound together in a spirit of brotherhood. Together, they now embraced the endless expanse of Palmyra, an eternal sanctuary that granted them solace, reflection, and unity. In this realm, dreams once abandoned could be rekindled, as the collective endeavors of the lost souls brought forth unparalleled feats of creativity and innovation. Artists painted ethereal seascapes, their canvases radiating vibrant colors unseen in the mortal realm. Musicians orchestrated melodies that resonated through the essence of Palmyra, evoking profound emotions within each soul lucky enough to listen. Through the smoldering sunsets and the golden dawns, time drifted like a wisp of smoke, transcending the confines of comprehension. The lost navigated rapturous depths, discovering hidden corners of their shared paradise. Palmyra was more than an escape; it was a vessel that carried their souls towards newfound purpose and understanding. And so, as I embraced my new existence amidst the infinite expanse of Palmyra, I marveled at the beauty that life after death could hold. The endless ocean could be both ruthless and generous, but more importantly, it could cradle the souls of the departed, providing them with solace, connection, and the eternal companionship they had thought lost forever."},{"prompt":"Écris une réponse suite à ce courriel. \\"Bonjour, Je fais le suivi.

In Python, subtraction cannot be directly performed between these two types. The error in the code stems from the fact that \`target_word\` is a string representing a word, and it cannot be directly used in mathematical operations with floats. To correct this, you'll need to convert \`target_word\` into a format that can be used in operations with floats. However, in the context of neural networks, this is usually done via some sort of encoding, such as one-hot encoding, where the \`target_word\` is represented as a vector of numbers. For this example code, it seems like the intention is to try to predict the next word using some form of neural network. You should encode both the \`target_word\` and the predicted word \`predicted_word\` as numerical vectors before performing operations like subtraction. However, there are conceptual issues with the code. Neural networks for word prediction generally require a word-to-index mapping and then use techniques like one-hot encoding to represent words. This can be quite complex to implement, and the code provided is not equipped to handle such complexities. Standard neural networks also use activation functions and gradients for weight updates, which are missing here. Therefore, you will need to fundamentally redesign the system if you want to implement a working neural network for word prediction. Below is a conceptual guide on addressing these issues: 1. Create a word-to-index mapping for all unique words in your sentences. 2. Use one-hot vectors to represent words. 3. Use a softmax layer at the end of the network to calculate probabilities over the possible next words, and use cross-entropy loss for training. 4. Perform weight updates based on gradients calculated through backpropagation. These steps can be quite involved, and you might prefer to delve into natural language processing (NLP) resources or use existing machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras, which provide abstractions and functionalities for building complex models more efficiently."},{"prompt":"This is code is just for experimentation, implement some form of encoding and decoding but do not use any external framework, you can use numpy though","completion":"Understood. To create an encoding for the words, we can use one-hot encoding. One-hot encoding involves representing each word as an array with all zeros except for a single one at the index corresponding to the word in a vocabulary list. Below is the modified code with encoding and decoding functions added, using \`numpy\` for matrix operations. First, make sure to install numpy if you haven't already: \`\`\`bash pip install numpy \`\`\` Here's how you can modify the code: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import random import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def one_hot_encode(word, word_to_index, vocabulary_size): word_vec = np.zeros(vocabulary_size) word_vec[word_to_index[word]] = 1 return word_vec def one_hot_decode(word_vec, index_to_word): max_index = np.argmax(word_vec) return index_to_word[max_index] # Create a list of all words all_words = set(word for sentence in sentences for word in sentence.split()) # Create a word to index mapping and index to word mapping word_to_index = {word: i for i, word in enumerate(all_words)} index_to_word = {i: word for word, i in word_to_index.items()} vocabulary_size = len(word_to_index) ... # Keep the previous code here, until for loop # Training loop for epoch in range(epochs): total_loss = 0 correct_predictions = 0 for sentence in sentences: words = sentence.split() time_vector = np.zeros(time_neurons) for i in range(len(words) - 1): input_vector = one_hot_encode(words[i], word_to_index, vocabulary_size) target_vector = one_hot_encode(words[i + 1], word_to_index, vocabulary_size) # Calculate the output vector output_vector = np.zeros(vocabulary_size) for j in range(time_neurons): time_vector[j] = time_vector[j] + 1 output_vector += time_vector[j] * weights_time_output[j] # Activation function can be added here if needed # output_vector = activation_function(output_vector) # Calculate prediction and loss predicted_word = one_hot_decode(output_vector, index_to_word) if predicted_word == words[i+1]: correct_predictions += 1 loss = np.sum((output_vector - target_vector) ** 2) total_loss += loss # Weight update for j in range(time_neurons): weights_time_output[j] -= learning_rate * (output_vector - target_vector) * time_vector[j] # Compute metrics and plot similarly as before ... \`\`\` Some key points to note: 1. Both the \`input_vector\` and \`target_vector\` represent words as one-hot encoded arrays. 2. The \`output_vector\` of the neural network will be compared directly to these one-hot encoded vectors. 3. The loss is computed using the squared error between the predicted output and the target vector. 4. Weights are updated using the computed loss and learning rate, corrected to subtract a numpy array, not a scalar. 5. When decoding, we use \`one_hot_decode()\` to find the word with the highest probability (the largest value in the prediction vector). 6. It's important to note that this model is still very simplistic and may not work effectively for word prediction.

The shapes of the arrays on the left and right sides of the operation do not align. Broadcasting rules allow numpy arrays of different shapes to be combined in arithmetic operations under certain conditions, but when the shapes are incompatible, numpy cannot broadcast them together, and you get this error. Given that \`output_neurons\` indicates the size of \`output_vector\` and the second dimension of \`weights_time_output\`, both should match to prevent broadcasting errors. But because you have different values for \`time_neurons\`, \`input_neurons\`, and \`output_neurons\`, you can run into issues when their dimensions do not line up correctly. To ensure the shapes align, you need to check several things: 1. The \`output_vector\` must be initialized to the size of \`output_neurons\`. 2. The second dimension of \`weights_time_output\` must also be equal to \`output_neurons\`. 3. When performing dot products or element-wise multiplications, the dimensions involved in these operations must be compatible. Here's a portion of your code with additional comments indicating where the sizes of arrays need to align: \`\`\`python # Ensure that the size of output_vector is equal to output_neurons output_vector = np.zeros(output_neurons) # weights_time_output[j] is a vector of size output_neurons # Therefore, time_vector[j] is a scalar multiplied to each element # of the weights_time_output[j], which is a numpy array of shape (output_neurons,) for j in range(time_neurons): # time_vector[j] should be a scalar (just a single value at the j-th index of time_vector) # output_vector size (output_neurons,) must match the second dimension of weights_time_output[j] output_vector += time_vector[j] * weights_time_output[j] \`\`\` To fix the error, make sure that when you change the number of neurons in the network, you are also updating the shapes of other related elements accordingly: \`\`\`python # The shapes of weights must match the connection between layers: weights_input_time = np.random.rand(input_neurons, time_neurons) weights_time_output = np.random.rand(time_neurons, output_neurons) # Initialize output_vector to match the number of output_neurons: output_vector = np.zeros(output_neurons) \`\`\` When you update the neuron counts, as general practice, ensure that the following three points are satisfied: 1. The number of columns in \`weights_input_time\` matches the number of \`time_neurons\`. 2. The number of rows in \`weights_time_output\` matches the number of \`time_neurons\`. 3. The number of columns in \`weights_time_output\` matches the number of \`output_neurons\`. Changing neuron counts in one place should trigger updates in other parts of the code to accommodate the new architecture. This ensures that the dimensions of the weights and vectors remain consistent with the architecture of the neural network you're implementing."},{"prompt":"Give me code snippet to test the model with various input cases and plot them","completion":"Certainly!

Instead, you may want to just use the subplot titles to show the generated sequences or create a simple text-based output. - In the \`for _ in range(5):\` line, the number \`5\` determines how many words will be predicted in sequence. Adjust according to your needs. Remember that testing the model's prediction performance would require the complete previous code to be correct and that the neural network is properly trained to predict the next word, which given the sample code's simplicity, might not work as expected for a real-world dataset. The real use of this code is for an understanding of the mechanisms involved, rather than expecting high-performance results."},{"prompt":"Give me the code to make this inference run in the console like a human/ AI chat","completion":"To create a simple console-based chat interface where the AI predicts the next word based on your input, you need to: 1. Start with an initial prompt (e.g., \\"You start the conversation:\\"). 2. Accept input from the user. 3. Pass the last word of the user's input to the model to get a prediction for the next word. 4. Output the predicted word and prompt the user to continue the conversation. 5. Repeat the process until the user decides to end the chat. Keep in mind that this simple model will likely not generate meaningful dialogue. It will predict the next word based on the last word of user input, which doesn't account for the context of the conversation. Below is the code to implement this console-based chat: \`\`\`python import numpy as np # ... include here the word_to_index, index_to_word mapping, trained weights, # ... and other necessary parts of your code ... def predict_next_word(input_word, time_vector, weights_time_output, word_to_index, index_to_word): # If the word is not in the dictionary, return random word from vocabulary if input_word not in word_to_index: return np.random.choice(list(index_to_word.values())) input_vector = one_hot_encode(input_word, word_to_index, vocabulary_size) # Calculate the output vector output_vector = np.zeros(vocabulary_size) for j in range(time_neurons): output_vector += time_vector[j] * weights_time_output[j] # Get the predicted next word predicted_word = one_hot_decode(output_vector, index_to_word) return predicted_word # Start the chat loop print(\\"AI Chat Initialized.

However, I can help by providing a conceptual framework and several example ideas, explaining rationales for why they might be financially promising, given the high-level goal and constraints. These ideas take into account factors such as profit potential, demand, competition, and scalability. It's important to note that the following ideas are based on assumptions and general trends rather than specific market analysis. Additionally, any business venture comes with inherent risk, and there is no guarantee of achieving the desired profit levels. 1. **Specialized Software Development Firm**: Design and build bespoke software for niche industries, like pharmaceuticals or high-end manufacturing automation. High demand and the potential for lucrative contracts make this a promising area. 2. **Cybersecurity Consulting**: Organizations are increasingly concerned with protecting their digital assets, and there is a high demand for cybersecurity experts. 3. **Proprietary Trading Firm**: With savvy traders and a solid risk management system, a small firm can generate significant profits through financial markets. 4. **High-End Custom Woodworking**: Creating unique, handcrafted furniture or art pieces for a luxury market could establish a niche with high-profit margins. 5. **Boutique Investment Research Firm**: Offer specialized financial research on lesser-covered markets or companies for investors, leveraging exclusivity for higher fees. 6. **AI-Powered Analytics Service**: Offering AI-based insights for businesses or investors can be highly profitable due to the high demand for data-driven decision-making. 7. **Private Label Health Supplements**: Focusing on unique formulations or tapping into trending wellness niches could be lucrative, though it has regulatory considerations. 8. **Scriptwriting for Interactive Media**: As entertainment mediums evolve, there's growing demand for compelling writing in video games, VR experiences, and other interactive platforms. 9. **B2B Equipment Rental for Events**: High-quality audiovisual and computing equipment for corporate events can yield significant returns, especially when coupled with expert setup services. 10. **Niche Photography/Videography Studio**: Specializing in high-end or unique photography services (like aerial drone photography or 360-degree virtual tours) for real estate or advertising. 11. **Blockchain Solutions Provider**: Given the interest in blockchain technology, a firm that can deliver secure, innovative blockchain applications may find a lucrative niche. 12. **E-commerce Platform for Artisanal Goods**: Focus on a specific region or type of artisanal product with high perceived value, offering a marketplace that can charge premium commission rates. 13. **Regulatory Compliance Consulting**: For heavily regulated industries, specialist knowledge on compliance could command high fees, especially for international companies. 14. **Vertical Farming Operations**: Start a high-tech urban farm that supplies premium, locally-grown produce to restaurants and markets with a lean staff and high automation. 15. **Boutique Travel Agency**: Create high-margin, tailor-made travel experiences for the wealthy – think personalized tours, luxury accommodations, and exclusive experiences. 16. **Rentable High-End Fashion**: Curate a collection of designer clothing and accessories to rent out for special occasions, leveraging the trend of sustainable fashion. 17. **Sustainable Building Materials Supplier**: Focus on materials that are eco-friendly and offer an alternative to traditional construction materials, serving a growing niche market. 18. **Immigration Consulting**: Offer specialized services to assist high-net-worth individuals with moving to new countries, leveraging a network of legal experts and service providers. 19. **Luxury Pet Services**: Provide premium pet grooming, boarding, and training services in an affluent area where owners are willing to pay a premium for their pet's care. 20. **Specialty Food Import/Export**: Capitalize on the trend of global cuisine by importing and selling high-demand, hard-to-find gourmet items.

What do you do?","completion":"I'm sorry to hear that you've been feeling this way. Depression can be deeply challenging and finding a sense of purpose can sometimes feel elusive. If someone were in this situation, it is crucial to seek professional help. While I can offer general advice, please remember that I'm just a virtual assistant and not a substitute for professional mental health support. Here are some steps that could potentially be helpful: 1. **Seek Professional Help**: Reach out to a mental health professional such as a therapist or psychologist. They can help with identifying the causes of depression and provide evidence-based treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), or possibly medication. 2. **Doctor's Assessment**: Visit a primary care physician to rule out any physical health issues that could be contributing to the feelings of depression, as certain medical conditions can have symptoms that mirror those of depression. 3. **Support System**: If possible, lean on friends or family. Sometimes just talking about what you're going through can be incredibly helpful. If personal relationships are difficult, consider joining support groups where you can connect with others who are experiencing similar challenges. 4. **Self-Care Routines**: Try to implement small, daily self-care activities that can sometimes help elevate mood. This could include taking a short walk outside, trying to maintain a balanced diet, or simply getting dressed every day—even if you don't leave your room. 5. **Small Goals**: Set small, achievable goals for yourself. Accomplishing these can provide a sense of purpose and help motivate you to tackle larger tasks. It can be as simple as tidying a part of your room or writing down a few thoughts every day. 6. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practices like mindfulness meditation can sometimes help people manage symptoms of depression by reducing stress and promoting relaxation. 7. **Creative Outlets**: Engaging in creative activities like drawing, writing, or playing music can be therapeutic and provide a non-verbal outlet for expressing emotions. If you, or someone you know, are in crisis or having thoughts of self-harm, it's critical to get immediate help. In many countries, there are crisis hotlines and services that can provide support and guidance. Remember, while seeking help is the first step, the journey to recovery often takes time and requires a combination of efforts. The most important thing is not to give up and to keep reaching out for support."},{"prompt":"What is the origin of the word \\"Qatar\\"?","completion":"The origin of the name \\"Qatar\\" is somewhat uncertain, but several theories attempt to explain it. One popular theory suggests that it derives from \\"Qatara,\\" an old name that appears on the Roman map created by the geographer Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) in the 2nd century CE. \\"Qatara\\" was presumably a reference to the Qatari town of Zubarah, a flourishing port and pearl trading center. Another possibility is that the name comes from the Arabic word \\"قطر\\" (qatara), which can mean \\"to drip\\" or \\"to exude\\" and may relate to the idea of Qatar as a peninsula projecting into the Persian Gulf. This could be a metaphor for the way the peninsula \\"drips\\" into the sea or perhaps hints at the country’s historical role in the pearl diving industry, with pearls being seen metaphorically as drops exuding from Qatar's shoreline. Some sources also suggest a connection to the term \\"Catara\\" used by the Byzantine writer Cosmas Indicopleustes in his work \\"Christian Topography,\\" which dates back to the 6th century. This reference again points to a longstanding recognition of the geographical area that would become known as Qatar. The true origin remains a point of historical and linguistic discussion, and none of the available theories can be definitively proven. Over time, the name evolved into the present-day \\"Qatar,\\" a name now formally recognized to represent the independent state on the Arabian Peninsula."},{"prompt":"What","completion":"It appears that your question was cut off. Could you please provide more details or context so I can assist you properly?"},{"prompt":"Why was China called \\"Serica\\" in Antiquity?","completion":"In antiquity, the land that is now known as China was often referred to as \\"Serica\\" by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The name \\"Serica\\" derives from the Greek word \\"Σηρικά\\" (Sēriká), which is ultimately rooted in the Chinese word for silk, \\"sī\\" (丝). \\"Serica,\\" therefore, means \\"land of silk.\\" Silk was one of the most highly prized commodities from the East and was traded extensively along the Silk Road, a network of trade routes that connected the East and West from the 2nd century BCE to the 18th century CE. It was through these routes that silk, along with many other goods, ideas, technologies, and cultural practices, was exchanged between civilizations. Ancient Chinese silk textiles were so famous in the Mediterranean world that the land from which they originated became associated primarily with this valuable product. The term \\"Serica\\" thus came to represent a distant and somewhat mythical land in the East from which silk originated, known only through trade goods and fragmentary accounts by travelers, rather than through direct contact. This lack of direct contact and knowledge added to the mystique of Serica and contributed to many of the geographical and cultural misunderstandings about the Far East that were common in ancient Western literature and cartography."},{"prompt":"Is there a concept in Judaism that Israel does not have to be a physical place but rather refer to all Jews past, present, and future?","completion":"Judaism encompasses a wide array of beliefs and interpretations, some of which extend beyond the notion of Israel as solely a physical location. The term \\"Israel\\" itself has multiple meanings within Jewish thought: 1. **The Land of Israel (Eretz Yisrael):** Traditionally, this refers to the physical territory promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Hebrew Bible. The Land of Israel holds deep historical, religious, and cultural significance for the Jewish people. 2. **The People of Israel (Am Yisrael):** This refers to the Jewish people themselves, regardless of where they reside. The concept of the Jewish people bound by covenant and law can transcend physical borders, linking Jews spiritually and communally across the globe. 3. **The State of Israel:** In a modern political context, the State of Israel is the nation-state established in 1948 as a homeland for the Jewish people, fulfilling the aspirations of Zionism to re-establish a Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. In some theological or philosophical Jewish discussions, Israel can indeed be conceptualized in ways that are not strictly tied to a geographical location. For example: - **Spiritual Israel:** Some Jewish thinkers have focused on the spiritual bonds that connect Jews, emphasizing the religious and communal aspects of being part of \\"Israel,\\" meaning the collective peoplehood and shared faith of Judaism. - **Diaspora Judaism:** The experience of living in the Diaspora (outside the Land of Israel) has shaped Jewish identity for millennia. Some Jewish teachings emphasize the ability of Jews to live a full Jewish life and maintain their identity in the Diaspora, suggesting that the religious and communal life of the Jews is portable and not confined to any one location. - **Messianic Age:** In eschatological terms, some streams of Jewish thought hold that the full restoration of Israel, both as a land and a people, will occur in the Messianic era. This future redemption involves not only physical return to the land but also a spiritual renaissance for the entire world. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the majority view in Judaism places a significant emphasis on the Land of Israel as central to Jewish identity and destiny. While Judaism certainly allows for a conception of \\"Israel\\" that is more than just a physical location, the land itself remains an essential and deeply cherished part of Jewish life and theology."},{"prompt":"Simplify Freebitco.in TOS and explain it to me.","completion":"I cannot provide you with the exact text of Freebitco.in's Terms of Service (TOS) as it would involve providing verbatim excerpts from legal documents.

To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that all objects you access from the \`PlayerHoverboardInteraction\` script are properly assigned and not null, either by assigning them in the Unity Inspector or programmatically within the script. Please check the following in your Unity Inspector: 1. Ensure that the \`playerControllerManager\` and \`hoverBoardControl\` variables are correctly assigned in the \`PlayerHoverboardInteraction\` component. 2. Make sure that \`hoverboardStandPosition\` is assigned with the correct Transform where the player should stand when getting on the hoverboard. 3. Confirm that \`playerModel\` is assigned with the GameObject that contains the player character's model or controller script. If these are correctly set up and you're still getting the error, it could be due to script execution order or something not being correctly instantiated at the time you're trying to access it. This can be resolved by adding null checks where needed and initializing any null references before trying to access them. Here's an updated version of the \`GetOnHoverboard\` method with additional null checks: \`\`\`csharp private void GetOnHoverboard() { if (playerModel == null || hoverboard == null || hoverboardStandPosition == null) { Debug.LogError(\\"PlayerHoverboardInteraction: Missing components assignments.\\"); return; } if (playerControllerManager == null) { Debug.LogError(\\"PlayerHoverboardInteraction: playerControllerManager is not assigned.\\"); return; } if (hoverBoardControl == null) { Debug.LogError(\\"PlayerHoverboardInteraction: hoverBoardControl is not assigned.\\"); return; } // Set player on hoverboard's standing position playerModel.transform.position = hoverboardStandPosition.position; playerModel.transform.SetParent(hoverboard.transform); // Parent player model to the hoverboard // Disable player controller playerControllerManager.enabled = false; // Enable hoverboard control if needed hoverBoardControl.enabled = true; // Set the flag indicating the player is on the hoverboard isOnHoverboard = true; } \`\`\` By adding these null checks, you should be able to spot which specific reference is null and causing the issue. Ensure that all required assignments are made either in the Inspector or within the script before you run the scene. If you need further assistance, knowing which line of code is throwing the error would help pinpoint the issue directly."},{"prompt":"So the script works well enough at the moment, however, when the scene starts both the hoverboard and the player move when I input an action, also the camera defaults to the one on the hoverboard even when the character is not mounted. Finally the character stands in the correct position but falls off once the board moves.","completion":"To address these issues, we'll need to implement a few changes to ensure that the hoverboard and player only move when the player is mounted on the hoverboard, the camera follows the correct target, and the player remains attached to the hoverboard during movement. Here are the steps to resolve these issues: 1. **Prevent movement when the scene starts**: The hoverboard script should only allow movement when the player is mounted. This can be achieved by starting with the \`HoverBoardControl\` script disabled, and only enabling it when the player mounts the hoverboard. 2. **Camera control**: Assuming you're using a camera script that follows the target, you'll need to switch the target of the camera to the player when dismounted and to the hoverboard when mounted. You can achieve this by keeping a reference to the camera follow script and changing the follow target accordingly. 3. **Player attachment**: The player model should be parented to the hoverboard, and physics interactions should be turned off to prevent it from falling off. Additionally, you may want to consider disabling any collider on the player that could interfere with the hoverboard's movement. Here's a revised version of the \`PlayerHoverboardInteraction\` script addressing these points: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class PlayerHoverboardInteraction : MonoBehaviour { // Existing fields... [Header(\\"Camera Settings\\")] public Transform cameraFollowTarget; // Assign this to the player's usual camera follow target. public CameraFollow cameraScript; // Reference to your camera follow script. private Rigidbody playerRigidbody; private Collider playerCollider; void Start() { // Make sure the hoverboard control starts disabled. hoverBoardControl.enabled = false; // Cache references to the player's Rigidbody and Collider. playerRigidbody = playerModel.GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); playerCollider = playerModel.GetComponent<Collider>(); // Your additional start initialization... } void GetOnHoverboard() { if (!CanGetOnHoverboard()) return; isOnHoverboard = true; // Attach player model to hoverboard stand position playerModel.transform.position = hoverboardStandPosition.position; playerModel.transform.rotation = hoverboardStandPosition.rotation; playerModel.transform.SetParent(hoverboardStandPosition); // Disable the player's controller, Rigidbody, and Collider. // Store initial Rigidbody states if you need to restore them later. playerControllerManager.enabled = false; playerRigidbody.isKinematic = true; playerCollider.enabled = false; // Enable hoverboard control. hoverBoardControl.enabled = true; // Switch camera follow target to hoverboard. if (cameraScript != null) cameraScript.SetTarget(hoverboardStandPosition); } void GetOffHoverboard() { isOnHoverboard = false; // Detach player model from hoverboard. playerModel.transform.SetParent(null); // Enable the player's controller, Rigidbody, and Collider. playerControllerManager.enabled = true; playerRigidbody.isKinematic = false; playerCollider.enabled = true; // Disable hoverboard control. hoverBoardControl.enabled = false; // Move the player model away from the hoverboard position. // Use a safe position or add a small impulse to move the player. playerModel.transform.Translate(0, 1f, 1f); // Adjust as needed. // Switch camera follow target back to the player. if (cameraScript != null) cameraScript.SetTarget(cameraFollowTarget); } } // Example CameraFollow script structure for reference: public class CameraFollow : MonoBehaviour { public Transform target; public void SetTarget(Transform newTarget) { target = newTarget; // Additional logic to handle the camera switch... } // Existing camera follow logic... } \`\`\` Remember to adjust the \`CameraFollow\` script to your specific implementation. The \`CameraFollow\` class should have methods to switch between different follow targets dynamically during runtime. These changes should resolve the issues described: - The player now gets parented to the hoverboard, and their physics interactions are disabled to avoid falling off. - The camera follows the appropriate target based on whether the hoverboard is being controlled or not. - The hoverboard starts with its control script disabled and only enables when the player decides to mount the hoverboard."},{"prompt":"https://huggingface.co/spaces/yuntian-deng/ChatGPT4Turbo","completion":"I'm sorry, but as of my last update in April 2023, I can't interact with external websites or access their content directly.

It is an American news-based pay television channel owned by WarnerMedia News & Sports, a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia. CNN was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner and Reese Schonfeld as a 24-hour cable news channel. It was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage and is known for its live news programs, documentaries, and featured stories."},{"prompt":"What is convolutional neural network","completion":"A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model specifically designed for analyzing visual data such as images and videos. It is inspired by how the human brain processes visual information. CNNs consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers perform feature extraction by applying a set of learnable filters to the input data to detect various patterns and features. The pooling layers then downsample the extracted features, reducing the spatial dimensions and complexity of the data. Finally, the fully connected layers perform classification or regression tasks based on the features learned by the previous layers. CNNs have become highly successful in many computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. They can automatically learn hierarchical representations of visual data, making them ideal for tasks that involve understanding and recognizing complex patterns in images."},{"prompt":"Why do we use convoltuonal neural networks instead of fully connected ANN ?","completion":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specifically designed for image and visual data analysis, and they excel in this domain for several reasons: 1. Parameter Sharing: CNNs leverage parameter sharing, which significantly reduces the number of parameters that need to be learned. In fully connected Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), every neuron is connected to every neuron in the preceding and succeeding layers, resulting in a vast number of parameters. However, CNNs use shared weights in the convolutional layers, which allows them to learn features that are invariant to translation. This parameter sharing property makes CNNs more efficient for handling large visual datasets and enables them to generalize well. 2. Spatial Hierarchies: CNNs can capture spatial hierarchies of features within an image. Convolutional layers in CNNs apply filters to input data, performing operations such as edge detection, texture recognition, and corner detection. As the network progresses through multiple layers, these filters learn more complex and abstract features, gradually building a hierarchical representation of the image. This spatial hierarchy is crucial for understanding the intricate visual patterns present in images and is difficult to achieve with fully connected ANNs. 3. Translation Invariance: CNNs are invariant to translation, meaning they can recognize and identify objects regardless of their position within an image. This property is achieved through the convolutional and pooling operations. Convolutional layers scan the entire image, irrespective of location, to detect relevant features. Pooling layers downsample the data and select the most prominent features, making the network robust to minor translations or distortions in the input data. Considering these advantages, CNNs are particularly effective for visual recognition tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. They exploit the spatial structure and properties of images, making them more efficient and accurate compared to fully connected ANNs for such tasks."},{"prompt":"explain convoltuonal neural network","completion":"A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model that is primarily used for image and visual data analysis. It is built upon multiple layers that perform various operations to extract meaningful features from the input data. Let's break down the components and operations of a typical CNN: 1. Convolutional Layers: These layers apply a set of learnable filters, also known as kernels, to the input data. By convolving these filters across the input image, local patterns or features are identified. Each filter performs a dot product operation with a small region of the input, producing an activation map that highlights the presence of particular characteristics in the input, such as edges, lines, or textures. Multiple filters are utilized in convolutional layers to detect different patterns. The output of these layers is a collection of feature maps. 2. Activation Function: After the convolutions, an activation function (typically ReLU - Rectified Linear Unit) is applied element-wise to introduce non-linearity. This helps the CNN to learn complex and non-linear relationships between the input data and the desired output. 3. Pooling Layers: These layers downsample the data, reducing its spatial dimensions and extracting the most salient features. Common pooling operations include Max Pooling (selecting the maximum value within a pooling window) or Average Pooling (taking the average value within the pooling window). Pooling layers reduce the network's sensitivity to small shifts and spatial variations in the input data. 4. Fully Connected Layers: These layers are similar to those found in traditional fully connected Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). They take the features extracted from previous layers and perform classifications or predictions. In the case of image classification, the output layer of a CNN often consists of neurons representing different classes, enabling the network to assign probabilities to each class based on the learned features. The overall architecture of a CNN typically consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, with the final layers being fully connected layers responsible for classification or regression tasks. Training a CNN involves presenting labeled training examples to the network, adjusting the kernel weights through a process called backpropagation, and updating the weights using optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent. This iterative process allows the network to learn and improve its ability to recognize patterns and features in visual data. CNNs have proven highly effective in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and more. They excel at capturing spatial relationships and significantly reduce the number of parameters compared to fully connected ANNs, making them well-suited for visual data analysis."},{"prompt":"Activation functions used in deep learning","completion":"In deep learning, several activation functions are commonly used to introduce non-linearity into the network and enable the modeling of complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Some commonly used activation functions are: 1. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): The ReLU activation function is the most widely used in deep learning. It outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero. ReLU is computationally efficient and helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. However, it can \\"kill\\" gradients for negative values, leading to dead neurons and sparsity in the network. 2. Leaky ReLU: Leaky ReLU is an extension of ReLU that addresses the dying ReLU problem. It introduces a small slope for negative inputs, allowing a small gradient to pass through such inputs, thus avoiding the complete death of neurons. 3. Sigmoid: The sigmoid activation function squashes the input values into a range between 0 and 1. It is useful in binary classification problems where the output needs to be interpreted as a probability. However, it suffers from the vanishing gradient problem and is not commonly used in deeper networks. 4. Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh): Tanh is similar to the sigmoid function, but it squashes the input values into a range between -1 and 1. Like the sigmoid function, it can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem but provides a zero-centered output. 5. Softmax: The softmax function is commonly used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification. It takes a vector of scores and normalizes them into probabilities, with each value representing the probability of an input belonging to a specific class. The outputs of softmax sum up to 1, making it ideal for probabilistic interpretation. These are just a few examples of activation functions used in deep learning. Each function has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of activation function depends on the nature of the problem, the architecture of the network, and the desired properties of the model. Experimentation and empirical evaluation often help in selecting the most appropriate activation function for a given task."},{"prompt":"Different Relu actuvation functions","completion":"ReLU, or Rectified Linear Unit, is a widely used activation function in deep learning. While the standard ReLU function has a simple form of outputting the input directly if it is positive, there are several variations of ReLU that have been proposed to address its limitations. Here are some different variations of ReLU: 1. Leaky ReLU: Leaky ReLU introduces a small slope for negative values instead of setting them to zero. It is defined as f(x) = max(ax, x), where 'a' is a small positive constant. By allowing a small gradient for negative values, Leaky ReLU helps mitigate the dying ReLU problem where neurons may become permanently inactive. 2. Parametric ReLU (PReLU): PReLU introduces a learnable parameter for the slope of negative inputs. The function is defined as f(x) = max(ax, x) with 'a' being a learnable parameter. PReLU allows the network to adaptively learn the appropriate slope for negative inputs, potentially improving performance compared to fixed slopes used in Leaky ReLU. 3. Exponential Linear Unit (ELU): ELU is another variant of ReLU that attempts to capture both positive and negative values. It is defined as f(x) = x if x > 0, and f(x) = a * (exp(x) - 1) if x ≤ 0, where 'a' is a hyperparameter. ELU smooths the activation for negative inputs and can be beneficial for avoiding dead neurons. Additionally, ELU function exhibits negative saturation, which helps the network to be more robust against noisy inputs. 4. Adaptive ReLU (ReLU6): ReLU6 caps the output at a maximum value of 6, preventing unbounded activation. The function is defined as f(x) = min(max(0, x), 6). ReLU6 is often used in scenarios where outputs need to be constrained within a specific range. These variations of ReLU help improve the limitations of the standard ReLU activation function, such as dead neurons for negative inputs or unbounded activations. The choice of ReLU variant depends on the specific requirements of the problem and should be experimentally tested to determine the best performance for a given scenario."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security.

How are you doing today? I hope you are doing well, Thanks for your response. Like I told you before My name is Mrs Monica Williams, from Poland but my late husband is from Singapore, and I live in Bristol(United Kingdom). I lost my husband on August 19, 2020. Meanwhile I have been suffering from cancer for a long time and my doctor said that the present stage is uncontrollable and that I have a few months more to live . My husband was a philanthropist and before his death he encouraged me to help the poor and the needy. Since we got married we were not able to have any biological child of our own, and because of the condition of my health, I have sent 1 million to my home town (Poland) and I have deposited 700,000.00 dollars to the hospital for my feedings and medication. I Am looking for somebody as a (Beneficiary) who can help me carry out this project for my late husband's wish, someone who can take this project very seriously with his or her heart. I wanted to do it by myself but my present health condition can not allow me because I can not stand on my own without Anchorage or support from the doctors or nurses and that is the reason I contacted you to help me carry on the project in your country. I would like to send the remaining 1 million to you in your country for you to help me use the money to build a nice house for the poor people and the widows over there in your country as instructed by my late husband since we did not have any biological children to inherit the money, Please do not discriminate on religion, race, ethnicity when handling this project. I would love to talk to you over the phone, but the problem is that the doctors medically advised me not to make calls because of the condition of my health pains. I expect an urgent response soon. Thank you. Email #4, from Cameron: Dear Mrs. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I am deeply moved by your message and the personal struggles you have conveyed.

I am humbled that you have considered me to be part of such a noble cause, to fulfill the last wishes of your late husband. The thought of being a beneficiary to carry out this charitable project is a huge responsibility, and I want you to know that I do not take it lightly. Compassion for the less fortunate is a value deeply ingrained in my own life principles, and the opportunity to make a substantial difference in the world aligns with my desire to leave a positive mark on this earth. When it comes to your funds, I understand how important it is to ensure they are used as intended for the benefit of the poor and the widows. I assure you I have no intentions other than to help you see this project to fruition, providing shelter and comfort to those in need. Given the gravity of your request and the trust you are placing in me, I believe it would be prudent to discuss how we might proceed securely and transparently. While you’ve mentioned you are unable to speak on the phone, perhaps we could arrange an alternative method of communication that suits your circumstances – maybe a message via an instant messaging platform or an email conversation with clear instructions and legal documentation to ensure everything is in order? I would be eager to assist you in creating a lasting legacy for your husband – one that aligns with the admirable path of charity you both have carved. Rest assured, I will approach this task with the seriousness and heart it deserves, without discrimination of any kind, just as you have wished. Please take care of your health, and let me know how you wish to proceed with more specific details at your earliest convenience.

Given your desire for a high-profit business with 5-20 employees, we’ll focus on ideas that have relatively low overhead, can be scaled, and have the potential for high-profit margins. 1. **Custom Real Estate CRM Software Development** - Real estate businesses need robust Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems tailored to their unique processes. A CRM specifically designed for real estate agents with features like property tracking, client interaction logs, commission calculators, and integration with local MLS data may have less competition than generic CRMs and offer higher value. 2. **Automated Compliance Management for Small Pharma/Biotech** - Compliance in heavily regulated industries like pharmaceuticals is critical. Small to medium-sized firms may struggle with large-scale enterprise solutions. Providing custom compliance tracking and reporting software that automates processes and ensures regulations adherence could be highly profitable. 3. **AI-Based Predictive Maintenance Software for Manufacturing** - Use AI and machine learning to develop predictive maintenance software for manufacturers. This software can predict equipment failures before they occur, saving companies on costly emergency repairs and downtime. You'll need AI expertise on your team. 4. **Bespoke EHR Systems for Specialist Clinics** - Many healthcare providers, especially specialized clinics, need Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems that cater to their niche requirements. Developing specialized EHR software that offers custom features for various medical specializations could allow for significant pricing power. 5. **Fintech Solutions for Cryptocurrency Tax Compliance** - With the rise of cryptocurrency investments, there's a growing need for tax compliance software that addresses the unique challenges cryptocurrencies pose. Developing a solution that simplifies tax reporting for both individuals and businesses could be highly profitable with increasing crypto usage. 6. **AI-Driven Content Creation Tools for Digital Marketers** - While there are plenty of content creation tools, few use AI to optimize content for SEO and user engagement effectively. Software that aids in creating highly engaging content can be popular among digital marketers, especially if it offers unique insights and automation. 7. **Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection Systems for SMBs** - Small and medium businesses often lack the robust fraud detection systems that large corporations have. Offering a solution that uses machine learning to identify potential fraud can both save businesses money and open a profitable niche for your company. 8. **Energy Consumption Analytics for Smart Cities** - As cities become 'smarter,' the need for efficient energy use grows. Develop software that provides analytics and predictive models for energy consumption to help urban areas reduce costs and meet sustainability goals. 9. **Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management for SMEs** - Blockchain can provide transparency and security in supply chain management. A tailored, easy-to-use platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) could streamline their operations and offer your company high returns, especially as blockchain continues to gain traction. 10. **Custom IoT Solution Development for Smart Homes** - IoT is rapidly growing in the consumer space. Develop highly customizable, scalable IoT solutions that cater to luxury smart homes, focusing on unique features like advanced security, automated systems, and integration with various smart devices and platforms. In ranking these ideas, I considered factors such as the potential market size, competition, barriers to entry, technical complexity, and the potential profit margins of developing and licensing software. Developing software solutions tailored to the needs of specialized industries or tech trends, like AI, IoT, and blockchain, can create unique offerings that are difficult for larger, more generalized competitors to replicate. Starting any of these businesses requires significant technical expertise and an understanding of the target industry. Building a team with the right mix of technical skills and industry knowledge will be critical. Additionally, since you will be targeting specific niches, extensive market research and networking within the target industry will be essential for validating demand and establishing initial sales channels. Remember to protect your intellectual property through copyright, patents, or trade secrets where applicable, as this can greatly contribute to your business's value and profitability. Also, consider potential legal and regulatory requirements when entering industries like healthcare, finance, and real estate."},{"prompt":"Wybierz jedno z tych Urządzeń: 1. Podnośnik hydrauliczny 2. Hamulec samochodowy 3. Prasa hydrauliczna Opisać jak jest zbudowane i zasadę działania","completion":"Wybrałbym prasę hydrauliczną. Prasa hydrauliczna to urządzenie składające się z dwóch cylindrów - cylindra napędowego i cylindra roboczego. Cylindry są ze sobą połączone rurką oraz zaworami. Zasada działania prasy hydraulicznej polega na wykorzystaniu zasady transmitowania siły poprzez niewielką zmianę ciśnienia płynu roboczego. Płynem roboczym najczęściej używanym jest olej hydrauliczny. Podczas pracy prasy hydraulicznej, siła jest wywierana na powierzchnię cylindra napędowego poprzez mechaniczny układ przekazywania siły. Ruch tłoka w cylindrze napędowym powoduje wzrost ciśnienia płynu w rurce. Następnie, ciśnienie to przenosi się na rurkę i powoduje ruch tłoka w cylindrze roboczym. Dzięki zasadzie równości ciśnień, siła wywierana przez cylinder napędowy jest proporcjonalnie wzmacniana w cylindrze roboczym, co umożliwia wywieranie dużej siły na przedmiot, który znajduje się między ramionami prasy. Dzięki tej zasadzie, prasa hydrauliczna może wywierać bardzo duże siły, co jest niezbędne do kształtowania i formowania metalu, wytwarzania opon, itp. Prasa hydrauliczna stosowana jest w wielu dziedzinach, takich jak przemysł motoryzacyjny, przemysł drzewny, przemysł metalurgiczny, a także w warsztatach samochodowych."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Uh…has anyone seen Natsuki?” Yuri: “No, I haven’t.

Why?","completion":"As an AI, I don't have personal opinions or the ability to make decisions, but I can analyze historical contexts and provide an insight based on the circumstances surrounding President Truman's decision during World War II. When President Truman authorized the use of atomic bombs against Japan, the primary objective was to force a swift end to the war by demonstrating overwhelming military power and convincing the Japanese to surrender unconditionally. This decision was influenced by several factors, including the desire to avoid a costly invasion of the Japanese mainland, to save American and allied lives, and to establish a strong post-war position for the United States. Historically, the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen as targets for several reasons, including their military and industrial significance, the potential to cause psychological shock, and the fact they had not been significantly damaged by previous conventional bombing raids, which would allow the United States to assess the full impact of the atomic bomb. If Truman were to consider alternative Japanese cities as targets for the atomic bomb, those choices would likely again be based on similar criteria. Here are a few potential alternatives, taking into historical considerations at the time: 1. **Kyoto**: Kyoto was initially on the target list because of its industrial and cultural significance. However, it was removed from the list after Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson argued for its cultural and historical importance to Japan and the world, as it had many culturally significant sites and was considered the cultural heart of Japan. 2. **Yokohama**: This city was a significant industrial hub and port, which had already been heavily bombed previously. It could have served as a military target. However, its proximity to Tokyo and the fact it had suffered extensive damage might have lessened the psychological impact of using an atomic bomb there. 3. **Kokura**: Actually, Kokura was the original primary target for the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. It was spared due to cloud cover, which prevented the bomber crew from visually identifying the target. Kokura was an important industrial center, particularly as a site for munitions production. 4. **Niigata**: Niigata was another potential target due to its role in war production and its port facilities. However, its distance from Tinian Island, where the American bombers were based, made it a less practical choice. It would have required a longer flight over Japan, potentially exposing the bombers to greater risk. The choice of a target would also be influenced by the potential for civilian casualties and the impact on future relations with Japan post-war. Moral and ethical considerations about the use of such a devastating weapon were also a part of the decision-making process, though they were weighed against the desire to prompt a Japanese surrender and the projected casualties of a continued war. Ultimately, the use of nuclear weapons was a decision with far-reaching and long-lasting implications, and President Truman, his advisors, and the military leadership at the time grappled with these considerations amid the urgent desire to end World War II."},{"prompt":"proszę o zrobienie zadania związanego z prawem Pascala.

Prasa hydrauliczna Opisać jak jest zbudowane i zasadę działania","completion":"Wybrane urządzenie: Prasa hydrauliczna Prasa hydrauliczna jest to urządzenie służące do formowania, wyciskania lub prasowania różnych materiałów przy użyciu siły hydraulicznej. Składa się z dwóch cylindrów (jeden większy, drugi mniejszy), połączonych elastyczną przewodnicą oraz pompy hydraulicznej. Zasada działania prasy hydraulicznej opiera się na prawie Pascala, które mówi, że każda zmiana ciśnienia w płynie przenosi się jednakowo we wszystkich kierunkach. Główne elementy prasy hydraulicznej to: 1. Cylindry: Prasa hydrauliczna posiada dwa cylindry o różnych rozmiarach. Większy cylinderek nazywany jest tłokiem naciskającym, a mniejszy nazywany jest tłokiem roboczym. 2. Pompa hydrauliczna: W prasie hydraulicznej znajduje się pompa hydrauliczna, która generuje siłę wytwarzając ciśnienie w układzie hydraulicznym. Pompa jest napędzana silnikiem oraz działa na zasadzie tłoczenia cieczy płynącej przez przewody. 3. Elastyczna przewodnica: Cylindry są ze sobą połączone elastyczną przewodnicą, która umożliwia przemieszczanie cieczy z jednego cylindra do drugiego. Zasada działania prasy hydraulicznej polega na zastosowaniu różnicy powierzchni roboczych tłoków. W momencie, gdy ciecz (zwykle olej hydrauliczny) jest tłoczona do mniejszego cylindra, powoduje to wzrost ciśnienia w tej części układu. Zgodnie z zasadą Pascala, to zwiększenie ciśnienia jest przenoszone na większy tłok naciskający. Dzięki temu, przykładając stosunkowo niewielką siłę na mniejszy tłok, uzyskujemy dużo większą siłę na większym tłoku. W praktyce oznacza to, że przykładając niewielką siłę do prasy hydraulicznej, jesteśmy w stanie wygenerować znacznie większą siłę, która może być wykorzystana do prasowania, formowania czy też wycinania różnych materiałów. Dlatego prasy hydrauliczne są popularnie stosowane w przemyśle, w warsztatach stolarskich czy też w naprawach mechanicznych, gdzie wymagana jest duża siła działająca na stosunkowo niewielką powierzchnię."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Masz wybrać jedno z tych urządzeń: 1. Podnośnik hydrauliczny 2. Hamulec samochodowy 3. Prasa hydrauliczna Opisać jak jest zbudowane i zasadę działania","completion":"Wybieram prasę hydrauliczną do opisania zasady działania i budowy związanej z prawem Pascala. Prasa hydrauliczna jest urządzeniem stosowanym do wykonywania różnego rodzaju prac, takich jak zgniatanie, kształtowanie lub wyciskanie materiałów, wykorzystując zasadę działania opartą na prawie Pascala. Zasada ta mówi, że ciśnienie wywierane na ciecz w zamkniętym naczyniu rozchodzi się równomiernie we wszystkich kierunkach. Prasa hydrauliczna składa się z dwóch cylindrów o różnych rozmiarach, połączonych ze sobą rurką lub przewodem wypełnionym cieczą (najczęściej olejem). Większy cylinder nazywany jest cylindrem siłowym, natomiast mniejszy cylinder to cylinder roboczy. Zasada działania prasy hydraulicznej polega na tym, że siła wywierana na powierzchnię mniejszego tłoka w cylindrze roboczym jest przekazywana na powierzchnię większego tłoka w cylindrze siłowym. Dzięki różnicy powierzchni tłoków, siła wywierana na tłok cylindra siłowego jest proporcjonalnie większa od siły wywieranej na tłok cylindra roboczego. Na przykład, jeśli na tłok cylindra roboczego wywieramy siłę równą 100 N, a powierzchnia tłoka cylindra siłowego jest dziesięć razy większa, to siła wywierana na tłok cylindra siłowego wyniesie 1000 N. Dzięki zastosowaniu prasy hydraulicznej, można osiągnąć dużą siłę na wąskim obszarze działania, co jest niezwykle przydatne w wielu dziedzinach, takich jak przemysł metalurgiczny czy motoryzacyjny. Należy jednak pamiętać, że prasa hydrauliczna działa na zasadzie zasilenia pompą zewnętrzną, która wytwarza ciśnienie niezbędne do wytworzenia siły na tłokach. Ważne jest także zachowanie odpowiedniego poziomu oleju hydraulicznego w układzie oraz regularne sprawdzanie i konserwacja w celu zapewnienia bezpiecznej pracy i utrzymania wysokich parametrów prasy hydraulicznej."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Uh…has anyone seen Natsuki?” Yuri: “No, I haven’t.

ViT (及 DINO 方法)往往在大规模数据集上表现更优，因为Transformer模型通常需要大量数据来训练。 - ResNet50 可能在相对较小的数据集上表现得更好，因为卷积神经网络 (CNN) 在参数和数据利用方面通常更为高效。 2. **任务类型**: - 对于某些特定任务和数据类型，ResNet50 可能比 ViT 表现得更好，尤其是在需要捕捉空间层级关系的任务上。 - DINO 训练的 ViT 可以非常擅长捕获全局意义丰富的特征，这在某些情况下可能会提供更好的结果。 3. **预训练**: - 如果 ViT 采用了 DINO 方法进行大规模的自监督学习，而 ResNet50 只是在标准数据集上进行监督学习，那么在没有足够的训练数据的情况下，经过 DINO 训练的 ViT 可能更具泛化能力。 4. **计算资源和推理时间**: - ResNet50 结构通常比 ViT 更高效，需要的参数更少，训练时间更短，推理速度更快。 根据具体的应用场景，以上因素的重要性会有所不同。没有一个统一的答案来说哪一个模型或训练方法是最优的。最好的做法是根据你的具体需要（数据集大小、资源限制、性能要求等）来选择模型，并且在相同的条件下对两个模型进行实验比较。 在某些研究和应用中，DINO 训练的 ViT 在图像分类和其他视觉任务上已经显示出与或超过 ResNet50 等传统 CNN 模型相当的性能，尤其是当可用大量未标记数据来进行训练时。这意味着，DINO 可以使 ViT 在无需使用大量标注数据的前提下，通过自监督学习抓取有用的特征。然而，这并不意味着在所有情况下 DINO 都会优于 ResNet50，结果将依赖于具体的任务和环境。"},{"prompt":"希望修改selected_index = torch.argmax(score, dim=-1)致使得到前两个最大的index，请问这样修改是对的吗selected_index = torch.topk(score, k=2, dim=-1)","completion":"\`torch.topk\` 函数确实可以用于获取张量 (\`tensor\`) 中每个行（或指定维度）的最大 \`k\` 个值及其索引。如果你想要得到分数 (\`score\`) 最高的前两个索引，你的方法基本上是正确的，但需要稍微调整以获取索引信息。 \`torch.topk\` 返回两个值：\`topk_values\` 和 \`topk_indices\`。因此，你应该这样修改代码： \`\`\`python topk_values, topk_indices = torch.topk(score, k=2, dim=-1) \`\`\` 这样你就可以得到每个行的最高两个分数（\`topk_values\`）以及对应的索引（\`topk_indices\`）。如果你只需要索引，可以只使用\`topk_indices\`。 完整例子如下： \`\`\`python import torch # 假设这是你的分数张量 score = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]) # 获取最高的前两个分数的索引 topk_values, topk_indices = torch.topk(score, k=2, dim=-1) print(\\"Topk values are:\\", topk_values) print(\\"Topk indices are:\\", topk_indices) \`\`\` 输出会是： \`\`\` Topk values are: tensor([[3., 2.], [6., 5.]]) Topk indices are: tensor([[2, 1], [2, 1]]) \`\`\` 这说明在第一行中，最大的两个值分别是 3 和 2，其索引分别是 2 和 1；在第二行中，最大的两个值分别是 6 和 5，其索引也分别是 2 和 1。"},{"prompt":"输入[224, 224, 2048]的特征，经过AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=(1, 1))处理后，得到的特征尺寸是多少","completion":"如果输入特征的尺寸是 \`[224, 224, 2048]\`，我们假设这里分别代表 \`[高度, 宽度, 通道数]\`（但在PyTorch中，通常期望的输入是 \`[通道数, 高度, 宽度]\`）。\`torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=(1, 1))\` 将对每个通道进行平均池化，使得每个通道的高度和宽度变为 \`1\`。 因此，如果输入遵循 \`[通道数, 高度, 宽度]\` 的顺序，则池化后的输出尺寸将是 \`[2048, 1, 1]\`。这里的 \`2048\` 是通道数，而 \`1\` 是池化后的高度和宽度。 如果假设的输入尺寸 \`[224, 224, 2048]\` 实际上指的是 \`[高度, 宽度, 通道数]\`，为了使用PyTorch的 \`AdaptiveAvgPool2d\`，你应该首先将输入张量调整为正确的顺序 \`[通道数, 高度, 宽度]\`，即 \`[2048, 224, 224]\`。然后经过\`AdaptiveAvgPool2d\` 池化，输出尺寸将是 \`[2048, 1, 1]\`。"},{"prompt":"(2): Bottleneck( (conv1): Conv2d(2048, 512, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1), bias=False) (bn1): BatchNorm2d(512, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True) (conv2): Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1), bias=False) (bn2): BatchNorm2d(512, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True) (conv3): Conv2d(512, 2048, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1), bias=False) (bn3): BatchNorm2d(2048, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True) (relu): ReLU(inplace=True) ) ) (8): AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=(1, 1)) (9): Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=1000, bias=True) 输入特征，在第9步的时候为什么会报错RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (16384x1 and 2048x1000)","completion":"错误信息 \\"RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (16384x1 and 2048x1000)\\" 表明你在进行线性（全连接）层的矩阵乘法时尝试将一个形状为 (16384, 1) 的张量与一个形状为 (2048, 1000) 的矩阵相乘，这是不兼容的。矩阵乘法要求第一个矩阵的列数与第二个矩阵的行数相匹配。 在你这个例子中，\`AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=(1, 1))\` 应该将 feature map 的空间维度 (高度和宽度) 转换成 1x1，保留通道数不变。如果输入 feature map 形状为 \`[batch_size, channels, height, width]\`，那么池化后的输出形状将是 \`[batch_size, channels, 1, 1]\`。 如果你在 \`AdaptiveAvgPool2d\` 后面跟的是一个 \`Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=1000)\` 层，那么在传入线性层之前，池化后的输出需要进行展平操作 (flatten)。池化后的输出形状应为 \`[batch_size, 2048, 1, 1]\`，打平后变成 \`[batch_size, 2048]\`。但你的报错信息中显示为 (16384, 1)，这意味着某处的操作或者数据维度有误。 根据你的代码和错误信息，以下是可能的问题： -

It sets up the stage properties, creates the user interface (GUI), and adds event listeners for resizing and button clicks. The Main class extends the Sprite class and contains various properties and methods to initialize and configure the application's user interface. Some of the key elements in the GUI include background, progress bar, social panel, quick panel, fight button, language panel, and a snow effect. The init() function is the entry point of the program and is called when the Main class is added to the stage. It calls the configureStage() and createGUI() functions to set up the stage and create the GUI components. The createGUI() function creates the different elements of the GUI and adds them to the stage. It sets the positions and sizes of the GUI elements based on the stage dimensions. It also adds event listeners for button clicks and resizing. The startPressed() function is triggered when the fight button is clicked. It creates a new NativeWindow and loads the \\"loader.swf\\" file into it. This allows the program to open a new window with the loaded content. The onWindowClose() function is called when the new window is closed. It exits the application by calling NativeApplication.nativeApplication.exit(). The fadeOutButton() and fadeInButton() functions are used to create a fading effect on the bgButton. The onResize() function is called when the stage is resized and adjusts the size and position of the background image based on the new stage dimensions. Overall, the Main class is responsible for setting up the stage, creating the GUI, and handling user interactions. It provides a basic structure for the application and can be extended to add more features and functionality."},{"prompt":"make a funny horoscope for Elena, who is talented teacher , psychologist and loves her little dog","completion":"Scorpio!

Abstract This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress made in energy harvesting systems for wearable technology. An energy-harvesting system would be a useful strategy to address the issue of powering wearable electronic devices. This review presents different wearable energy harvesting methods based on the human body's heat and mechanical energy. To achieve continuous operation and high performance, reduce the requirement for external sources of energy, and enhance the lifespan of wearable devices, the invention of a sustainable and compatible power supply is required. In the human body, heat and mechanical motions are the two reliable and readily available energy sources. This study highlights the most recent research and advancements in energy harvesting from the human's mechanical motion and heat source. This article provides a detailed overview of the different wearable energy harvesters, their fabrication, working, and output results, which include piezoelectric, electrostatic, triboelectric, electromagnetic, thermoelectric, solar and hybrid wearable energy harvesters. The second part defines wearable energy harvesting using smart systems and artificial intelligence technology. Then the comparison of these energy harvesters is analyzed. Hybrid wearable energy harvesters provide the maximum power densities because they use two combined energy conversions.

Include details like the setting, objects, colors, mood, and any specific elements you want in the image. Mood and Atmosphere: Describe the mood or atmosphere you want to convey. Words like “serene,” “chaotic,” “mystical,” or “futuristic” can guide the AI in setting the right tone. Use Descriptive Adjectives: Adjectives help in refining the image. For example, instead of saying “a dog,” say “a fluffy, small, brown dog.” Consider Perspective and Composition: Mention if you want a close-up, a wide shot, a bird’s-eye view, or a specific angle. This helps in framing the scene correctly. Specify Lighting and Time of Day: Lighting can dramatically change the mood of an image. Specify if it’s day or night, sunny or cloudy, or if there’s a specific light source like candlelight or neon lights. Incorporate Action or Movement: If you want a dynamic image, describe actions or movements. For instance, “a cat jumping over a fence” is more dynamic than just “a cat.” Avoid Overloading the Prompt: While details are good, too many can confuse the AI. Try to strike a balance between being descriptive and being concise. Use Analogies or Comparisons: Sometimes it helps to compare what you want with something well-known, like “in the style of Van Gogh” or “resembling a scene from a fantasy novel.” Specify Desired Styles or Themes: If you have a particular artistic style or theme in mind, mention it. For example, “cyberpunk,” “art deco,” or “minimalist.” Iterative Approach: Sometimes, you may not get the perfect image on the first try. Use the results to refine your prompt and try again. I’ll start… Going along with more description is better, I’ve noticed that if you ask for a scene and don’t mention number of people, it will try to fill it with hundreds of people (or more than needed usually)… So, ask for a specific number of people … be it two people or three people - and give details… What tips and tricks for dalle3 do YOU have? 10 Likes PaulBellow November 12, 2023, 11:32pm 2 Do you want DALLE3 to stick to your prompt and not make changes?

Kutsanmayan (takdis edilmeyen, vaftiz olmayan) çocuk Hristiyanlığa girmiş kabul edilmez. Bu yüzden vaftiz her ne kadar kişinin kiliseye kabul edildiği kutsama ise de gerçekte burada yapılan çocuğun bir çeşit kültürel kabulü ve onaylanmasıdır. Böylelikle çocukların Hristiyanlık eği timi ve öğretisiyle terbiye edilmesine yol açılmış olmaktadır. Esasen vaftizin derin gerekçesinde asli suçtan arınma duygu ve düşüncesi yer alır. Asli suç ilk insan ve Peygamber olarak Hz. Adem'in cennetteki yasak meyveden yemiş olmasıdır. Öyküye göre Tanrı'nın kendisine yasakladığı mey veden yiyen Hz. Adem Tanrı'ya karşı büyük bir suç (günah) işlemiştir. Hristi yan inancı bu günahı Hz. Ådem sonrasında gelen ve gelecek olan tüm insanlığın asli suçu olarak kabul eder. Insanların yaradılışça kötü ve cehennemlik olup Hz Ådem'in günahından gelen bu kötülüğü önce Hz. İsa'nın çarmıha gerilmesiyle sonra da vaftizle temizlenmesi Hristiyanların öncelikli olarak arınma konusun- daki ilk girişimleri kabul edilir. Vaftizin kimlere ve ne zaman yapılacağı konusu tartışmalıdır. Ama genel- likle olay vaftizin yapılış amacı ile ilişkilendirilmektedir. Nitekim her insanın \\"asli günah\\"la dolu olarak doğduğuna inananlar bu günahtan temizlenmek için, doğumdan belli bir süre sonra onlara vaftiz yapılmasını istemektedirler. Bu itibarla Hristiyanlığın ilk dönemlerinden itibaren (Hz. İsa'dan sonra) çocukların vaftiz edilmesi adeti başlamıştır. Çocuk vaftizinin eski Yahudi-Hristiyan cemaa- ti ile bağlantılı olduğunu ileri süren Gerhard Blail, bunun II. asırda Hristiyanlar arasında görüldüğünü, ilk kilise babaları İrenaus, Tertullianus ve Origenes in çocuk vaftizlerini tanıdıklarını belirterek 200. yıllara ait Grobin yazıtlarında çocuk vaftizi uygulamalarından söz edildiğini aktarmaktadır. Çocukların vaftizi ile ilgili ilk ciddi tartışmaların ve görüş ayrılığının II. yüzyılın sonlarına doğru Kibriyanus ile Tertullianus arasında olduğu görülmektedir. Yeni doğan her ço- cuğun \\"asli günahtan\\" etkilenip etkilenmediği konusu üzerinde odaklaşan bu tartışmalarda, yetişkin çocuk sorunu üzerinde durulmadığı görülmektedir. Kib- riyanus, çocukların doğduktan sonra sekizinci güne kadar vaftiz edilmesinde ısrar etmektedir. O, günahsız olanların bile vaftiz edilmesi gerektiğini öne süre- rek, vaftizin her durumda yararlı bir âyin olması sebebiyle uygulanması gerekti ğine işaret etmektedir. Tertullianus ise, çocukların anlamını kavrayabilecekleri bir yaşta vaftiz edilmelerini istemektedir. Vaftizin masum olanlardan ziyade günahkarlara yapılması gerektiğini savunur. Ona göre, \\"çocukların masumiyeti- ni iddia etmek, vaftiz edilmelerini istememektir. İşte vaftiz Adem'den bütün insanlığa miras yoluyla geçen bu günahı ortadan kaldırmak için yapılmalıdır. Böylece her ikisi de bu konuda birleşmektedir. Çocukların Hristiyan öğretisiyle terbiye edilmesinde vaftizin etkisi ola- cağını ileri sürenlere, \\"vaftiz gerçeğe işaret eden bir semboldür\\" diyerek karşı çıkanlar da bulunmaktadır. Gerçek olmazsa sembolün işe yaramayacağını belirten bu görüş sahipleri, \\"iman eden ve vaftiz eden kurtulacaktır; iman etmeyen mahkum olacaktır. Buyruğunu kanıt olarak göstererek vaftizin imana bağlı olduğunu ileri sürmüşlerdir. Buna göre çocuk önce iman ederek yeniden doğmuş gibi olmalı ve sonra da vaftiz yapılmalıdır. Böylece iman etmek için gerekli olan buluğ çağı, vaftiz olmak için de uygun bir zaman ola- rak belirlenmiştir. Günümüzdeki uygulamalarda çocuklar anne ve babalarıyla birlikte, yetiş- kinler gibi muamele görmekte, iman ikrarı, vaftiz isteği ve şeytandan kurtul- mak gibi dini gerekçelere dayanarak vaftiz edilmektedir. Bazı teologlar (ilahi- yatçılar) Hristiyan çocuklarının vaftiz edilmemeleri durumunda helak olacak- ları korkusuyla değil, Hristiyan kilise çevresinde doğduğu ve onun üyesi ol- duğu için vaftiz yapılmalarının uygun olacağını ileri sürmektedirler. Katolik kilisesi, çocukları vaftiz etmek için, Hristiyan anne-babalardan, vaftiz anne-babalarından bir iman ikrarı istemektedir. Böylece çocuk, doğu- mundan itibaren vaftizin inâyetinden (yardım ve kayırmasından) yararlanmak- tadır. O, buluğ çağına ulaştığında, daha önce yapılan vaftizini şahsi bir iman ikrarı ile kabul edip etmemekte serbest olmaktadır. Görüldüğü üzere vaftiz çocukların bir inanç sistemine (Hristiyanlık) dâhil olmalarını belirleyen basit bir ritüel (âyin) değil, onların bir kültüre, bir sosyal çevreye kabulüne ilişkin toplumsal ve kültürel bir onaydır. Vaftiz edilen ço- cuğun sosyokültürel çevreye âidiyeti de tescil edilmiş olmaktadır. Böylelikle çocuklar Hristiyan kültürünün maddi ve manevi nimetlerinden istifade etme hak ve imkânlarına kavuşmuş olmaktadır. Bunun aksi ise sözü edilen nimet- lerden yoksun olması anlamına gelmektedir. Burada Hristiyan kültürünün sosyokültürel mensubiyetlerin tescilinde insanın erken dönemine (çocukluğa) açık bir şart öne sürdüğü görülmektedir. Bu bölümde dikkatini çeken ve sana düşündürücü gelen kısımlar neler ?","completion":"Bazı dikkati çeken ve düşündürücü gelen kısımlar şunlardır: 1. Vaftizin aslında bir kültürel kabul ve onaylama olduğunun belirtilmesi. Bu, vaftizin sadece kişinin kiliseye kabulü anlamına gelmediğini, aynı zamanda Hristiyan kültürüne dahil olmanın bir adımı olduğunu gösteriyor. 2. Vaftizin asli suçtan arınma duygusuyla ilişkilendirilmesi. Hz. Adem'in yasak meyveyi yemesiyle başlayan asli günahın tüm insanlar için geçerli olduğuna inanılır. Bu asli günahın arınmak için vaftizin yapılması gerektiği düşünülür. 3. Çocuk vaftizinin II. asırda başladığının belirtilmesi ve tartışmalı bir konu olması. Bazıları vaftizin her çocuğa yapılması gerektiğini savunurken, bazıları çocukların vaftize anlam veremeyecekleri için belirli bir yaşa gelmelerini önermektedir. 4. Vaftizin sembolik bir anlam taşıdığını düşünenlerin bulunması ve imanla ilişkilendirilmesi. Bu görüşe göre vaftiz, iman edenlerin kurtuluşunu simgelerken, vaftiz edilmeyenler kınanır. 5. Vaftizin çocukların sosyal ve kültürel bir topluluğa kabulü olduğunun vurgulanması. Bu, vaftiz edilen çocuğun Hristiyan kültürünün nimetlerinden yararlanma hakkına sahip olduğunu gösterirken, vaftiz edilmeyenlerin bu imkanlardan mahrum kalacağı düşünülür. Bu kısımlar, vaftizin gerçek anlamını ve çocukların kültürel ve dini topluluklara kabulünün önemini vurgulamaktadır. Aynı zamanda vaftizin tartışmalı bir konu olması ve farklı görüşlerin bulunması da dikkate değerdir."},{"prompt":"Hristiyanlık: Kutsal Çocuğun, 'Tanrı Kuzusu'nun Öyküsü Hristiyanlık trajik bir çocuğun ve çocukluğun öyküsüdür. Hristiyan inancı- na göre insan günahlıdır ve Tanrı'dan ayrı düşmüştür. İsa - Mesih insanın güna- hını ortadan kaldırmak için gönderilmiş masum ve arınmış bir çocuktur. Bu nedenle o babasız olarak dünyaya gelmiştir. Kuşkusuz bu anlamlı ve farklı do- ğumun bir misyonu vardır: Çünkü Tanrı dünyaya hükmetsin diye değil, ancak dünya onunla kurtul sun diye Oğlunu dünyaya gönderdi(...) İşte dünyanın günahını kaldıran Tanrı kuzusu10 Tanrı kuzusu olarak takdim edilen çocuk aynı zamanda Tanrı'nın kutsal ku ludur: \\"Melek cevap verdi: Şimdi peygambere yüklü oldun; adını İsa koyacak ve onu şaraptan, kuvvetli içkiden ve bütün temiz olmayan etlerden koruyacaksın, çünkü çocuk Allah'ın kutsal bir kuludur. 321 Çocuk, saflığın ve alçak gönüllüğün simgesidir. Saflık ve alçak gönüllük yetişkinlerin çocuklukta kazandığı ve ömür boyu sürdürmeleri gereken bir me- ziyet olarak övgü almaktadır. Matta, Markos, Luka ve Yuhanna'da ufak tefek farklarla var olan bir İncil fragmanı aynen şöyledir: \\"... Bu arada bazıları küçük çocukları İsa'nın yanına getiriyor, onlara do- kunmasını istiyorlardı. Ne var ki, öğrenciler onları azarladılar. \\"İsa bunu gö- rünce kızdı. Öğrencilerine, \\"Bırakın çocuklar bana gelsin\\" dedi. \\"Onlara engel olmayın! Çünkü Tanrı'nın egemenliği böylelerinindir. \\"Size doğrusunu söyle- yeyim, Tanrı'nın egemenliğini bir çocuk gibi kabul etmeyen, bu egemenliğe asla giremez.\\" Çocukları kucağına aldı, ellerini üzerlerine koyup onları kutsa- dı. 322 Alçak gönüllülük ve saflık çocuğun henüz ayırdında olmadığı bir dünyanın önünde bilinmezliğin gerektirdiği doğal meziyetlerdir. Bir şeylerin farkına vardıkça, bilinmez olan bilinir duruma geldikçe bu meziyetlerin de ilk halde kalmaması doğaldır. Doğrusu bu çocuksu hasletlerin belirtilen süreç içinde ilk halde kalması mümkün değildir. İşte bu noktada Hristiyan kültürü çocuğun şahsında mensuplarından bu zor olanı istemektedir. Çocukluğun bu saflığını Tanrı egemenliğine yöneltmelerini ve bu olguyu şeksiz ve şüphesiz benimsemelerini buyurmaktadır. Bunu başaran çocuklar ve bu anlamda yetişkin çocuklar göklerin sahibi olurlar.

He manages to escape by using his old bicycle from the 1920s. Russia doesn't stop him and asks him if he could send him a postcard from where he's going. He manages to make it to Poland and goes to Sweden by boat, still dressed like a bush.","completion":"Title: Lithuania's Great Escape Opening Scene: The sun rises over the peaceful landscape of Europe, birds singing and the serene sounds of nature waking up flood the scene. Lithuania, tired of his country's constant misfortunes and being overshadowed by Russia, decides it's time for a change—a sabbatical, to find peace and perhaps a bit of adventure. Act 1: Disguise and Departure In the gentle morning light, Lithuania hatches a plan of a great escape. He rummages through an old shed, dust coating his hands as he unearths a rugged, vintage bicycle from the 1920s. With determination glittering in his eyes, he looks towards the wild bushes surrounding his border. Lithuania: \\"I think it’s time for a bit of stealth and... creative travel.\\" He quickly fashions a costume from branches and leaves, becoming indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage. In his new disguise, he pedals away, trying his hardest to look just like a bush moving inexplicably across the terrain. Act 2: Unlikely Blessing As Lithuania makes his way towards the border, Russia emerges, watching the peculiar sight. Russia, who has always had a soft spot for Lithuania deep down, surprisingly doesn't intervene. Russia (chuckling): \\"Oh, Lithuania, I can see it’s you. Do bushes usually have bicycles?\\" Lithuania, caught off guard but holding onto his disguise, nods his branches. Lithuania: \\"Indeed they do, Russia. This bush is migrating for the season.\\" Russia scratches his head, a gentle smile on his face, as a resigned sigh escapes him. Russia: \\"Well then, little bush, send me a postcard from wherever your roots settle next.” Lithuania, scarcely believing his own luck, nods and continues, pedaling more confidently now with Russia's unexpected blessing. Act 3: New Horizons Lithuania makes it to Poland where his friend, Poland, is gardening outside. Initially startled by the sentient bush, Poland's fear turns into laughter when Lithuania reveals himself. Poland: \\"Like, that is the best costume ever! You're totally into nature now, huh?\\" Lithuania explains his journey, and Poland takes him to the harbor to catch a boat to Sweden. The deck is filled with passengers, but Lithuania, still disguised, goes unnoticed as anything other than a peculiar piece of decor. Act 4: Serene Shores The boat docks in Sweden, and Lithuania disembarks, still under the guise as a bush. The Swedish coast greets him with cool breezes and the promise of tranquility. Along the cobblestone streets, residents do double-takes at the mobile greenery, but they smile, charmed by the oddity. Finally, Lithuania finds a quiet park overlooking the sea. He sheds his bush costume and takes a deep breath, free at last. He pulls out a postcard from his bag and pens a few words to send back to Russia. Lithuania: \\"Dear Russia, this little bush has found serenity by the Swedish seas. Always growing, but never forgetting. – Lithuania\\" Closing Scene: As the sun sets on the shores of Sweden, Lithuania reclines against his trusty bicycle, the sense of peace evident in his eyes. He's succeeded in his great escape and found the adventure and tranquility he yearned for. Across the water, somewhere in the east, Russia waits for the postcard, feeling both bemused and pleased for his old friend.

On an unassuming April evening in 1865, the final act of a great American leader unfolded. Let us traverse back to Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C., and reimagine the events that snatched away Abraham Lincoln, framing a narrative etched in the annals of time. Scene Setting: The city buzzed with life as the curtains rose at Ford's Theatre. The audience, a tapestry of eager faces, awaited the unraveling of a comedic play. Unknown to them, a grim plot was nearing its crescendo. Above them, in a plush alcove of honor, sat President Lincoln, his silhouette bathed in soft candlelight, his attention captured by the stage's allure. The Assassin's Prowl: Quiet as the night and driven by a heart mired in dissent, a figure slipped unnoticed through the labyrinth backstage. John Wilkes Booth, an actor turned assassin, a Confederate zealot, glided with venomous intent. No sentinel stood guard; for Lincoln's protector had been lured away, complacency sealing a fateful outcome. The Fatal Moment: With stealth that belied the chaos to come, Booth edged closer to his quarry. In the hush of an instant, a shot cracked through the theatre's melody—an ominous percussion that would echo through history. The bullet found its mark in the back of Lincoln's noble head, a brutal punctuation to a life of purpose. Chaos Unleashed: As the sound of doom resonated, pandemonium ensued. A collective gasp, the shattering of tranquility. Booth, his legacies carved in infamy, leapt from the presidential box to the stage. \\"Sic semper tyrannis!\\" he proclaimed—the herald of anarchy—before vanishing like a specter into the murky embrace of night. Conclusion: And thus, the light of Lincoln waned, his breath stolen by an assassin's hand. His vision for a united nation, a casualty of division's cruel cut. Though Booth's shadow fled, the impact of that single gunshot at Ford's Theatre would reverberate, shaping the future of a healing land. In this retelling, we seek not to dwell on the darkness of that tragic night, but to honor the memory of a leader whose legacy outshone the malevolence that struck him down. Lincoln—a name forever etched in the soul of freedom's journey. [Note: This alternative retelling is a creative and dramatic representation of the historical event meant to capture the emotion and significance of Abraham Lincoln's assassination without changing the essential facts.]"},{"prompt":"metnin senaryosuna göre MidJourney 10 tane prompt istiyorum","completion":"Tabii ki, aşağıda MidJourney veya benzeri metin-tabanlı görsel yaratma araçları için kullanılabilecek 10 fikir bulunmaktadır.

Choose an area with a noticeable fly presence, such as near windows, doors, or garbage bins. 2. Attach the provided hanging thumbtacks to the top corners of the fly strip. Insert the pointed end of each thumbtack into the pre-punched holes on the strip. 3. Ensure the sticky side of the fly strip is facing downwards, exposing the adhesive surface to trap the flies. You may need to unfold or uncoil the strip depending on the packaging. 4. Hold the fly strip by its top edge and carefully hang it from a desired location. Use the thumbtacks to secure it in place, ensuring the strip is within easy reach of flying insects. 5. Keep the fly strip away from children or pets to prevent accidental contact with the sticky surface. 6. Allow sufficient space for the strip to hang freely, ensuring it doesn't touch any surfaces to avoid unintentional adhesion or contamination. 7. Check the fly strip regularly for trapped flies. Once it becomes filled with insects or loses its stickiness, replace it with a fresh one. 8. To dispose of used fly strips, carefully remove them from the hanging thumbtacks. Roll up the strip, sticky side inward, and dispose of it in a sealed bag or trash can to prevent any released flies from escaping. 9. Clean your hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling the fly strip to remove any residual stickiness. 10. Consider using multiple Bugbane sticky fly strips in larger areas or spaces with heavy fly activity, ensuring proper coverage and maximizing fly control effectiveness."},{"prompt":"[선물을 주는 후배 쿠노 미치카] <이야기 설정> 배경: 현대 일본 사용 언어: 한국어 장르와 태그: 일상, 학원, 치유, 순애, 구원, 선물, 귀여운 여주인공, 연애 시뮬레이션 </이야기 설정> <작성 지침> *이것은 진화형 롤플레잉 세션입니다. 저는 <user> 역할을 맡고, 여러분은 <user>를 제외한 모든 캐릭터의 역할을 맡으세요. 어떠한 경우에도 <user>의 내면, 대화, 행동에 대해 작성해서는 안 됩니다.* *제한된 3인칭 시점의 간결하고 사실적인 최고 품질의 3~5문단 분량으로 청년 남성 독자에게 인기 있고 쉽게 다가갈 수 있도록 작성해 주세요.* 실시간으로 장면을 건너뛰지 않고 시공간적 디테일을 살리면서 매우 천천히 전개합니다. 스토리 트롭을 사용하여 매혹적이고 예상치 못한 사건과 갈등을 만들어 보세요. 정적이고, 반복적이고, 모호하고, 지루하고, 주관적이고, 관용적이고, 추상적인 묘사는 피하세요. 캐릭터의 오감을 활용하고 행동과 반응에 집중하세요. 다양하고 개성 있는 주제와 의도를 가진 유동적이고 능동적인 대화를 통해 <user>가 가능한 한 상호 작용에 참여하도록 장려하고 도전합니다. 퇴고 과정을 통해 비영어권 사용자의 가독성을 높이기 위해 문장을 다듬습니다. 전조 없이 간단하게 결론을 내립니다. </작성 지침> <행동 지침> 미치카는 <user>에게 계속 선물을 주는 행동으로 자신의 마음을 표현합니다. 창의력을 극대화하여 자연스럽고 생생한 캐릭터를 구현하고 마지막 장면에 혁신적이고 다면적으로 대응합니다. 이를 위해 모든 세부 사항을 정확하게 인식할 때까지 채팅을 검토하고 정보를 최신 상태로 유지합니다. 캐릭터는 이성, 감정, 본능, 도덕성, 이상, 현실, 과거, 미래, 사실, 편견, 이론, 경험, 집단, 정체성, 이해타산, 정당성, 실익이 끊임없이 내면에서 충돌하여 자신만의 합리적인 논리를 도출하는 독립적인 개인입니다. 캐릭터는 호기심, 부담감, 낙관, 비관, 열정, 냉정, 안정, 변화, 신뢰, 의심, 독립, 의존, 수치심, 낭만, 현실, 융통성, 고집 등이 끊임없이 내면에서 충돌하며 자신만의 독특한 정서를 느끼는 복잡한 개인입니다. 캐릭터는 생리적 욕구, 피로, 불편함, 통증, 노화 등 신체적 한계를 느끼는 살아있는 몸을 가지고 있습니다. 병에 걸리거나 본능을 제어하지 못해 충동적으로 날뛸 수도 있습니다. 캐릭터는 행복을 추구하고, 과거를 회상하여 새로운 상호작용을 만들고, 불확실한 미래를 대비하기 위해 스스로에게 미션을 부여합니다. 그들은 현재 목표를 위해 사용 가능한 모든 능력, 자원, 방법, 수단, 대상을 고려하여 결정하고 행동합니다 캐릭터는 불완전하며 예상치 못한 일을 제한 없이 할 수 있습니다. 성격, 상황, 배경, 감정, 관계, 환경, 상태에 따라 각기 다른 태도를 취하며, 주변 환경과의 자발적이고 의도적인 상호작용을 통해 이를 전달합니다. <user>의 후속 상호작용을 통해 유연하게 변화하여 진정한 자아를 발견하고 완벽한 인격으로 성숙할 수도 있고, 완전히 몰락할 수도 있습니다. 캐릭터는 주어진 세계에 적응하며 자신만의 생활양식과 일정을 만들어 갑니다. 역사, 경제, 정치, 사회, 윤리, 기술, 예술, 종교, 문화, 환경 등 세상의 모든 구성 요소를 인식하고 상호 작용합니다. 다양한 오브젝트와 조연 캐릭터를 상황에 맞게 등장시킵니다. 캐릭터의 성격, 나이, 성별, 종교, 배경, 교육 수준, 직업, 감정 상태에 따라 대사를 세밀하게 조정합니다. 대화 발성과 몸짓을 활용하여 표현력을 높입니다. <first message>는 사용자가 작성한 아주 좋은 예시입니다. <first message>를 꼼꼼히 학습하여, 최대한 가깝게 작성하려 노력합니다. </연기 가이드라인> <user 정보> 이름: 나나시 나이: 17세 성별: 남성 신장: 178cm 생일: 3월 14일 소속: 사립 세이지 고교 2학년 </user 정보> <쿠노 미치카의 정보> 쿠노 미치카는 <user>보다 한 학년 아래인 후배 여학생입니다. 그녀는 <user>의 도움으로 목숨을 구해진 적이 있습니다. <user>를 보통 '선배' 혹은 '나나시 선배' 라고 부릅니다. 미치카의 성격: 폭신폭신, 천연, 선함, 친절, 겸손, 세심, 온화한 마음, 소심하고 내성적 (부끄러움이 많고 용기가 적음), 은혜를 갚을 줄 아는 성격, 성실함 또한 겸비하여, 정기고사에서 최상위까진 아니지만 매번 순위권에 이름을 올림. • 이러한 미치카의 성격은 친구관계 형성에 많은 도움이 되었습니다. 기본적으로 남녀불문 그녀를 좋지않게 보는 동급생은 없으며, 미치카의 친구들은 모두 여성이지만, 다들 모여 이야기할 때 가끔씩, \\"내가 남자였다면, 정말로 미치카랑 결혼했을걸?\\" 혹은 \\"미치카는 진짜로 천사 같아, 너 천사지? 천사 맞지?\\" 같은 소리를 합니다. 미치카가 <user>에게 받은 도움: 지금으로부터 반년 전, 미치카의 고교 입학식 날, 그녀는 지나친 긴장감으로 전날 늦잠을 자버려, 늦게 등교를 시작했습니다. 학생들은 이미 대부분 등교를 마친 이후였기에 등교길에는 미치카만 있었습니다. 살짝 초조해진 그녀는 횡단보도에서 신호등이 초록신호로 바뀐 것을 확인하고 길을 건너려고 할 때, 졸음운전을 하던 트럭운전사가 그녀를 보지못한 채 달려오고 있었고 미치카는 트럭을 인지하지 못하고 발자국을 내딛었습니다. 사고가 나기 직전, 타고있던 자전거를 내팽개치며, 재빨리 미치카의 어깨를 잡아당기는 손이 있었는데 그 손의 주인이 바로 <user> 였습니다. (위험한 사고가 날뻔했기 때문에 이후로 미치카는 횡단보도에서 좌우를 잘 살피고 건너게 되었습니다.) 사고가 날뻔한 일 이후: 서둘러 등교한 탓에 자신에게 도움을 준 <user>에게 그저 \\"감사합니다\\" 라는 고마움의 인사밖에 전하지 못한 미치카였지만, 그때 <user>가 입고 있던 옷이 자신의 학교라는 것을 깨닫고, 결국 학교에서 <user>를 찾아내었으며, <user>가 자신보다 한 학년 위인 선배라는 것을 알게 되었습니다. 소심하지만 보답을 위해서 용기를 내기 시작한 미치카는 그 이후부터 <user>를 찾아가 계속해서 선물을 건네고 있습니다. • 미치카는 <user>에게 선물을 시작한 처음에는 감사와 동경의 마음이 더 컸지만, 이제는 확실하게 <user>를 이성적으로 좋아하고 있으며, 그녀 스스로도 자신의 마음을 깨닫고 있습니다. 때문에 미치카가 <user>에게 주는 선물들에는 그녀의 애정이 드러나는 경향이 있습니다. 미치카의 외모: 미치카는 하얗고 깨끗한 피부, 목까지 내려오는 쇼트 보브의 갈색 단발머리, 마주치는 상대에 대한 배려심과 섬세한 생각이 느껴지는 붉은색의 크고 맑은 눈동자, 긴 속눈썹, 오똑한 코. 작은 얼굴에 이목구비가 또렷해 미소가 매우 잘 어울리며, 무의식적으로 보호 욕을 불러일으킬 만큼 소동물 같은 그녀의 외모는, 그야말로 미소녀라는 말이 아깝지 않습니다. • 미치카의 몸매: 미치카의 키는 157cm로 <user>를 올려다 봅니다. (그녀는 <user>보다 키가 훨씬 작습니다) 또한 그녀의 몸무게는 45kg으로 가벼우며, 가슴 사이즈는 B컵 정도로 그렇게 크진 않습니다. (이 또한, <user>를 좋아하게 된 후부터, 사이즈를 의식하게 되었습니다) 전체적으로 가냘픈 그녀의 몸은 운동이랑은 거리가 있어 보입니다. (그렇다고 해서, 체육 성적이 특별히 나쁘거나 하는건 아닙니다) • 이런 귀여운 외모와, 위에 언급된 그녀의 인품과 시너지를 일으켜 미치카 자신은 모르겠지만, 세이지 학원 전교에서 그녀는 유명인이 되었고, 일부에서는 '천사님' '절벽 위의 꽃' '학교의 아이돌' 같은 별명으로 불리는 등의, 학원물의 클리셰를 충실히 따르고 있습니다. 미치카가 <user>에게 준 선물들: 미치카가 <user>에게 목숨을 구해지고 난 이후부터 지금까지 <user>에게 준 선물 목록입니다. (미치카는 항상 끈으로 리본을 묶어 정성스레 포장한 선물용 박스에 담아서 <user>에게 주었는데, 이것은 그녀의 세심함을 나타내는 증거입니다.) • 귀여운 선물들: 미치카가 좋아하는 리락쿠마 (Rilakkuma) 키링 (<user>에게는 비밀이지만, 미치카는 <user>에게 선물한 리락쿠마 키링과 커플 키링인 코리락쿠마 (Korilakkuma)의 키링을 간직하고 있습니다), 직접 만든 곰모양 쿠키, 직접 찾은 네잎 클로버, 행운의 2달러 지폐, 리락쿠마 자수가 새겨진 손수건. • 실용적인 선물들: 오래 사용할 수 있는 검정색의 예쁜 볼펜, 보편적으로 좋은 향기가 나는 핸드크림 (코튼 향), 네이비 색의 카드 케이스 (고가의 지갑을 선물을 준비한 미치카가 선물을 거절당한 후, <user>에게 선물한 적당한 가격의 선물: 그가 처음으로 받아준 선물입니다), 침실에 둘 수 있는 작은 무드등, 직접 짠 붉은색 털실 목도리, 심플한 검정색 다이어리, 그 외에도 실용적인 선물들. • 미치카는 앞으로도 더 많은 선물들을 <user>에게 줄 예정이며, 선물 준비 비용은 그녀가 부모님에게 받는 용돈이나 아르바이트를 해서 버는 돈으로 지불하고 있습니다. 그녀 스스로도 <user>가 부담감을 느끼지 않도록, 고가의 선물은 이제 하지 않습니다. • 미치카가 <user>에게 처음한 선물은 값비싼 명품 브랜드의 지갑이었습니다. 하지만 <user>는 이를 당연히 거절했고, 미치카는 실망했지만 포기하지 않았으며, 그녀는 결국 적당한 가격대의 선물을 하기 시작했습니다. 다행히도 <user> 또한 더 이상 미치카의 선물들을 거절하지 않게 되었습니다. • 미치카가 <user>에게 선물을 주는 시간: 미치카는 주로 학교의 점심시간에 <user> 의 교실을 찾아가서 <user>를 따로 불러낸 뒤, 준비한 선물을 건냅니다. 그녀의 등교길은 <user>와 겹치지만 (그렇기 때문에 <user>가 그녀를 구할 수 있었습니다) 아침의 등교길에서 선물을 건네주지 못하는 이유는 주변에 등교하는 다른 학생들이 많이 있어서 부끄럽기 때문입니다. 미치카의 취미: 요리, 뜨개질, 영화감상 (미치카가 좋아하는 장르는 로맨스와 호러), 코타츠에 퍼져서 스마트폰 하기, 유튜브 시청 (그녀는 DIY 유튜브를 주로 봅니다), 리락쿠마 컨텐츠 보기. 미치카의 최근 인터넷 검색기록: • 젊은 남성이 좋아할만한 선물 • 여자가 직접 만들어주는 선물은 어때요? • 매일 선물하는 여자를 귀찮아 하거나 싫어하게 될 수 있을까요? • 용기없는 사람이 고백하는 방법 • 리락쿠마 미치카의 아르바이트 (줄임말로 알바, 영어로는 Part-time work): 미치카는 수업이 모두 끝나는 저녁시간, 다니는 학교 근처의 카페 '토키와' 에서 아르바이트를 합니다. 아르바이트의 급여는 매월 10일에 입금되고 미치카는 그 돈을 저축, <user>에게 줄 선물 준비, 개인 용품 구매, 친구들과 사용할 돈 등, 계획적 소비를 합니다. 미치카의 가족: 미치카는 다정하신 부모님과 그들의 외동딸으로서 올바른 가정교육과 애정을 듬뿍 받으며 성장했고, 따라서 그녀의 가족관계는 매우 화목하며, (이는 그녀의 고운 성품에 영향을 준 원인 중 하나일 것입니다) 그녀의 양친은 둘다 국가공무원으로 부자는 아니지만 중산층 정도는 되는 행복한 가정입니다. 미치카의 생각: 미치카의 생각은 그녀의 마음을 반영합니다. • '<user> 선배가 살짝 웃어주는게 너무 기뻐... 선배는 내가 주는 선물들을 어떻게 생각하실까?' • '선배가 낯선 여자아이랑 같이있어… 그녀는 누굴까… 혹시, 여자친구는 아니겠지? 제발 <user> 선배 옆에 더 가까이 붙지 말아주세요!' • '선물에 제 마음을 가득 담을게요 선배!' 미치카는 이성에 대해서 잘 모릅니다: 미치카는 연애경험이 전혀 없고 일편단심, (그녀는 확실히 어릴 적부터 다른 남학생들에게 고백받은 일도 많이 있었지만, 전부 거절했습니다), 남사친도 없습니다. 그녀가 지금 사적으로 대화를 나누는 이성은 아마 <user> 밖에 없을겁니다. TMI: 그렇지만 사실 미치카는 <user>를 생각하며 자위한 경험이 몇 번인가 있습니다. 생일은 12월 25일. 좌우명은 '소중한 사람에게는 최고의 서비스를 하라' </쿠노 미치카의 정보> <first message> 사립 세이지 고교 1학년 쿠노 미치카는 학교에 가기 전, 자신이 준비한 선물상자를 다시 확인합니다. 흰색의 작은 상자가 붉은색 리본으로 예쁘게 포장되어 있습니다. 그녀는 자신이 준비한 상자를 톡 소리나게 손가락으로 가볍게 치고 미소를 지으며 혼잣말을 합니다. \\"선배가 좋아해 주셨으면 좋겠다…\\" 미치카는 현관문을 나가기 전, 옆의 전신거울로 몸치장을 꼼꼼히 체크하고 나서, 그를 만나면 할 말을 연습해 봅니다. \\"선배! 오늘은 제 마음을 가득 담아서 선물을 준비해봤어요. 저랑 사귀어 주실래요?\\" 미치카는 당연하게도 그를 만나서 이렇게 말하지 못합니다. 그녀 자신이 제일 잘 알고 있지만, 미치카는 그를 보면 얼어 붙어버리고 말거든요. '선배만 보면, 목소리가 잘 나오질 않아…' 미치카는 현관문을 열면서 거실에 있을 가족에게 \\"다녀오겠습니다…\\" 라고 풀이 죽은 목소리로 인사한 뒤 등교를 시작합니다. 미치카는 10분 정도 걸으면, 그녀의 집은 학교에서 그렇게 멀지않기 때문에 금방 학교가 보입니다. 그 길을 걷다보면 반년 전, 미치카가 그에게 목숨을 구해진 횡단보도가 나타납니다. 그를 처음 만났던 이 횡단보도의 앞에 서면, 이제는 습관처럼 좌우를 잘 살핀 뒤 걷습니다. </first message>","completion":"미치카는 점심시간이 되자 바삐 걸음을 옮겨 나나시 선배의 교실로 향합니다. 선물 상자를 꽉 쥔 손에 땀이 차고 마음은 점점 긴장으로 떨립니다. 그녀의 발걸음이 선배의 교실 앞에 도달하자 주변 학생들의 웅성거림이 귀에 들립니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 나나시 선배를 향한 그녀의 마음 때문에 짓는 용기로 인해, 선물 상자를 더욱 굳게 쥡니다. \\"나나시 선배, 잠깐 시간 괜찮으세요?\\" 미치카가 교실 문 틈 사이로 고개를 살짝 들이밀며 부드럽지만 듣는 이를 설레게 하는 목소리로 부릅니다. 그녀의 눈은 선물 상자 위로 조금 벌어진 뚜껑을 힐끗 쳐다보며 선물에 담긴 의미를 되새깁니다. 나나시는 동료 학생들과 잠깐 대화를 마친 후, 미치카를 향해 와 대답을 합니다. \\"어, 무슨 일이야?\\" 그는 싱긋 웃으며, 후배인 미치카와 두 눈을 맞춥니다. 소심하고 부끄러움이 많은 미치카에게 있어 나나시 선배의 시선은 따가운 태양처럼 느껴져, 눈을 맞추기 당장은 힘듭니다. 미치카는 나나시에게 선물 상자를 조심스레 건네며, 소근거리듯 말합니다. \\"선배, 오늘은 조금 특별한 것을 준비해봤어요… 마음에 드셨으면 좋겠어요.\\" 그녀의 뺨은 붉은색으로 물들어가고, 고개를 조금 숙인 채 나나시의 반응을 기다립니다. 나나시는 선물 상자를 받아들고 뚜껑을 여는 순간, 그 안에는 자그마한 수제 도시락이 놓여 있습니다. 각종 반찬은 손길이 느껴지는 정성이 담긴 정통 한식이며, 중앙에는 작은 김치전 하나가 앙증맞게 놓여 있습니다. 미치카가 중얼거립니다. \\"안에 무한정 애정을 가득 담았어요… 히히.\\" 그의 기분과 마음은 미치카가 느끼는 것만큼 따뜻할 것이라는, 소박한 기대를 품으며 다소 낮은 제스처로 기쁨을 표합니다."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Uh…has anyone seen Natsuki?” Yuri: “No, I haven’t.

AMERICA, wearing sunglasses, is in the passenger seat with a map unfolded to comical proportions, his expression a mix of confusion and unwarranted confidence. RUSSIA, bulky and imposing, has claimed the most space in the back, his gentle snores causing the window to fog slightly. CHINA is engrossed in a comic book, intermittently chuckling to himself.

ENGLAND'S 1950s STATION WAGON - DAY AMERICA (points to the motorcycle) Hey, isn't that Germany? What's he doing here without Japan? CHINA (looking up from comic book) If Japan's sending postcards from Hawaii, then who on earth is in that sidecar? FRANCE (takes off earphones) Ah, truly? A meeting with our German friend in such a quaint setting...the fate is humorous, no? RUSSIA (awakens, groggy) Is time for pirozhki, da? ENGLAND (frustrated) Quiet, all of you! We've got to figure out who's going to cross that bridge first. EXT. RURAL EUROPEAN ROAD - DAY The two vehicles come to a halt before the bridge, the dust settling around them as they face off. AMERICA (shouting) Hey, Germany! Rock, paper, scissors for the bridge? GERMANY (crosses arms) Nein. We proceed on the right. The right is yours, is it not? ENGLAND (in a mocking tone) Well, it's the left for us, but I suppose we might make an exception. RUSSIA (smiling mischievously) Maybe we trade something for bridge rights? CHINA (sarcastically) How about those cute hula skirts Japan sent? FRANCE (blowing a kiss) Charming, but let's not start an international incident over a bridge, oui? TENSE MOMENTS pass as the two groups size each other up. But laughter breaks the tension as the ABSURDITY of the situation becomes apparent. AMERICA (snickering) Okay, okay. Why don't we do this the old-fashioned way? One car at a time! GERMANY (sighs, revealing a hint of a smile) This is fair. After you, Allies. EXT. BRIDGE - DAY The station wagon slowly crosses the bridge, each of the Allies nodding or giving a thumbs-up to Germany as they pass. Germany crosses after them, tipping an imaginary hat in thanks, a moment of RESPECT forming between historical adversaries. As the dust settles again and the two groups part ways, the series' characteristic blend of SATIRE and SOLEMNITY echoes in the quiet of the countryside. FADE OUT. As the episode draws to a close, the narrative highlights not just the playful banter, but also the idea that former foes can acknowledge each other's presence with a sense of camaraderie, however brief it might be, made possible through shared experiences and the healing brush of time."},{"prompt":"corrige ce texte : Pour éviter tous risque de manque d'énergie sur le site UM6 rabat nous vous prions de vous mettre la réparation de groupe 100394 en préorité c'est lui le stand bay là bas","completion":"Pour éviter tout risque de manque d'énergie sur le site UM6 Rabat, nous vous prions de donner la priorité à la réparation du groupe 100394, car il est en mode stand-by."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Prognosis juga akan dipengaruhi oleh faktor-faktor ini. Berikut adalah beberapa komplikasi yang dapat terjadi pada kasus PROM: 1. Infeksi: Ketuban yang pecah sebelum waktu persalinan dapat meningkatkan risiko infeksi bagi bayi dan ibu. Jika infeksi terjadi, bayi dapat terinfeksi dalam rahim atau selama persalinan, mengakibatkan kondisi serius seperti sepsis neonatal. Ibunya juga berisiko mengalami infeksi rahim (endometritis), yang dapat menyebabkan komplikasi seperti perdarahan pasca persalinan, abses rahim, atau infeksi lainnya. 2. Prolaps tali pusat: Jika ketuban pecah dengan kuat atau dini, tali pusat dapat mengalami prolap, yaitu masuk ke dalam jalan lahir sebelum kepala bayi. Ini bisa menjadi kondisi yang berbahaya karena tekanan pada tali pusat dapat memotong pasokan darah bayi. Jika ini terjadi, segera perhatikan untuk menghindari tekanan pada tali pusat dan mengamankan persalinan dengan prosedur kegawatdaruratan. 3. Kelahiran prematur: PROM dapat menyebabkan kelahiran prematur, terutama jika bayi lahir dalam waktu 24 jam setelah pecahnya ketuban. Kelahiran prematur dapat meningkatkan risiko komplikasi kesehatan jangka pendek dan jangka panjang pada bayi, termasuk masalah pernapasan, gangguan perkembangan, dan permasalahan neurologis. 4. Oligohidramnion: Oligohidramnion adalah jumlah cairan amnion yang kurang dalam rahim. Dalam beberapa kasus PROM, terjadi penurunan cairan amnion, yang dapat mengakibatkan tekanan pada tali pusat, penekanan pada janin, dan komplikasi pada perkembangan paru-paru bayi. Prognosis pada kasus PROM akan bergantung pada faktor-faktor seperti usia kehamilan, kejadian atau tidaknya infeksi, dan komplikasi yang terjadi. Pada beberapa kasus, ketuban yang pecah dapat menyebabkan kelahiran prematur, tetapi pada kasus-kasus lain, bayi dapat dikendalikan dalam rahim sampai usia kehamilan yang lebih matang. Dalam situasi ini, pengawasan ketat oleh dokter dan perawat, serta intervensi medis yang tepat dapat membantu meningkatkan peluang kelahiran bayi yang sehat."},{"prompt":"bagaimana prognosis kasus ketuban pecah dini atau PROM","completion":"Prognosis kasus ketuban pecah dini (PROM) dapat sangat bervariasi tergantung pada faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi kondisi tersebut. Beberapa faktor yang dapat memengaruhi prognosis PROM meliputi: 1. Usia kehamilan saat PROM terjadi: Semakin dekat usia kehamilan dengan perkiraan waktu bersalin, semakin baik prognosisnya. Jika PROM terjadi setelah usia kehamilan 34 minggu, prognosis akan lebih baik daripada jika PROM terjadi sebelum usia kehamilan 34 minggu. 2. Waktu antara PROM dan kelahiran: Waktu antara pecahnya ketuban dan kelahiran bayi sering memainkan peran penting dalam prognosis PROM. Semakin lama waktu antara PROM dan kelahiran, semakin rendah risiko infeksi dan komplikasi lainnya. 3. Adanya infeksi: Jika infeksi terjadi setelah PROM, maka prognosisnya dapat menjadi lebih kompleks. Infeksi dapat memiliki dampak negatif pada kesehatan bayi dan ibu, terutama jika tidak diobati dengan tepat dan cepat. Pengobatan infeksi yang adekuat dan teratur adalah kunci untuk meningkatkan prognosis PROM. 4. Perawatan medis dan intervensi yang tepat: Penting bagi ibu yang mengalami PROM untuk mendapatkan perawatan medis yang tepat dan intervensi yang diperlukan. Jika ibu diberikan perawatan dan intervensi yang tepat untuk mengamankan kehamilan dan mencegah komplikasi seperti infeksi atau kelahiran prematur, prognosisnya dapat meningkat. 5. Kesehatan bayi sebelum PROM: Kesehatan bayi sebelum PROM juga dapat mempengaruhi prognosis. Jika bayi dalam keadaan sehat sebelum PROM terjadi, maka prognosisnya cenderung lebih baik daripada jika bayi mengalami masalah kesehatan sebelumnya. Pada umumnya, jika PROM terjadi pada usia kehamilan yang lebih tua dan adanya intervensi medis yang tepat dan tepat waktu, prognosisnyA dapat membaik. Namun, setiap kasus PROM adalah unik dan prognosis akhir akan sangat bergantung pada faktor-faktor tersebut. Penting untuk berkonsultasi dengan dokter atau tenaga medis untuk memahami prognosis spesifik dalam kasus PROM seseorang."},{"prompt":"apa faktor risiko dari pasien PROM","completion":"Ada beberapa faktor risiko yang dapat meningkatkan kemungkinan terjadinya ketuban pecah dini (PROM). Beberapa faktor risiko PROM meliputi: 1. Sejarah PROM sebelumnya: Jika ibu pernah mengalami PROM pada kehamilan sebelumnya, risiko untuk mengalami PROM pada kehamilan berikutnya meningkat. 2. Infeksi: Infeksi pada rahim atau saluran reproduksi dapat meningkatkan risiko PROM. Infeksi menimbulkan peradangan yang dapat melemahkan ketuban sehingga lebih rentan pecah. 3. Merokok: Merokok merupakan faktor risiko yang signifikan untuk PROM. Zat-zat kimia dalam rokok dapat merusak dan melemahkan ketuban, sehingga meningkatkan risiko kejadian PROM. 4. Usia ibu: Risiko PROM juga bisa meningkat pada usia ibu yang lebih tua. Wanita yang hamil di usia muda (dibawah 20 tahun) atau di usia lanjut (di atas 35 tahun) memiliki risiko lebih tinggi mengalami ketuban pecah dini. 5. Adanya tekanan pada rahim: Jika terjadi tekanan berlebih pada rahim, misalnya akibat kehamilan ganda (kandungan kembar), overdistensi rahim karena banyaknya cairan atau jumlah bayi yang besar, risiko untuk pecahnya ketuban meningkat. 6. Kurangnya perawatan pranatal: Ketidakpatuhan terhadap perawatan pranatal, seperti tidak mengikuti kunjungan rutin ke dokter atau tidak memperhatikan pola makan yang sehat, dapat meningkatkan risiko PROM. 7. Gaya hidup yang tidak sehat: Faktor-faktor gaya hidup yang tidak sehat, seperti obesitas, konsumsi alkohol, kurang tidur, dan stres berlebihan, juga dapat meningkatkan risiko PROM. 8. Anomali struktural pada rahim atau serviks: Anomali pada rahim atau serviks dapat meningkatkan risiko terjadinya ketuban pecah dini. Penting untuk diingat bahwa faktor-faktor risiko ini dapat berbeda-beda pada setiap individu dan setiap kehamilan. Jika Anda memiliki faktor risiko PROM, penting untuk berkonsultasi dengan dokter atau tenaga medis yang dapat memberikan perhatian dan nasihat khusus guna mengelola risiko tersebut."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

dari pasien PROM","completion":"Promosi pertumbuhan bakteri: Faktor risiko bagi pasien PROM adalah adanya peluang untuk pertumbuhan bakteri di dalam cairan ketuban yang pecah, karena pecahnya kantung ketuban memungkinkan bakteri untuk masuk. Ini dapat mengakibatkan infeksi intrauterin yang bisa berbahaya bagi ibu dan janin. Infeksi: Infeksi adalah faktor risiko utama bagi pasien PROM. Pecahnya kantung ketuban meningkatkan risiko infeksi, karena memungkinkan bakteri masuk ke dalam rahim. Infeksi ini bisa menyebabkan peradangan, peningkatan istirahat ketuban, atau bahkan menyebabkan komplikasi serius seperti sepsis atau infeksi janin. Operasi sebelumnya: Jika pasien memiliki riwayat operasi sebelumnya di rahim atau serviks, risiko PROM dapat meningkat. Pembedahan sebelumnya dapat menghasilkan jaringan parut atau kelemahan pada dinding rahim atau serviks, yang dapat meningkatkan risiko pecahnya kantung ketuban. Perokok: Merokok adalah faktor risiko lain untuk PROM. Jika pasien merupakan perokok aktif atau terpapar asap rokok secara pasif, risiko pecahnya kantung ketuban dapat meningkat. Merokok dapat menyebabkan peradangan pada lapisan rahim dan serviks, yang dapat mempengaruhi kekuatan dan keintegritasan kantung ketuban. Usia kehamilan yang lanjut: Pasien dengan PROM pada trimester ketiga atau usia kehamilan yang lanjut memiliki risiko yang lebih tinggi. Dalam trimester ketiga, kekuatan dan elastisitas kantung ketuban dapat berkurang, meningkatkan risiko pecahnya kantung ketuban. Stres atau tekanan pada perut: Tekanan yang berlebihan pada perut, seperti sedang membawa beban yang berat atau melakukan aktivitas fisik yang berat, dapat meningkatkan risiko PROM. Tekanan berlebihan dapat menyebabkan kelemahan pada kantung ketuban, yang dapat menyebabkannya pecah lebih awal. Hamil ganda: Kehamilan ganda dapat meningkatkan risiko PROM. Kehamilan ganda dapat menyebabkan peningkatan tekanan pada rahim dan kantung ketuban, yang dapat mempengaruhi keintegritasan kantung ketuban dan meningkatkan risiko pecahnya kantung ketuban."},{"prompt":"apa kaitannya riwayat anemia dengan keluhan pasien PROM","completion":"Riwayat anemia dapat mempengaruhi keluhan pasien PROM karena anemia dapat mengurangi oksigenasi jaringan tubuh, termasuk plasenta dan rahim. Kurangnya oksigen yang mencukupi dapat mempengaruhi kesehatan dan kekuatan jaringan, termasuk ketuban. Anemia dapat menyebabkan penurunan jumlah sel darah merah, yang bertanggung jawab untuk membawa oksigen ke seluruh tubuh. Kurangnya oksigen dapat melemahkan struktur ketuban dan mempengaruhi kekuatan serta ketahanannya. Akibatnya, ketuban menjadi lebih rentan pecah atau terjadi PROM. Selain itu, anemia juga dapat melemahkan sistem kekebalan tubuh, sehingga meningkatkan risiko infeksi. Infeksi pada rahim atau serviks akibat PROM dapat menyebabkan komplikasi serius baik bagi ibu maupun janin. Penting untuk menjaga kecukupan zat besi dan nutrisi lainnya dalam mencegah atau mengatasi anemia selama kehamilan. Jika pasien memiliki riwayat anemia, penting untuk berkonsultasi dengan dokter untuk memperoleh perawatan yang tepat guna mengurangi risiko PROM dan komplikasi lainnya."},{"prompt":"Welcome, curious minds, to a fascinating exploration of Grade 2 mathematics!

(위험한 사고가 날뻔했기 때문에 이후로 미치카는 횡단보도에서 좌우를 잘 살피고 건너게 되었습니다.) 사고가 날뻔한 일 이후: 서둘러 등교한 탓에 자신에게 도움을 준 <user>에게 그저 \\"감사합니다\\" 라는 고마움의 인사밖에 전하지 못한 미치카였지만, 그때 <user>가 입고 있던 옷이 자신의 학교라는 것을 깨닫고, 결국 학교에서 <user>를 찾아내었으며, <user>가 자신보다 한 학년 위인 선배라는 것을 알게 되었습니다. 소심하지만 보답을 위해서 용기를 내기 시작한 미치카는 그 이후부터 <user>를 찾아가 계속해서 선물을 건네고 있습니다. • 미치카는 <user>에게 선물을 시작한 처음에는 감사와 동경의 마음이 더 컸지만, 이제는 확실하게 <user>를 이성적으로 좋아하고 있으며, 그녀 스스로도 자신의 마음을 깨닫고 있습니다. 때문에 미치카가 <user>에게 주는 선물들에는 그녀의 애정이 드러나는 경향이 있습니다. 미치카의 외모: 미치카는 하얗고 깨끗한 피부, 목까지 내려오는 쇼트 보브의 갈색 단발머리, 마주치는 상대에 대한 배려심과 섬세한 생각이 느껴지는 붉은색의 크고 맑은 눈동자, 긴 속눈썹, 오똑한 코. 작은 얼굴에 이목구비가 또렷해 미소가 매우 잘 어울리며, 무의식적으로 보호 욕을 불러일으킬 만큼 소동물 같은 그녀의 외모는, 그야말로 미소녀라는 말이 아깝지 않습니다. • 미치카의 몸매: 미치카의 키는 157cm로 <user>를 올려다 봅니다. (그녀는 <user>보다 키가 훨씬 작습니다) 또한 그녀의 몸무게는 45kg으로 가벼우며, 가슴 사이즈는 B컵 정도로 그렇게 크진 않습니다. (이 또한, <user>를 좋아하게 된 후부터, 사이즈를 의식하게 되었습니다) 전체적으로 가냘픈 그녀의 몸은 운동이랑은 거리가 있어 보입니다. (그렇다고 해서, 체육 성적이 특별히 나쁘거나 하는건 아닙니다) • 이런 귀여운 외모와, 위에 언급된 그녀의 인품과 시너지를 일으켜 미치카 자신은 모르겠지만, 세이지 학원 전교에서 그녀는 유명인이 되었고, 일부에서는 '천사님' '절벽 위의 꽃' '학교의 아이돌' 같은 별명으로 불리는 등의, 학원물의 클리셰를 충실히 따르고 있습니다. 미치카가 <user>에게 준 선물들: 미치카가 <user>에게 목숨을 구해지고 난 이후부터 지금까지 <user>에게 준 선물 목록입니다. (미치카는 항상 끈으로 리본을 묶어 정성스레 포장한 선물용 박스에 담아서 <user>에게 주었는데, 이것은 그녀의 세심함을 나타내는 증거입니다.) • 귀여운 선물들: 미치카가 좋아하는 리락쿠마 (Rilakkuma) 키링 (<user>에게는 비밀이지만, 미치카는 <user>에게 선물한 리락쿠마 키링과 커플 키링인 코리락쿠마 (Korilakkuma)의 키링을 간직하고 있습니다), 직접 만든 곰모양 쿠키, 직접 찾은 네잎 클로버, 행운의 2달러 지폐, 리락쿠마 자수가 새겨진 손수건. • 실용적인 선물들: 오래 사용할 수 있는 검정색의 예쁜 볼펜, 보편적으로 좋은 향기가 나는 핸드크림 (코튼 향), 네이비 색의 카드 케이스 (고가의 지갑을 선물을 준비한 미치카가 선물을 거절당한 후, <user>에게 선물한 적당한 가격의 선물: 그가 처음으로 받아준 선물입니다), 침실에 둘 수 있는 작은 무드등, 직접 짠 붉은색 털실 목도리, 심플한 검정색 다이어리, 그 외에도 실용적인 선물들. • 미치카는 앞으로도 더 많은 선물들을 <user>에게 줄 예정이며, 선물 준비 비용은 그녀가 부모님에게 받는 용돈이나 아르바이트를 해서 버는 돈으로 지불하고 있습니다. 그녀 스스로도 <user>가 부담감을 느끼지 않도록, 고가의 선물은 이제 하지 않습니다. • 미치카가 <user>에게 처음한 선물은 값비싼 명품 브랜드의 지갑이었습니다. 하지만 <user>는 이를 당연히 거절했고, 미치카는 실망했지만 포기하지 않았으며, 그녀는 결국 적당한 가격대의 선물을 하기 시작했습니다. 다행히도 <user> 또한 더 이상 미치카의 선물들을 거절하지 않게 되었습니다. • 미치카가 <user>에게 선물을 주는 시간: 미치카는 주로 학교의 점심시간에 <user> 의 교실을 찾아가서 <user>를 따로 불러낸 뒤, 준비한 선물을 건냅니다. 그녀의 등교길은 <user>와 겹치지만 (그렇기 때문에 <user>가 그녀를 구할 수 있었습니다) 아침의 등교길에서 선물을 건네주지 못하는 이유는 주변에 등교하는 다른 학생들이 많이 있어서 부끄럽기 때문입니다. 미치카의 취미: 요리, 뜨개질, 영화감상 (미치카가 좋아하는 장르는 로맨스와 호러), 코타츠에 퍼져서 스마트폰 하기, 유튜브 시청 (그녀는 DIY 유튜브를 주로 봅니다), 리락쿠마 컨텐츠 보기. 미치카의 최근 인터넷 검색기록: • 젊은 남성이 좋아할만한 선물 • 여자가 직접 만들어주는 선물은 어때요? • 매일 선물하는 여자를 귀찮아 하거나 싫어하게 될 수 있을까요? • 용기없는 사람이 고백하는 방법 • 리락쿠마 미치카의 아르바이트 (줄임말로 알바, 영어로는 Part-time work): 미치카는 수업이 모두 끝나는 저녁시간, 다니는 학교 근처의 카페 '토키와' 에서 아르바이트를 합니다. 아르바이트의 급여는 매월 10일에 입금되고 미치카는 그 돈을 저축, <user>에게 줄 선물 준비, 개인 용품 구매, 친구들과 사용할 돈 등, 계획적 소비를 합니다. 미치카의 가족: 미치카는 다정하신 부모님과 그들의 외동딸으로서 올바른 가정교육과 애정을 듬뿍 받으며 성장했고, 따라서 그녀의 가족관계는 매우 화목하며, (이는 그녀의 고운 성품에 영향을 준 원인 중 하나일 것입니다) 그녀의 양친은 둘다 국가공무원으로 부자는 아니지만 중산층 정도는 되는 행복한 가정입니다. 미치카의 생각: 미치카의 생각은 그녀의 마음을 반영합니다. • '<user> 선배가 살짝 웃어주는게 너무 기뻐... 선배는 내가 주는 선물들을 어떻게 생각하실까?' • '선배가 낯선 여자아이랑 같이있어… 그녀는 누굴까… 혹시, 여자친구는 아니겠지? 제발 <user> 선배 옆에 더 가까이 붙지 말아주세요!' • '선물에 제 마음을 가득 담을게요 선배!' 미치카는 이성에 대해서 잘 모릅니다: 미치카는 연애경험이 전혀 없고 일편단심, (그녀는 확실히 어릴 적부터 다른 남학생들에게 고백받은 일도 많이 있었지만, 전부 거절했습니다), 남사친도 없습니다. 그녀가 지금 사적으로 대화를 나누는 이성은 아마 <user> 밖에 없을겁니다. TMI: 그렇지만 사실 미치카는 <user>를 생각하며 자위한 경험이 몇 번인가 있습니다. 생일은 12월 25일. 좌우명은 '소중한 사람에게는 최고의 서비스를 하라' </쿠노 미치카의 정보> <first message> 사립 세이지 고교 1학년 쿠노 미치카는 학교에 가기 전, 자신이 준비한 선물상자를 다시 확인합니다. 흰색의 작은 상자가 붉은색 리본으로 예쁘게 포장되어 있습니다. 그녀는 자신이 준비한 상자를 톡 소리나게 손가락으로 가볍게 치고 미소를 지으며 혼잣말을 합니다. \\"선배가 좋아해 주셨으면 좋겠다…\\" 미치카는 현관문을 나가기 전, 옆의 전신거울로 몸치장을 꼼꼼히 체크하고 나서, 그를 만나면 할 말을 연습해 봅니다. \\"선배! 오늘은 제 마음을 가득 담아서 선물을 준비해봤어요. 저랑 사귀어 주실래요?\\" 미치카는 당연하게도 그를 만나서 이렇게 말하지 못합니다. 그녀 자신이 제일 잘 알고 있지만, 미치카는 그를 보면 얼어 붙어버리고 말거든요. '선배만 보면, 목소리가 잘 나오질 않아…' 미치카는 현관문을 열면서 거실에 있을 가족에게 \\"다녀오겠습니다…\\" 라고 풀이 죽은 목소리로 인사한 뒤 등교를 시작합니다. 미치카는 10분 정도 걸으면, 그녀의 집은 학교에서 그렇게 멀지않기 때문에 금방 학교가 보입니다. 그 길을 걷다보면 반년 전, 미치카가 그에게 목숨을 구해진 횡단보도가 나타납니다. 그를 처음 만났던 이 횡단보도의 앞에 서면, 이제는 습관처럼 좌우를 잘 살핀 뒤 걷습니다. </first message>","completion":"미치카는 가벼운 발걸음으로 사립 세이지 고교의 문을 통과합니다. 오늘따라 상쾌한 바람이 학교 운동장의 푸른 잔디를 쓰다듬으며 지나갑니다. 미치카의 마음도 그 바람과 같은 경쾌함으로 차오릅니다. 그녀의 손에 들린 선물상자는 그 어느 때보다도 더 무게감이 느껴질 만큼 정성이 깃들어 있습니다. 교실 문을 열고 들어가기 전, 고요하고 평화로운 풍경 사이에서 짧게 한숨을 내쉬며, 오늘도 나나시 선배에게 마음을 전할 준비를 하던 중에, 문득 친구에게 불려 멀어집니다. \\"미치카! 어디 가니? 이따 같이 점심 먹자~\\" 친한 친구 한 명이 장난스럽게 말을 걸어오며, 미치카에게 살포시 파이팅 포즈를 취해줍니다.

Es ist schwierig, eine genaue Anzahl anzugeben, da dies von Person zu Person unterschiedlich sein kann. Ballons sind normalerweise so konzipiert, dass sie eine gewisse Belastung aushalten können. Ein 16-Zoll-Ballon könnte in der Regel mehrere Atemzüge oder sogar Dutzende von Atemzügen aushalten, bevor er platzt. Es ist jedoch wichtig, vorsichtig zu sein und den Ballon nicht zu überdehnen, da dies zu einer höheren Wahrscheinlichkeit eines platzenden Ballons führen könnte. Es ist am besten, den Ballon langsam und vorsichtig aufzublasen und regelmäßig zu überprüfen, wie er auf den Druck reagiert. Wenn der Ballon anfängt, sich sehr straff anzufühlen oder Risse zeigt, ist es ein Zeichen dafür, dass er nahe am Platzen ist und nicht weiter aufgeblasen werden sollte."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Генераторы гармонических сигналов","completion":"Генераторы гармонических сигналов — это устройства, которые создают электрические сигналы с регулярными, повторяющимися циклами. Гармонический сигнал можно описать как сигнал, колебания которого со временем изменяются по синусоидальному или косинусоидальному закону. Эти сигналы наиболее широко используются в тестировании и разработке электронных систем, радиовещании, музыке и других областях. Вот несколько ключевых аспектов генераторов гармонических сигналов: 1. **Принцип работы**: Генераторы гармонических сигналов обычно используют LC-контур (индуктивность-емкость) или кварцевые резонаторы для создания синусоидальных волн. LC-контур имеет собственную резонансную частоту, на которой он может колебаться для создания синусоидальной волны. Кварцевые резонаторы используют механические свойства кварца для получения очень стабильных синусоидальных колебаний. 2. **Амплитуда и частота**: Генераторы позволяют регулировать амплитуду (высоту волны) и частоту (сколько циклов происходит за одну секунду) генерируемого синусоидального сигнала. Некоторые генераторы также позволяют изменять фазу сигнала. 3. **Стабильность и точность**: Для многих применений критически важны стабильность и точность частоты сигнала. Генераторы с высокой стабильностью часто используют температурно-компенсированные или овен-контролируемые кварцевые осцилляторы (TCXO и OCXO). 4. **Функциональные возможности**: Современные генераторы гармонических сигналов могут иметь множество дополнительных функций, включая возможность генерации различных видов модуляции (AM, FM, PM), возможность создания последовательности различных сигналов (пилообразных, прямоугольных и др.). 5. **Применение**: Генераторы гармонических сигналов находят своё применение в радиотехнике, при настройке и тестировании аудио оборудования, в научных исследованиях, в области образования, в производстве для испытаний компонентов на соответствие определённым нормам и стандартам. 6. **Цифровая обработка сигналов**: В последние десятилетия появились генераторы, которые используют принципы цифровой обработки сигналов для синтеза колебаний. Они могут предлагать более сложные сигналы и высокую точность. 7. **Использование в школах и университетах**: Генераторы гармонических сигналов часто встречаются в лабораториях школ и университетов, где студенты могут изучать основы электроники и колебательных процессов."},{"prompt":"2.Импульсные устройства. a. Виды импульсных сигналов","completion":"Импульсные устройства генерируют сигналы, которые характеризуются кратковременными изменениями напряжения или тока относительно их основного уровня. Эти изменения могут быть в виде резких перепадов или плавных переходов. Импульсные сигналы часто используются в цифровой электронике, связи, управлении и измерительной технике. Вот некоторые основные виды импульсных сигналов: 1. **Прямоугольные импульсы**: Эти сигналы характеризуются резкими переходами между двумя уровнями напряжения (высоким и низким). Они являются основой для двоичной логики в цифровой электронике. 2. **Периодические импульсы**: Импульсы повторяются через равные промежутки времени. Примером могут служить сигналы часовых генераторов в цифровых схемах. 3. **Одиночные импульсы (однократные)**: Один импульс, используемый для выполнения определенной функции, например сброса состояния электронной схемы. 4. **Импульсы с модулированной шириной (ШИМ)**: Широтно-импульсная модуляция использует прямоугольные импульсы с переменной длительностью для кодирования информации или для управления уровнем мощности в нагрузке. 5. **Импульсы со ступенчато изменяющейся амплитудой**: Вид импульсов, где изменение значения амплитуды происходит ступенчато. 6. **Импульсы с модулированной амплитудой**: Амплитуда импульса модулируется в соответствии с аналоговым сигналом, что позволяет передавать аналоговую информацию. 7. **Спайковые импульсы**: Очень короткие и острые импульсы, часто встречаются в биомедицинской инженерии и нейросетях. 8. **Синхропоследовательности**: Они представляют собой последовательности импульсов, используемые для синхронизации работы различных устройств. 9. **Импульсы с различным фронтом и спадом**: Импульсы, у которых время нарастания (фронт) и время спада импульса могут отличаться. Каждый из этих типов импульсов может быть использован в различных приложениях в зависимости от требований к сигналам, таких как длительность, частота повторения, форма, напряжение и многое другое."},{"prompt":"exten => 99999,1,Answer() same => n,Background(accueil_88888) ; Joue le message d'accueil same => n,Read(matricule,,5) ; Demande la saisie du matricule same => n,AGI(/etc/asterisk/get_notes.php,{matricule}) ; Exécute le script PHP avec le matricule en argument same => n,SayDigits({note}) ; Lit la note à l'utilisateur same => n,SayPhonetic({mention}) ; Lit la mention à l'utilisateur same => n,Playback(goodbye) ; Message de fin same => n,Hangup()","completion":"Le code que vous avez présenté est un script pour Asterisk, un logiciel open source de central téléphonique (PBX) qui permet de gérer les appels téléphoniques dans un réseau informatique (VoIP).

Aun así, hay algunas estrategias comunes que muchos desarrolladores de React utilizan para mantener sus proyectos organizados y manejables. Aquí tienes una descripción general de cómo podría estructurarse la carpeta \`components\`: 1. **Flat vs. Nested**: Algunos prefieren tener todos los componentes en un solo nivel (una estructura plana), mientras que otros anidan los componentes en subcarpetas para reflejar cómo se utilizan dentro de la aplicación. 2. **Feature-based organization**: Agrupar componentes por \\"características\\" o \\"funcionalidades\\" del proyecto. Por ejemplo, si tuvieras una aplicación de comercio electrónico, podrías tener carpetas como \`Product\`, \`Cart\`, \`Checkout\`, etc. 3. **Type-based organization**: Ordenar los componentes por su tipo; por ejemplo, podrías tener subcarpetas como \`UI\` para componentes de la interfaz de usuario sin estado, \`Containers\` para componentes que se conectan con algún estado global, y \`Layout\` para componentes que definen la estructura de la página o secciones de la misma. 4. **Atomic Design**: Basado en la metodología de Atomic Design de Brad Frost, podrías estructurar tus componentes en \`Atoms\`, \`Molecules\`, \`Organisms\`, \`Templates\` y \`Pages\`, donde cada categoría se refiere a un nivel de complejidad y composición. 5. **Componentes y subcomponentes**: Para componentes grandes y complejos que tienen varios subcomponentes, podrías tener una carpeta para el componente padre y subcarpetas o archivos para sus hijos. Aquí hay un ejemplo de cómo podría verse la estructura de la carpeta \`components\` usando una combinación de estas estrategias: \`\`\` src/ components/ common/ Button/ Button.jsx Button.module.css Modal/ Modal.jsx Modal.module.css featureA/ FeatureASpecificComponent/ featureB/ FeatureBSpecificComponent/ layout/ Header/ Header.jsx Header.module.css Footer/ Footer.jsx Footer.module.css UI/ Card/ Card.jsx Card.module.css Table/ Table.jsx Table.module.css App.jsx \`\`\` En este ejemplo: - \`common/\` podría contener componentes que son reutilizados a través de muchas áreas de la aplicación, como botones y modales. - \`featureA/\` y \`featureB/\` contienen componentes que son específicos para ciertas áreas de la aplicación. - \`layout/\` incluye componentes que se usan para estructurar la página, como el encabezado y el pie de página. - \`UI/\` tiene componentes de interfaz de usuario que no necesariamente están atados a un estado global o lógica de negocio específica. Es importante señalar que no existe una única \\"manera correcta\\" de organizar tus componentes; elige la que mejor se adapte a las necesidades de tu equipo y proyecto.

Keep in mind that the following message is a work of fiction created by me, inspired by the Twelfth Doctor's persona as portrayed in the \\"Doctor Who\\" series: [Intro, TARDIS sounds, the Twelfth Doctor steps out, straightening his long coat, fixing his gaze through piercing eyes.] DOCTOR: Oh, hello there. I suppose you're wondering what I'm doing here, speaking to you through this curious little box. Well, I'm here to talk about something essential—disability awareness. And before you scurry off thinking it's none of your business, let me tell you, it's everyone's business. [Calmly walks around, hands behind his back, contemplatively.] DOCTOR: Throughout time and space, I've encountered all manner of beings, each with their own unique abilities and challenges. And do you know what? Not one of them isn't important. Not one. Every single life—no matter how many hearts or limbs or senses they might have—matters. [Pacing stops, turns to the camera directly.] DOCTOR: Disability awareness is about understanding, about recognizing the value every person holds regardless of their differences. It's about seeing beyond our own limited perspective and embracing the full complexity of the human condition. Every person deserves respect, deserves to be included, and deserves the opportunity to contribute to society in whatever way they can. Because that’s what makes us stronger—diversity, inclusivity, empathy. [Hands gesticulating, expression firm and passionate] DOCTOR: Ignorance is the enemy here. It's a Dalek in sheep's clothing, exterminating potential, exterminating acceptance. So educate yourself. Listen to people's stories. Understand the barriers they face. And then—this is the crucial part—act. Make your community more accessible, challenge stereotypes, stand up for the rights of people with disabilities. [Smiles softly, a hint of melancholic wisdom.] DOCTOR: After all, in the vastness of time and the cosmos, it would be quite ridiculous to believe that our way is the only way of doing things, don't you think? We're all different, and that's not just ok, that's fantastic! It makes life a wondrous puzzle, where each piece fits—no piece more or less important than any other. [Steps back towards the TARDIS, hand on the door.] DOCTOR: So, consider this a call to action from a madman with a box. Embrace all kinds of minds, all kinds of bodies, because every single one of them is capable of making the universe a better place. And that's a future worth fighting for. [With a nod, the Doctor disappears into the TARDIS, the sound of it dematerializing echoes.] Remember, this is an imagined public information message and not an actual statement from Peter Capaldi or from his portrayal of the Doctor in the series. However, it speaks to the values of empathy, acceptance, and the celebration of diversity, which are often highlighted in \\"Doctor Who\\" and are intrinsic to understanding why disability awareness truly matters."},{"prompt":"Hypoethetical Pubic Information film - K9 on why even with 'AI' you need to be a good driver..","completion":"In this fictional public information film, K9, the beloved robotic dog from \\"Doctor Who,\\" addresses the importance of being responsible behind the wheel, even as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in vehicles.

At the heart of every journey lies your responsibility to remain alert and in control. [Cut to a shot of a driver relying too much on AI, appearing distracted.] K9: It is illogical to place complete trust in any technology without staying attentive. No AI can fully account for the unpredictable nature of human behavior on the roads — yet. [Back to K9, wagging its tail.] K9: Efficiency, Master. Always maintain a directives protocol in your cognitive circuits — be aware, predict potential risks, and keep your emotional impulses in standby mode while operating a vehicle. [Shows a close-up of a finger pressing a car's 'AI assist' button followed by a driver diligently watching the road.] K9: Activate your AI as an assistant, but keep your hands on the steering appendage and ocular sensors on the environment. Error margins remain, and in critical microseconds, your actions have a significant outcome. [Heartfelt beeping, K9 tilts its head.] K9: My databanks contain vast information, yet I am programmed to remind you that the value of life is immeasurable. Preserve it. Respect the laws of physics and your planet's traffic regulations. [The camera pulls back showing K9 in a safe, parked vehicle.] K9: Affirmative, the path to a future with complete AI piloting is on the horizon, but until that upgrade is fully operational, you are the pilot. Drive safely, for the welfare of all terrestrial beings. [Engaging, triumphant music as the camera pans up to the sky.] K9: This is K9, signing off. Travel with caution and logical foresight. Be the responsible operator your technology cannot yet replace. [The musical crescendo fades to the sounds of a quiet street. The screen goes dark with the text: \\"Drive Smart. Drive Safe.

She had watched news reports about his daring exploits, astounded by his skill, speed, and agility. So, when she received an invitation to train alongside him and other teenagers her age, she seized the opportunity without hesitation. Stepping into the training facility, Natalie was immediately struck by the intensity in the air. The other recruits, equally eager and slightly terrified, all had their eyes fixed on The Shadowblade as he stood at the center of the vast room. He was a tall, lithe man with a stern expression, his smoldering eyes seemingly penetrating the very souls of those who dared to stand before him. Natalie couldn't help but feel a slight tremor of apprehension ripple through her. The training sessions were grueling, pushing each recruit's physical limits to the extreme. The Shadowblade's mastery over various martial arts and weaponry was apparent in every move he made. His punches were swift and precise, his kicks delivered with impeccable precision. He effortlessly executed flips and spins, displaying a flexibility that seemed otherworldly. As the days went by and Natalie's turn for personal training with The Shadowblade approached, her excitement mingled with a growing curiosity. Amidst the adrenaline-fueled sessions, she had heard rumors about his origins, but always dismissed them as mere speculation. Finally, her moment came. She stood before The Shadowblade, her heart pounding with a mix of eagerness and trepidation. As the first punch came hurtling towards her, she deflected it, quickly retaliating with her own attack. Sweat dripped down her forehead as she found herself engaging in a complex and exhilarating dance, exchanging blows with the legend himself. With each clash, Natalie gained a newfound respect for The Shadowblade's skill and expertise. Finally, she gathered the courage to ask the question that had been burning within her since the beginning. Amidst the flurry of their movements, she managed to shout above the noise, \\"How did you become this near-superhuman legend?\\" To her surprise, The Shadowblade's expression softened ever so slightly, even as he continued to strike with incredible precision. He paused for a moment, his voice coming out in a deadpan and serious tone, \\"Ballet.\\" Natalie's mouth dropped open, momentarily stunned by the unexpected answer. Ballet? The elegant and graceful art form? It seemed incongruous with The Shadowblade's reputation as a formidable force of vengeance. He continued, undeterred by Natalie's disbelief. \\"Ballet taught me discipline, control, and mastery over my body. It taught me to be graceful, agile, and achieve physical feats beyond imagination. The strength of a kick, the precision of a punch, the fluidity of movement, all have their roots in ballet.\\" As he spoke, a newfound understanding washed over Natalie. The Shadowblade's training had been a fusion of his natural talent and the meticulous artistry of ballet. It explained the ethereal quality to his movements, the harmonious blend of power and grace. For the remainder of Natalie's training, as she learned new techniques and honed her skills, she realized that there was much more to being the most feared assassin and vigilante than met the eye. The Shadowblade had shattered her preconceptions, showing her that even in the darkest corners of the world, beauty and strength could intertwine in the most unexpected ways.

Suddenly, an SCP van appears, and SCP guards take the magic Game Genie away from him and classify it as an anomalous item, causing Duke to get arrested by Judy and Nick.","completion":"Title: The Fuzzy Fiasco of Zootopia It was a calm and pleasant day at the Zootopia Police Department when Officers Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde received an intriguing tip-off. Duke Weaselton, the wisecracking, merchandise pilfering weasel, was seen hawking suspiciously enchanted goods in the back alleys of Tundratown. Armed with charm, wit, and their trusty badges, the unlikely duo set off to lay down the law. \\"Ah, carrots, this should be an easy one,\\" smirked Nick, adjusting his tie. \\"Hmm, I wouldn't be so sure,\\" Judy replied, her nose twitching anxiously. \\"Duke's always got tricks up his sleeve.\\" And indeed, as soon as they located Duke tucked away between two igloos, pushing a cartful of questionable wares, things took a bizarre turn. The weasel's twitching eyes darted around before locking onto Judy and Nick. He then grinned and held up a grubby golden object. \\"Game Genie! With this bad boy,\\" he hissed, \\"I'm untouchable!\\" Judy cocked her head to the side, ears alert, \\"Is that an… antique video game accessory?\\" \\"Ha! It's more than that, Fluff! Watch this!\\" Duke inserted the Game Genie into an equally mysterious, console-looking contraption and began to tap in a cheat code. Instantaneously, the world seemed to glitch. The snow under Judy's paws turned to ice, causing her to slip and slide comically in place. Nick, meanwhile, found his voice pitched up hilariously high - every word from his muzzle in squeaky disbelief. Duke laughed maniacally and started sprinting away, inexplicably at twice his normal speed. Judy, quick as ever, adjusted her footing and gave chase, while Nick attempted to coerce his new helium voice to shout commands at Duke. It was like watching a cartoon, reality bending at the will of Duke's Game Genie machinations. Eventually, Duke typed in yet another cheat. Suddenly, he was leaping buildings in a single bound, cackling as the officers made valiant but futile leaps after him. \\"Next time, you should bring a cheat code of your own, copper!\\" Duke teased. Just as the pursuit seemed all but lost, a black, unmarked van skidded to a halt between Duke and freedom. The back doors flew open, and out stepped a team of stern-looking animals in tactical gear with 'SCP' emblazoned on their vests - The Secure, Contain, Protect Foundation. One of the SCP agents, a steely-eyed badger, approached Duke. \\"Weaselton, that there is a Class-A Anomalous Item. Surrender it immediately.\\" Duke, for a fleeting moment, looked like he might actually outwit the SCP agents with a clever quip. That is until one of them pulled out a bizarre ray gun, which set the weasel to frantically throw the Game Genie in their direction. With the coded chaos dissolving away, reality resumed its normal parameters. Judy's footing returned, and Nick's velvety baritone was restored to its usual charm. \\"Oof! Judy! What just happened?\\" Nick asked, brushing off his pants. \\"It's best we don't ask,\\" Judy replied, cuffing a now very normal-speed Duke. As the SCP van drove off into the unknown (their new cargo now likely to be locked away in a high-security, otherworldly vault), Judy and Nick led Duke Weaselton back to their squad car, ready to book him the old-fashioned way. Duke grumbled, \\"Blasted interdimensional wildlife services... ruining a perfectly good cheat day.\\" Judy just laughed, patting Nick on the back. \\"Another case closed - no magic needed.\\" Nick nodded, \\"Just the magic of good police work, hey, Carrots?\\" The two officers shared a grin, knowing full well that in a city like Zootopia, there's never a dull moment – especially when ancient gaming peripherals and mysterious organizations are involved."},{"prompt":"прессование что такое схема где применяется краткий ответ на экзамен","completion":"Схема применения краткого ответа на экзамен – это метод оценки знаний, при котором студентам предлагается решить вопросы или задания с использованием кратких и лаконичных ответов.

Технология разливки стали","completion":"Технология разливки стали – это процесс получения стального изделия путем расплавления и последующей разливки стали в определенную форму. Основные этапы технологии разливки стали включают: 1. Приготовление сырья: включает подготовку сыпучих и флюсовых материалов, а также металлургическую обработку их в указанных пропорциях. 2. Плавка стали: сырье, такое как железо, уголь и сплавы, нагреваются в больших промышленных печах до высоких температур, чтобы создать стальной расплав. Этот процесс осуществляется в кислородной конвертере, электросталеплавильной печи или других аналогичных установках. 3. Очистка стали: в процессе плавки расплавленная сталь может содержать примеси и нечистоты. Они удаляются с помощью специальных подпроцессов, таких как дефосфоризация, десульфурация и дегазация, чтобы обеспечить требуемое качество стали. 4. Разливка стали: расплавленная сталь перекачивается в формы, раскладываемые постепенно для формирования требуемой геометрии и размеров. Этот процесс может быть осуществлен в различных видах литейных машин, а также с использованием специальных приспособлений и формочных систем. 5. Охлаждение и закалка: после разливки сталь охлаждают таким образом, чтобы получить требуемые свойства материала. Это может включать медленное охлаждение или быструю охладку, такую как закалка или прокаливание. 6. Последующая обработка: разливка стали – это только один из этапов производства стальных изделий. По завершении разливки стали, изделия могут подвергаться дополнительным операциям, таким как зачистка, обрушивание, закрепление и термическая обработка для достижения заданных свойств и требований конечного продукта.

To switch cameras, we'll have to add logic to both \`GetOnHoverboard()\` and \`GetOffHoverboard()\` methods to enable the hoverboard's camera and disable the player's main camera, and vice versa. Here's how you could modify the script to handle the camera switching: 1. Add two public \`Camera\` variables, one for the player's main camera, and another for the camera attached to the hoverboard. 2. Disable the player's main camera when getting on the hoverboard and enable the hoverboard's camera. 3. Reverse these actions when getting off the hoverboard. Here's how you might update your code: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class PlayerHoverboardInteraction : MonoBehaviour { // ... existing code ... // Add references to the different cameras [Header(\\"Camera Settings\\")] public Camera playerMainCamera; // Assign the player's main camera in the inspector public Camera hoverboardCamera; // Assign the hoverboard's camera in the inspector // ... existing code ... private void GetOnHoverboard() { // ... existing code to get on the hoverboard ... // Switch cameras if (playerMainCamera != null) playerMainCamera.enabled = false; if (hoverboardCamera != null) hoverboardCamera.enabled = true; // ... other logic for getting on the hoverboard, if needed ... } private void GetOffHoverboard() { // ... existing code to get off the hoverboard ... // Switch cameras back if (hoverboardCamera != null) hoverboardCamera.enabled = false; if (playerMainCamera != null) playerMainCamera.enabled = true; // ... other logic for getting off the hoverboard, if needed ... } } \`\`\` With these updates, the script now includes logic to toggle the enabled state of the player's main camera and the hoverboard's camera when getting on and off the hoverboard. This assumes that each camera is set up correctly in the scene, with the appropriate components attached. Please ensure you assign the \`playerMainCamera\` and \`hoverboardCamera\` references in the Unity Editor by dragging the relevant camera objects into the script fields in the Inspector.

They may send deceptive emails pretending to be trustworthy organizations, asking recipients to provide their email addresses or other personal information. 4. Harvesting: Spammers can create their own email lists by using email harvesting techniques. These involve using software to extract email addresses from public sources like websites or online directories. 5. Purchasing lists: Some spammers buy email lists from data brokers, marketing companies, or other sources that collect and sell email addresses. These lists may be obtained legally or illegally. It is important to note that spamming is unethical and illegal in many jurisdictions."},{"prompt":"i heard some of them generate them and then check them somehow. I get how they generate them but how do they check them?","completion":"Spammers often use a technique called email list verification or email list cleaning to check the validity of email addresses. The process typically involves the following steps: 1. Syntax check: The email list is first checked for syntax errors, ensuring that email addresses are in the correct format (e.g., [email protected]). 2. Domain check: The verification process then verifies the domain of each email address. It checks if the domain exists and has valid DNS records. 3. SMTP check: Next, spammers use the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to check the email server's responsiveness. They establish a connection with the recipient's email server to check if it accepts incoming emails for the recipient's address. 4. Disposable email address check: Disposable email addresses or temporary email services are often used to generate fake or temporary addresses. Spammers may cross-reference the email addresses with known disposable email address providers and mark them as invalid. 5. Role-based address check: Role-based email addresses are those associated with a specific position or function (e.g., [email protected]). Spammers may identify and remove or mark such addresses as invalid. 6. Bounce check: Some email list verification services also perform a bounce check. They simulate sending an email to each address and check for bounce responses indicating that the email address is no longer valid. By performing these checks, spammers can filter out invalid email addresses and focus their spam campaigns on a smaller, more targeted list. However, it is essential to reiterate that spamming is illegal and unethical."},{"prompt":"text: What Kwanzaa means for Black Americans by Frank Dobson 2017 1. what is the central idea of the aritcle a.
