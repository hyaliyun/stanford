We are given that ( d ) and ( n ) are positive integers such that ( d ) divides ( n ), ( n > 1000 ), and ( n ) is not a perfect square. We need to minimize ( leftlvert d - sqrt{n} rightrvert ). 2. To minimize ( leftlvert d - sqrt{n} rightrvert ), we want ( sqrt{n} ) to be as close to ( d ) as possible. This implies that ( n ) should be close to ( d^2 ). 3. Consider ( n = d^2 + k ) where ( k ) is a small integer. Since ( n ) is not a perfect square, ( k neq 0 ). 4. We need ( n ) to be greater than 1000. Therefore, we need ( d^2 + k > 1000 ). 5. Let's first consider ( k = 1 ). Then ( n = d^2 + 1 ). We need ( d^2 + 1 > 1000 ), which implies ( d^2 > 999 ). Thus, ( d > sqrt{999} approx 31.6 ). The smallest integer ( d ) is 32. 6. For ( d = 32 ), ( n = 32^2 + 1 = 1025 ). We need to check if ( d = 32 ) divides ( n = 1025 ). Since ( 1025 div 32 ) is not an integer, ( d = 32 ) does not work. 7. Next, consider ( k = -1 ). Then ( n = d^2 - 1 ). We need ( d^2 - 1 > 1000 ), which implies ( d^2 > 1001 ). Thus, ( d > sqrt{1001} approx 31.6 ). The smallest integer ( d ) is 32. 8. For ( d = 32 ), ( n = 32^2 - 1 = 1023 ). We need to check if ( d = 32 ) divides ( n = 1023 ). Since ( 1023 div 32 ) is not an integer, ( d = 32 ) does not work. 9. Next, consider ( k = d ). Then ( n = d^2 + d ). We need ( d^2 + d > 1000 ). 10. Solving the quadratic inequality ( d^2 + d - 1000 > 0 ), we get: [ d = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4 cdot 1000}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{4001}}{2} ] Since ( d ) must be positive, we take the positive root: [ d = frac{-1 + sqrt{4001}}{2} approx frac{-1 + 63.25}{2} approx 31.125 ] The smallest integer ( d ) is 32. 11. For ( d = 32 ), ( n = 32^2 + 32 = 1056 ). We need to check if ( d = 32 ) divides ( n = 1056 ). Since ( 1056 div 32 = 33 ), ( d = 32 ) works. 12. Now, we calculate ( leftlvert d - sqrt{n} rightrvert ): [ leftlvert 32 - sqrt{1056} rightrvert = leftlvert 32 - sqrt{32^2 + 32} rightrvert = leftlvert 32 - sqrt{1024 + 32} rightrvert = leftlvert 32 - sqrt{1056} rightrvert ] 13.

(M.A. Evdokimov)","completion":"1. Consider the tetrahedron (ABCD), and let us start by analyzing the problem condition that the midpoints of all the heights of this tetrahedron lie on its inscribed sphere. 2. Given any height (h_i) of the tetrahedron, by the problem condition, the inequality (frac{h_i}{2} leq 2r) holds true, where (r) is the radius of the inscribed sphere. Hence, we have: h_i leq 4r quad text{for } i = 1, 2, 3, 4. 3. Let (S_i) be the area of the face onto which the height (h_i) is dropped. Our aim is to prove that all areas (S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4) are equal. 4. Suppose to the contrary that not all (S_i) are equal. Assume (S_1) is the smallest area without loss of generality (if multiple faces have the same area, pick any one of them). 5. Since not all (S_i) are equal, and (S_1) is the smallest, the following inequality must hold: frac{S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4}{4} > S_1. 6. Express the volume of the tetrahedron (V) in two ways: V = frac{1}{3} h_1 S_1 = frac{1}{3} r left( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 right) > frac{1}{3} r cdot 4 S_1, which simplifies to: frac{1}{3} h_1 S_1 > frac{1}{3} r cdot 4 S_1 implies h_1 > 4r. 7. This conclusion (h_1 > 4r) contradicts our earlier inequality (h_1 leq 4r). Therefore, our assumption that the areas (S_i) are not all equal must be incorrect. 8. Hence, all (S_i) must be equal. Given (S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = S_4 = S), then all (h_i) are also equal since: h_i = frac{3V}{S} quad text{for } i=1, 2, 3, 4. 9. Denote these equal heights by (h). From our volume relationship: h = 4r, thus the inequality (h leq 4r) turns into an equality. This can only occur if the height contains the center of the sphere and the point of tangency with the face (and similarly for each height). 10. Let (H) be the base of the height from vertex (A) on face (BCD). Since (H) is the point of tangency of this face with the sphere, let (BH = a). Using the theorem on tangents and secants, we have: a^2 = frac{h}{2} cdot h. 11. Using the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle (ABH), we have: AB^2 = AH^2 + BH^2 = h^2 + a^2 = h^2 + frac{h^2}{2} = frac{3h^2}{2}. 12. Similarly, we get the same expression for the remaining edges of the tetrahedron. Therefore, all edges of the tetrahedron are equal, indicating that the tetrahedron is indeed regular. # Conclusion: Since all heights (h_i) and areas (S_i) are equal, and the equality (h = 4r) holds, the tetrahedron must be regular (i.e., an equilateral tetrahedron).

Therefore, we substitute the center (1,2) into the equations of the given lines to see which one is satisfied: A: x+y-1=0 rightarrow 1+2-1=2 (Not satisfied) B: x+y+3=0 rightarrow 1+2+3=6 (Not satisfied) C: x-y+1=0 rightarrow 1-2+1=0 (Satisfied) D: x-y+3=0 rightarrow 1-2+3=2 (Not satisfied) Since the center (1,2) only satisfies the equation x-y+1=0, the line that bisects the circle is given by: [boxed{x-y+1=0}] Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"prompt":"a single elimination tennis tournament, there are 120 players.

To find the minimum magnitude, note that the smallest non-zero sum of the squares of three odd integers occurs when each is pm1: [ text{Thus,} quad k^2 geq 1, quad m^2 geq 1, quad n^2 geq 1 ] [ k^2 + m^2 + n^2 geq 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3 ] 8. The minimum length of the sum of these vectors is therefore: [ |vec{S}| = sqrt{3} ] 9. We can achieve a sum of overrightarrow{S} with the minimum length by choosing vectors such that k = m = n = 1, implying: [ overrightarrow{S} = overrightarrow{e_1} + overrightarrow{e_2} + overrightarrow{e_3} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{sqrt{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"Among a pile of coins, one differs in weight from the others. What is the minimum number of weighings on a balance scale needed to determine whether the faulty coin is lighter or heavier than the others?","completion":"We need to determine the minimum number of weighings required to find out whether a particular coin, which has a different weight from the others, is lighter or heavier using a balance scale. I. Solution: Step 1: Dividing the Coins into Groups 1. Divide the coins into three groups. Let’s call them Group A, Group B, and Group C. - Group A: fewer coins than half of the total number of coins. - Groups B and C: have an equal number of coins. Step 2: First Weighing (Group B vs Group C) 2. **Compare Group B and Group C on the balance scale:** a) **If the balance is level:** - This means the false coin is in Group A. - Measure Group A against an equal number of known genuine coins. b) **If the balance tips to one side:** - Assume the heavier side is Group B. - Add genuine coins to Group B from those already deemed good until we have an even number of coins. - Divide Group B into two equal parts and weigh them against each other on the scale. Step 3: Second Weighing (Further Analysis) 3. **For the tipped balance scenario (Group B heavier):** a) **If the balance levels out:** - The false coin must be in the remaining part which means it is lighter. b) **If the balance tips again:** - The side that tips heavier still contains the false coin, which means it is heavier than the others. Conditions: - This method will not be applicable for just 1 or 2 coins because it is not possible to distinguish which is the false coin with less than two weighings. II. Alternative Solution: Step 1: Different Division of Coins 1. Suppose the first group doesn’t contain fewer coins than the others and should not be greater than the sum of the other groups. - Groups A and B: equal number of coins. - Group C: same or slightly less number of coins. Step 2: If the First Group Contains Coins Equal to Other Groups 2. **Using similar balance methods:** a) **First weighing:** - Compare one of the equal groups (say Group B or C) with another group to check the balance. b) **Depending on the results:** - Select the correct group containing the false coin and repeat similar steps as mentioned above by comparing within the group and finding the heavier or lighter coin. Special Case for Five Coins: - When dealing with exactly 5 coins, a similar split as in Solution I can be followed but may involve slightly different divisions to balance and identify the heavier/lighter coin.

The even property of the function indicates symmetry, which in this context, translates to the graph of f(x) being symmetric about the vertical line x=1. This is the first step in understanding the nature of f(x) based on the given conditions. Next, we are told that for any x_{1}, x_{2} in [1,+infty) where x_{1} neq x_{2}, the inequality (x_{2}-x_{1})[f(x_{2})-f(x_{1})] < 0 holds. This implies that the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval [1,+infty). To see why, consider two cases: if x_2 > x_1, then f(x_2) - f(x_1) < 0 indicating f(x) decreases as x increases. The monotonic behavior ensures that as we move rightward from x = 1, the function values of f(x) decrease. With this understanding, let's analyze the condition f(ln a)geq f(-1). Given the symmetry about x = 1 and the monotonic decreasing nature of f(x) over [1,+infty), for f(ln a) to be greater than or equal to f(-1), the argument ln a must be within a certain distance from x = 1 that doesn't exceed the distance of -1 from x = 1.

Since the sum of all angles is 180 degrees, each angle is 60 degrees, which is acute. This triangle can exist. 2. **A right isosceles triangle**: In this triangle, one angle is a right angle (90 degrees), and the other two angles are equal.

An obtuse angle is greater than 90 degrees, which would mean all angles in this triangle would need to be greater than 90 degrees.

C: The number of students scoring above 130 points is roughly the same in Part One and Part Two. D: The average math score in Part Two is higher than the average math score in Part One.","completion":"To analyze the given options step by step, we start with the information provided in the problem and apply it to each option. **Option A:** Given the density function for Part One, φ(x)=frac{1}{10sqrt{2π}}e^{-frac{(x-110)^{2}}{200}}, we can deduce the parameters of the normal distribution. The mean mu is the value at the center of the distribution, which is 110. The variance sigma^{2} can be found from the denominator of the exponent, where 2sigma^{2}=200, leading to sigma^{2}=100 and thus sigma=10. Therefore, the math scores in Part One indeed follow a normal distribution N(110, 10^{2}). This makes option A correct in stating the distribution, but since we are looking for the incorrect conclusion, we proceed to the next options. **Option B:** For Part Two, the scores follow a normal distribution N(115, 56.25), where mu=115 and sigma^{2}=56.25, giving sigma=7.5. To find the number of students scoring between 100 and 122.5 points, we look at the probabilities within 1 and 2 standard deviations from the mean. The calculation is as follows: [P(100＜ξ＜122.5)=frac{1}{2}[P(100＜ξ＜130)+P(107.5＜ξ＜122.5)]=frac{1}{2}(0.9544+0.6826)=0.8185] This probability corresponds to 0.8185 times 750 approx 614 students. Therefore, option B is correctly calculated and thus not the incorrect conclusion. **Option D:** Comparing the means of Part One and Part Two, we have mu_{text{Part One}}=110 and mu_{text{Part Two}}=115. Since 115 > 110, the average math score in Part Two is indeed higher than in Part One, making option D correct. **Option C:** The math scores in Part One follow N(110, 10^{2}), and in Part Two, they follow N(115, 7.5^{2}). To determine if the number of students scoring above 130 points is roughly the same, we would consider the tail probabilities beyond 130 for both distributions. However, the solution incorrectly concludes without providing a detailed comparison or calculation for the probabilities of scoring above 130 in both distributions. The correct approach would involve calculating these probabilities and comparing them, but the provided solution does not do this. Therefore, the analysis provided in the solution for option C is not sufficiently detailed to conclude its correctness directly. However, based on the solution's logic, it suggests option C is correct, implying students scoring above 130 points in both parts are roughly the same due to the distribution parameters. Given the detailed analysis, the solution identifies **option A** as the incorrect conclusion because it misinterprets the correctness of the statement about the distribution of Part One's scores. However, upon closer inspection, option A accurately describes the distribution based on the given density function, making the initial solution's conclusion about option A being incorrect a misunderstanding. The correct interpretation should affirm that option A correctly identifies the distribution parameters for Part One. Therefore, the incorrect conclusion, based on the provided solution and a detailed step-by-step analysis, remains as identified in the solution, but with a clarification that option A was analyzed correctly according to the given density function. Thus, the solution's identification of the incorrect option is based on a misinterpretation of the question's intent rather than a mathematical error in analyzing the options.

Which probability is greater: that the sum is greater than 350, or that the sum is not greater than 140?","completion":"1. **Describe the problem:** We need to compare the probabilities of the following events when 70 dice (with faces numbered from 1 to 6) are thrown: (a) the sum of the numbers rolled being greater than 350, and (b) the sum of the numbers rolled being no more than 140. 2. **Transformations and Symmetry:** Consider the sum (S) of the numbers resulting from the dice rolls. If each face (x) (where (x in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})) is replaced with (7 - x), the sum (S) transforms to (490 - S). This is because each die has an expected value of (frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = 3.5), leading to the total expected sum (70 cdot 3.5 = 245). 3. **Establishing Equality:** Sets with sums over 350 are paired with sets having sums less than 140. Specifically, if a set has a sum (S) greater than 350, then the set obtained by replacing each (x) with (7 - x) has a sum of (490 - S), which is less than 140. Therefore, the count of sets with sum (> 350) equals the count of sets with sum (< 140). [ P(S > 350) = P(S < 140) ] 4. **Probability Consideration:** Given 70 dice rolls, all combinations of results are equally probable. Each number on a die (from 1 to 6) appears with equal likelihood. Hence, the symmetries we've discussed imply that choosing a set with (S > 350) is equivalent to choosing a set with (S < 140). 5. **Including the Edge Case:** Note the strict inequality (S > 350) and (S < 140) does not include the sums exactly equal to 140 or 350. The problem asks which event has a higher probability. [ P(S leq 140) = P(S < 140) + P(S = 140) ] Since every possible configuration of dice rolls is equally likely, the possibility (S = 140) needs to be added to the consideration. 6. **Conclusion:** Since (P(S > 350) = P(S < 140)) and (P(S = 140)) is a positive probability, it follows that: [ P(S leq 140) > P(S > 350) ] Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers is no more than 140 is greater than the probability that the sum is greater than 350.

Each of these polygons has at most one side along each of the sides of the square. Additionally, each polygon shares at most one side with any other polygon. 2. Therefore, each polygon can have at most ( 4 ) sides on the edges of the square plus ( (n-1) ) sides, where ( n-1 ) represents the maximum possible number of shared sides with other polygons. This gives us a total of: [ 4 + (n-1) = n + 3 ] Thus, any polygon in this decomposition can have at most ( n + 3 ) sides. 3. Now, let's explore the number of sides any polygon could potentially have. Since they must be convex and follow the above constraints, they must have at least ( 3 ) sides (a minimum requirement for any polygon) and at most ( n + 3 ) sides. 4. Suppose there are no triangles among these polygons. Then, the polygonal sides must range between ( 4 ) to ( n + 3 ) inclusive. That means every polygon should have sides that are ( 4, 5, ldots, n + 3 ). 5. Among these polygons, an ( (n+3) )-sided polygon should exist per our assumption. For an ( (n+3) )-sided polygon to exist: - It must have at most ( 4 ) sides on the boundary of the original square. - This would leave it needing ( n - 1 ) more sides, which must be shared with other polygons. However, consider this polygon: - If it has ( (n + 3) ) sides, and at most ( 4 ) sides are along the edge of the square, the remaining ( (n - 1) ) sides have to be shared with other polygons. - This equilibrium means it should share exactly ( (n - 1) ) sides with other polygons making it highly unlikely as each polygon would complexly intertwine. 6. So, for the other remaining polygons: - They can at most connect two sides to the boundary of the square. - Following the above calculation, that gives each remaining polygon at most: [ 2 + (n - 1) = n + 1 ] sides. 7. Hence, under the given setup, there cannot exist an ( (n + 2) )-sided polygon because we reach a contradiction: - The ( n + 2 ) side arrangement is not feasible with the established maximal connection limits for remaining polygons. 8.

Denote this difference by ( Delta W ): [ Delta W = W_{text{real}} - W_{text{actual}} ] - Since each fake coin causes a discrepancy of 5 zolotniks, the number of fake coins (and thus the bag number) can be deduced as: [ text{Number of fake coins} = frac{Delta W}{5} ] - Since the number of coins chosen from each bag represents the bag number, the number of fake coins corresponds to the bag from which the coins were taken. 6. **Conclusion**: - The bag containing fake coins is identified by the number derived from ( frac{Delta W}{5} ).

Recall that for a cyclic sequence, we can denote ( x_{5+k} = x_k ) for ( k = 1,2,3,4,5 ). 2. **Express the Equality to Prove:** We need to show: [ left(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5right)^2 > 4left(x_1 x_2 + x_2 x_3 + x_3 x_4 + x_4 x_5 + x_5 x_1right) ] 3. **Expanding the Left-Hand Side and Simplifying:** Consider that: [ left(sum_{k=1}^{5} x_kright)^2 = left(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5right)^2 ] Using the identity: [ left(a + b + c + d + eright)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + ae + bc + bd + be + cd + ce + de) ] Therefore: [ left(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5right)^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 + 2 sum_{1 le i < j le 5} x_i x_j ] 4. **Identifying the Necessary Difference:** The inequality can be rewritten as: [ x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 + 2 sum_{1 le i < j le 5} x_i x_j > 4 left(x_1 x_2 + x_2 x_3 + x_3 x_4 + x_4 x_5 + x_5 x_1right) ] 5. **Simplifying the Expression:** By subtracting the right-hand side from both sides, we get: [ x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 + 2 sum_{1 le i < j le 5} x_i x_j - 4 left(x_1 x_2 + x_2 x_3 + x_3 x_4 + x_4 x_5 + x_5 x_1right) > 0 ] 6. **Rewriting the Summations:** Notice that the terms ( sum_{1 le i < j le 5} x_i x_j ) include the terms ( x_1 x_3, x_1 x_4, x_2 x_4, x_2 x_5, x_3 x_5, ) and pairwise combinations not considered in the cyclic product combinations ( 4 sum_{k=1}^{5} x_k x_{k+1} ). 7. **Positive Integer Argument:** Since ( x_i ) are positive integers, the sums and cross-terms within the quadratic expansion will always introduce additional positive terms that guarantee that: [ left(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5right)^2 > 4 sum_{k=1}^{5} x_k x_{k+1} ] 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we have shown the required inequality holds for positive integers ( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 ).

Prove that the vertex ( C ) of the equilateral triangle ( ABC ) also moves uniformly along some circle.","completion":"1. **Initial setup and assumptions:** Assume points A and B move along circles O_1 and O_2, respectively, both with a constant angular velocity and clockwise. By without loss of generality, let's consider they move with an angular velocity of 1. Therefore, at time t, the arguments of vectors overrightarrow{O_{1}A} and overrightarrow{O_{2}B} are t_1 + t and t_2 + t, respectively. 2. **Using complex numbers to represent vectors:** Consider associating complex numbers to vectors on the plane. Define z(varphi) = cos(varphi) + i sin(varphi). Given this, overrightarrow{O_{1}A} and overrightarrow{O_{2}B} at time t can be represented as: [ overrightarrow{O_{1}A} = r_1 z(t_1 + t) ] [ overrightarrow{O_{2}B} = r_2 z(t_2 + t) ] 3. **Translating vectors to an origin-centered system:** Suppose O is the origin.

What is this relationship? These functions are called inverses of each other. Why is the function 1/x special in this respect? Can we name other such functions? (involutory functions).

Are there other such functions? When is the inverse of a convex function also convex, and when is it concave? 1. **Function Inverses**: - The relationship between function pairs like ( a^{x} ) and ( log_{a} x ), ( x^{n} ) and ( sqrt[n]{x} ), (frac{1}{x^{n}} ) and ( frac{1}{sqrt[n]{x}} ) derives from the fact that these functions are inverses of each other. - For example, for the pair ( a^{x} ) and ( log_{a} x ), the statement ( y = a^{x} ) can be inverted to ( x = log_{a} y ). - Similarly, ( y = x^{n} ) can be inverted as ( x = sqrt[n]{y} ), and ( y = frac{1}{x^{n}} ) can be inverted as ( x = frac{1}{sqrt[n]{y}} ). - These inverses help in establishing the functional relationship between the given pairs. 2. **Special Case of ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} )**: - The function (frac{1}{x}) is special because it is its own inverse. That is, if ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} ), then ( f(f(x)) = x ). - This makes (frac{1}{x}) an example of an involutory function, one where the function is the same as its inverse. 3. **Other Examples of Involutory Functions**: - Another classic example of an involutory function is ( f(x) = -x ). Applying ( f ) twice, i.e., ( f(f(x)) = -(-x) = x ). 4. **Inverse of Convex Functions**: - Assume ( f(x) ) is a monotonically increasing and convex function. A function ( f ) is convex if for any ( x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R} ), and ( lambda in [0,1] ): [ f(lambda x_1 + (1-lambda)x_2) leq lambda f(x_1) + (1-lambda) f(x_2) ] - Let ( varphi = f^{-1} ) be the inverse function of ( f ). - Since ( f ) is increasing and convex, ( varphi ) is also increasing. Therefore, applying ( varphi ) to both sides of the convexity inequality for ( f ) gives: [ frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = varphi left(f left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) right) < varphi left( frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2)}{2} right) ] - Let ( xi_1 = f(x_1) ) and ( xi_2 = f(x_2) ). Then ( x_1 = varphi(xi_1) ) and ( x_2 = varphi(xi_2) ). This gives: [ frac{varphi(xi_1) + varphi(xi_2)}{2} < varphi left( frac{xi_1 + xi_2}{2} right) ] - The inequality shows that if ( f ) is convex and monotonically increasing, then its inverse ( varphi ) is concave. 5. **Monotonically Decreasing Convex Functions**: - If ( f ) is convex but monotonically decreasing, then its inverse ( varphi ) is also monotonically decreasing. - From the convexity property of ( f ) and substituting similar as before, we get: [ frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = varphi left(f left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) right) > varphi left( frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2)}{2} right) ] - Hence: [ frac{varphi(xi_1) + varphi(xi_2)}{2} > varphi left( frac{xi_1 + xi_2}{2} right) ] - Therefore, a convex and monotonically decreasing function's inverse is also convex. **Conclusion**: - A monotonically increasing convex function has a concave inverse. - A monotonically decreasing convex function has a convex inverse. - Similarly, if ( f ) is concave and increasing, its inverse is convex, and if ( f ) is concave and decreasing, its inverse is concave.

Since (m) and (n) have opposite signs (given they are distinct and opposite in sign), (n) must be positive. 3. **Product and Sum of Roots (m) and (n)**: Using the properties of quadratic roots, we determine: - The product of the roots (mn) is equal to (frac{c}{a}). Since one root is positive and the other is negative, their product is negative, indicating (frac{c}{a} < 0). - The difference (n - m) is positive because (n > 0) and (m < 0). 4. **Formation of the New Quadratic Equation**: The new quadratic equation is given by (cx^2 + (m-n)ax - a = 0). 5. **Discriminant Calculation**: To determine the nature of the roots of the new quadratic equation, we calculate the discriminant ((Delta)): [ begin{aligned} Delta &= left((m-n)aright)^2 - 4 cdot c cdot (-a) &= a^2(m-n)^2 + 4ac &= a^2 left((m-n)^2 + 4 cdot frac{c}{a}right) &= a^2 (m^2 - 2mn + n^2 + 4 cdot frac{c}{a}) &= a^2 (m^2 - 2mn + n^2 + 4mn) quad left(because mn = frac{c}{a}right) &= a^2(m^2 + 2mn + n^2) &= a^2 (m + n)^2 & geq 0 quad text{(since square of any real number is non-negative)} end{aligned} ] Since the discriminant ((Delta)) is non-negative, the quadratic equation (cx^2 + (m-n)ax - a = 0) has real roots. 6. **Nature of the Real Roots**: Let the roots be (x_1) and (x_2): - Sum of the roots: [ x_1 + x_2 = frac{-(m-n)a}{c} = -frac{a(n-m)}{c} ] Given that (m < 0) and (n > 0), therefore (n - m) is positive, making (frac{a(n-m)}{c}) positive. Hence, (-frac{a(n-m)}{c}) is negative, indicating (x_1 + x_2 < 0). - Product of the roots: [ x_1 x_2 = frac{-a}{c} ] Given (c/a < 0), it follows that (-frac{a}{c}) is positive, indicating (x_1 x_2 > 0). Since the sum of the roots is negative and their product is positive, both roots (x_1) and (x_2) must be negative. # Conclusion: Based on the above calculations and properties, the roots are both negative.

Specifically, we can write ( n = 2^k times ell ), where ( ell ) is an odd number and ( k ) is a nonnegative integer. 2. **Classifying integers by their odd component:** Consider the set ( {1, 2, 3, ldots, 2012} ). We classify each integer in this set by the odd number ( ell ) in its unique representation ( 2^k times ell ). Since ( ell ) must be odd, the possible values of ( ell ) range from 1 to 2011, but only the odd numbers are considered. There are ( 1006 ) odd numbers between 1 and 2012. 3. **Counting the classes:** We have ( 1006 ) classes, each corresponding to a different odd number ( ell ). Each class contains numbers of the form ( 2^k times ell ) for various nonnegative integers ( k ). 4. **Ensuring no two numbers in the same class:** Suppose ( S ) is a subset of ( {1, 2, 3, ldots, 2012} ) with at least ( 1000 ) elements. If no two numbers in ( S ) are such that one divides twice the other, then no two numbers in ( S ) can belong to the same class with the same odd ( ell ).

We have ( m mid 2(3m) ) and ( 2m mid 2(3m) ), so at most one of these classes can contain a number from ( S ). 6. **Counting empty classes:** There are ( 669 - 505 + 1 = 165 ) odd integers in the range ( 505 leq m leq 669 ). Since at most one number from each pair ( {m, 2m} ) and ( {3m} ) can be in ( S ), at least ( frac{165}{2} + 1 = 83 ) classes must be empty. 7. **Conclusion:** If at least ( 83 ) classes are empty, then at most ( 1006 - 83 = 923 ) classes can contain elements of ( S ). Since ( S ) has at least ( 1000 ) elements, it is impossible to fit all elements of ( S ) into ( 923 ) classes without violating the condition that no two numbers in ( S ) are such that one divides twice the other.

Given the constraint that each row, column, and diagonal must have three different digits, the immediate challenge arises with the available digits. 3. **Focus on the Key Cells**: Let's consider the five key cells in the grid: the four corner cells and the center cell. Specifically: - The central cell is crucial as it intersects with both diagonals. - The four corner cells are important as they also interact with the rows, columns, and diagonals. 4. **Counting and the Pigeonhole Principle**: Note that we have five such critical positions (four corners and one center) but only four different digits. This automatically reaches a contradiction through the Pigeonhole Principle: - Pigeonhole Principle: If n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. Here, our \\"containers\\" are the key cells and our \\"items\\" are the digits. - With only four digits to fill these five cells, it is inevitable that one digit must repeat within these positions. 5. **Conclusion**: Since any valid arrangement requires these key positions (the center and corners) to all contain different digits to satisfy the row, column, and diagonal requirements, having a repeating digit in any of these positions is not permissible.

Since ( k ) must be 1 (to ensure ( n ) has exactly 30 divisors), we have: [ (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 30 ] 4. **Factorization of 30**: We need to find all combinations of ( (a+1), (b+1), (c+1) ) that multiply to 30: [ 30 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 ] Thus, the possible values for ( (a+1), (b+1), (c+1) ) are permutations of ( (2, 3, 5) ). 5. **Solving for ( a, b, c )**: [ begin{cases} a+1 = 2 & Rightarrow a = 1 b+1 = 3 & Rightarrow b = 2 c+1 = 5 & Rightarrow c = 4 end{cases} ] Similarly, we can permute ( (2, 3, 5) ) to get other combinations: [ begin{cases} a+1 = 2 & Rightarrow a = 1 b+1 = 5 & Rightarrow b = 4 c+1 = 3 & Rightarrow c = 2 end{cases} ] [ begin{cases} a+1 = 3 & Rightarrow a = 2 b+1 = 2 & Rightarrow b = 1 c+1 = 5 & Rightarrow c = 4 end{cases} ] [ begin{cases} a+1 = 3 & Rightarrow a = 2 b+1 = 5 & Rightarrow b = 4 c+1 = 2 & Rightarrow c = 1 end{cases} ] [ begin{cases} a+1 = 5 & Rightarrow a = 4 b+1 = 2 & Rightarrow b = 1 c+1 = 3 & Rightarrow c = 2 end{cases} ] [ begin{cases} a+1 = 5 & Rightarrow a = 4 b+1 = 3 & Rightarrow b = 2 c+1 = 2 & Rightarrow c = 1 end{cases} ] 6. **Constructing the Numbers**: Using the values of ( a, b, c ) from the above combinations, we get the following numbers: [ 2^1 cdot 3^2 cdot 5^4 = 2 cdot 9 cdot 625 = 11250 ] [ 2^1 cdot 3^4 cdot 5^2 = 2 cdot 81 cdot 25 = 4050 ] [ 2^2 cdot 3^1 cdot 5^4 = 4 cdot 3 cdot 625 = 7500 ] [ 2^2 cdot 3^4 cdot 5^1 = 4 cdot 81 cdot 5 = 1620 ] [ 2^4 cdot 3^1 cdot 5^2 = 16 cdot 3 cdot 25 = 1200 ] [ 2^4 cdot 3^2 cdot 5^1 = 16 cdot 9 cdot 5 = 720 ] Thus, the numbers are ( 11250, 4050, 7500, 1620, 1200, 720 ).

Simplifying the expression using algebraic identities: [ |x^2 - y^2| = |(x-y)(x+y)| = |x-y||x+y| ] Given x neq y, neither factor is zero. 2. Evaluating minimum value: Since |x-y| and |x+y| are positive, the minimum of Z occurs when x approx y, making |x-y| as small as possible while |x^2| + |y^2| remains comparatively larger. Consider x = 1+epsilon and y = 1-epsilon with epsilon approx 0. Then: [ Z = frac{|2epsilon(2+epsilon)|}{2+2epsilon^2} approx frac{4epsilon}{2} = 2epsilon ] As epsilon to 0, Z to 0. Thus, the minimum value is 0. 3. Evaluating maximum value: Using x = -y (the only scenario where x^2 = y^2), we get: [ Z = frac{|x^2 - y^2|}{|x^2| + |y^2|} = frac{0}{2|x^2|} = 0 ] Thus, the expression is also zero.

Suppose triangle ABC with angles angle A, angle B, and angle C such that angle A leq angle B leq angle C. 2. First, let's consider the scenario where triangle ABC is not an acute-angled triangle. This means that one of its angles is either right or obtuse. Without loss of generality, assume angle C geq 90^circ or angle C > 90^circ. 3. Place points A_1 on side BC, B_1 on side CA, and C_1 on side AB, such that AA_1 = BB_1 = CC_1. 4. Since angle C geq 90^circ (right or obtuse), it follows that point C_1 on AB closer to vertex A implies CC_1 < AA_1 because of the properties of the triangle's side lengths relating to its largest angle. - Specifically, for any choice of points A_1 and C_1, we have: [ CC_1 < AC < AA_1 ] 5. Thus, if triangle ABC is not an acute-angled triangle, finding A_1, B_1, C_1 with the property AA_1 = BB_1 = CC_1 is not possible. 6. Now, let's prove the other direction: if triangle ABC is acute-angled, we need to show we can choose points A_1, B_1, and C_1 with AA_1 = BB_1 = CC_1. 7.

We need to verify: - maxleft(h_a, h_b, h_cright) = h_a, - min(b, c) = b, - and h_a < b. 9. Given triangle ABC is acute-angled: - All altitudes h_a, h_b, h_c are inside the triangle, - Therefore, h_a < b, h_b < a, and h_c < b since they all lie within the triangle and not on the sides. 10. Since h_a < b, min(b, c) = b, and max(h_a, h_b, h_c) = h_a, it follows that it is possible to select x such that x lies within the interval defined above. 11.

This can be expanded as: [ frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} cdot (n cdot p) + frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} cdot (k cdot q) ] 4. Further simplification gives: [ = frac{n cdot p cdot n!}{k!(n - k)!} + frac{k cdot q cdot n!}{k!(n - k)!} = n cdot p cdot binom{n}{k} + q cdot frac{k cdot n cdot (n - 1)!}{k cdot (k - 1)!(n - k)!} ] 5. Which simplifies to: [ = n cdot left(p cdot binom{n}{k} + q cdot binom{n - 1}{k - 1}right) ] 6.

Here is the step-by-step proof: 1. **Rewriting the Left-Hand Side**: Notice that the left-hand side is a sum of reciprocals. First, we rewrite the sum by adding 1 to each term on the left-hand side, and then we compensate by subtracting 1 from the sum as follows: left(frac{1}{n} + 1right) + left(frac{1}{n+1} + 1right) + cdots + left(frac{1}{2n-1} + 1right) - n geq n(sqrt[n]{2} - 1) This can be rearranged as: left(frac{n+1}{n} + frac{n+2}{n+1} + cdots + frac{2n}{2n-1}right) - n geq n(sqrt[n]{2} - 1) Simplifying the above expression, we get: frac{n+1}{n} + frac{n+2}{n+1} + cdots + frac{2n}{2n-1} geq nsqrt[n]{2} 2. **Applying the AM-GM Inequality**: By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality, we know that for any positive real numbers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n, we have: frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n}{n} geq sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 cdots a_n} Applying the AM-GM inequality to the terms ( frac{n+1}{n}, frac{n+2}{n+1}, ldots, frac{2n}{2n-1} ), we have: frac{frac{n+1}{n} + frac{n+2}{n+1} + cdots + frac{2n}{2n-1}}{n} geq sqrt[n]{left(frac{n+1}{n}right) left(frac{n+2}{n+1}right) cdots left(frac{2n}{2n-1}right)} 3. **Simplifying the Product Inside the Root**: Observe that the product inside the nth root is a telescoping product: left(frac{n+1}{n}right) left(frac{n+2}{n+1}right) cdots left(frac{2n}{2n-1}right) = frac{n+1}{n} times frac{n+2}{n+1} times cdots times frac{2n}{2n-1} = frac{2n}{n} = 2 Therefore, sqrt[n]{left(frac{n+1}{n}right) left(frac{n+2}{n+1}right) cdots left(frac{2n}{2n-1}right)} = sqrt[n]{2} 4. **Combining the Results**: Plugging this back into our inequality, we get: frac{frac{n+1}{n} + frac{n+2}{n+1} + cdots + frac{2n}{2n-1}}{n} geq sqrt[n]{2} Multiplying both sides by n, we finally obtain: frac{n+1}{n} + frac{n+2}{n+1} + cdots + frac{2n}{2n-1} geq nsqrt[n]{2} Thus, we have shown: frac{1}{n} + frac{1}{n+1} + cdots + frac{1}{2n-1} geq n(sqrt[n]{2} - 1) (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"There are 6 identical balls labeled with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

We will analyze the problem in three different cases based on the types of plants used in the regions A, C, and E, which are not directly adjacent to each other. 1. **Case 1: All three regions A, C, E have the same type of plant** - First, choose one type of plant for regions A, C, and E. There are 4 types to choose from, giving C_{4}^{1} = 4 ways. - For each choice of plant for A, C, and E, there remain 3 plant types for regions B, D, and F. Since re-planting of the same type is permissible, each of the regions B, D, and F can be planted in 3 different ways. The total number of ways in this case is: [ 4 times 3 times 3 times 3 = 108 ] 2. **Case 2: Regions A, C, E have two different types of plants** - There are C_{4}^{2} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6 ways to choose 2 out of the 4 plant types. - These 2 chosen types can be arranged in regions A, C, and E in A_{2}^{2} = 2 ways (one type can be used in 2 regions and the other type in 1 region). - In this case, say regions A and C are of the same type, and E is another type.

Check whether 5 and 7 must be divisors of 3b + 18: - For 5 and 7, we need to check other possible values of b. If a = 2, then 4b = 6 and b = 1.5 (not an integer). For a = 0, 4b = 10, then b = 2.5 (also not an integer). Thus, b = 2 stands consistent for integer values. Re-express 4b = 10 - 2a as 2(5 - a), indicating 2 is a factor of 4b. Therefore, b must be an integer multiple of 2, b = 2n. Substituting into 3b + 18 gives: 3b + 18 = 3(2n) + 18 = 6n + 18 = 6(n + 3). This expression confirms that 6 must be a factor of 3b + 18. Since 6 is a multiple of 1, 2, 3, and 6, these must be divisors of 3b + 18. 4 and 8 are not guaranteed as divisors because 24 = 4 times 6 includes 4 and 8 only when n + 3 is even and at least 4, respectively.

The total number of horse-months used by all three is 96 (from a) + 16x (from b) + 108 (from c). The cost per horse-month is the total cost divided by the total number of horse-months: Cost per horse-month = Total cost / Total horse-months Cost per horse-month = 435 / (96 + 16x + 108) We know that b should pay Rs. 180, and b used 16x horse-months, so: 180 = (Cost per horse-month) * (16x) 180 = (435 / (96 + 16x + 108)) * (16x) Now we can solve for x: 180 = (435 * 16x) / (204 + 16x) 180 * (204 + 16x) = 435 * 16x 36720 + 2880x = 6960x 36720 = 6960x - 2880x 36720 = 4080x x = 36720 / 4080 x = 9 So, b put in the horses for boxed{9} months."},{"prompt":"Prove that it is not possible to exactly cover an 8 times 8 rectangular floor using 15 tiles of size 4 times 1 and 1 tile of size 2 times 2.","completion":"To prove that it is impossible to cover an 8 times 8 rectangular area using 15 tiles of size 4 times 1 and 1 tile of size 2 times 2, we will analyze the given problem using the coloring method and parity argument. 1. **Coloring the Grid**: - Color the 8 times 8 grid using four colors (A), (B), (C), and (D). - Each (2 times 2) block will have one cell of each color, arranged in such a way that any two diagonally opposite cells in a (2 times 2) block have the same color. - This coloring ensures that each color appears exactly once within each (2 times 2) sub-grid. 2. **Analyzing Tile Coverage**: - Each (4 times 1) tile covers four cells in a row or column. - Regardless of its orientation (horizontal or vertical), a (4 times 1) tile will cover one cell of each of the four colors (A), (B), (C), and (D). - The (2 times 2) tile covers a block of four cells forming a square and will always cover two cells of the same color (since it spans two diagonals of the (2 times 2) block) and two cells of other colors. 3. **Total Number of Cells Covered**: - The grid has a total of (8 times 8 = 64) cells. - Adding the covered areas by the given tiles: [ text{15 (}4 times 1text{ tiles)} times 4 text{ cells/tile} = 60 text{ cells} ] [ text{1 (}2 times 2text{ tile)} times 4 text{ cells/tile} = 4 text{ cells} ] [ text{Total covered cells} = 60 + 4 = 64 ] 4. **Problem arising with (2 times 2) Tile**: - When 15 tiles of (4 times 1) are placed on the grid, each color (A), (B), (C), and (D) will be reduced by (15) cells: [ 16 text{ cells/color initially} - 15 text{ cells/color used by }4 times 1text{ tiles} = 1 text{ cell/color remaining} ] - Thus, after placing the 15 (4 times 1) tiles, each of (A), (B), (C), and (D) will have precisely one cell left. 5. **Infeasibility of Placing the (2 times 2) Tile**: - The (2 times 2) tile requires four cells to fit. - Since it covers only three different colors out of the required four (due to it covering two diagonally opposite cells), it is impossible to place this tile in such a way as to cover exactly four leftover cells of distinct colors.

The crosssection of a cuboctahedron with a plane results in a regular polygon. What is the maximum number of sides this polygon can have?","completion":"The problem involves determining the maximum number of sides that a regular polygon, resulting from a sectional cut of a cuboctahedron, can have. The cuboctahedron in question is derived from a cube. We will solve this systematically. 1. **Starting with the cube and forming the cuboctahedron:** - Consider a cube with edge length 1. - The cuboctahedron is formed with vertices at the midpoints of the edges of the cube. 2. **Understanding possible sections of the cuboctahedron:** - Analyze sections parallel to the base of the cube at a height (0 < h < frac{1}{2}) from the base. In cross-sections parallel to a face of the cube, the intersection results in an octagon. Let's verify the properties of these cross-sections: 3. **Proving the regularity of the octagonal section:** - Each edge of the octagon within a face of the cube segment can be analyzed. The vertex of an edge from within a cube face is calculated as ( x ): [ frac{x}{1} = frac{h}{1/2} implies x = 2h ] - Another vertex along the diagonal edges results in the side length calculation: [ text{Diagonal edge} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - hsqrt{2} ] - For the octagon to be regular, the equality: [ 2h = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - hsqrt{2} ] - Solving for ( h ): [ 2h + hsqrt{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} implies h(2 + sqrt{2}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} implies h = frac{1/2}{2+sqrt{2}} ] Thus, we have shown an octagon (8-sided polygon) can be regular in the plane section of the cuboctahedron. 4. **Hypothetical larger section:** - Suppose an ( n )-sided regular polygon where ( n > 8 ): - The vertices of this polygon need to lie on the edges of cuboctahedron. - Any ( n ) greater than 8 implies more intersections than physically possible on different edges. Let's confirm with potential values: - Considering sections like the 6-sided hexagon: - Multiple rotations yields multiple intersection areas (each aligned by ( 90^circ, 180^circ, 270^circ )) - Combining them provides all the edges of the original cuboctahedron. 5. **Proving contradiction by maximizing intersections:** - If one edge of any sided polygon intersects more than twice, ( n) sides redistribute such that more than two vertices surpass rotational symmetries, maintaining structural constraints. 6. **Verify geometric boundary constraints:** - Each possible higher-order section (partitional 8-inside_any boundary) refrains from restructuring geometry maintaining limits. Confirms n = 8 as highest valid section. # Conclusion: The maximum number of sides on a regular polygon formed by cutting a cuboctahedron by a plane is [ boxed{8} ]"},{"prompt":"An automobile travels a/4 meters in r seconds.

Each time we draw a ball at random from the bag, we do not put the drawn ball back in the bag, but we add an additional black ball to the bag.

We will denote the foot of the altitude from ( B ) to ( AC ) as ( H ), the foot of the angle bisector from ( B ) to ( AC ) as ( D ), and the midpoint of ( AC ) as ( M ). First Solution 1. **Isosceles Triangle Case**: - If ( AB = BC ), then ( triangle ABC ) is isosceles. In this case, points ( H ), ( D ), and ( M ) coincide because all three segments (altitude, angle bisector, and median) are the same line segment. 2. **Non-isosceles Triangle Case ( (AB < BC) )**: - Since ( AB < BC ), we have ( angle A > angle C ). - Therefore, ( angle ABH < angle HBC ). - From this, we infer ( angle ABH < frac{angle ABC}{2} ), implying that ( angle ABH < angle ABD ). - This means point ( H ) lies on the segment ( AD ). 3. **Using Property of Angle Bisector**: - By the Angle Bisector Theorem, (frac{AD}{DC} = frac{AB}{BC}). Since ( AB < BC ), it follows that ( AD < DC ). - Consequently, ( AD < frac{AC}{2} ), implying ( AD < AM ). - Thus, point ( M ) lies on the segment ( CD ). 4. **Conclusion from Above Steps**: - Since ( AD < AM ) and ( H ) lies on ( AD ), and ( M ) lies on ( CD ), it follows that ( D ) lies between ( H ) and ( M ). Second Solution Consider ( triangle ABC ) again, and inscribe a circle around it. Extend line ( BD ) until it meets the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) at a point ( D_1 ). 1. **Inscribed Circle and Triangle Properties**: - ( D_1 ) is the midpoint of the arc ( AC ) that does not pass through ( B ). Therefore, the straight line through ( D_1 ) and parallel to ( BH ) (which is perpendicular to ( AC )) passes through ( M ), the midpoint of ( AC ). 2. **Conclusion Based on Circular Symmetry**: - From the symmetry and properties of the circle, ( D ) must lie between ( H ) and ( M ). Thus, we have proven that in any triangle, the angle bisector from a vertex lies between the median and the altitude drawn from the same vertex.

The intersection of these two planes has exactly one point in common with the log. Find the volume V of the wedge in terms of pi.","completion":"1. **Geometry of the Log and Cuts**: The log is a cylinder with diameter 10 inches, so the radius r is 5 inches. The first cut is perpendicular to the axis, and the second cut forms a 60^circ angle with the first. 2. **Volume of the Wedge**: The wedge can be visualized as part of a cone (since the cut at 60^circ forms a cone shape with the perpendicular cut). The volume of a full cone with this setup would be frac{1}{3}pi r^2 h, where h = r because of the 60^circ angle (forming an equilateral triangle in the cross-section). The volume of the full cone is frac{1}{3}pi (5)^2 (5) = frac{125}{3}pi. 3. **Adjusting for the Wedge**: Since the wedge forms a sector of the cone and the angle is 60^circ, this is frac{60}{360} = frac{1}{6} of the full cone.

The combined rate of A and B working together is ( frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} + frac{2}{6} = frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2} ) of the job per hour. Since the remaining job is ( frac{5}{6} ) and they work together at a rate of ( frac{1}{2} ) per hour, they will complete the remaining job in ( frac{5/6}{1/2} = frac{5}{6} times frac{2}{1} = frac{10}{6} = frac{5}{3} ) hours.

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), we can choose ( x_0 ) and ( x_1 ) such that: [ x_0 equiv 1 pmod{p_1^{alpha_1}}, quad x_0 equiv -1 pmod{p_2^{alpha_2}}, quad x_0 equiv -1 pmod{p_3^{alpha_3}}, ldots ] [ x_1 equiv -1 pmod{p_1^{alpha_1}}, quad x_1 equiv 1 pmod{p_2^{alpha_2}}, quad x_1 equiv 1 pmod{p_3^{alpha_3}}, ldots ] Then ( x_0 x_1 equiv -1 pmod{n} ). Since there are ( 2^r ) total residue sets, there would be ( 2^{r-1} ) pairs. Hence: [ P_n equiv (-1)^{2^{r-1}} pmod{n} ] For ( r ge 2 ), ( (-1)^{2^{r-1}} = 1 ). For ( r = 1 ), ( (-1)^{2^{0}} = -1 ). - **Case 2: ( n ) has a prime factor other than 2.** Write ( n = 2^k prod_{i=1}^{r} p_i^{alpha_i} ). Similar to the previous case, pairing residue classes gives ( 2^{r+1} ) pairs. - **Case 3: ( n = 2^k ).** Here, ( P_n = 1 ) if ( k ge 3 ) and ( P_n = -1 ) if ( k = 1 ) or ( k = 2 ).

Then, which of the following statements is true? A: The sample means of the two sets of sample data are the same. B: The sample medians of the two sets of sample data are the same. C: The sample standard deviations of the two sets of sample data are the same. D: The sample ranges of the two sets of sample data are the same.","completion":"To analyze the impact of adding a constant c to each element of a set of sample data on various statistical measures, we proceed as follows: **Option A: Sample Means** The mean of the original set of data is given by bar{x} = frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}. When we add a constant c to each data point, the mean of the new set becomes bar{y} = frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} + c) = frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} + frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}c = bar{x} + c. Thus, the difference between the sample means of the two sets of data is c, which means that the sample means are not the same. Therefore, option A is incorrect. **Option B: Sample Medians** The median is the middle value of a data set when it is ordered. Adding a constant c to each data point shifts all values by c, including the median. Therefore, the difference between the sample medians of the two sets of data is also c, indicating that the sample medians are not the same. Thus, option B is incorrect. **Option C: Sample Standard Deviations** The standard deviation measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean. It is calculated as sqrt{frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - bar{x})^2}. When we add a constant c to each data point, the calculation for the standard deviation of the new set does not change because the deviation of each point from the mean is unaffected by the addition of a constant to all values. Mathematically, D(y_{i}) = D(x_{i} + c) = D(x_{i}). Therefore, the sample standard deviations of the two sets of sample data are the same, making option C correct. **Option D: Sample Ranges** The range of a set of data is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the set. Since adding a constant c to each data point shifts both the maximum and minimum by the same amount, the difference (range) remains unchanged. Thus, the sample ranges of the two sets of sample data are the same, making option D correct.

Since 300 beans are randomly scattered in the rectangle, and 70 fall outside the ellipse, this suggests that 300 - 70 = 230 beans are within the area of the ellipse. Since the beans are scattered randomly, we could assume that the number of beans per unit area inside the ellipse is approximately the same as the number of beans per unit area in the entire rectangle.

According to the given information, the cost price (C.P) of 10 pens is equal to the selling price (S.P) of 5 pens.

To find the gain or loss percentage, we need to calculate the gain or loss first and then express it as a percentage of the cost price. Since the selling price is twice the cost price, there is a gain, and the gain can be calculated as: Gain = S - C Gain = 2C - C Gain = C Now, to find the gain percentage, we use the formula: Gain % = (Gain / C.P) * 100% Substituting the values we have: Gain % = (C / C) * 100% Gain % = 1 * 100% Gain % = 100% Therefore, the gain percentage is boxed{100%} ."},{"prompt":"On the board, 2017 digits are written.

In order to see the result of repeatedly performing this operation, we need to find what eventually happens to the remaining number after several iterations. 4. Notice that for any given number ( N ), the difference between ( N ) and the sum of its digits (denoted as ( S(N) )) is always a multiple of 9.

Let us examine the scenario where points O and A are in the same half-plane relative to the line BC. Let K denote the midpoint of BC and G denote the centroid of triangle ABC. 3. Extend segment OK to intersect the larger circle at point O_1. Since K is the midpoint of BC, K is also the midpoint of segment OO_1. Therefore, quadrilateral BOCO_1 is a parallelogram. 4. Note that G, the centroid of triangle ABC, also acts as the intersection point of the medians within triangle AOO_1 because AK is a median in AOO_1. The relationship among the segments AG, GK in a triangle is such that AG : GK = 2 : 1. 5. Recognize that since triangle AOO_1 is isosceles, the median OG is also the angle bisector.

If we can find a path of adjacent squares from 1 to 64 with at most 6 squares in between, then the difference between the numbers on these squares must be at least 9. - To see why, note that if there are 6 squares between 1 and 64, then the sequence of numbers could be something like 1, 2, 3, ldots, 7, 64. The difference between 1 and 64 is 63, and if we distribute this difference among 7 steps (including 1 and 64), the average difference per step is frac{63}{7} = 9. - Therefore, there must be at least one step where the difference is at least 9. 2. **Lower Bound Argument:** - We need to show that it is possible to label the squares such that the difference between any two adjacent squares is at most 9. - One way to label the squares is to number them in order by row.

At each step, we are allowed to choose two numbers A and B, erase them from the board, and then add the number A B to the board. We do this until only one number remains on the board. Can the number 2 remain?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are provided with the integers 1 through 2013 (inclusive). We are allowed to repeatedly pick any two numbers (A) and (B), replace them with (A - B), and continue this process until only one number remains. 2. **Invariant Identification:** We need to identify an invariant under the operation (A, B rightarrow A - B). An invariant is a property that remains unchanged throughout the operations. Here, we can consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the numbers on the board. 3. **Initial Sum Calculation:** First, calculate the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 2013: [ S = sum_{k=1}^{2013} k ] Using the formula for the sum of the first (n) integers: [ S = frac{2013 times (2013 + 1)}{2} ] Simplify the expression: [ S = frac{2013 times 2014}{2} ] [ S = frac{2013 times 1007 times 2}{2} ] [ S = 2013 times 1007 ] 4. **Check Parity:** Determine the parity of (2013 times 1007). Both 2013 and 1007 are odd numbers, and the product of two odd numbers is always odd. Therefore, (S) is odd. 5. **Parity After Each Operation:** Each step involves replacing (A) and (B) with (A - B). Notice that this operation does not affect the parity of the remaining sum: - If (A) and (B) are both odd or both even, (A - B) will be even. - If one of (A) or (B) is odd and the other is even, (A - B) will be odd. In either case, the parity of the overall sum remains unchanged if those chosen numbers were replaced. Thus, the parity of the sum of numbers on the board remains invariant through each operation. 6. **Conclude the Result:** We started with an odd sum (as calculated above). Since replacing two numbers with their difference preserves the parity, it is impossible to end up with an even number (2 is even). The remaining number must be an odd number. Therefore, it is not possible for the final number to be 2.

[5 points]","completion":"Given the problem to determine if all coins can be distributed evenly among the six or eight chests given their properties when opened partially, let's proceed with detailed steps to understand the solution thoroughly. Part (a) - Six Chests 1. **Understanding Orders for Two Chests**: - When any two chests are opened, they can be balanced with an equal number of coins by redistributing their contents. 2. **Grouping Chests**: - We can divide the six chests into three pairs. Let's call these pairs: ((C_1, C_2), (C_3, C_4), (C_5, C_6)). 3. **Identifying Coin Parity**: - The total number of coins in each pair must be even. Therefore, if we sum the number of coins from each chest within a pair, the sum is even. - It follows that the total number of coins in all six chests must therefore also be even because it is a sum of three even numbers: [ C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 + C_5 + C_6 equiv 0 pmod{2}. ] 4. **Dividing into Triplets**: - Now consider dividing the chest into two triplets, such as: ((C_1, C_2, C_3)) and ((C_4, C_5, C_6)). - Given the property, the coins in any set of three chests can be balanced. Therefore, the total number of coins for each triplet is divisible by three: [ C_1 + C_2 + C_3 equiv 0 pmod{3} quad text{and} quad C_4 + C_5 + C_6 equiv 0 pmod{3}. ] - Thus the total number of coins in all six chests, (N = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 + C_5 + C_6), must be divisible by 6, since 2 and 3 are co-prime: [ N equiv 0 pmod{2} quad text{and} quad N equiv 0 pmod{3} implies N equiv 0 pmod{6}. ] - Therefore, it is possible to distribute the coins evenly among the six chests.

We need to find the coordinates of ( K ) and the lengths ( AK ) and ( BK ). - Using the formula for the distance from a point to a line, we can find ( AK ) and ( BK ). 3. **Using the Law of Cosines**: - We use the Law of Cosines in ( triangle ABC ) to find the angles: [ cos angle BAC = frac{AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2}{2 cdot AB cdot AC} = frac{3^2 + 5^2 - 7^2}{2 cdot 3 cdot 5} = frac{9 + 25 - 49}{30} = frac{-15}{30} = -frac{1}{2} ] [ angle BAC = cos^{-1}left(-frac{1}{2}right) = 120^circ ] 4. **Finding ( angle AEI )**: - Since ( E ) is the reflection of ( A ) over ( BC ), ( angle AEB = 2 angle ACB ). - Let ( I ) be the incenter of ( triangle ABD ).

This means that ( v_i ) must be of the form ( v_i = u_i - k_i ) where ( k_i ) is a non-negative integer. 2. **Choose ( k_i ) appropriately:** We will choose ( k_i ) such that ( v_i ) are as close to each other as possible. One way to do this is to choose ( k_i ) such that ( v_i ) are within an interval of length 1. Specifically, we can choose ( k_i ) such that ( v_i ) are in the interval ([0, 1)). 3. **Ensure the sum of squares condition:** We need to show that (sum_{0 leq i < j leq 4} (v_i - v_j)^2 < 4). Since there are 10 terms in this sum, if each term ((v_i - v_j)^2) is less than 0.4, the total sum will be less than 4. 4. **Construct ( v_i ):** Let ( v_i = u_i - lfloor u_i rfloor ). This ensures that ( v_i in [0, 1) ) and ( u_i - v_i = lfloor u_i rfloor in mathbb{N} ). 5. **Calculate the sum of squares:** Since ( v_i in [0, 1) ), the maximum possible difference between any two ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) is less than 1. Therefore, ((v_i - v_j)^2 < 1) for all ( i ) and ( j ). 6. **Sum the squares:** [ sum_{0 leq i < j leq 4} (v_i - v_j)^2 < 10 cdot 1 = 10 ] However, we need to ensure that this sum is less than 4. To achieve this, we can use the fact that the ( v_i ) are uniformly distributed in ([0, 1)). The expected value of ((v_i - v_j)^2) is (frac{1}{6}) (since the variance of a uniform distribution on ([0, 1)) is (frac{1}{12}) and the expected value of the square of the difference is twice the variance). 7. **Expected sum of squares:** [ sum_{0 leq i < j leq 4} mathbb{E}[(v_i - v_j)^2] = 10 cdot frac{1}{6} = frac{10}{6} = frac{5}{3} < 4 ] Thus, it is always possible to find such ( v_i ) that satisfy both conditions.

We need to prove that all six individuals can sit around a round table in such a way that each pair of adjacent individuals knows each other. 2. **Understand the seating condition**: The crucial insight here is that if each subset of five people can sit together satisfying the condition, then every person in the group must know at least three other people. Let's denote the six people as ( P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, ) and ( P_6 ). 3. **Determine the minimal number of acquaintances**: Using the given condition, we can deduce that any person, say ( P_1 ), must know at least three other individuals among the remaining five (that is, ( P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, ) and ( P_6 )). If ( P_1 ) knew fewer than three people, it would be impossible to sit ( P_1 ) around the table with only one or two neighbors being his acquaintances, violating the problem’s requirement. 4. **Establish mutual connections among subsets**: Since any five out of the six people can sit around the table in harmony, consider a subset of five people: ( {P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6} ). These five can sit around the table such that each pair of adjacent individuals knows each other. Now, let’s focus on the sixth individual, say ( P_1 ).

Let’s assume that ( P_1 ) knows ( P_2, P_3,) and ( P_4 ). 5. **Insert the sixth member into the seating arrangement**: Since ( P_1 ) knows ( P_2, P_3, and P_4 ), and given that ( P_2 ) and ( P_3 ) are neighbors, or ( P_3 ) and ( P_4 ) are neighbors, ( P_1 ) can be seated between ( P_2 ) and ( P_4 ), or ( P_3 ) and either ( P_2 ) or ( P_4 ). More specifically: - If ( P_2 ) and ( P_3 ) are adjacent, ( P_1 ) can be seated between ( P_2 ) and ( P_3 ). - Alternatively, if ( P_3 ) and ( P_4 ) are adjacent, ( P_1 ) can be seated between ( P_3 ) and ( P_4 ). 6. **Conclusion**: By positioning ( P_1 ) appropriately among the mutually acquainted neighbors, the arrangement for all six people around the round table can always be done such that each pair of adjacent individuals knows one another.

We start with the given function ( f : mathbb{R} to mathbb{R} ) which satisfies the functional equation: [ f(x + f(x)) = f(x) ] for all ( x in mathbb{R} ). 2. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the function ( f ) is not constant. This implies there exist ( x, y in mathbb{R} ) such that ( f(x) < f(y) ). 3. Without loss of generality, assume ( x < y ). 4. Consider also ( x < y < x + f(x) ). Since ( f(x) ) is continuous and ( f(x + f(x)) = f(x) ), analyze the behavior of the function within this interval. 5. Let's define a line ( L ) such that it passes through the points ( (x, f(x)) ) and ( (x + f(x), f(x+f(x))) ). This line ( L ) can be represented by the equation: [ y = mx + b ] where ( n ) is a natural number and ( L ) separates the point ( (y, f(y)) ) from the points ((x, f(x))) and ((x + f(x), f(x+f(x)))). 6. Since ( f(y) > f(x) ), and ( f ) is continuous, there must be a point between ( x ) and ( x+f(x) ) where the value of ( f ) should change, conflicting with ( f(x + f(x)) = f(x) ). 7. This contradiction indicates that our initial assumption of ( f(x) < f(y) ) for some ( x ) and ( y ) is incorrect. 8. Thus, ( f ) must be constant over ( mathbb{R} ). # Conclusion: Therefore, the continuous function ( f : mathbb{R} to mathbb{R} ) satisfying ( f(x+f(x)) = f(x) ) must be a constant function.

Since the boys make up 50% of the school, the girls must make up the remaining 50% (because the total percentage must add up to 100%). Therefore: z = 100% - 50% z = 50% So, we have determined that z is boxed{50%} . However, without a specific value for y, we cannot determine the exact numerical values for x and y.

We need to prove that if every 30 of these sets have a common element, then all 50 sets have a common element. 2. **Base Case:** We start by considering the case where ( k = 30 ). By the problem's condition, any 30 sets out of the 50 have a common element. 3. **Inductive Step:** We will use induction to show that if any ( n ) sets (where ( 30 leq n < 50 )) have a common element, then ( n+1 ) sets also have a common element. 4. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for some ( n ) (where ( 30 leq n < 50 )), any ( n ) sets have a common element. Let this common element be ( x ). 5. **Extending to ( n+1 ) Sets:** Consider the ( n ) sets ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n} ) with the common element ( x ). Now, take an additional set ( A_{n+1} ). 6. **Forming New Sets:** Form a new collection of sets ( S ) by taking ( A_{n+1} ) and any ( n-1 ) sets from ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n} ). There are exactly ( binom{n}{n-1} = n ) such sets in ( S ). 7. **Common Element in New Sets:** If ( x ) is a common element in any of these ( n ) sets in ( S ), then ( x ) is a common element in ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n, A_{n+1}} ), and we are done. 8. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:** If ( x ) is not a common element in any of the sets in ( S ), then by the Pigeonhole Principle, some other element ( y ) among the 29 elements of ( A_1 ) must appear at least twice as a common element in the sets of ( S ). 9. **Conclusion:** The union of any two sets in ( S ) will include ( A_{n+1} ) and ( n-1 ) sets from ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n} ). Since ( y ) appears at least twice as a common element, ( y ) must be a common element in ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n, A_{n+1}} ). 10. **Inductive Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that if any ( n ) sets have a common element, then ( n+1 ) sets also have a common element. Starting from ( n = 30 ), we can extend this to ( n = 50 ). 11. **Final Conclusion:** Therefore, all 50 sets have a common element.

Therefore, the function h(x) can be written as: h(x) = frac{1}{cos x} + frac{1}{cos(x - frac{pi}{3})}. To simplify h(x), we find a common denominator: h(x) = frac{cos x + cos(x - frac{pi}{3})}{cos x cdot cos(x - frac{pi}{3})}.

The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 24 is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{24}{3} = frac{24 times 23 times 22}{3 times 2 times 1} = 2024 ] This means we would need 2024 planes if no four points were coplanar. 3. **Determine the number of planes to be eliminated**: Since we only have 2019 planes, we need to eliminate: [ 2024 - 2019 = 5 text{ planes} ] 4. **Analyze the effect of having points coplanar**: If ( k ) points are coplanar, the number of planes eliminated is given by: [ binom{k}{3} - 1 ] This is because (binom{k}{3}) planes are initially counted, but only one plane is needed to contain all ( k ) points, so we eliminate (binom{k}{3} - 1) planes. 5. **Consider the maximum number of points that can be coplanar**: To eliminate exactly 5 planes, we need to find ( k ) such that: [ binom{k}{3} - 1 = 5 ] Solving for ( k ): [ binom{k}{3} = 6 ] The smallest ( k ) that satisfies this is ( k = 4 ), since: [ binom{4}{3} = 4 ] This means having 4 points coplanar eliminates: [ binom{4}{3} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 text{ planes} ] 6. **Check if eliminating 5 planes is possible**: Since eliminating 3 planes requires 4 points to be coplanar, and 5 is not a multiple of 3, it is impossible to eliminate exactly 5 planes by having some points coplanar. 7. **Conclude the contradiction**: Since it is impossible to eliminate exactly 5 planes by having some points coplanar, our initial assumption that it is possible to choose 24 points and 2019 planes satisfying the given conditions must be false.

To solve this, we will use a combinatorial approach and a well-known principle called the Erdős-Szekeres theorem. Let's go through the steps to reach the conclusion: 1. According to the Erdős-Szekeres theorem, for any sequence of ( mn+1 ) distinct real numbers, there is either an increasing subsequence of length ( m+1 ) or a decreasing subsequence of length ( n+1 ). 2. To apply this theorem in the context of our problem, consider that each student has four subjects' grades, which we can denote as ((a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i)). We need to ensure that in every sufficiently large set of students, there is a subset of 10 students whose grades in at least two subjects are in non-decreasing order. 3. To form the required groups, we consider sequences in two subjects, say ( a_i ) and ( b_i ). Let us denote ( n ) as the number of subjects being considered and ( k ) as the number of students we want to find increasing or decreasing subsequences in. 4. Given four subjects (Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, Combinatorics), we need a combination such that: - The sequence is colored distinctly based on their grade arrangements. - By the Erdős-Szekeres theorem, for every Eulerian Number ( (m+n) ), any sequence longer than ( mn ) will have a large subsequence, either increasing or decreasing. 5. For sequences in ( k ) subjects, we need the count of students) ( N ) to ensure a subsequence in two subjects: [ N geq binom{c+k-1}{c-1} ] Where ( k ) is the sequence length, and ( c ) is the subjects considered. 6.

(b) To show this, notice that the circles which are tangent to ( h_i ) and ( h_j ) are homothetic with the common homothety center ( B ).

By Lemmata 1 and 2, we have ( r = u_{i, i+1} cdot d(P) ) and ( r = v_{j, j+1} cdot d(P) ) simultaneously, thus ( u_{i, i+1} = v_{j, j+1} ). To prove the converse, assume ( u_{i, i+1} = v_{j, j+1} ). Let ( P ) be the intersection of the angle bisector ( beta_{i, i+1} ) and the ellipse arc ( varepsilon_{j, j+1} ). Choose ( r = u_{i, i+1} cdot d(P) = v_{j, j+1} cdot d(P) ).

Any two numbers can be chosen from any subset, and still retain the divisibility property needed. 3. **Calculate the Total Possible Numbers:** - The sets formed are: [ {1} cup {2, 3} cup {4, 5, 6, 7} cup cdots cup {1024, ldots, 2007} ] - Counting these subsets, we find there are exactly 11 subsets. - Each subset contributes at most 2 numbers except for the first singleton subset contributes 1: [ 1 + (10 times 2) = 1 + 20 = 21 ] 4. **Constructing an Example Subset ( M ) with 21 Elements:** - We can construct such a subset using either exponential sequences like: [ A = {1, 2, 4, 8, ldots, 2^{10} } ] and [ B = {3, 6, 12, 24, ldots, 3 times 2^9 } ] - Here, ( A cup B ) where ( A ) are powers of 2 and ( B ) are multiples of 3 and powers of 2 (i.e., ( 3 times 2^k )) ensures the condition holds as: - Choosing two numbers from the same sequence assures divisibility, and any two of three numbers will always have two from the same sequence. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{21} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that points F and B are the focus and the endpoint of the conjugate axis, respectively, of the hyperbola C: frac{x^2}{a^2} frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0), if the midpoint of segment FB lies on hyperbola C, then the eccentricity of hyperbola C is _______.","completion":"This problem tests our understanding of the equation and properties of a hyperbola, mainly focusing on how to find the eccentricity. It also requires the application of the midpoint formula, making it a moderately difficult problem. Let F(c, 0) represent the focus and B(0, b) represent the endpoint of the conjugate axis. Using the midpoint formula, we can find the coordinates of the midpoint M of segment FB. Substituting these coordinates into the hyperbola's equation and combining it with the formula for eccentricity, we can calculate the desired value.

The time it takes for B to finish the race is the distance B runs divided by B's speed. So, the time for B to finish the race is 500 m / (4x) = 125/x hours. During this time, A is also running. The distance A covers in this time is A's speed multiplied by the time, which is (3x) * (125/x) = 375 m. Now, we add the 140 m head start that A had to the distance A covered while B was running the 500 m: Total distance covered by A = 140 m (head start) + 375 m = 515 m. Since the race is only 500 m long, we need to find out by how much A wins the race.

Let M(x_1,y_1), N(x_2,y_2), Q(x_0,y_0), then x_1+x_2=- frac {8k^{2}}{3+4k^{2}}, Since P is the midpoint of segment MN, we have x_{P}= frac {x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}= - frac {4k^{2}}{3+4k^{2}}. Therefore, y_{P}=k(x_{P}+1)= frac {3k}{3+4k^{2}}. Since overrightarrow {OM}+ overrightarrow {ON}= overrightarrow {OQ}, we have overrightarrow {OQ}=2 overrightarrow {OP}. Therefore, begin{cases} x_{0}=2x_{P}= - frac {8k^{2}}{3+4k^{2}} y_{0}=2y_{P}= frac {6k}{3+4k^{2}}end{cases}. Since ray OP intersects the ellipse at point Q, we have frac {x_{0}^{2}}{4}+ frac {y_{0}^{2}}{3}=1. Therefore, 3(- frac {8k^{2}}{3+4k^{2}})^{2}+4( frac {6k}{3+4k^{2}})^{2}=12. Thus, 64k^4+48k^2=4(16k^4+24k^2+9). Therefore, 48k^2=96k^2+36. Thus, -48k^2=36.

The total distance to be covered by the train is the length of the train plus the length of the platform: Total distance = Length of train + Length of platform Total distance = 360 m + 150 m Total distance = 510 m The speed of the train is given in kilometers per hour (km/hr), but the distance is in meters. To make the units consistent, we need to convert the speed of the train to meters per second (m/s). Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 45 km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 45 × (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 45 × (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the platform using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 510 m / 12.5 m/s Time = 40.8 seconds Therefore, it will take the train approximately boxed{40.8} seconds to pass the platform."},{"prompt":"Given the power function f(x)=m{x^{mfrac{1}{2}}} satisfies the condition fleft(3aright) gt fleft(aright), the range of real number a is ( ).

Given this is a power function, we determine m=1 to simplify the function expression. Therefore, we have f(x) = x^{frac{1}{2}}. 2. **Determine the function's properties**: With f(x) = x^{frac{1}{2}}, the domain of f(x) is [0, +infty). This is because the square root function is defined for non-negative numbers. Additionally, it is known that the square root function is an increasing function within its domain. This means if x_1 > x_2, then f(x_1) > f(x_2). 3. **Apply the given condition**: Given fleft(3-aright) gt fleft(aright), and knowing f(x) is increasing, we derive the following conditions: - 3-a geq 0 to ensure f(3-a) is defined. - a geq 0 to ensure f(a) is defined. - 3-a > a because f(x) is increasing, and f(3-a) > f(a). 4. **Solve the inequalities**: We solve the derived inequalities step by step. - From 3-a geq 0, we get a leq 3, which means a can be up to 3. - From a geq 0, we directly have the lower limit of a. - Solving 3-a > a gives 3 > 2a, which simplifies to a < frac{3}{2}. 5. **Combine the conditions**: Combining a geq 0 and a < frac{3}{2} gives us the final range of a as 0 leq a < frac{3}{2}.

Therefore: [ 3 times 90^circ = 270^circ ] 2. **Interior Angles Requirement in a Triangle:** - For a point to be within a triangle, the sum of the angles at that point must be [ 360^circ ]. - This means a vertex of the cube cannot be an interior point of any triangle because the sum of angles at a vertex of the cube is [ 270^circ ], whereas it needs to be [ 360^circ ] to be an interior point. 3. **Single Triangle Coverage:** - If a triangle is to cover one of the cube's vertices, one of its edges must accommodate [ 180^circ ] of the [ 270^circ ]. This leaves [ 90^circ ] to be covered by other angles of triangles at that vertex. - Hence, one triangle can cover up to [ 180^circ ] out of the [ 270^circ ]. - The remaining [ 90^circ ] at each vertex should then be covered by angles of one or more remaining triangles. 4. **Covering All Cube Vertices:** - A triangle has a total angle sum of [ 180^circ ]. For three triangles, the sum is: [ 3 times 180^circ = 540^circ ] - To cover all eight vertices of the cube, the total sum required is: [ 8 times 90^circ = 720^circ ] - This implies that there are not enough angle measures in three triangles (which sum to [ 540^circ ]) to cover all eight vertices (each needing [ 90^circ ] of coverage). **Conclusion:** It is not possible to cover the entire surface of a cube without gaps or overlaps using exactly three triangles.

Under one of the squares, there is a hidden treasure.

The result can be either: - The treasure is found. - A plaque indicates the minimum steps to the treasure. 3. **Understanding Movement on the Board**: Moving one step from a square means going to a neighboring square sharing an edge. The distances on the board follow the Manhattan or rectilinear metric. 4. **Visualizing Diagonal Search Patterns**: - If the plaque under ( U ) indicates a distance ( d ), the cells at a distance ( d ) from ( U ) form a diagonal perpendicular to the main diagonal starting from ( U ). - Next, dig another corner, say ( W ) on the same side as ( U ). As this is another corner, we continue to form diagonals as before. 5. **Worst-case Scenario Coverage**: To entirely cover the possibility of where the treasure might be if not found in the first two digs: - Assume ( W )’s plaque also indicates distance, forming a second set of diagonals perpendicular to the first. - These diagonals intersect, allowing us to cross-check the indicated cell forming another viable candidate for digging. 6. **Need for Additional Dig**: - There might be a chance that the plaques show the treasure is just 1 step away, leading us to neighboring cells. However, multiple cells could still be candidates in proximity.

We will show that (p = 5). 3. **Simplify the Congruence**: Given (6^n equiv 1 pmod{n}), it is necessary to reduce this to (6^n equiv 1 pmod{p}). 4. **Apply Fermat's Little Theorem**: Since (p) does not divide 6, by Fermat's Little Theorem, it follows that (6^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}). 5. **Combine Results Using the Given Theorem**: Given that (6^n equiv 1 pmod{p}), and by Fermat's theorem (6^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}), we can apply the theorem mentioned in step 1 to get (6^{gcd(p-1, n)} equiv 1 pmod{p}). 6. **Evaluate GCD**: Since (p-1) and (n) are coprime when their greatest common divisor is 1 (the smallest prime divisor of (n) cannot divide (p-1)), it follows that (gcd(p-1, n) = 1). 7. **Conclude Using Modulo**: Therefore, (6^1 equiv 1 pmod{p}), meaning (p) divides (6 - 1 = 5). 8. **Final Step**: Since the only prime divisor of 5 is 5 itself, we conclude that (p = 5). Hence, (n) must be divisible by 5. [ boxed{} ] Second Method: 1. **Euler-Fermat Generalization**: Use Euler-Fermat theorem: If (a) and (m) are relatively prime, then (a^{varphi(m)} equiv 1 pmod{m}). Here, (varphi(m)) is the Euler's totient function. 2. **Contradiction Setup**: Suppose the problem statement is false. That is, there exists some (n > 1) that is not divisible by 5, but (n) divides (6^n - 1). Let (n_0) be the smallest such number. Therefore, (6^{n_0} equiv 1 pmod{n_0}). 3. **Use Euler's Totient Function**: Since (n_0) is relatively prime to 6, Euler's theorem states (6^{varphi(n_0)} equiv 1 pmod{n_0}). 4. **Determine GCD**: Let (d = gcd(n_0, varphi(n_0))). Since (varphi(n_0) < n_0), it follows that (d < n_0). 5. **Inducing Smaller Counterexample**: According to the theorem cited in the first method, (6^d equiv 1 pmod{n_0}). Since (d) is a divisor of (n_0), (6^d equiv 1 pmod{d}). 6. **Properties of d**: Note that (d neq 1) because (d) must comply with the derived properties: (d > 1) and (d < n_0), and (d) cannot be divisible by 5 since (n_0) is not. 7. **Contradiction**: Since (d) is a smaller positive integer that also serves as a counterexample to the problem's assertion, this contradicts (n_0) being the smallest such value.

Let PK be the tangent segment from P to the circle Gamma. By the Power of a Point theorem, we have: [ PK^2 = OP^2 - R^2 ] 4. We need to show that PQ^2 = PK^2. Therefore, we need: [ PQ^2 = OP^2 - R^2 ] 5. Since D is the foot of the perpendicular from O to l, we have: [ OP^2 = OD^2 + PD^2 ] 6. Substituting this into the equation for PQ^2, we get: [ PQ^2 = (OD^2 + PD^2) - R^2 ] 7. Let Q be a point on OD such that QD = sqrt{OD^2 - R^2}. Then: [ QD^2 = OD^2 - R^2 ] 8.

The total cost of the apples would be A * x, and the total cost of the bananas would be 0.60 * (9 - x). The equation representing the total cost is: A * x + 0.60 * (9 - x) = 5.60 Now we need to solve for A (the price of each apple). First, distribute the 0.60 to the terms inside the parentheses: A * x + 0.60 * 9 - 0.60 * x = 5.60 Now, simplify the equation: A * x + 5.40 - 0.60 * x = 5.60 Combine like terms: (A - 0.60) * x = 5.60 - 5.40 (A - 0.60) * x = 0.20 Now, we need to find the value of x (the number of apples) to solve for A. Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of apples and bananas, we can't solve for A directly. However, we can try different values of x (from 1 to 8, since the customer can't buy 0 or 9 apples if they bought a total of 9 fruits) and see which one gives us a reasonable price for A. Let's try x = 1 (1 apple and 8 bananas): (A - 0.60) * 1 = 0.20 A - 0.60 = 0.20 A = 0.20 + 0.60 A = 0.80 If the customer bought 1 apple at 0.80 and 8 bananas at 0.60 each, the total cost would be: 0.80 * 1 + 0.60 * 8 = 0.80 + 4.80 = 5.60 This matches the total cost, so the price of each apple is boxed{0.80} ."},{"prompt":"Factorization: ab^{2}9a=______.","completion":"To factorize the given expression ab^{2}-9a, we follow these steps: 1.

In this form: [ Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 ] This can be rewritten as: [ vec{r} cdot vec{a} = m text{ where } vec{r} = (x, y, z), quad vec{a} = (A, B, C), quad m = -D ] Given that (A, B, C) neq (0, 0, 0), this is also an equation of a plane. 5. **Normal Form of the Plane Equation** To convert the equation Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 to its normal form: [ vec{r} cdot frac{vec{a}}{|vec{a}|} = frac{m}{|vec{a}|} ] We divide both sides by |vec{a}| = sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}: [ frac{Ax + By + Cz}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}} = -frac{D}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}} ] Thus, the normal form of the plane equation is: [ frac{Ax + By + Cz}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}} = -frac{D}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}} ] # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the equation vec{r} cdot vec{a} = m is the equation of a plane, and any linear equation in three variables can be expressed and transformed into its normal form.

For l_{1}, this gives us k_{1} = -frac{2}{1} = -2. 2. **Find the slope of l_{2}**: Similarly, for l_{2}, we have k_{2} = -frac{1}{-a} = frac{1}{a}. 3. **Condition for parallel lines**: Since l_{1} is parallel to l_{2}, their slopes must be equal. Hence, we have k_{1} = k_{2}, which leads to -2 = frac{1}{a}. 4. **Solve for a**: From the equality of slopes, solving for a gives us a = -frac{1}{2}. 5. **Express l_{2} with the found value of a**: With a = -frac{1}{2}, substituting back into the equation of l_{2} gives us the new form x + frac{1}{2}y - 1 = 0.

The laundry is sorted by colour and placed in the bins. Next, the heaviest bin (only one of them, if there are several that are heaviest) is emptied and its contents washed. What is the minimal possible storing capacity required of the laundry bins in order for them never to overflow?","completion":"To determine the minimal possible storage capacity required of the laundry bins so that they never overflow, we need to analyze the process through which the laundry accumulates and is washed each week. Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Weekly Accumulation and Washing**: - Each week, the family generates 10 text{ kg} of laundry. - The laundry is sorted by color and placed in three separate bins. - The heaviest bin is emptied and its contents are washed. 2. **Bound on Laundry Accumulation**: - After each week, the total amount of laundry across all bins increases by 10 text{ kg} before any bin is emptied. Thus, if the total laundry before washing in week n is a_n, then a_{n+1} = a_n + 10. - The heaviest bin, which has at least frac{a_n + 10}{3} kg of laundry, is emptied. Therefore, the post-wash total amount of laundry is reduced by at least frac{a_n + 10}{3}. - We can express this mathematically as: [ a_{n+1}' = a_n + 10 - frac{a_n + 10}{3} = frac{2}{3} (a_n + 10) ] - Define a_0 = 0. The recurrence relation is then given by: [ a_{n+1} = frac{2}{3} (a_n + 10) ] 3. **Finding the Bound**: - To find an upper limit on a_n, consider the solution of the recurrence relation. We can solve for the steady-state by setting a_{n} = a_{n+1}: [ a = frac{2}{3}(a + 10) ] - This simplifies to: [ 3a = 2a + 20 quad Rightarrow quad a = 20 ] - Hence, a_n is bounded above by 2 times 10 = 20. However, this is the post-wash bound. 4. **Pre-Wash Bound**: - Since the post-wash total can be up to 20, before washing the additional 10 kg may be added: [ text{Pre-wash total} = 20 + 10 = 30 text{ kg} ] 5. **Verifying Storage Capacity**: - Consider each bin's potential maximum content.

Applying this to p, with x=(a-2) and y=frac {1}{a-2} (which are both positive since a>2), we get: frac{(a-2) + frac {1}{a-2}}{2} geq sqrt{(a-2) cdot frac {1}{a-2}} = 1.

The best opposing scores would be: - 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 points - 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 points - Hence, 9 points do not guarantee being the top scorer. 4. **Checking for 10 Points:** - Possible scoring combinations to achieve 10 points include: - 4 + 3 + 3 - 4 + 4 + 2 - If a team scores 10 points using 4 + 3 + 3, the best another team can achieve with the highest remaining scores would be: - 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 points 5. **Conclusion:** - With 10 points, the highest another team can score, considering optimal distribution, is 9 points.

They can at worst end with a draw. 5. **Additional Cross**: The first player has an added advantage of having one more \\"cross\\" compared to the noughts at any given time due to starting first. - This additional cross could only help the first player in reaching a winning configuration or maintaining a draw, reinforcing that the second player cannot secure a win if the first player follows an optimal strategy. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our initial assumption that the second player can always win, despite the first player playing optimally, can't hold up. # Conclusion: The second player cannot win if the first player plays optimally; they can at most secure a draw.

Each stone weighs no more than 1 ton. A truck can carry a maximum load of 3 tons. We need to find the minimum number of trucks required to transport all the stones. 2. **Weigh Constraints**: Given that the total weight of all stones is 10 tons and each stone weighs no more than 1 ton, we can infer the following: [ text{Total weight} = 10 text{ tons} ] [ text{Weight of each stone} leq 1 text{ ton} ] 3. **Truck Capacity**: Each truck can carry a maximum of 3 tons.
