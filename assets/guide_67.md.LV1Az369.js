According to the given information, 8% of the population died due to bombardment. Therefore, the population after the bombardment is 92% of the initial population (since 100% - 8% = 92%). So, after the bombardment, the population is: 0.92 * P Then, 15% of the remaining population left the village due to fear.

Let's call the colors white and black. 2. **Defining Good Points**: A \\"good point\\" is defined as the intersection of two lines. Since no three lines are concurrent, each intersection point is shared by exactly four regions. 3. **Assigning Integers to Regions**: - For a white region, count the number of good points on its boundary and assign this number to the region. - For a black region, count the number of good points on its boundary, multiply this number by (-1), and assign this product to the region. 4. **Checking the First Condition**: - Consider two neighboring regions, one white and one black. Let (a) be the integer assigned to the white region and (-b) be the integer assigned to the black region. - The product of the integers assigned to these two regions is (a cdot (-b) = -ab). - The sum of the integers assigned to these two regions is (a + (-b) = a - b). - Since (a) and (b) are both positive (as they count the number of good points), we have (-ab < a - b), satisfying the first condition. 5. **Checking the Second Condition**: - For each line, consider the half-planes determined by it. Each half-plane contains a certain number of regions. - The sum of the integers assigned to all regions in a half-plane must be zero. - This is ensured by the checkerboard coloring and the assignment of integers. Each good point contributes equally to the sum of the integers in both half-planes, but with opposite signs due to the coloring. Thus, the contributions cancel out, resulting in a sum of zero. 6. **Special Case of Parallel Lines**: - If all lines are parallel, there are no good points, and thus each region would be assigned the integer 0. - This would violate the first condition, as the product of the integers assigned to any two neighbors would be 0, which is not less than their sum (which would also be 0). 7. **Conclusion**: The assignment of integers to regions is possible if and only if not all of the lines are parallel.

The LCM of 12 and 16 is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in either number.

A. 40 m<sup>2</sup> B. 30 m<sup>2</sup> C. 20 m<sup>2</sup> D. 35 m<sup>2</sup>","completion":"Let's call the length of the rectangle l, which uses the material priced at 3 yuan/meter, and the width w, which uses the material priced at 5 yuan/meter. Since the perimeter of the rectangle involves two lengths and two widths, our cost constraint can be written as: 2 times 3 times l + 2 times 5 times w leq 100. Simplifying this gives us: 6l + 10w leq 100, which can be further simplified to: 3l + 5w leq 50. As we're looking to maximize the area A = lw of the rectangle and since l and w are integers, we can systematically test combinations of l and w to find the maximum product while satisfying the inequality 3l + 5w leq 50. Starting with the highest possible value for w that satisfies the budget constraint (ignoring l for the moment), we find that w = 10 would already cost 5 times 10 = 50 yuan, leaving no budget for the length, so w must be less than 10. Considering integer values for w, we start with w = 9 and find the maximum possible l: 3l + 5 times 9 leq 50, 3l + 45 leq 50, 3l leq 5, which is not possible for any positive integer l. So we reduce w by 1 and try again with w = 8: 3l + 5 times 8 leq 50, 3l + 40 leq 50, 3l leq 10. Taking the quotient and remainder when dividing 10 by 3, we get l = 3 as the maximum integer value. This gives us an area: A = lw = 3 times 8 = 24 , text{m}^2. However, we need to continue this process, checking if a lower value for w allows for a sufficiently large increase in l to achieve a greater overall area: For w = 7, the maximum l is: 3l + 5 times 7 leq 50, 3l + 35 leq 50, 3l leq 15, l = 5. This area is: A = 5 times 7 = 35 , text{m}^2. This is larger than our previous area and is now the area to beat. We should verify that no smaller w will give a larger product. For w = 6, we have: 3l + 5 times 6 leq 50, 3l + 30 leq 50, 3l leq 20, l = 6. And the area is: A = 6 times 6 = 36 , text{m}^2. This is an error because we concluded earlier that the area 35 , text{m}^2 was the largest and should not find a larger area with different dimensions given the same constraints. Let's correct this. Going back to the step with w = 6: 3l + 30 leq 50, 3l leq 20, l leq frac{20}{3} approx 6.67. However, since l is an integer, the largest l is l = 6. The area for these dimensions would be the same as with w = 6, so A = 36 , text{m}^2 was an incorrect finding. The correct area for w = 6, l = 6 is: A = 6 times 6 = 36 , text{m}^2. We continue to check for lower values of w (down to w = 1) to ensure that no larger area exists. Completing this systematic check, we determine that the largest l that satisfies the budget for each corresponding w does not yield an area greater than 35 , text{m}^2. Therefore, the configuration with l = 5 and w = 7 gives us the maximum area, which is: boxed{A = 35 , text{m}^2}."},{"prompt":"Let f(x) = sin(pi x), g(x) = cos(pi x), h_1(x) = g(f(x)), and h_n(x) = h_1(h_{n1}(x)) for integers n geq 2.

Position Analysis and Case Handling: Start by analyzing the strictest constraints concerning the blue and orange houses. **Case 1: Blue (B) is the 1st house.** - Orange (O) cannot be the 2nd house, so possible positions for O are 3rd, 4th or 5th. - Green (G) must come before both B and R; hence G could only be at position 2. - This arrangement strictly limits Red (R) and the other house color (say, yellow, Y) must fit in the remaining slots ensuring Green before Red. - **Subcase 1.1: O is the 3rd house.** - Possible arrangements are: text{G}-text{B}-text{O}-text{Y}-text{R}. - **Subcase 1.2: O is the 4th house.** - Possible arrangements are: text{G}-text{B}-text{R}-text{O}-text{Y}. - **Subcase 1.3: O is the 5th house.** - Possible arrangements with G before R: text{G}-text{B}-text{Y}-text{R}-text{O}. **Case 2: Blue (B) is the 2nd house.** - Green (G) must be the 1st house due to its constraint with B. - Similar subcases as above can be explored for O being in positions 3, 4, or 5. Continuing this logic similarly for B in other possible houses, we generate cases, keeping in mind that G is always before B and B before O. Additionally, analyze each scenario to fit in other house colors and obeying all required constraints, counting all valid orderings. Conclusion: After a full case analysis respecting positions of B, G, O, R, and adding one additional house color in plausible orders, we find: - Total valid orders: text{G}-text{B}-text{O}-text{Y}-text{R}, text{G}-text{B}-text{R}-text{O}-text{Y}, and text{G}-text{B}-text{Y}-text{R}-text{O}. textbf{(D) 5} The final answer is boxed{textbf{(D)} 5}"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = sqrt{3}cosleft(frac{pi}{2} 2xright) 2cos^2x + 1 (1) Find the smallest positive period of f(x).

Since there are 11 months from January to November, the total sales from these months would be 11 * A. Adding December's sales, the total sales for the year would be 11 * A + M * A. According to the information given, December's sales total (M * A) is 0.15384615384615385 of the total sales for the year.

Let's denote the center of the moving circle as point M. Here are the steps to enhance the solution: 1. Since the circle is tangent to the vertical line x = -1, the tangent point on the circle must have the same x-coordinate as the line, which is -1. 2. The center of the circle M must be to the right of the tangent point since the circle passes through (1, 0). This implies that the distance between the center M and the point of tangency must equal the radius of the circle, say r. 3. Therefore, if the center of the circle M has coordinates (x_m, y_m), then the point of tangency has coordinates (-1, y_m), since the y-coordinate must be the same for both points. 4. Using the fact that M passes through (1, 0), we can establish the distance from the center M to the point (1, 0) is also r. Therefore, r = sqrt{(x_m - 1)^2 + y_m^2}. 5. Because the distance from the center M to the tangent point (-1, y_m) is also r, we have r = x_m - (-1) = x_m + 1. 6. Equating these two expressions for r, we get sqrt{(x_m - 1)^2 + y_m^2} = x_m + 1. 7. Squaring both sides of the equation, we obtain (x_m - 1)^2 + y_m^2 = (x_m + 1)^2. 8. Expanding the squares and simplifying, we get x_m^2 - 2x_m + 1 + y_m^2 = x_m^2 + 2x_m + 1. 9. Further simplification gives us y_m^2 = 4x_m.

Therefore, (a = 3). - This sequence results in the median: [ 3 quad (text{middle value of sorted data}) ] - This matches the third entry in Mitya's book: 3 4. **Fourth Number on the Board**: - Next, we need to find a number (b) such that the updated sequence {1, 3, 3, (b)} has a median of 2.5. - Sorting the existing sequence, we'll get: {1, 3, 3, (b)}. - For the median to be 2.5, (b) must be less than 3 but greater than 1. The only such integer is 2. - Therefore, (b = 2), resulting in {1, 2, 3, 3}, and the median is: [ frac{2 + 3}{2} = 2.5 ] - This matches the fourth entry in Mitya's book: 2.5 **Conclusion (a)**: The fourth number written on the board is ( boxed{2} ). Part (b) 1. **Fifth Number on the Board**: - Adding another number (c) to the list {1, 2, 3, 3, (c)}, the median recorded is 3. - To maintain the median as 3, (c) should be such that at least half of the values are 3 or more. - If (c geq 3), let's assume (c = 3): [ text{Resulting sequence: } {1, 2, 3, 3, 3} ] This sequence's median remains 3: [ 3 quad (text{middle value in sorted list}) ] - This matches the fifth entry in Mitya's book: 3 2. **Sixth Number on the Board**: - Next, another number (d) is added, forming the list {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, (d)}. The updated median is 2.5. - To achieve this median with an additional number, (d leq 2) since another number less than 3 introduced needs to balance the median back down to 2.5. - Let (d = 2): [ text{Resulting sequence: } {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3} ] This sequence has a median of: [ frac{2 + 3}{2} = 2.5 ] - This matches the sixth entry in Mitya's book: 2.5 3. **Seventh Number on the Board**: - Next, adding another number (e) to the list {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, (e)}, the updated median is 2. - For the median to be 2 with this configuration, (e leq 2). - Let (e = 2): [ text{Resulting sequence: } {1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3} ] Which has a median of: [ 2 quad (text{middle value in the sorted list}) ] - This matches the seventh entry in Mitya's book: 2 4. **Eighth Number on the Board**: - Finally, we add another number (f) to the list {1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, (f)}, and the updated median is 2. - To maintain the median as 2 in this scenario, (f leq 2). - Let (f = 2): [ text{Resulting sequence: } {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3} ] - Thus, the sequence's median is 2: [ frac{2 + 2}{2} = 2 ] - This matches the eighth entry in Mitya's book: 2 **Conclusion (b)**: If the sixth and seventh numbers are both less than 2, the eighth number must be ( boxed{2} )."},{"prompt":"Vasya loves picking mushrooms. He calculated that during the autumn, he collected a threedigit number of mushrooms with the sum of its digits equal to 14. Then Vasya calculated that 8% of the mushrooms were white, and 14% were boletus. How many mushrooms did Vasya collect?","completion":"1. We start with the given condition that Vasya collected a three-digit number of mushrooms, and the sum of its digits is 14. 2. To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of mushrooms such that ( 14% ) of this number is an integer. This implies the total number of mushrooms must be divisible by 100 since percentages work nicely when the number is expressed in terms of hundreds. Therefore, we consider numbers ending in 00 or 50. 3. If the number ends in ( 00 ), it can be written as ( 900 ), ( 800 ), up to ( 100 ). However, these numbers do not satisfy the condition that the sum of their digits should be 14 since: - If a number is ( 900 ), digits are ( 9 + 0 + 0 = 9 ) - Hence, a number ending in ( 00 ) will have a digit sum ( leq 9 ), clearly less than 14. So this case isn't feasible. 4. Therefore, we consider numbers ending in ( 50 ). - Let the three-digit number be represented as ( 950 ), ( 850 ), ( 750 ),... up to (150). We check the digit sums: - For ( 950 ): ( 9 + 5 + 0 = 14 ) - For ( 850 ): ( 8 + 5 + 0 = 13 ) (does not satisfy the condition) - Similarly, other combinations ( x50 ) where ( x ) varies from 1 to 8 will sum less than 14. 5. From the calculations, we conclude that the only valid condition satisfying the original constraints is ( 950 ): [ (9 + 5 + 0 = 14) ] 6. Verifying the final result with initial conditions: - ( 14% ) of the total amounts to: [ 0.14 times 950 = 133 ] Hence, calculation matches.

For a hyperbola in standard form, the eccentricity e is given by e = sqrt{1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}}. Also, the coordinates of the foci are (pm ae, 0), so the right focus is at (ae, 0). The asymptotes of a hyperbola are straight lines that pass through the center and have the slopes equal to pm frac{b}{a}. The equations of the asymptotes are therefore y = pm frac{b}{a}x. Since the problem states that the circle is tangent to one of the asymptotes, without loss of generality, let's consider the asymptote with the positive slope (y = frac{b}{a}x). The equation for the circle with radius equal to eccentricity e and centered at the right focus (ae, 0) is (x - ae)^2 + y^2 = (ae)^2. x^2 - 2aex + (ae)^2 + y^2 = (ae)^2. x^2 - 2aex + y^2 = 0.

For a tangency point to exist, x cannot be zero because we are considering the point on the asymptote away from the origin. Therefore: frac{b^2}{a^2} + 1 - 2sqrt{1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}} = 0.

Consider first the possible condition where: [ cos x = 0 ] Substituting ( cos x = 0 ) into the equation, we get: [ sin^3 x = 0 ] However, ( cos x = 0 implies x = frac{pi}{2} + kpi ), and for these x values: [ sin x = 0 implies x = kpi ] Since this would imply both ( sin x = 0 ) and ( cos x = 0 ), which cannot happen simultaneously, this case is invalid. 4. Next, we divide through by ( cos^3 x ) assuming ( cos x neq 0 ): [ frac{sin^3 x}{cos^3 x} + frac{sin^2 x cos x}{cos^3 x} + frac{sin x cos^2 x}{cos^3 x} + frac{6 cos^3 x}{cos^3 x} = 0 ] Simplifying each term: [ tan^3 x + tan^2 x + tan x + 6 = 0 ] 5. Let ( y = tan x ). The simplified equation becomes: [ y^3 + y^2 + y + 6 = 0 ] 6. Next, we solve for ( y ). Factorize the polynomial: [ (y + 2)left(y^2 - y + 3right) = 0 ] 7. Solving each factor: [ y + 2 = 0 implies y = -2 ] [ y^2 - y + 3 = 0 ] For the quadratic term: [ y^2 - y + 3 = 0 ] The discriminant (( Delta )) is given as: [ Delta = (-1)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 3 = 1 - 12 = -11 ] Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions. 8.

When x in (-frac{pi}{2}, 0), the function f(x) is increasing, as sin x is increasing and x is negative, hence the slope is increasing. When x in (0, frac{pi}{2}), the function f(x) is decreasing because sin x increases more slowly than x. Therefore, conclusion 1 is correct. For conclusion 2, as x to 0, f(x) approaches 1, and since x neq 0, f(x) < 1 for all x, which means that the function does not have a maximum value.

This means that as the number of workers increases, the time required to complete the job decreases, and vice versa, while keeping the product of the number of workers and the days to complete the job constant. Given that four painters can complete the job in 1.25 work-days, we can calculate the constant product as follows: [ (text{number of workers}) times (text{days to complete job}) = 4 times 1.25 = 5 ] This product must remain the same regardless of the number of workers.

Next, we set ( y = 1 ) in the functional equation: [ f(x f(1)) + 1 f(x) = x f(1) + f(x) ] Simplifying, we get: [ f(x f(1)) + f(x) = x f(1) + f(x) ] Thus: [ f(x f(1)) = x f(1) ] Since ( f ) is bounded, the only possible solution is ( f(1) = 0 ). Hence: [ f(x cdot 0) = 0 ] which implies: [ f(x) = 0 ] 4. To further verify, let's set ( x = 1 ): [ f(f(y)) + y f(1) = f(y) ] Substituting ( f(1) = 0 ) from the previous step: [ f(f(y)) = f(y) ] This means ( f(f(x)) = 2 f(x) ), implying that: [ f^{(n)}(x) = 2^{n-1} f(x) ] Since ( f ) is bounded, ( f(x) = 0 ) is a consistent solution so far, but let's explore further. 5. Suppose there is some ( r ) such that ( f(r) < 0 ). For ( t ): [ f(t r) = t f(r) ] because if ( f(t) = 0 ), then each revertible pair ( left(x, frac{1}{x}right) ) and ( left(frac{1}{x}, xright) ) simplifies the following: [ fleft(x fleft(frac{1}{x}right)right) = fleft(frac{f(x)}{x}right) = 0 ] 6. Testing the pair ( (x, frac{1}{x}) ): [ fleft(x fleft(frac{1}{x}right)right) = fleft(frac{f(x)}{x}right) = 0 ] For ( x > 0 ): [ frac{f(x)}{x} leq 0 implies f(x) leq 0 ] Assuming ( f(x) < 0 ), leads either ( boxed {f(x) = 0} ). 7. Analyzing ( (x, -1) ): [ x f(-1) + f(-x)=x f(-1)=f(-xf(-1)) ] 8. With testing and substituting: [ f(-x)= x f(-1) ] Solving ( x f(-1)=f(-x)= 2 f(x)<0 ) deriving: [ f(-1)=-2 ] 9. Thus our final function testing outputs derive by ( f(x)=-2 x ) if (x<0): [ f(x)=0 otherwise ] Easy checking shows both this and the null function solves it. # Conclusion [ boxed{ f(x) = begin{cases} 0 & text{if } x geq 0 -2x & text{if } x < 0 end{cases}} ] is the potential solution confirming real bounded function case."},{"prompt":"Lines perpendicular to the sides of a triangle are drawn through the vertices of the triangle, converging at these vertices. Prove that these perpendicular lines form two equal triangles.","completion":"Given: A triangle ( ABC ) with perpendiculars drawn from its vertices to the opposite sides, forming new triangles. To Prove: These perpendiculars form two equal triangles. 1. **Identify the Perpendiculars:** Assume we draw the perpendiculars from vertex ( A ) to side ( BC ), from vertex ( B ) to side ( AC ), and from vertex ( C ) to side ( AB ). Let these perpendiculars meet ( BC ), ( AC ), and ( AB ) at points ( A' ), ( B' ), and ( C' ), respectively. 2. **Establishing the Parallelism:** Notice that the perpendicular from ( A ) to ( BC ) implies that line ( AA' ) is parallel to the altitudes from ( B ) and ( C ). Similarly, ( BB' parallel AC ) and ( CC' parallel AB ). These parallel relationships indicate that we can form parallelograms by extending lines through appropriate points. 3. **Use of the Circumcircle:** Since these altitudes intersecting at the vertices of the triangle meet at points equidistant from the circumcenter (by definition of the perpendicular bisectors being radii of the circumcircle), we can utilize properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. 4. **Properties of Parallelograms:** Consider quadrilaterals ( ABA'C ), ( ACB'B ), and ( BCA'A ). Given the circumcircle and parallel properties, segments ( AA', BB', ) and ( CC' ) serve as altitudes and thus, form orthocenters opposite each vertex. - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. - Consequently, we have: [ AA' parallel BB' quad text{and} quad AA' = BB' ] This parallelism and equality imply that the triangles formed by the intersection of these altitudes and corresponding segments must be similar and equal in all aspects. 5. **Conclusion:** By geometry, if two angles or sides are equal and the other identical due to orthogonality and equidistance from the circumcenter, we infer that the resultant figures (here, our triangles) are congruent. Thus, the perpendiculars through each vertex of a triangle indeed form two equal triangles.

This means that for Rs. 2000, she can get 10 kgs more at the reduced price than she could at the original price. Let's calculate the amount of oil she could get for Rs. 2000 at the original price: Amount of oil at original price = 2000 / P After the reduction, she gets 10 kgs more for the same amount of money: Amount of oil at reduced price = (2000 / R) + 10 Since R = 0.60P, we can substitute R in the equation: Amount of oil at reduced price = (2000 / (0.60P)) + 10 We know that the amount of oil at the reduced price is equal to the amount of oil at the original price plus 10 kgs: 2000 / P + 10 = 2000 / (0.60P) Now, let's solve for P: 2000 / P + 10 = 3333.33 / P Multiplying both sides by P to get rid of the denominator: 2000 + 10P = 3333.33 Now, let's solve for P: 10P = 3333.33 - 2000 10P = 1333.33 P = 1333.33 / 10 P = 133.33 Now that we have the original price per kg (P), we can find the reduced price per kg (R): R = 0.60P R = 0.60 * 133.33 R = 79.998 Therefore, the reduced price per kg of oil is approximately Rs. boxed{80} ."},{"prompt":"Let f(x) = x^2 6x + 14 and let g(f(x)) = 3x + 4.

This satisfies the condition for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for ( n )** Suppose ( A_n ) has eigenvalues ( -n, -n+2, ldots, n-2, n ) with multiplicities ( binom{n}{0}, binom{n}{1}, ldots, binom{n}{n} ), respectively. We need to show that ( A_{n+1} ) has eigenvalues ( -n-1, -n+1, ldots, n-1, n+1 ) with multiplicities ( binom{n+1}{0}, binom{n+1}{1}, ldots, binom{n+1}{n+1} ).

The new eigenvalues of ( A_{n+1} ) will be: [ -n-1, -n+1, ldots, n-1, n+1 ] The multiplicities of these eigenvalues can be determined using Pascal's identity: [ binom{n}{i} + binom{n}{i+1} = binom{n+1}{i+1} ] This ensures that the multiplicities of the new eigenvalues are ( binom{n+1}{0}, binom{n+1}{1}, ldots, binom{n+1}{n+1} ). Thus, by induction, we have shown that ( A_n ) has ( n+1 ) distinct integer eigenvalues ( lambda_0 < lambda_1 < ldots < lambda_n ) with multiplicities ( binom{n}{0}, binom{n}{1}, ldots, binom{n}{n} ).

Is it true that we can find arbitrarily large ( N ) such that all of ( (x_1 + x_{2N-1}), (x_2 + x_{2N-2}), ldots, (x_{N-1} + x_{N+1}) ) are less than ( 2 x_N )? 1. **Setting Up the Problem:** We start by noting the condition given: (lim_{n to infty} frac{x_n}{n} = 0). This implies that for any (epsilon > 0), there exists an (N_0) such that for all ( n > N_0 ): [ frac{x_n}{n} < epsilon implies x_n < epsilon n ] 2. **Choosing a Small ( k ):** Choose a small positive ( k ) such that ( 0 < k < x_1 ). This choice of ( k ) ensures that ( x_1 - k ) is positive. 3. **Maximizing ( x_n - nk ):** Define ( N ) to be the largest integer ( n ) that maximizes ( x_n - nk ). This means that ( x_N - Nk ) is as large as possible among the values of ( x_n - nk ). 4. **Behavior of ( x_n - nk ):** Since ( frac{x_n}{n} to 0 ) as ( n to infty ), only finitely many terms ( x_n - nk ) can be positive for sufficiently large ( k ). Thus, ( N ) as defined is well-defined and finite, meaning that for large enough ( n ), ( x_n - nk ) will be non-positive. 5. **Showing ( x_{N-m} + x_{N+m} < 2x_N ):** We need to show that ( x_{N-m} + x_{N+m} < 2x_N ) for all ( 1 leq m < N ). We start with: [ x_{N-m} - (N-m)k leq x_N - Nk quad text{and} quad x_{N+m} - (N+m)k leq x_N - Nk ] Adding these inequalities gives: [ x_{N-m} + x_{N+m} - (N-m)k - (N+m)k leq 2x_N - 2Nk ] Simplifying, we get: [ x_{N-m} + x_{N+m} leq 2x_N ] 6. **Ensuring Arbitrarily Large ( N ):** To ensure that we can find arbitrarily large ( N ), we need to carefully choose ( k ). Take ( k ) small enough, such that: [ k < frac{x_{N+1} - x_N}{N+1} ] This choice ensures that: [ x_{N+1} - (N+1)k > x_N ] Since ( x_{N+1} - (N+1)k > x_N ), and thus greater than all ( x_i - ik ) for ( i leq N ), the definition of ( N ) will keep increasing. Hence, ( N ) can be made arbitrarily large by choosing ( k ) appropriately small. # Conclusion: Thus, it can be concluded that there exist arbitrarily large ( N ) such that all of ( x_1 + x_{2N-1}, x_2 + x_{2N-2}, ldots, x_{N-1} + x_{N+1} ) are less than ( 2 x_N ).

So, ( |y| = 3 ), giving y-intercepts ( (0, 3) ) and ( (0, -3) ). 2. **Dimensions of the Rhombus**: - The length of the horizontal diagonal (from x-intercepts) is ( 18 ) (from ( -9 ) to ( 9 )). - The length of the vertical diagonal (from y-intercepts) is ( 6 ) (from ( -3 ) to ( 3 )). 3. **Area Calculation**: - The formula for the area of a rhombus given the lengths of the diagonals is ( text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times d_1 times d_2 ). - Substituting the lengths of the diagonals: ( text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 18 times 6 = 54 ) square units.

Next, we'll isolate the term ( 9x ) by subtracting 6 from both sides: [ 9x = 474 - 6 ] 7. Compute the subtraction: [ 9x = 468 ] 8. Finally, solve for ( x ) by dividing both sides by 9: [ x = frac{468}{9} ] 9. Perform the division: [ x = 52 ] 10.

Statement (2): If ( a + b ) is divisible by 3, then both ( a ) and ( b ) are divisible by 3. 1. Let ( a + b = 3n ) for some integer ( n ). 2. This implies ( frac{a}{3} + frac{b}{3} = n ). 3. For ( n ) to be an integer, ( frac{a}{3} ) and ( frac{b}{3} ) must both be integers, meaning both ( a ) and ( b ) must be divisible by 3. Hence, statement (2) is true. Statement (3): If ( a + b ) is a prime number, then ( a - b ) is not necessarily a prime number. 1. Consider ( a + b = 17 ) (a prime number). 2. Let ( a = 14 ) and ( b = 3 ), then ( a - b = 14 - 3 = 11 ) (also a prime number). 3. Since both ( a + b ) and ( a - b ) can be prime numbers, this counterexample disproves the statement. Hence, statement (3) is false. Statement (4): If ( c = a + b neq 0 ), then (frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^3 + c^3} = frac{a - b}{a + c}). 1. Given that ( c = a + b ), we have: [ frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^3 + c^3} = frac{(a - b)left(a^2 + ab + b^2right)}{(a + c)left(a^2 - ac + c^2right)}. ] 2. We simplify the denominator: ( c = a + b to c^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 ). Thus the denominator is: [ (a + c)(a^2 - a(a + b) + (a + b)^2) = (a + (a+b))(a^2 - a^2 - ab + a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = (a + c)(a^2 + ab + b^2). ] 3. Hence we obtain: [ frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^3 + c^3} = frac{(a - b)left(a^2 + ab + b^2right)}{(a + (a + b))(a^2 + ab + b^2)} = frac{a - b}{a + c}. ] Therefore, statement (4) is true. # Conclusion: Since statements (1), (2), and (4) are true: boxed{(B) , 2 text{ 个}}"},{"prompt":"What is the sum of all the even integers between 200 and 400?","completion":"We need to find the sum of the arithmetic series 202 + 204 + dots + 400.

Thus, a_{3}=7, which means Statement A is correct. **For Statement B: a_{2022}=a_{2}** The sequence has a pattern for even indices, where a_{2k+2}=a_{2k}.

Therefore, we can set up the following equation: ( v cdot t = (v + sqrt{15}) cdot (t - frac{pi}{4}) ) Expanding the right side of the equation, we get: ( v cdot t = v cdot t + sqrt{15} cdot t - v cdot frac{pi}{4} - sqrt{15} cdot frac{pi}{4} ) Since ( v cdot t ) is common on both sides, we can cancel it out: ( 0 = sqrt{15} cdot t - v cdot frac{pi}{4} - sqrt{15} cdot frac{pi}{4} ) Now, we can solve for ( v ): ( v cdot frac{pi}{4} = sqrt{15} cdot t - sqrt{15} cdot frac{pi}{4} ) ( v = frac{sqrt{15} cdot t - sqrt{15} cdot frac{pi}{4}}{frac{pi}{4}} ) ( v = frac{4sqrt{15} cdot t - sqrt{15} cdot pi}{pi} ) ( v = frac{4sqrt{15} cdot t}{pi} - sqrt{15} ) We know that the time saved is ( frac{pi}{4} ) hours, and this is the time it would take to travel the distance at the increased speed of ( sqrt{15} ) miles per hour more than the actual speed. So we can write: ( sqrt{15} cdot frac{pi}{4} = v cdot frac{pi}{4} ) Solving for ( v ): ( v = sqrt{15} ) Therefore, the actual average speed when the driver drove from home to the store was ( boxed{sqrt{15}} ) miles per hour."},{"prompt":"f point P(a,b) lies on the line y=2x+1, then the value of the algebraic expression 14a+2b is ( ).

Since A and B are at the same distance from P on AB, we have that P is the midpoint of AB. Similarly, Q will be the midpoint of BC such that BP = BQ = frac{AB}{2}. 4.

We need to determine if a straight line, which does not contain any of the vertices of the polygonal chain, can intersect all 11 segments. 2. **Dividing the Plane:** Any straight line in the plane divides the plane into two half-planes. Let's denote these two half-planes as H_1 and H_2. 3. **Traversing the Polygonal Chain:** As we traverse the polygonal chain starting from an initial vertex and moving along each segment, we must check where the segments cross the straight line. 4. **Crossing Property:** Each time a segment of the polygonal chain intersects the straight line, we transition from one half-plane to the other (from H_1 to H_2 or from H_2 to H_1). 5. **Returning to the Start:** Since the polygonal chain is closed, after traversing all 11 segments, we must end up where we started. This implies that the number of times we cross the line must be even because we start in a half-plane and to return to that same half-plane, the total number of crossings must cancel out (even number of transitions). 6. **Contradiction:** An 11-segment polygonal chain cannot be crossed an even number of times because 11 is an odd number. This directly leads to a contradiction when trying to ensure each segment is crossed by the line. Hence, it is not possible for a straight line to intersect all 11 segments of a closed 11-segment polygonal chain without containing any of the vertices. # Conclusion: Thus, a straight line that does not contain any of the vertices of the polygonal chain cannot intersect all 11 segments. boxed{text{Cannot}}"},{"prompt":"vartriangle ABC, D and E are two points on segment BC such that BD = CE and angle BAD = angle CAE .

Given that ( angle BAD = angle CAE ), it follows that ( angle CAE = angle CA'E ). 2. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:** - Since ( angle CAE = angle CA'E ), quadrilateral ( AA'CE ) is cyclic. This is because opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to ( 180^circ ), and here we have ( angle CAE ) and ( angle CA'E ) being equal. 3. **Properties of Translation:** - By the definition of translation, ( AA' ) and ( CE ) are parallel. This implies that ( AA'CE ) is not just any cyclic quadrilateral but a cyclic trapezoid. 4. **Isosceles Trapezoid:** - In a cyclic trapezoid, the non-parallel sides are equal.

Therefore, the total age of all 7 people when the youngest was born was 132 years (the total age of the other 6 people) + 0 years (the age of the youngest person) = 132 years. Now, the youngest person is Y years old, which means Y years have passed since the youngest was born. In that time, each of the other 6 people has also aged Y years. So, the increase in the total age of the 6 people is 6 * Y years. The total age of the 7 people now (210 years) is the total age when the youngest was born (132 years) plus the increase in age of the 6 people (6 * Y years) plus the age of the youngest person (Y years). So, we have the equation: 132 + 6Y + Y = 210 Combining like terms, we get: 7Y + 132 = 210 Subtracting 132 from both sides, we get: 7Y = 210 - 132 7Y = 78 Dividing both sides by 7, we get: Y = 78 / 7 Y = 11.14 Since age is typically measured in whole years, we can round this to the nearest whole number if necessary.

According to the problem, Pop spent 15, so P = 15. Crackle spends 3 times as much as Pop, so C = 3P = 3 * 15 = 45. Snap spends the same amount as Crackle, so S = C = 45. The total amount spent by Snap, Crackle, and Pop is 150, so S + C + P = 150. We already know that S = 45, C = 45, and P = 15, so we can check if the total adds up to 150: 45 (Snap) + 45 (Crackle) + 15 (Pop) = 105, which is not equal to 150. This means there's a mistake in the initial assumption that Snap spends the same amount as Crackle. Let's correct the information: If Crackle spends 3 times as much as Pop, and Pop spent 15, then Crackle spent 3 * 15 = 45. The total amount spent is 150, and we know that Pop spent 15 and Crackle spent 45. So, the amount Snap spent (S) plus the amount Crackle spent (C) plus the amount Pop spent (P) should equal 150: S + C + P = 150 S + 45 + 15 = 150 S + 60 = 150 S = 150 - 60 S = 90 Now we have the correct amounts: Snap spent 90, Crackle spent 45, and Pop spent 15. The ratio of the amount Snap spent to the amount Crackle spent is S:C, which is 90:45. To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by 45: 90 / 45 : 45 / 45 = 2:1 So, the ratio of the amount Snap spent to the amount Crackle spent is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"Consider a modified calculator that has a key for squaring the displayed number, and another key for taking the reciprocal.

This means that there exist integers ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) with ( n_1 < n_2 ) such that: [ 10^{n_1} - 1 equiv 10^{n_2} - 1 pmod{p} ] 3. **Forming a Number Divisible by ( p ):** Taking the difference of these numbers, we get: [ (10^{n_2} - 1) - (10^{n_1} - 1) = 10^{n_1} (10^{n_2-n_1} - 1) ] Since both numbers have the same remainder when divided by ( p ), their difference must be divisible by ( p ). Therefore: [ 10^{n_1} (10^{n_2-n_1} - 1) equiv 0 pmod{p} ] 4. **Using the Coprimality of 10 and ( p ):** Given that ( p ) is a prime number distinct from 2 and 5, ( p ) is coprime to 10, meaning ( gcd(p, 10) = 1 ). Thus, ( 10^{n_1} ) and ( p ) are coprime, which implies that: [ 10^{n_2-n_1} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Therefore, ( 10^{n_2-n_1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). 5. **Forming the Number with All Ones:** The number ( 111 ldots 11 ) (with ( n_2-n_1 ) ones) is therefore divisible by ( p ). Hence, there exists some ( k = frac{10^{n_2-n_1}-1}{p} ) such that the number ( pk ) consists of ( n_2 - n_1 ) ones. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The proposed statement is proven.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Pete read twice as many books as Matt did last year, and this year he doubles that number while Matt reads only 50% more.

Step 1: Identify the orientation of the parabola. Since C opens to the left, its standard equation takes the form y^{2} = -2px, where p > 0 represents the distance from the vertex to the focus (or to the directrix). Step 2: Determine the value of p. The problem states that the distance from the focus to the directrix is 3. In the context of the parabola's equation, this distance is represented by 2p. Therefore, we have 2p = 3. Step 3: Solve for p. From 2p = 3, we find that p = frac{3}{2}. Step 4: Substitute p into the standard equation. With p = frac{3}{2}, the equation of the parabola becomes y^{2} = -2 cdot frac{3}{2}x = -3x. However, to match the standard form given in the options, we recognize a mistake in the calculation for p. The correct interpretation should be that p itself is the distance from the vertex to the focus (or to the directrix), not half of this distance. Therefore, the correct calculation is directly p = 3, not p = frac{3}{2}. Correcting Step 3: Given that the distance from the focus to the directrix is 3, and this distance is equal to 2p, we should directly set p = 3 without dividing by 2 since p itself represents the full distance for parabolas opening horizontally.

Let's first assess the scenario involving (k = 15): - We use the Pigeonhole Principle to determine if there must be at least 15 students in the same class. - Suppose the 60 students are divided among (n) classes. According to the problem, we know that among any selection of 10 students, there must be at least 3 from the same class. 3. Assume for contradiction that not all 15 students can be in the same class: - For the possibility of not having 15 students in the same class, consider (n = 5), and each class having 12 students. - Even if this setup each class has 12 students, they can be partitioned in such a way: ( [12, 12, 12, 12, 12] ). - This satisfies the initial condition that any 10 students selected will include at least 3 from the same class since mixing from 5 different classes is not possible without including 3 from the same group. 4. Now consider if it's possible to not achieve this with only 4 classes: - If each of the 4 classes had 15 students: ( [15, 15, 15, 15] ). 5. Therefore, if (m) is the number of classes: - As any 10 students contains at least 3 from the same class, we must have: (n leq 4). 6.

This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as {C}_{10}^{3}. The formula for combinations is {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.

The first scenario is when the digits can be rearranged without any restrictions, and the second scenario is when the rearrangement includes the digits 1 or 0, which could potentially violate the condition that the first digit cannot be 0. 3. **Calculate the total possibilities including both scenarios**: Since there are 2 scenarios, we multiply the number of combinations by 2 to account for both. This gives us: [ 2 times {C}_{10}^{3} = 2 times 120 = 240 ] 4. **Adjust for the condition violation**: If the rearranged digits include 1, 2, and 0, the only case that does not meet the condition is when 0 is in the first position.

Since drawing a line through the center splits the square symmetrically, and both halves have an equal number of lamps, a move lighting the central lamp will also involve lighting lamps on either the left or right half. 4. **Detailed steps**: - **Step 1**: Draw an initial line parallel to one side of the grid that excludes the bottom row.

This strategy aims to keep the sums of the two piles as balanced as possible. 4. **Pairing the Cards:** We pair the cards into 25 pairs: ((1, 50), (2, 49), ldots, (25, 26)). Each pair sums to 51. We denote the difference between the sums of the two piles after (n) pairs as (p_n). 5. **Analyzing Grogg's Moves:** - Assume after (i) pairs, the difference (p_i geq 0). - Grogg places the largest remaining card, (50-i), in the lesser pile. - After Grogg's move, the difference becomes (p_i - (50-i)). - Winnie then places a card with value between 1 and (49-i) in the other pile. - The new difference (p_{i+1}) ranges from (p_i - 2(50-i) + 1) to (p_i - 1). 6. **Bounding the Difference:** - For (p_i geq 0), the minimum difference after (i+1) pairs is (2i - 99). - For (p_i < 0), the maximum difference after (i+1) pairs is (99 - 2i). 7. **Induction Proof:** - Base case: After the first pair, (-99 leq p_1 leq 99). - Inductive step: Assume (k-100 leq p_k leq 100-k). For the next pair, (k-99 leq p_{k+1} leq 99-k). - This holds for all pairs, so after 25 pairs, (-75 leq p_{25} leq 75). 8. **Winnie's Strategy:** - Winnie pairs cards as ((1, 2), (3, 4), ldots, (49, 50)). - If Grogg picks an odd card (n), Winnie picks (n+1) and places it in the opposite pile. - If Grogg picks an even card (n), Winnie picks (n-1) and places it in the opposite pile. - If Grogg picks 49 or 50, Winnie picks the other and places it in the same pile. 9. **Ensuring a Difference of 75:** - Each pair ((a, a+1)) contributes a difference of 1. - There are 24 such pairs, contributing a difference between 0 and 24. - The pair ((49, 50)) contributes a difference of 99. - Thus, the total difference is at least (99 - 24 = 75). 10. **Conclusion:** - Grogg can force the difference to be at most 75. - Winnie can ensure the difference is at least 75. - Therefore, the optimal result when both play perfectly is exactly 75.

At this moment, the distance between the ship and the lighthouse is ______ km.","completion":"Let's consider the positions of the ship and the lighthouse. We place the lighthouse M at the origin of a coordinate system, and we consider the eastward direction as the positive x-axis. 1. When the ship is at point A, it is observing the lighthouse at an angle of 60° to the northeast. This indicates that the line connecting the lighthouse to point A forms a 60° angle with the north direction, which corresponds to a 30° angle with the negative x-axis (considering northeast as 45° from the north - to the x-axis line). Let d be the distance between the lighthouse and the ship at point A. Using trigonometry, we can express the coordinates of point A as A(-dcos(30°), dsin(30°)). 2. The ship sails eastward 4 hours at a speed of 15 km/h, meaning it covers a distance of 4 times 15 = 60 km. Hence, point B will have the x-coordinate increased by 60, resulting in B(A_x + 60, A_y) or, in terms of d, B(-dcos(30°) + 60, dsin(30°)). 3. At point B, the ship observes the lighthouse at an angle of 15° to the northeast. This indicates that the line connecting the lighthouse to point B forms a 15° angle with the north direction, which corresponds to a 75° angle with the positive x-axis. 4. The distance between the ship at point B and the lighthouse can now be expressed using the tangent of 75°, such that tan(75°) = frac{dsin(30°)}{dcos(30°) - 60}. 5. Solving for d given that sin(30°) = frac{1}{2}, cos(30°) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, and tan(75°) = 2 + sqrt{3}, we get: 2 + sqrt{3} = frac{frac{1}{2}d}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}d - 60}, (2 + sqrt{3})(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}d - 60) = frac{1}{2}d, (2sqrt{3} + 3)d - 120(2 + sqrt{3}) = frac{1}{2}d, (2sqrt{3} + frac{5}{2})d = 120(2 + sqrt{3}), d = frac{120(2 + sqrt{3})}{2sqrt{3} + frac{5}{2}}, d = frac{240 + 120sqrt{3}}{5 + 4sqrt{3}}. 6. To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: d = frac{(240 + 120sqrt{3})(5 - 4sqrt{3})}{(5 + 4sqrt{3})(5 - 4sqrt{3})}, d = frac{1200 - 960sqrt{3} + 600sqrt{3} - 480 cdot 3}{25 - 48}, d = frac{-240sqrt{3} + 720}{-23}, d = frac{240sqrt{3} - 720}{23}. 7. Since we are interested in the distance at point B, we need to find the length of the line segment from B to M. At this stage B is at (-dcos(30°) + 60, dsin(30°)), which has components: (-frac{240sqrt{3} - 720}{23}cdotfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} + 60, frac{240sqrt{3} - 720}{23}cdotfrac{1}{2}). 8.

Now, that expression is messy and not how we were expecting to find the distance. What happened here is that instead of simplifying to a nice numerical value, we got a complex expression. Let's go back to step 5, where it looks like we might be able to simplify further or potentially find an arithmetic mistake. Revisiting step 5, we had: (2 + sqrt{3}) cdot (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}d - 60) = frac{1}{2}d. Multiplying out the left side, we should get: sqrt{3} d + 2 d - (120sqrt{3} + 240) = frac{1}{2} d. Moving d terms to one side gives us: sqrt{3} d + frac{3}{2} d = 120sqrt{3} + 240. Combining the d terms: (sqrt{3} + frac{3}{2}) d = 120sqrt{3} + 240. Now, let's solve for d, keeping the terms as simple as possible: d = frac{120sqrt{3} + 240}{sqrt{3} + frac{3}{2}}, d = frac{240(0.5 + sqrt{3})}{sqrt{3} + frac{3}{2}}, Applying the conjugate to simplify the denominator: d = frac{240(0.5 + sqrt{3})(sqrt{3} - frac{3}{2})}{(sqrt{3} + frac{3}{2})(sqrt{3} - frac{3}{2})}, d = frac{240(0.5sqrt{3} - frac{3}{4} + 3 - frac{3sqrt{3}}{2})}{3 - frac{9}{4}}, d = frac{240(frac{5sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{3}{4})}{frac{3}{4}}, d = frac{240(10sqrt{3} - 3)}{3}, d = 80(10sqrt{3} - 3). Now this looks more like a result we can interpret. The 80 is a factor of the entire term, and both terms in the parenthesis include integers and sqrt{3}. Let's complete the calculations: d = 800sqrt{3} - 240. Given that sqrt{3} is approximately 1.732, we find that: d approx 800 times 1.732 - 240, d approx 1385.6 - 240, d approx 1145.6.

So, we denote this common difference by d. 3. **Use the given equation to find a relationship**: We start with the given equation 2a_{8}-a_{12}=4. Since a_{12} = a_{8} + 4d (because moving from term 8 to term 12 involves adding the common difference d four times), we can rewrite the equation as: [ 2a_{8} - (a_{8} + 4d) = 4 ] Simplifying this, we find: [ a_{8} - 4d = 4 ] Since a_{8} = a_{4} + 4d, we can also write a_{4} = a_{8} - 4d.

Find all values of the parameter a for which points A and B lie on opposite sides of the line y 3x = 4 (points A and B do not lie on this line).","completion":"1. Let's consider the first given equation and transform it step-by-step. The original equation is: [ 5a^2 + 12ax + 4ay + 8x^2 + 8xy + 4y^2 = 0 ] We can rearrange and try to group terms to form perfect squares: [ (4y^2 + 4(2x + a)y) + 8x^2 + 12ax + 5a^2 = 0 ] Recognizing the square terms, we can rewrite this: [ left( (2y)^2 + 2 cdot 2y cdot (2x + a) + (2x + a)^2 right) - (2x + a)^2 + 8x^2 + 12ax + 5a^2 = 0 ] Simplifying the expression inside the square, we get: [ (2y + 2x + a)^2 + 4x^2 + 8ax + 4a^2 = 0 ] This becomes a sum of two squares: [ (2y + 2x + a)^2 + 4(x + a)^2 = 0 ] Since the sum of two squares is zero, both squares must be zero: [ 2y + 2x + a = 0 quad text{and} quad x + a = 0 ] Solving these, we find: [ x_A = -a quad text{and} quad y_A = frac{a}{2} ] 2. Now consider the second equation given for the parabola: [ ax^2 - 2a^2x - ay + a^3 + 4 = 0 ] Given (a neq 0) (since it represents a parabola vertex), we can rearrange the equation as: [ y = frac{1}{a}(ax^2 - 2a^2x + a^3 + 4) ] Simplifying, we get: [ y = x^2 - 2ax + left(a^2 + frac{4}{a}right) ] This defines the parabola and its vertex coordinates: [ x_B = a quad text{and} quad y_B = y(a) = frac{4}{a} ] 3. We then need to check the positions of points (A) and (B) relative to the line (y - 3x = 4). We denote this condition by a function: [ f(x, y) = 3x - y + 4 ] The line equation can be rearranged to (3x - y + 4 = 0). For points (A) and (B) to lie on opposite sides of this line, the expressions (f(x_A, y_A)) and (f(x_B, y_B)) must produce results of opposite signs. We calculate these as follows: [ f(x_A, y_A) = f(-a, frac{a}{2}) = 3(-a) - frac{a}{2} + 4 = -frac{7a}{2} + 4 = frac{-7a + 8}{2} ] Similarly, [ f(x_B, y_B) = f(a, frac{4}{a}) = 3a - frac{4}{a} + 4 ] Thus, points (A) and (B) are on opposite sides if: [ left(frac{-7a + 8}{2}right) left(3a - frac{4}{a} + 4right) < 0 ] Simplifying this inequality, we get: [ frac{(-7a + 8)(3a + 4 - frac{4}{a})}{2} < 0 ] Further simplifying and removing the fraction: [ frac{(7a - 8)(3a - 2)(a + 2)}{a} > 0 ] 4.

These policemen serve to create bounded strips in the horizontal direction. 3. **Bounding the Bandit into a Vertical Strip**: Due to these stationary policemen, the bandit is effectively trapped between two vertical lines ( x = 200l ) and ( x = 200(l+1) ) for some integer ( l ).

Specifically: - Upon reaching the intersection ( (n, 0) ), each policeman turns to patrol along the street ( x = n ) moving: - In the positive ( y )-direction if ( n ) is even. - In the opposite direction if ( n ) is odd. 5. **Ensuring All Vertical Streets Are Patrolled**: By this movement, eventually, all vertical streets will be patrolled up and down by policemen. This ensures that, in due time, the bandit will be restricted within a horizontal line segment between these moving policemen. 6. **Complete Restriction of the Bandit**: Eventually, the bandit will be compressed into a vertical strip of width 1 between two adjacent policemen on these newly patrolled streets. 7. **Final Capture**: Given that policemen can see along the infinite length of streets, one of the patrolling policemen will eventually be aligned horizontally with the bandit and see him. This alignment guarantees that the bandit is spotted as all possible streets are covered by the policemen. # Conclusion: Yes, the police can ensure that their goal of seeing the bandit is achieved through this algorithm.

Firstly, we find the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(e^x - x - 1) = e^x - 1. Now let's determine the sign of f'(x): - For x in (-infty, 0), e^x < 1, so f'(x) = e^x - 1 < 0. - For x in (0, +infty), e^x > 1, so f'(x) = e^x - 1 > 0. The sign of f'(x) tells us that the function f(x) is decreasing on the interval (-infty, 0) and increasing on the interval (0, +infty). Since f(0) = e^0 - 0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0, we have that f(x) reaches its minimum value at x = 0. Because x neq 0, and f(x) is only decreasing before x = 0 and increasing after, we can conclude that for any x neq 0, f(x) = e^x - x - 1 > 0. Therefore: e^x > 1 + x.

D: A quadrilateral with perpendicular and bisecting diagonals is a square.","completion":"To analyze each statement step by step: - **Statement A**: A rhombus is defined as a quadrilateral with all sides equal. If a rhombus has equal diagonals, this means the diagonals are also perpendicular (a property of a square). Therefore, a rhombus with equal diagonals must have all sides equal and all angles equal to 90^circ, which defines a square. Hence, statement A is true. - **Statement B**: A rectangle is defined as a quadrilateral with all angles equal to 90^circ. If a rectangle has perpendicular diagonals, this does not change the fact that all angles are 90^circ and opposite sides are equal, which are also properties of a square. Additionally, for the diagonals to be perpendicular in a rectangle, the sides must also be equal, making it a square. Thus, statement B is true. - **Statement C**: A parallelogram with perpendicular and equal diagonals is a special case. The property of equal diagonals in a parallelogram implies that it is a rectangle, and perpendicular diagonals imply that it is a rhombus. A quadrilateral that is both a rectangle and a rhombus is a square, making statement C true. - **Statement D**: A quadrilateral with perpendicular and bisecting diagonals does not necessarily have all sides equal or all angles equal to 90^circ. This property alone makes it a rhombus, as all rhombi have diagonals that bisect each other at right angles. However, it does not guarantee that all angles are 90^circ, which is a requirement for a square.

The weight after the operation is: [ w_{text{after}} = sum_{i in P setminus {p+1}} frac{1}{2^i} + frac{1}{2^p} + frac{1}{2^{p+4}} ] Since ( frac{1}{2^{p+1}} ) is replaced by ( frac{1}{2^p} + frac{1}{2^{p+4}} ), we have: [ frac{1}{2^p} + frac{1}{2^{p+4}} > frac{1}{2^{p+1}} ] This inequality holds because: [ frac{1}{2^p} + frac{1}{2^{p+4}} = frac{1}{2^p} + frac{1}{16 cdot 2^p} = frac{1}{2^p} left(1 + frac{1}{16}right) = frac{1}{2^p} cdot frac{17}{16} > frac{1}{2^p} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2^{p+1}} ] Therefore, ( w_{text{after}} > w_{text{before}} ). 4. **Conclusion:** Since the weight ( w(S) ) strictly increases with each operation and the number of ( G )'s remains constant, we cannot have an infinite sequence of increasing weights. This is because the weight is bounded above by the sum of the geometric series: [ sum_{p=1}^{infty} frac{1}{2^p} = 1 ] Hence, the process must eventually terminate when there are no more occurrences of \\"AG\\" in the string.

The burning speed of the fuse is 0.2 meters per second, which means it takes frac{x}{0.2} seconds for the fuse to burn completely. On the other hand, the blaster moves away from the blasting point at a speed of 3 meters per second. To ensure safety, the blaster must be at least 50 meters away before the fuse burns out. Therefore, the time it takes for the blaster to reach a safe distance is the time it takes to cover the distance from the blasting point to the safe area, minus the distance already covered by the fuse burning in the opposite direction, which is frac{50-x}{3} seconds. To find the condition that the length of the fuse must satisfy, we set up the inequality that the burning time of the fuse must be greater than the time it takes for the blaster to reach a safe distance: [ frac{x}{0.2} > frac{50-x}{3} ] This inequality ensures that the blaster has enough time to evacuate to a safe distance before the fuse burns out completely.

For an inscribed angle ( angle A_i ), the corresponding central angle ( angle AO_iA_{i+1} ) subtends the same arc and will be twice the inscribed angle. 2. **Identify Key Angles:** Due to the symmetry and properties, denote the arcs subtended as ( angle AO_iA_{i+3} ) for each chosen vertex ( A_i ): [ angle A_1 = 180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle A_7A_1A_2, ] [ angle A_3 = 180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle A_2A_3A_4, ] [ angle A_5 = 180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle A_4A_5A_6. ] 3. **Sum the Relevant Angles:** Summing the angles at vertices ( A_1 ), ( A_3 ), and ( A_5 ), we get: [ angle A_1 + angle A_3 + angle A_5 = (180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle A_7A_1A_2) + (180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle A_2A_3A_4) + (180^circ - frac{1}{2} angle A_4A_5A_6). ] Simplifying this, we have: [ angle A_1 + angle A_3 + angle A_5 = 3 cdot 180^circ - frac{1}{2} (angle A_7A_1A_2 + angle A_2A_3A_4 + angle A_4A_5A_6). ] 4. **Incorporate Geometry Properties:** The sum of internal angles in a heptagon (7-sided polygon) is ((7-2) cdot 180^circ = 900^circ).

Substituting the given values, we have frac{AB}{AC}=frac{BD}{CD}=2. This relationship helps us to establish the ratio of the sides opposite to angles B and C in triangle ABC. Next, by applying the Law of Sines to triangle ABC, we get frac{sin B}{sin C}=frac{AC}{AB}. Substituting the ratio from the Angle Bisector Theorem into this equation, we find frac{sin B}{sin C}=frac{AC}{AB}=frac{1}{2}. Thus, for part (1), we obtain boxed{frac{sin B}{sin C}=frac{1}{2}}. # For Part (2): Given angle BAC=60^{circ} and AD=1, and using our conclusion from part (1), we start by analyzing the relationship between angles B and C. Since angle B+angle C = pi - angle A = pi - 60^{circ} = frac{2pi}{3}, we can express angle C as frac{2pi}{3} - angle B. Thus, frac{sin B}{sin(pi-B-A)} = frac{sin B}{sin(frac{2pi}{3}-B)} = frac{1}{2}. Simplifying the denominator using the sine of a difference formula, we get sin(frac{2pi}{3}-B) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos B + frac{1}{2}sin B. Substituting this into the equation, we have frac{sin B}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos B + frac{1}{2}sin B} = frac{1}{2}. Solving for tan B = frac{sin B}{cos B}, we find tan B = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, which implies that B=30^{circ}. In triangle ABD, with angle BAD=angle B=30^{circ}, we have angle BDA=120^{circ} by angle sum property. Applying the Sine Rule, frac{AB}{sin angle BDA} = frac{AD}{sin B} simplifies to frac{AB}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = frac{1}{frac{1}{2}}. Solving for AB, we find AB=sqrt{3}.

Therefore, the number of second-year students is: 0.80 * 676 = 540.8 Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round this to 541 second-year students. Now, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of second-year students who study automatic control of airborne vehicles. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the size of their intersection: N + A - B = Total number of second-year students We know that N (students who study numeric methods) is 226, B (students who study both) is 134, and we want to find A (students who study automatic control of airborne vehicles).

Since there are 3 other parks (A, C, and D), and both A and B have 3 options (excluding park B), the total scenarios where neither chooses park B is 3 times 3 = 9.

So we can set up the following equation: [ frac{C}{2 times 12} - frac{C}{5 times 12} = 150 ] To solve for ( C ), we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is ( 2 times 5 times 12 ): [ frac{5C}{2 times 5 times 12} - frac{2C}{2 times 5 times 12} = 150 ] [ frac{5C - 2C}{2 times 5 times 12} = 150 ] [ frac{3C}{2 times 5 times 12} = 150 ] Now, multiply both sides by ( 2 times 5 times 12 ) to solve for ( C ): [ 3C = 150 times 2 times 5 times 12 ] [ 3C = 150 times 120 ] [ 3C = 18000 ] Divide both sides by 3 to find ( C ): [ C = frac{18000}{3} ] [ C = 6000 ] So, Gary's used car cost boxed{6000} ."},{"prompt":"Given that z is a complex number such that z + frac{1}{z} = 2 cos 5^circ, find z^{3000} + frac{1}{z^{3000}}.","completion":"Given z + frac{1}{z} = 2 cos 5^circ implies, using the expression for a complex number on the unit circle, [ z^2 + 1 = 2z cos 5^circ, text{ so } z^2 - 2z cos 5^circ + 1 = 0. ] Using the quadratic formula, z is: [ z = frac{2 cos 5^circ pm sqrt{(2 cos 5^circ)^2 - 4}}{2} = cos 5^circ pm i sin 5^circ. ] By DeMoivre's Theorem, [ z^{3000} = (cos 5^circ pm i sin 5^circ)^{3000} = cos (3000 times 5^circ) pm i sin (3000 times 5^circ). ] Calculating 3000 times 5^circ = 15000^circ.

We start by considering a cycle C in G. 1. **Starting with a Cycle in G**: - Let C be a cycle in G. By the definition of a 2-connected graph, such a cycle always exists. 2. **Constructing C-trails**: - For each component D of G-C, we need to construct sets of C-trails in G^{2}+bar{E}, ensuring that each vertex of D is included in a trail. 3. **Considering Components of G-C**: - If D has only one vertex u, we choose a C-trail in G containing u. - If |D| geq 2, let tilde{D} be the graph formed by contracting G-D into a single vertex tilde{x}. By the induction hypothesis, tilde{D}^{2} contains a Hamiltonian cycle tilde{H}. Replace edges in tilde{E} (not originally in G^2) by edges from G or new edges bar{e} in bar{E}.

Then G_{0} is a union of C-trails covering all vertices in G. 5. **Forming Eulerian Graph**: - Now, modify G_{0} to form an Eulerian multigraph by ensuring that every vertex has even degree. This is possible because G_{0} is connected (Theorem 1.8.1). 6. **Traversing G_1**: - Let G_{1} be the connected subgraph of and include all trails. Since G_{1} is connected, it is possible to form an Eulerian tour W_1 covering edges of this subgraph. 7. **Hamiltonian Cycle in G^{2}**: - By traversing and replacing sections step-by-step, ensure every vertex is involved. - Check that every C-restricted vertex's component degree remains even and each edge is traversed once or replaced. This results in an Eulerian tour becoming a Hamiltonian cycle in G^2. Therefore, for any 2-connected graph G, the square G^{2} contains a Hamiltonian cycle. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given a positive integer ( n geq 2 ), nonnegative real numbers ( x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n} ) such that ( sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}^{2}=1 ), and ( M=max left{x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}right} ), let ( S=n M^{2}+2 sum_{i<j} x_{i} x_{j} ).

From the definition of variance: [ S^2 = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - bar{x})^2 ] Using triangular inequality and properties of the median, we note: [ |bar{x} - m| = left| frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - m) right| leq frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - m| ] The mean deviation from the median cannot exceed the mean deviation from the mean: [ frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - m| leq sqrt{ frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - bar{x})^2 } = sqrt{S^2} ] 5. **Conclusion**: Since sqrt{S^2} should logically denote the standard deviation, the presence of an inconsistency suggests one of the recorded values or the calculations was incorrect: [ (bar{x} - m)^2 leq S^2 implies (0-4)^2 leq 15.917 implies 16 leq 15.917 ] This incorrect inequality confirms the mathematics teacher's suspicion that Ivanov made a mistake.

Let (P) be a point on the ellipse where its radial distance from (O) is (frac{a-b}{2}) and its center on the circle with radius (frac{a+b}{2}). Here, there are two possible cases for constructing such circles. 3. One may use Steiner's method to construct these circles. Steiner's Method: 1. Draw three circles with radii ( b ), (frac{a + b}{2} ), and ( a ) around the center ( O ). 2. Using the point ( P ) within these circles, identify that (P) lies on a smaller circle of radius (frac{a-b}{2}), centered at (O_1) where ( O_1 ) is a point on the circle of radius (frac{a + b}{2}). This suggests two solutions since the circle centered at (O_1) could intersect at two points on the defined radius. Another Method: 1. Draw a circle with radius (frac{a-b}{2}) at any position and rotate the point (P) around (O) until it intersects this circle. 2. At this intersection, measure the orientations of the ellipse axes by rotating the ellipse alignment back to the original. This defines the major and minor axes directions. Generalization Using Spherical Geometry: 1. Recall that any arbitrary cut through a sphere will yield a circle, but it is generally seen as an ellipse in perspective. 2. Let (O) be the center of a sphere of radius (a). When this sphere is intersected by any plane at (O), the trace is a larger axis circle (2a). 3. Knowing that the ellipse has the minor axis (2b), we establish the plane tilt angle (alpha_1) such that ( cos alpha_1 = frac{a}{b} ). Here, the intersecting plane touches a cone with apex at (0), perpendicular to (P_1), with a semi-angle of (90^circ - alpha_1). 4. Given the defined point (P) on the ellipse provides a means to find the point on the sphere that maps to (P)—label these points as (Q_1) and (Q_2). 5. The tangent planes through these points (touching the cone) define the intersecting plane curves. These circles formed by the sphere cuts are the circles required to map out the ellipse. 6. Of the four possible circles, two pairs collapse onto each other, mapping the equivalent ellipse.

When 0 < a < e, g(-1)=-2a < 0, g(1)=2(e-a) > 0, Thus, g'(x)=0 has a unique real root x_{0} in (1,+infty), and x_{0}in(-1,1), a= dfrac {(x_{0}-1)e^{x_{0}}}{2}.

Therefore, when x=1, f(x) takes a minimum value of 0, When x=x_{0}, f(x) takes a maximum value of f(x_{0})=(x_{0}-1)^{2}(e^{x_{0}}-a), Setting 2a^{2}=0, we get a=0, which is not valid, 0 < a < e. Setting (x_{0}-1)^{2}(e^{x_{0}}-a)=2a^{2}, from the equation we get (x_{0}+1)^{2}e^{x_{0}}+(x_{0}-1)^{3}=0, Let h(x_{0})=(x_{0}+1)^{2}e^{x_{0}}+(x_{0}-1)^{3}, Then h'(x_{0})=(x_{0}+1)(x_{0}+3)e^{x_{0}}+3(x_{0}-1)^{2}. When x_{0}in(-1,1), h'(x_{0}) > 0, Thus, h(x_{0}) is monotonically increasing on (-1,1). Since h(0)=0, x_{0}=0, a= dfrac {1}{2}, which satisfies 0 < a < e. When a=e, from (1) we know there is no extremum. When a > e, g(1)=2(e-a) < 0, g(ln a)=a(ln a-1) > 0, Thus, g(x)=0 has a unique real root x_{0} in (1,+infty), and x_{0}in(1,ln a).

The line FA is perpendicular to one of the asymptotes, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of -frac{b}{a}, which gives the slope as frac{a}{b}. The equation of line FA can be written as: y = frac{a}{b}(x + c) To find the coordinates of point A, we set the equations of line FA and asymptote OA equal to each other: frac{a}{b}(x + c) = -frac{b}{a}x Solving for x gives us the x-coordinate of A as -frac{a^2}{c}.

When a > 1, for x in (0, a-1], varphi'(x) < 0, therefore, varphi(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, a-1], Therefore, varphi(a-1) < varphi(0) = 0, i.e., when a > 1, there exists x > 0 such that varphi(x) < 0, Hence, ln(1+x) geq frac{ax}{1+x} does not always hold, In summary, the range of the real number a is (-infty, 1]. boxed{(-infty, 1]} (III) Given, g(1) + g(2) + ldots + g(n) = frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{3} + ldots + frac{n}{n+1}, n - f(n) = n - ln(n+1), The comparison result is g(1) + g(2) + ldots + g(n) > n - ln(n+1).

How many tickets did Connie redeem today on each item?","completion":"Let's calculate the number of tickets Connie spent on each item step by step: 1. Stuffed koala bear: Connie spent 20% of her 500 tickets on a stuffed koala bear. 20% of 500 = 0.20 * 500 = 100 tickets 2. Earbuds: Connie spent 30 tickets on a pair of earbuds. 3. Remote controlled car: She spent twice as many tickets on a remote controlled car as she did on earbuds. 2 * 30 = 60 tickets 4. Glow bracelets: Connie spent 15% of her 500 tickets on glow bracelets. 15% of 500 = 0.15 * 500 = 75 tickets Now let's calculate the remaining tickets after these purchases: 500 - (100 + 30 + 60 + 75) = 500 - 265 = 235 tickets 5. Poster and keychain: Let's denote the cost of the poster as P and the cost of the keychain as K. We know that K = 3/4 * P and that P + K = 235 tickets. From the equation K = 3/4 * P, we can express P in terms of K: P = 4/3 * K Now we substitute P in the second equation: 4/3 * K + K = 235 (4K + 3K) / 3 = 235 7K / 3 = 235 7K = 235 * 3 7K = 705 K = 705 / 7 K = 100.71 (since we can't have a fraction of a ticket, we'll round to the nearest whole number) K = 101 tickets (for the keychain) Now we find P using the value of K: P = 4/3 * K P = 4/3 * 101 P = 404/3 P = 134.67 (again, rounding to the nearest whole number) P = 135 tickets (for the poster) Now let's check if the total adds up to 235 tickets: P + K = 135 + 101 = 236 tickets Since we rounded the numbers, we have an extra ticket. To correct this, we can adjust one of the values by 1 ticket. Let's adjust the keychain's cost: K = 101 - 1 = 100 tickets Now the total is: P + K = 135 + 100 = 235 tickets So, Connie redeemed her tickets as follows: - Stuffed koala bear: 100 tickets - Earbuds: 30 tickets - Remote controlled car: 60 tickets - Glow bracelets: 75 tickets - Poster: 135 tickets - Keychain: boxed{100} tickets"},{"prompt":"the space Cartesian coordinate system, given point M(a,b,c), the following statements are made: (1) The coordinates of the point symmetric to M with respect to the xaxis are M_{1}(a,b,c); (2) The coordinates of the point symmetric to M with respect to the yoz plane are M_{2}(a,b,c); (3) The coordinates of the point symmetric to M with respect to the yaxis are M_{3}(a,b,c); (4) The coordinates of the point symmetric to M with respect to the origin are M_{4}(a,b,c).

The center of the circle is O, and the radius is r = frac{AB}{2} = 9. 2. Extend overline{AB} through A to C. Let AC = x. 3. Point T lies on omega such that line CT is tangent to omega. Since CT is tangent to omega at T, OT perp CT. 4. Let P be the foot of the perpendicular from A to line CT. We need to find the maximum possible length of segment BP and then find m^2 where m is this maximum length. 5. Since OT perp CT, OT is the radius of the circle, and OT = 9. 6. By the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OCT, we have: [ OC^2 = OT^2 + CT^2 implies (9 + x)^2 = 9^2 + y^2 implies (9 + x)^2 = 81 + y^2 implies y^2 = (9 + x)^2 - 81 ] 7. Since AB is a diameter, angle AQB = 90^circ. Also, angle QAB = angle CAP, so triangle QAB sim triangle PAC. 8. Since AP perp CT and OT perp CT, OT parallel AP, which results in triangle CAP sim triangle COT. 9. Using the similarity of triangles triangle CAP and triangle COT, we have: [ frac{9 + x}{x} = frac{OC}{AC} = frac{OT}{AP} = frac{9}{AP} implies AP = frac{9x}{9 + x} ] 10. Similarly, we can find that PC = frac{xy}{9 + x}. 11. Using the similarity of triangles triangle QAB and triangle PAC, we have: [ frac{x}{18} = frac{AC}{AB} = frac{AP}{QA} = frac{frac{9x}{9 + x}}{QA} implies QA = frac{162}{9 + x} ] 12. Similarly, QB = frac{18y}{9 + x}. 13. Since QP = QA + AP, we have: [ QP = frac{162}{9 + x} + frac{9x}{9 + x} = frac{162 + 9x}{9 + x} = frac{9(18 + x)}{9 + x} ] 14. Therefore, we have: [ BP^2 = QP^2 + QB^2 = left(frac{9(18 + x)}{9 + x}right)^2 + left(frac{18y}{9 + x}right)^2 ] 15. Substituting y^2 = (9 + x)^2 - 81 into the equation, we get: [ BP^2 = left(frac{9(18 + x)}{9 + x}right)^2 + left(frac{18sqrt{(9 + x)^2 - 81}}{9 + x}right)^2 ] 16. Simplifying, we get: [ BP^2 = left(frac{9(18 + x)}{9 + x}right)^2 + left(frac{18sqrt{(9 + x)^2 - 81}}{9 + x}right)^2 = left(frac{9(18 + x)}{9 + x}right)^2 + left(frac{18sqrt{18x + 81}}{9 + x}right)^2 ] 17. Simplifying further, we get: [ BP^2 = left(frac{9(18 + x)}{9 + x}right)^2 + left(frac{18sqrt{18x + 81}}{9 + x}right)^2 = left(frac{9(18 + x)}{9 + x}right)^2 + left(frac{18sqrt{18x + 81}}{9 + x}right)^2 ] 18. This means that we wish to maximize: [ frac{5x^2 + 108x + 324}{x^2 + 18x + 81} ] 19. Let this value be k, so: [ x^2(k - 5) + 18x(k - 6) + 81(k - 4) = 0 ] 20. The discriminant of this quadratic must be greater than or equal to 0 to yield real solutions, which means that: [ 324(k - 6)^2 - 81(4)(k - 5)(k - 1) ge 0 ] 21. Simplifying, we get: [ k^2 - 12k + 36 - k^2 + 9k - 20 ge 0 implies 3k le 16 implies k = frac{16}{3} ] 22. Thus, BP^2 = 81k = 16 cdot 27 = 432.

Consider the table formed by all possible sequences of length (n) using the numbers (1) and (-1). This table has (2^n) rows and (n) columns. 2.

We aim to prove that it's possible to select multiple rows from the corrupted table such that their sum is a row consisting entirely of zeros. 4. **Case Analysis and Strategy:** - We start by selecting rows one by one and keep track of their sum, denoted by (S = S(m)), where (m) is the number of rows selected so far. - If the row is already a zero row, the task is complete. 5. **First Row Selection:** - Begin by selecting a corrupted row originating from the (1^n) sequence (a row originally consisting of all ones). - If this row (S(1)) is not already zero, it contains at least one (1) (since the row consists of 0s and 1s). 6. **Subsequent Row Selection:** - For the second row, select a corrupted row originating from a sequence where the positions corresponding to the (1) entries in (S(1)) have (-1) in the original uncorrupted table. - The sum (S(2)) of the first two selected rows will again consist of 0s and 1s. 7. **Induction Hypothesis:** - Assume we have already chosen (k) rows such that the sum (S(k)) consists of 0s and 1s. - If (S(k)) matches any previous sum (S(m)) for some (m < k), then the sum of rows from ((m+1)) to (k) forms a zero row (desired result). 8. **Choosing the Next Row:** - If (S(k)) does not match any previous sum, select the next row of the corrupted table that originally corresponds to the positions altered by (-1) where (S(k)) has 1, and 1 where (S(k)) has 0. - This ensures that the rows selected for different sums (S(m)) are distinct. 9. **Conclusiveness with Finite Rows:** - Given there are (2^n) different rows, all possible sums (S(k)) form a finite set. - If sums (S(k)) do not repeat immediately, after (2^n) selections all such sums would be covered. - So at some step, (S(k)) must be zero, requiring only the first (k) chosen rows to sum to zero. 10. **Alternative Approach: Transformations:** - Define sequences (a_i) from the original, non-corrupted table, and (b_i) from the corrupted table. Also define (c_i = a_i - 2 b_i). - The sequence (c_i) will have terms identical to (a_i) where elements were replaced by zero, and opposite otherwise. - For every (i), there exists some (j(i)) such that (c_i = a_{j(i)}). 11. **Recursive Cycle Formation:** - Form a sequence (i_k) where (i_{k+1} = j(i_k)). This sequence will eventually cycle because there's a finite number of distinct elements. - Let (i_k = i_l) for some (k < l). - Summing terms from (i_k) to (i_{l-1}) gives: b_{i_k} + b_{i_{k+1}} + ldots + b_{i_{l-1}} = frac{1}{2}left((a_{i_k} - a_{i_{k+1}} + a_{i_{k+1}} - a_{i_{k+2}} + ldots + a_{i_{l-1}} - a_{i_l})right) = frac{1}{2}(a_{i_k} - a_{i_l}) = 0. 12. **Conclusion:** This shows that some sequence of selected rows sums to the zero row.

This is equivalent to finding the solutions for 2x - 5 = ln x.

Let us first consider the function y = 2x - 5: - This is a linear function with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of -5. - It will intersect the x-axis at x = frac{5}{2} and continue to increase without bound as x increases. Next, consider the function y = ln x: - This is a natural logarithm function which is defined for x > 0. - It passes through the point (1,0) and increases slowly without bound as x increases. To determine where these two functions intersect, we can discuss their behavior: - For x leq 0, the function y = ln x is not defined, so there cannot be any intersections in this domain. - At x = 1, we have y = 2(1) - 5 = -3 < ln 1 = 0. This means the line y = 2x - 5 is below the graph of y = ln x at x = 1. - As x increases from 1, both functions increase, but because y = 2x - 5 grows faster than y = ln x and they intersect at x = frac{5}{2} on the horizontal axis (y = 0), these two functions must intersect at exactly one point to the right of x = 1.

Calculate (a_3): [ a_3 = 5 cdot frac{a_1 + a_2}{2} = 5 cdot frac{1 + 143}{2} = 5 cdot 72 = 360. ] Clearly, (a_3) is an integer. 2. Assume (a_3, a_4, ldots, a_{k-1}) are integers for some (k geq 4). We aim to prove (a_k) is also an integer. Using the recursion relation: [ a_k = 5 cdot frac{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{k-1}}{k-1}. ] By the hypothesis of induction, the sum (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{k-1}) being an integer implies (a_k) is also an integer. 3. To continue the proof, we express (a_k) in terms of previous values: [ a_k = 5 cdot frac{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{k-1}}{k-1} ] and [ a_{k-1} = 5 cdot frac{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{k-2}}{k-2}. ] We can manipulate the above to show a relationship between (a_k) and (a_{k-1}): [ a_k = frac{5}{k-1} left(frac{(k-2)}{5} a_{k-1} + a_{k-1}right). ] Simplifying further gives: [ a_k = frac{5}{k-1} left(frac{k-1}{5} a_{k-1}right) = a_{k-1}. ] This recursively demonstrates that each term evolves based on integer sums. 4. Continuing from step 2, we generalize the form of (a_n).

The ratio of the speeds of cars A and B is 5:6, and we know the speed of car B is 90 km/h. To find the speed of car A, we can set up a proportion: Speed of A / Speed of B = 5 / 6 Let the speed of car A be ( V_A ) km/h. Then we have: ( V_A / 90 = 5 / 6 ) To find ( V_A ), we cross-multiply: ( 6 * V_A = 5 * 90 ) ( 6 * V_A = 450 ) Now, divide both sides by 6 to solve for ( V_A ): ( V_A = 450 / 6 ) ( V_A = 75 ) km/h Now that we have the speeds of both cars, we can find the time it takes for them to meet. Since they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Relative speed = Speed of A + Speed of B Relative speed = 75 km/h + 90 km/h Relative speed = 165 km/h The distance between them is 88 km, so the time it takes for them to meet is the distance divided by their relative speed.

When the man is rowing upstream (against the current), his effective speed is Vm - Vr = 6 kmph - 3 kmph = 3 kmph. When the man is rowing downstream (with the current), his effective speed is Vm + Vr = 6 kmph + 3 kmph = 9 kmph. Let's denote the distance to the place he is rowing to as D (one way), so the total distance for the round trip is 2D.

Time to row upstream (Tu) is given by the distance divided by the effective speed upstream: Tu = D / (Vm - Vr) = 2.25 km / 3 kmph = 0.75 hours. Time to row downstream (Td) is given by the distance divided by the effective speed downstream: Td = D / (Vm + Vr) = 2.25 km / 9 kmph = 0.25 hours. The total time (T) taken to row to the place and back is the sum of the time taken to row upstream and downstream: T = Tu + Td = 0.75 hours + 0.25 hours = 1 hour.

Since the train takes 30 seconds to cross the bridge and is traveling at a speed of 45 km/hr, we can convert the speed to meters per second and then multiply by the time to find the distance. First, convert the speed from km/hr to m/s: 45 km/hr = 45 * (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) 45 km/hr = 45 * 1000 / 3600 m/s 45 km/hr = 45000 / 3600 m/s 45 km/hr = 12.5 m/s Now, calculate the distance the train travels in 30 seconds: Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 12.5 m/s * 30 s Distance = 375 meters The distance the train travels while crossing the bridge is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge. We know the bridge is 265 meters long, so we can find the length of the train by subtracting the length of the bridge from the total distance: Length of the train = Total distance - Length of the bridge Length of the train = 375 meters - 265 meters Length of the train = 110 meters Therefore, the length of the train is boxed{110} meters."},{"prompt":"Define a new operation a diamondsuit b = frac{a^2}{b}.

Each set (S_j) contains at most 1000 elements because (x) ranges from 0 to 999. 3. **Count elements in (S_j)**: Since there are at most 499 even numbers, the total number of elements in the union of all (S_j)'s is at most (1000 times 499 = 499000). 4. **Count integers with even (leftlfloor sqrt{n} rightrfloor)**: There are (10^6) integers from 1 to (10^6). The number of integers (n) such that (leftlfloor sqrt{n} rightrfloor) is even can be calculated as follows: - For (n) in the range ([k^2, (k+1)^2 - 1]), (leftlfloor sqrt{n} rightrfloor = k). - If (k) is even, then all (n) in the range ([k^2, (k+1)^2 - 1]) have (leftlfloor sqrt{n} rightrfloor) even. - The number of such (n) for each even (k) is ((k+1)^2 - k^2 = 2k + 1).

Since (leftlfloor sqrt{n} rightrfloor) is even, (a_n) would be the sum of an even number of odd numbers, which is even. This contradicts the assumption that (a_n) is odd.

(The angle at the tip of the cone refers to the angle between its generatrices in an axial crosssection.)","completion":"Let's solve the problem step-by-step. We denote the centers of the spheres as (O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}), the points of tangency of the spheres with the table as (A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}), the vertex of the cone as (C), and the angle at the vertex of the cone as (2alpha). We also denote (varphi = angle O_{1} C A_{1}) and (psi = angle O_{3} C A_{3}). 1. According to the problem, the distances between the centers of the spheres and the vertex (C) can be calculated. The spheres are tangent to each other, and we apply the Pythagorean theorem for the distance between their tangency points on the table. [ CA_{1} = 2 ] 2. To find the distances between the points of tangency on the table, note that the radii of the spheres are 2, 2, and 1, respectively. Hence, the distances between their centers are: [ A_{1}A_{3} = A_{2}A_{3} = sqrt{(2 + 1)^2 - (2 - 1)^2} = sqrt{9 - 1} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2} ] 3. Using the information about distances, we find: [ CA_{3} = sqrt{A_{1}A_{3}^2 - CA_{1}^2} = sqrt{(2sqrt{2})^2 - 2^2} = sqrt{8 - 4} = sqrt{4} = 2 ] 4. Therefore, considering the tangent ratio for (psi): [ tan psi = frac{O_{3}A_{3}}{CA_{3}} = frac{1}{2} ] 5. From the geometry of tangency for (A_{1}), knowing that the radius is equal to the distance (CA_{1}): [ O_{1}A_{1} = 2 = CA_{1} ] This gives us: [ varphi = 45^circ ] 6. Choosing a point (K) on the axis of symmetry of the cone such that its projection (H) onto the plane (CO_{1}O_{2}) falls on the segment (O_{1}O_{2}), we establish the relationship between the angles: [ angle KCO_{1} = angle KCO_{2} = varphi + alpha = 45^circ + alpha ] 7. Similarly, (CO_{1} = 2sqrt{2}) and (CO_{2} = 2sqrt{2}), thus both segments have the same length. 8. Important geometric facts: - (H) is the point of tangency of the equal spheres. Since triangles (KCO_{1}) and (KCO_{2}) are congruent: [ HO_{1} = HO_{2} ] - Since (KHC) lies in the plane orthogonal to (O_{1}O_{2}), both segments (KH perp O_{1}O_{2}) and (CH perp O_{1}O_{2}). - Using the perpendicular dropped from (K) on (CO_{1}), let (KM) be the perpendicular from (K) to (CO_{1}): [ cos angle HCK = frac{CH}{CK} = frac{CM}{cos angle O_{1}CH} times frac{cos angle KCO_{1}}{cos angle O_{1}CH} ] 9. Using the angles established: [ cos angle KCO_{1} = cos (45^circ + alpha) ] [ cos alpha - sin alpha = cos (45^circ + alpha) = sin (2 psi + alpha) = sin 2 psi cos alpha + cos 2 psi sin alpha ] 10. Finally, by substituting (tan psi = frac{1}{2}) and simplifying, we find: [ cos alpha - sin alpha = cos left( 90^circ - 2 psi - alpha right) = sin (2 psi + alpha) = sin 2 psi cos alpha + cos 2 psi sin alpha ] Simplifying we get: [ operatorname{tg} alpha= frac{1 - sin 2 psi}{1 + cos 2 psi} = frac{left( sin psi - cos psi right)^{2}}{2 cos^{2} psi} = frac{( tan psi - 1 )^{2}}{2} = frac{1}{8} ] Thus, the angle at the vertex of the cone is: [ alpha = operatorname{arcctg} 8 ] This gives: [ 2alpha = 2 operatorname{arcctg} 8 ] Conclusion: boxed{2 operatorname{arcctg} 8}"},{"prompt":"f two factors of 3x^3 mx + n are x3 and x+4, find the value of |3m2n|.

We aim to find the angle alpha between the equal sides b such that there exists a line e, parallel to the base a, that halves both the area and the perimeter of the triangle. 2. **Similarity of triangles:** The line e that cuts the triangle and is parallel to the base a forms a smaller triangle similar to the original triangle. Let the sides of this smaller triangle be denoted by x (corresponding to b). 3. **Area ratio:** Since the area is halved, the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the original triangle is frac{1}{2}. For similar triangles, the ratio of the areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides: [ left( frac{x}{b} right)^2 = frac{1}{2} ] Therefore, [ frac{x}{b} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} implies x = frac{b sqrt{2}}{2}. ] 4. **Perimeter halving condition:** According to the problem, the line e also halves the perimeter. The total perimeter of the original triangle is 2b + a. Hence, the half-perimeter is: [ frac{2b + a}{2} = b + frac{a}{2}. ] The perimeter of the smaller, cut-off triangle is 2x + l, where l is the length of the segment of e. 5. **Length of the segment on the base:** By similarity of triangles, the base of the smaller triangle l is given by: [ l = a cdot frac{x}{b} = a cdot frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{a}{sqrt{2}}. ] 6. **Equation for halving the perimeter:** For the perimeter to be halved: [ 2x + l = b + frac{a}{2} ] Substitute x = frac{b sqrt{2}}{2} and l = frac{a}{sqrt{2}} into the equation: [ 2 left( frac{b sqrt{2}}{2} right) + frac{a}{sqrt{2}} = b + frac{a}{2} ] Simplifying: [ b sqrt{2} + frac{a}{sqrt{2}} = b + frac{a}{2} ] 7. **Isolate a:** Rearrange and solve for a: [ b sqrt{2} - b = frac{a}{2} - frac{a}{sqrt{2}} ] [ b (sqrt{2} - 1) = frac{a(sqrt{2} - 1)}{2 (sqrt{2})} ] [ b cdot frac{sqrt{2} - 1}{sqrt{2} - 1} = frac{a}{2 sqrt{2}} ] [ a = 2b (sqrt{2} - 1) ] 8. **Finding alpha:** Use the relationship involving the sine of half the angle: [ sinleft(frac{alpha}{2}right) = frac{a}{2b} = sqrt{2} - 1. ] Solving for alpha: [ alpha = 2 sin^{-1}(sqrt{2} - 1) approx 2 sin^{-1}(0.4142) approx 48.94^circ. ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{alpha approx 48.94^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"When the last three digits of (1978^n) and (1978^m) are equal, find the positive integers (m) and (n) (where (n > m geq 1)) such that the sum (m+n) is minimized.","completion":"1. Given that the last three digits of (1978^n) and (1978^m) are the same, we can write the difference (1978^n - 1978^m) as follows: [ 1978^n - 1978^m = 1978^m left(1978^{n-m} - 1right). ] This difference must be divisible by 1000, since their last three digits are the same. Therefore, (1978^n - 1978^m) is divisible by (1000 = 2^3 times 5^3). 2. We consider the term (1978^{n-m} - 1). Notice that: - (1978) is even, so (1978^{n-m}) for any (n > m) will be even. - (1978^{n-m} - 1) is odd (since an even number minus 1 is odd), so it has no factor of 2. 3. Therefore, for (1978^m left(1978^{n-m} - 1right)) to be divisible by (2^3), (1978^m) itself must include three factors of 2. Since 1978 is (2 times 989), it contains exactly one factor of 2. Hence, [ m cdot 1 geq 3 implies m geq 3. ] 4. Because (1978^m) does not contain any factor of 5, divisibility by (5^3) must come entirely from (1978^{n-m} - 1). We need [ 1978^{n-m} - 1 ] to be divisible by (5^3 = 125). 5. The sequence of the last digits of (1978^t) cycles every four terms, as (1978 mod 10) forms the cycle (8, 4, 2, 6). For (1978^{n-m} - 1) to be divisible by (125), it must complete a full cycle \`[8, 4, 2, 6]\`, hence: [ n - m = 4k, text{ for some integer } k. ] 6. For some power (4k), the congruence properties dictate that (22^{4k} equiv 1 pmod{125}). Particularly, (6^k - 1 equiv 0 pmod{125}). Therefore, (k) must be a multiple of (25) because the cyclic order of the last digits repeats every 4 terms and powers of small bases like 6 repeat every 25 terms modulo higher powers of 5. 7. As a result, combining all steps: [ k = 5p, quad text{where } p text{ is an integer}. ] 8. With (k = 5p), we rewrite the original (4k) relationship: [ n - m = 4times 25p = 100p. ] 9.

Let's find out the correct direction and magnitude of this shift by examining the function inside the sine. The argument of the sine function in y=3sin(2x+dfrac{pi}{4}) is shifted by dfrac{pi}{4} compared to the argument of the sine in y=3sin(2x). Since the sine function is periodic with period 2pi, a phase shift will move the entire graph left or right without affecting its shape. A phase shift of dfrac{pi}{4} inside the sine function can be factored out to show its effect on the variable x. To move the graph of y=3sin(2x) so that it matches the graph of y=3sin(2x+dfrac{pi}{4}), we consider: y = 3sin(2cdot(x + dfrac{pi}{8})) = 3sin(2x + dfrac{pi}{4}).

Thus, we have shown that the line PQ bisects angle APB. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"We place 2004 twocolored chips forming a circle: white on one side and black on the other.

Number the 2004 fichas from 1 to 2004, with ficha 1 being initially black and all other fichas being white. 2. Observe that to eventually have all fichas white, each ficha that starts white must be flipped an even number of times. 3. Analyze the effect of each move, which involves flipping three fichas: - If the current configuration of three fichas is BNB (Black-Neighbor-Black), flipping them changes it to NBN (Neighbor-Black-Neighbor), increasing the count of black fichas by 1. - If it's NNB (Neighbor-Neighbor-Black), flipping changes it to BBN (Black-Black-Neighbor), decreasing the count by 1. - If it's BNN (Black-Neighbor-Neighbor), flipping changes it to NBB (Neighbor-Black-Black), also decreasing the count by 1. - If it's NNN (Neighbor-Neighbor-Neighbor), flipping changes it to BBB (Black-Black-Black), decreasing the count of black fichas by 3. 4. Due to the initial setup of having exactly one black ficha, the final number of moves must be odd to turn all fichas white. 5. Designate ( x_i ) as the number of moves in which ficha ( i ) is chosen (where ( i ) must be a black ficha). 6. The color of ficha ( i ) changes as many times as it's itself chosen (( x_i )), the ficha to its left is chosen (( x_{i-1} )), and the ficha to its right is chosen (( x_{i+1} )). Thus, the number of flips that ficha ( i ) experiences is ( x_{i-1} + x_i + x_{i+1} ). 7. Calculate the total number of moves ( N ): [ N = sum_{i=1}^{2004} x_i ] Considering the modularity, we see that fichas at indices 2, 5, ..., ( 3k + 2 ), ..., 2003 are counted, all initially white. 8. For 2004 fichas (since 2004 is multiple of 3), we count each fiche ( x_i ) thus: [ N = sum_{k=0}^{667} (x_{3k + 2}) ] Since each of these sums represents twice of flips, hence a contradiction arises because ( N ) must be even (while we concluded earlier it has to be odd). 9. Conclude that for 2004 fiches, it is impossible to have all fichas turned to white faces up. # For 2003 fichas: 1. Using similar notation and starting points as before, note that starting from black ficha and proceeding sequentially, we observe: 2. Move through fichas ( 1,2,ldots,2001,2002 ): If we move consistently leaving in certain orders: - ( NNN NNN NNN BB ) 3. Target the placement of the forms ( 2, 5, ..., 3k + 2, ..., 2000 ) effectively reaching: - ( BBB BBB BBB BB ) This pairs each summing order flip with all others rendering them equivalent for summation moduli.

Let's define a function f(x) = ln x + frac{n}{x} + 1 - m. The derivative of this function is f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - frac{n}{x^2}. The minimum value of this function is f(n) = ln n + 2 - m geqslant 0, which gives us m leqslant 2 + ln n. Therefore, frac{m}{n} leqslant frac{1 + ln n}{n}.

Simplifying gives x^2+(y-1)^2=4, Since there exists a point M on circle C satisfying MA=2MO, Therefore, the two circles intersect or are tangent, Thus, 1 leqslant sqrt{a^2+(a-3)^2} leqslant 3, solving this gives 0 leqslant a leqslant 3, So, the range of the real number a is boxed{[0,3]}.

The first player to have exactly 21 coins in one of the boxes after their move wins. Who wins with optimal play?","completion":"1. We start by numbering the boxes from 1 to 11. Let's denote the move by the number of the box into which we do **not** place a coin. 2. Assume that the first player begins the game by not placing a coin in box 1. Hence, a coin is placed in boxes 2 through 11. 3. To ensure victory, the second player must make moves such that, regardless of the first player's moves, they end up making moves corresponding to boxes 2 through 11 during the game. This configuration ensures that each box will contain 10 coins eventually. 4. For each box k, where 1 leq k leq 11, after 11 moves, 10 coins will be placed in each of the 10 remaining boxes, excluding box 1. 5. Let's identify box A, in which the first player sequentially places a coin from their second move to the 11th move. Thus, after their 11 moves, box A will contain 20 coins. 6. Now the second player's 11th move should be such that they place a coin in every box except one, thereby ensuring that the chosen box A (which already contains 20 coins from the first player's moves) now accumulates 21 coins on this final move. 7. By doing so, the second player wins the game because they are the first to have a box containing exactly 21 coins. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The second player wins}} ]"},{"prompt":"f the function y=(m3)x^{m^{2}3m+2} is a quadratic function in terms of x, then the value of m is: A: 3 B: 0 C: 3 or 0 D: Any real number","completion":"To determine the value of m for which the function y=(m-3)x^{m^{2}-3m+2} is a quadratic function in terms of x, we need to set the exponent of x equal to 2, since a quadratic function has the form ax^2+bx+c. Thus, we have: 1. The exponent of x must be 2: m^{2}-3m+2=2. 2. Additionally, the coefficient of x^2 must not be zero, which means m-3 neq 0. Solving the equation from step 1 for m: [ begin{align*} m^{2}-3m+2 &= 2 m^{2}-3m &= 0 m(m-3) &= 0. end{align*} ] This equation gives us two possible values for m: m=0 and m=3. However, from our second condition (m-3 neq 0), we must exclude m=3 to avoid the coefficient of x^2 being zero. Therefore, the only value of m that makes y=(m-3)x^{m^{2}-3m+2} a quadratic function in terms of x and satisfies all conditions is m=0.

If either were even, the expressions (2m^5 - 1) and (2n^5 + 1) would be odd, while (n^4) and (m^4) would be even, leading to a contradiction. 2. **Checking ((m, n) = (1, 1)):** - For (m = 1) and (n = 1): [ n^4 = 1^4 = 1 quad text{and} quad 2m^5 - 1 = 2 cdot 1^5 - 1 = 1 ] [ m^4 = 1^4 = 1 quad text{and} quad 2n^5 + 1 = 2 cdot 1^5 + 1 = 3 ] Both conditions (1 mid 1) and (1 mid 3) are satisfied. Thus, ((1, 1)) is a solution. 3. **Assuming ((m, n) neq (1, 1)):** - Consider the expression (2m^5 - 2n^5 - 1): [ 2m^5 - 2n^5 - 1 equiv 2m^5 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{n^4} ] [ 2m^5 - 2n^5 - 1 equiv -(2n^5 + 1) equiv 0 pmod{m^4} ] - Since (m) and (n) are coprime, it follows that: [ m^4 n^4 mid 2m^5 - 2n^5 - 1 ] - Note that (2m^5 - 2n^5 - 1 neq 0) due to parity considerations (since (2m^5) and (2n^5) are even, and subtracting an odd number (1) results in an odd number). 4. **Case 1: (2m^5 > 2n^5 + 1):** - We have: [ m^4 n^4 + 2n^5 + 1 le 2m^5 ] - From the second divisibility condition, (n^5 ge frac{m^4 - 1}{2}). Hence, (n^4 ge m^2) (otherwise, if (n^4 < m^2), then (n < sqrt{m}), which gives a contradiction). - Therefore: [ m^4 n^4 + 2n^5 + 1 ge m^6 + 2n^5 + 1 ge 3m^5 + 2n^5 + 1 ] This is clearly greater than (2m^5), leading to a contradiction. 5. **Case 2: (2n^5 + 1 > 2m^5):** - We have: [ m^4 n^4 + 2m^5 le 2n^5 + 1 ] - From the second divisibility condition, (m^5 ge frac{n^4 + 1}{2}). Hence, (m^4 > 2n) (easy to show). - This will yield the desired contradiction. Since both cases lead to contradictions, the only solution is ((m, n) = (1, 1)).
