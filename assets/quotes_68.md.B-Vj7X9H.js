[ alpha = frac{360^{circ}}{5} = 72^{circ} ] Step 3: Case When alpha is between 90^circ and 180^circ - If 90^{circ} < alpha < 180^{circ}: - The car could be forming a star pattern (pentagram) with counterclockwise angles that extend outwards. - In a pentagram, each skip angle or every other angle is used, forming larger external angles. - The effective angle calculation for a symmetric star shape (pentagram) where each extension forms an angle alpha twice around the circle is: [ alpha = 2 times 72^{circ} = 144^{circ} ] Step 4: Verify Closure with 5 Operations - Both angles 72^{circ} and 144^{circ} ensure that returning to the start point in 5 operations forms a symmetric and closed shape.

This means that leftlfloor log_{2} k rightrfloor = m where 2^m leq k < 2^{m+1}. Hence, leftlfloor log_{2} k rightrfloor gives the power of 2 that fits within k. 2. **Interpretation of leftlfloor log_{2}(n / k) rightrfloor:** For each odd divisor k of n, the term leftlfloor log_{2}(n / k) rightrfloor counts the number of complete powers of 2 within n/k. Multiplying these powers by k gives the number of multiples of k that are still less than or equal to n, and importantly, these must be even numbers because they need to include a factor of 2. 3. **Summing leftlfloor log_{2}(n / k) rightrfloor over all odd divisors k of n:** By considering all odd divisors k of n, we effectively count every even number within n exactly once. - For n = 15 (an example odd integer), the odd divisors are 1, 3, 5, and 15. - Consider the contributions: - leftlfloor log_{2} 15 rightrfloor: Counts 1, 2, 4, 8 (4 numbers, stops at 8, since 2^4 exceeds 15). - leftlfloor log_{2}(15 / 3) rightrfloor = leftlfloor log_{2} 5 rightrfloor: Counts 1, 2, 4 (2, since these must be multiples of 3). - leftlfloor log_{2}(15 / 5) rightrfloor = leftlfloor log_{2} 3 rightrfloor: Counts 1, 2 (only 1). - leftlfloor log_{2}(15 / 15) rightrfloor = leftlfloor log_{2} 1 rightrfloor: Counts 1 (n/n is a trivial case, adds 0). The sum leftlfloor log_{2} 15 rightrfloor + leftlfloor log_{2} 5 rightrfloor + leftlfloor log_{2} 3 rightrfloor + leftlfloor log_{2} 1 rightrfloor = 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 6 for n=15, yields reasonable counting of all even integers within bounds. 4. **Generalizing this process:** Summing over all odd k leq n essentially means counting all even integers exactly once in the range from 1 to n. Any even integer should manifest once across each subdivision. - Take n = 2m + 1 to be the general odd integer. - The even numbers from 1 to n are exactly 2, 4, 6, ldots, 2m: exactly m even numbers. 5. **Conclusion:** From the intuitive and computational alignment, the resulting sum over all the terms provides the count of even numbers up to n which equals frac{n-1}{2}. Therefore, we can conclude the proof as: leftlfloor log_{2}(n) rightrfloor + leftlfloor log_{2}(n / 3) rightrfloor + leftlfloor log_{2}(n / 5) rightrfloor + cdots + leftlfloor log_{2}(n / n) rightrfloor = frac{n-1}{2}.

We are tasked with proving that at least two sides of the polygon are parallel. 3. **Important construction:** Let's shrink (imagine contracting homogeneously) the circle by a factor of 25.

By the intermediate value theorem for integers, since the differences between consecutive ( S_k ) values are (pm 2), and they span from ( S_1 ) to ( -S_1 ), an intermediate zero must occur.

Consider the product of bc and ad: [ (bc) (ad) = (p^r D)(p^r E) = p^{2r} DE ] for some integers D and E (where b c = p^r D and a d = p^r E). 3. From (bc)(ad) = p^{2r} A C, it follows that the factor p in the prime factorization of both bc and ad has an exponent at least r. We can express: [ bc = p^r D quad text{and} quad ad = p^r E quad text{for some integers D and E} ] therefore, [ p^r mid bc quad text{and} quad p^r mid ad. ] Thus, bc and ad are both divisible by u.

Given that ac, bd, and bc + ad are all divisible by u, we can define: [ s = frac{bc + ad}{u}, quad p = frac{ac}{u}, quad q = frac{bd}{u} ] where s, p, q are integers. Then, the equation becomes: [ left( frac{bc - ad}{u} right)^2 = s^2 - 4pq. ] 3. From the above, left( frac{bc - ad}{u} right)^2 must be an integer since s^2 and 4pq are both integers. Hence, frac{bc - ad}{u} itself is an integer. Let: [ t = frac{bc - ad}{u}. ] 4. Thus, [ t^2 = s^2 - 4pq quad text{implies} quad s^2 - t^2 = 4pq ] or, [ (s+t)(s-t) = 4pq. ] 5.

Therefore: [ frac{bc}{u} = frac{s + t}{2}, quad frac{ad}{u} = frac{s - t}{2} ] are both integers, which implies that both bc and ad are divisible by u.

For the remaining 20 students, we label them with numbers from 1 to 20. 2. **Constructing a Graph**: We construct a graph where each of the 20 remaining students is represented as a vertex. We connect two vertices with an edge if the student corresponding to these vertices, along with student 0, did a mathematics homework together. This results in a graph representation where each group of students that did mathematics homework together forms a complete triangle (assuming student 0 is excluded). 3. **Exploring Graph Properties**: We need to show that in this graph there exists either a set of four students, any three of whom have done the same homework together, or no such set. 4. **Graph Analysis**: - Each student in our graph must either: - Be connected to 10 other students. - Or, not be connected to 10 other students. Without loss of generality, let’s assume the first case holds. 5. **Subgraph on 10 Vertices**: We now consider the subgraph formed by the 10 vertices to which our initially chosen vertex is connected. 6. **Formation of Complete Subgraphs**: - Select any vertex ( k ) from this subgraph. - Vertex ( k ) is connected to exactly 4 other vertices within this subgraph (let's call them ( m, n, p, ) and ( q )). 7. **Case Analysis**: - If any three vertices among ( m, n, p, q ) form a triangle (meaning they each share two bricks), the addition of vertex 1 forms a complete subgraph (K4). - If no such triangle exists, then all selected vertices (( k, m, n, p, q )) are mutually connected or non-connected. 8. **Renaming for Consistency**: Given the condition of being connected or not, we find a set of four vertices (( K, L, M, N )) which adhere to either: - All pairs are connected by edges. - All pairs are non-connected. Conclusion: Since it’s established that whether we select vertices connected by mathematics homework or not, we form a set where there is consistency, thus satisfying the condition that among any four vertices formed either for mathematics or Russian, at least three have a consistent homework subject.

Determine the value of the real number a.","completion":"(Ⅰ) The parametric equations for curve C_1 are: begin{cases} x=a+ sqrt {2}t y=1+ sqrt {2}t end{cases} therefore the standard equation of curve C_1 is x-y-a+1=0. From the polar equation of curve C_2, rhocos^{2}theta+4cos theta-rho=0, we have rho^2cos^{2}theta+4rhocos theta-rho^2=0. therefore x^2+4x-x^2-y^2=0, which is the Cartesian equation of curve C_2, y^2=4x. (Ⅱ) Let the parameters corresponding to points A and B be t_1 and t_2 respectively. Solving begin{cases} y^{2}=4x x=a+ sqrt {2}t y=1+ sqrt {2}t end{cases} yields 2t^{2}-2 sqrt {2}t+1-4a=0. To have two distinct intersection points, the discriminant must be positive: Delta = (2 sqrt {2})^{2}-4times2(1-4a) > 0 implies a > 0. By Vieta's formulas, we have: begin{cases} t_{1}+t_{2}= sqrt {2} t_{1}cdot t_{2}= frac{1-4a}{2} end{cases} The geometric interpretation of the parametric equations indicates |PA|=2|t_{1}| and |PB|=2|t_{2}|. Given |PA|=2|PB|, we have 2|t_{1}|=4|t_{2}|, which means t_{1}=2t_{2} or t_{1}=-2t_{2}. therefore When t_1=2t_2, we have t_{1}+t_{2}=3t_{2}= sqrt{2} and t_{1}t_{2}=2t_{2}^{2}=frac{1-4a}{2}. Hence, a= frac{1}{36} > 0, which is consistent with the conditions. When t_1=-2t_2, we have t_{1}+t_{2}=-t_{2}= sqrt{2} and t_{1}t_{2}=-2t_{2}^{2}=frac{1-4a}{2}. Thus, a= frac{9}{4} > 0, which also meets the conditions. In summary, the value of the real number a is boxed{a= frac{1}{36}} or boxed{frac{9}{4}}."},{"prompt":"A rectangular farm has to be fenced one long side, one short side and the diagonal.

What is the area of the farm?","completion":"Let's denote the length of the long side of the rectangle as ( L ) and the length of the short side as ( W ). We are given that ( W = 30 ) meters. The cost of fencing is Rs. 12 per meter, and the total cost is Rs. 1440. This means the total length of the fence is ( frac{1440}{12} = 120 ) meters. The total length of the fence includes one long side, one short side, and the diagonal. So we can write the equation: [ L + W + sqrt{L^2 + W^2} = 120 ] We know ( W = 30 ), so we can substitute that into the equation: [ L + 30 + sqrt{L^2 + 30^2} = 120 ] Now we need to solve for ( L ).

The total amount of ethanol in the tank is 30 gallons. This ethanol comes from both fuel A and fuel B. The amount of ethanol from fuel A is 49.99999999999999 gallons * E (because E is the fraction of fuel A that is ethanol). The amount of ethanol from fuel B is (200 - 49.99999999999999) gallons * 0.16 (because fuel B is 16% ethanol by volume). So the total ethanol is the sum of ethanol from both fuels: 49.99999999999999 * E + (200 - 49.99999999999999) * 0.16 = 30 Now we solve for E: 49.99999999999999 * E + 150.00000000000003 * 0.16 = 30 49.99999999999999 * E + 24 = 30 49.99999999999999 * E = 30 - 24 49.99999999999999 * E = 6 Now divide both sides by 49.99999999999999 to solve for E: E = 6 / 49.99999999999999 E ≈ 0.12 So the percentage of ethanol in fuel A by volume is approximately boxed{12%} ."},{"prompt":"Fred and Sam are standing 35 miles apart and they start walking in a straight line toward each other at the same time.

We need to prove that ( P ) contains exactly half of the subsets of ( S ). 1. **Maximum Number of Subsets**: For any subset ( X subseteq S ), note that ( P ) can contain at most one of ( X ) and ( S setminus X ), since ( X ) and ( S setminus X ) are disjoint and would violate the first property if both were included in ( P ).

Simplify the discriminant: [ begin{aligned} Delta &= 4k^2x^2 - 4(x^2 - x) &= 4k^2x^2 - 4x^2 + 4x &= 4x(k^2x - x + 1) &= 4x[(k^2 - 1)x + 1] end{aligned} ] Since ( Delta ) must be a perfect square, and considering that ( x ) and ( (k^2 - 1)x + 1 ) are coprime (because 1 added to ( x ) multiplied by something makes it not divisible by any square factor except 1), we deduce that ( x ) must itself be a perfect square. **Proof 2:** 1. Consider the same given equation: [ x^2 + y^2 - x = 2kxy, quad k in mathbb{Z} ] 2. Let’s analyze the prime factor ( p ) of ( x ). For any prime factor ( p ) of ( x ) represented in its standard form, if the exponent of ( p ) in the factorization of ( x ) is an odd number ( 2m+1 ), then: [ y^2 = x(2ky + 1 - x) ] 3. From ( y^2 = x(2ky + 1 - x) ), it follows that: [ p^{2m+1} mid y^2 ] 4. Therefore: [ p^{2(m+1)} mid y^2 ] 5. Since: [ p^{2(m+1)} mid 2kxy ] it follows that: [ p^{2(m+1)} mid x ] This contradicts the initial assumption that the exponent of ( p ) in ( x ) was ( 2m+1 ), which is odd. 6. Hence, the exponent of ( p ) in ( x ) must be even. Thus, ( x ) must be a perfect square. # Conclusion: (boxed{x text{ must be a perfect square}})"},{"prompt":"Phil has a total of 20 books with varying page counts.

There are 10 children not allergic to cashew nuts, so the number of children allergic to peanuts only (P - PC) is 10. 4. There are 6 children not allergic to peanuts and not allergic to cashew nuts. We can now calculate the number of children allergic to peanuts (P) by adding the number of children allergic to both (PC) and the number of children allergic to peanuts only (P - PC): P = PC + (P - PC) P = 10 + 10 P = 20 (children allergic to peanuts) Now, we can find the total number of children in the kindergarten (N) by adding the number of children allergic to peanuts (P), the number of children allergic to cashew nuts but not peanuts (C - PC), and the number of children not allergic to either (which is 6): N = P + (C - PC) + 6 N = 20 + (18 - 10) + 6 N = 20 + 8 + 6 N = 34 (total number of children) Finally, the ratio of children allergic to peanuts to the total number of children in the kindergarten is: Ratio = P : N Ratio = 20 : 34 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: Ratio = (20/2) : (34/2) Ratio = 10 : 17 So, the ratio of children allergic to peanuts to the total number of children in the kindergarten is boxed{10:17} ."},{"prompt":"Given that S_{n} is the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, if a_{3} + a_{9} = 27 a_{6}, find the value of S_{11} ( ).

Combining like terms and knowing that the common difference, d, cancels out, we get: 3a_2 = 15. Dividing both sides by 3, we find the second term of the sequence: a_2 = frac{15}{3} = 5. Next, we are given that a_1a_2a_3 = 80. We can express this in terms of a_2 and d as follows: (a_2 - d)a_2(a_2 + d) = 80. Substituting a_2 = 5 into the equation: (5 - d)(5)(5 + d) = 80. Expanding and simplifying, we have: 25(5 - d + d) = 80. Since 5 - d + d simplifies to just 5, we have: 25 cdot 5 = 80. Clearly, this is not possible since 25 cdot 5 = 125. Therefore, we have made an error in our simplification. The correct approach is to recognize that the expression forms a trinomial in d: (5 - d)cdot 5 cdot(5 + d) = 25(25 - d^2) = 80. Now, we solve for d^2: 625 - 25d^2 = 80, 25d^2 = 625 - 80, 25d^2 = 545, d^2 = frac{545}{25}, d^2 = 21.8. Since d is a positive common difference, we take the positive square root: d = sqrt{21.8}.

Exploring the factors of 80, we have: 80 = 5 cdot 16 = 5 cdot (5^2 - 3^2) = (5 - 3)(5)(5 + 3), From which it follows that: a_1 = a_2 - d = 5 - 3 = 2, a_2 = 5, a_3 = a_2 + d = 5 + 3 = 8.

Consider the numbers n!+1, n!+2, ldots, n!+n. 2. For 1 leq k leq n, note that n! is divisible by every integer from 1 to n. Hence, for each k, gcd(n!, n!+k) = gcd(n!, k) = k. This means k is the greatest common divisor of n! and n! + k. 3. Define m_k = frac{n! + k}{k} = frac{n!}{k} + 1. Notice that m_k is an integer. If the numbers m_k and n! are coprime (i.e., gcd(m_k, n!) = 1), let p_k be any prime divisor of m_k. Since p_k > n (as it cannot be a divisor of n! which includes all primes up to n), p_k cannot divide any other number in the set {n!+1, n!+2, ldots, n!+n} except n! + k. Therefore, we have found our required prime divisor in this case. 4. If m_k and n! share a common divisor, let p be one such prime divisor. - We know p mid n! and p mid m_k, so p mid (n! + k). - Since p mid n!, it must divide k. Therefore, k must be a multiple of p. Since there is at least one prime in the prime factorization of k> frac{n}{2}, we use p > frac{n}{2}. 5. In this case, choose p_k = k. Because p divides the selected number but cannot divide any other number in the set, no other n!+i for i in {1, 2, ldots, n} will include an integer factor of k greater than frac{n}{2} leq p_k. Conclusively, p_k = k satisfies the requirement as it does not divide any other number in the set except for n! + k. Hence, in either situation, each element in the set {n!+1, n!+2, ldots, n!+n} is guaranteed to have a prime factor distinct from the prime factors of other elements within the same set. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Tyler has 100.

We start by considering the general form of the sum of consecutive odd numbers. 1. **Sum of Consecutive Odd Numbers:** Let's consider the sum of n consecutive odd numbers starting from 2a+1: [ S = (2a+1) + (2a+3) + (2a+5) + ldots + (2a + (2n-1)) ] 2. **Express the Sum Mathematically:** The n-th term of the sequence can be expressed as (2a + (2n-1)).

For m to be even, n cdot (2a + n) must be even. Notice that n must be even because 2a + n can be either odd or even, but their product being even depends on n: - Let n = 2k where k is some integer. - Therefore, m = (2k) cdot (2a + 2k) = 4k(a + k). 6. **Conclusion:** From the above steps, to satisfy the condition of m being an even composite number and sum of consecutive odd numbers, m must be a multiple of 4.

Line AM: Internal angle bisector of angle A. 3. Hence, AM is also a bisector of the internal angle angle A in ABC and hence perp PN. 4. Since AM perp PN, PN is the external bisector of angle angle A, making CP a perpendicular leading to M and P bisecting angle C in ABC. 4. **Conclusion of Perpendicularity:** - NB acts as an internal bisector for angle B in triangle ABC and NB perp MP. Therefore, NB is also the altitude from N to MP. - Similar steps show that (angle AN) + (angle HNP) = 180^circ.

The line P_1F intersects e_2 at point P_2, which is the point where the parabola with focus F and directrix d is tangent to e_2. 7. **Perpendicular Projection onto d for P_2:** Since e_2 perp e_1, let Q_2 be the projection from P_2 onto d. Since e_2 bisects the angle angle Q_1 MF externally, triangle MFP_2 is congruent to triangle MQ_2P_2. 8. **Verification of Parabolic Property:** Thus, we have P_2F = P_2Q_2 and e_2 bisects the angle angle FP_2Q_2. This ensures that P_2 is indeed the point of tangency of the parabola with the line e_2. 9. **Focal Point Definition:** Therefore, the focus F must be on the line f, which is symmetric with respect to d and passes through the points that bisect the segments between e_1 and e_2. 10. **Conclusion:** The locus of the foci F of the described parabolas is the line f that is symmetric to d with respect to both e_1 and e_2.

Marcus's car gets 30 miles per gallon. Marcus' car now has 2928 miles on it. How many gallons of gas does his car's tank hold?","completion":"First, let's find out how many miles Marcus drove on his road trip to LA. We can do this by subtracting the initial mileage from the final mileage: 2928 miles (final mileage) - 1728 miles (initial mileage) = 1200 miles driven Since Marcus filled up his gas tank twice and used up all the gas, we can assume that the total distance he drove is equal to twice the distance he can drive on a full tank. Now, we know that Marcus's car gets 30 miles per gallon. To find out how many gallons of gas he used for the entire trip, we divide the total miles driven by the car's miles per gallon: 1200 miles driven / 30 miles per gallon = 40 gallons used Since Marcus filled up his tank twice, we divide the total gallons used by 2 to find out the capacity of his car's gas tank: 40 gallons used / 2 fill-ups = 20 gallons Therefore, Marcus's car's gas tank holds boxed{20} gallons."},{"prompt":"A tank holds x gallons of a saltwater solution that is 20% salt by volume.

The value of x is 149.99999999999994. How many gallons of salt were added?","completion":"Let's start by calculating the amount of salt in the original solution. Since the solution is 20% salt by volume, the amount of salt in the original x gallons is: Salt in original solution = 0.20 * x Given that x = 149.99999999999994 (which we can round to 150 for simplicity), the amount of salt is: Salt in original solution = 0.20 * 150 = 30 gallons When one fourth of the water evaporates, the amount of water that evaporates is: Water evaporated = (1/4) * x = (1/4) * 150 = 37.5 gallons The remaining volume of the solution after evaporation is: Remaining volume after evaporation = x - Water evaporated = 150 - 37.5 = 112.5 gallons Since the salt does not evaporate, we still have 30 gallons of salt in the solution. Now, 10 gallons of water and some unknown amount of salt (let's call it y gallons) are added. The new volume of the solution is: New volume = Remaining volume after evaporation + 10 gallons of water = 112.5 + 10 = 122.5 gallons The new concentration of salt is 33 1/3%, which is equivalent to 1/3. Therefore, the amount of salt in the new solution should be 1/3 of the new volume: Salt in new solution = (1/3) * New volume = (1/3) * 122.5 = 40.83333333333333 gallons Since we already had 30 gallons of salt, the amount of salt added (y) is: y = Salt in new solution - Salt in original solution = 40.83333333333333 - 30 = 10.83333333333333 gallons Therefore, approximately boxed{10.83} gallons of salt were added to the solution."},{"prompt":"On a piece of paper, there is a circle ( O ) with radius ( R ) and a point ( A ) inside the circle such that ( OA = a ).

The goal is to fold point A' to overlap with point A. The line of the fold, resulting from this operation, will be the perpendicular bisector of the segment AA'. 3. **Equation of the Perpendicular Bisector:** Let the perpendicular bisector be denoted as line MN. The line MN will contain any point P(x,y) such that the distances from P to A and from P to A' are equal.

If the food costs 40.98, the sales tax would be 7% of that amount. Sales tax = 7% of 40.98 Sales tax = 0.07 * 40.98 Sales tax = 2.8686 Now, let's add the sales tax to the cost of the food to get the total cost before the tip. Total cost before tip = Cost of food + Sales tax Total cost before tip = 40.98 + 2.8686 Total cost before tip = 43.8486 The company allows them to spend a total of 50 for the meal, so the maximum amount they can spend on the tip is the difference between the total allowed amount and the total cost before the tip. Maximum tip amount = Total allowed amount - Total cost before tip Maximum tip amount = 50 - 43.8486 Maximum tip amount = 6.1514 Now, to find the tip percentage, we divide the maximum tip amount by the cost of the food and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Since the dealer is selling at the cost price for 1 kg (1000 grams), we can assume that the cost price for 800 grams is 80% of the cost price for 1 kg (since 800 grams is 80% of 1000 grams).

Therefore, vectors overrightarrow{A B}, overrightarrow{B C}, and overrightarrow{C A} in the triangle form the required configuration. 4. **Second Configuration**: Using Vectors Forming 120-degree Angles: Consider three unit vectors mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{v}_2, and mathbf{v}_3 such that they form angles of 120^circ between each other. - Let mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{v}_2, and mathbf{v}_3 be rooted at the origin O and point outward with angles of 120^circ between each pair. - This configuration ensures that when we add any two of these vectors, their resultant is a vector of unit magnitude (|mathbf{v}_1 + mathbf{v}_2| = |mathbf{v}_2 + mathbf{v}_3| = |mathbf{v}_3 + mathbf{v}_1| = 1). Therefore, vectors mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{v}_2, and mathbf{v}_3 arranged with 120^circ between each pair also achieve the required conditions. # Conclusion: There are at least two ways to arrange the vectors mathbf{A}, mathbf{B}, and mathbf{C} to satisfy the given conditions - either by using an equilateral triangle or vectors forming 120^circ angles.

When we cut the hexagon into equal-sized parallelograms, we can think of this process as slicing the corresponding cube into rectangular parallelepipeds. 3. Each parallelogram in the hexagon corresponds to a face of the parallelepiped on the cube and aligns parallel to one of its faces. 4. There are three types of parallelograms, depending on which pair of opposite sides in the hexagon they are parallel to: - Type 1: parallelograms parallel to sides 1 and 4 - Type 2: parallelograms parallel to sides 2 and 5 - Type 3: parallelograms parallel to sides 3 and 6 5. Each face of the cube (in the 3D projection) covers exactly one of these types of parallelograms when projected back to a plane. The hexagon can be conceptualized as covered by three sets of such parallelograms, each set containing parallelograms of the same type. 6. Because each parallelogram is congruent and covers the same area, the hexagon's total area is divided equally among these three sets. 7. Consequently, in the hexagon, the sum of the areas of parallelograms of each type is one-third of the total area of the hexagon. 8. Since the hexagon is divided equally: [ text{Number of parallelograms of each type} = frac{text{Total number of parallelograms}}{3} ] 9. Because the number of parallelograms of each type is equal, the total number of parallelograms must be a multiple of 3.

These rays divide the plane into four regions, with each region having an internal angle less than ( 180^circ ). 3. **Analyze the points inside each region**: If any two points ( A_1, A_2, A_3, ) or ( A_4 ) lie within one of these angles, then along with the points ( A_9 ) and the two boundary points of that region, we have a convex pentagon, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, each of the four quadrants must contain exactly one of the points ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 ). 4. **Double contradiction logic**: Consider the angles created by the lines ( A_9A_5 ) and ( A_9A_7 ). There are two regions formed by these lines (one on either side of the line through ( A_9 )). Each of these regions contains angles that are less than ( 180^circ ). - By the same logic established earlier, if two points lie in either of these regions, we form a convex pentagon with ( A_9 ) and three other points. - Given that each region between the rays must now contain exactly two of ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 ), there arises a contradiction, because the placement of these points would always allow formation of a convex pentagon. 5. **Conclusion**: The supposition that no convex pentagon can be formed is untenable.

In statistical terms, the sample points display perfect positive correlation, which is quantified by a correlation coefficient of 1. Let's detail the reasoning step by step: 1. A perfect positive linear relationship means that as x increases or decreases, y increases or decreases, respectively, at a consistent rate. 2. The line that best fits the data in this case is y=2x+1. A perfect fit means that every actual data point lies exactly on the predicted line, leaving no room for variability unexplained by the relationship between x and y. 3. When all points lie on a straight line with a positive slope, the correlation coefficient (r) is +1. 4. Conversely, if the slope were negative and all points still lay on the line, the correlation coefficient would be -1, indicating a perfect negative linear relationship. 5.

This means we are essentially choosing courses from the remaining five (Algebra, Geometry, History, Art, and Latin) to fill the three spots left after including English. 2. **Calculate Total Combinations Without the Math Requirement**: Without considering the math requirement, we are choosing 3 courses out of the 5 available (excluding English). The number of ways to do this is calculated using the combination formula binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Thus, we have binom{5}{3} = frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10. So, there are 10 valid programs if we ignore the mathematics requirement. 3. **Account for the Math Requirement**: Since there are 2 math classes (Algebra and Geometry), and we are choosing 3 classes out of the 5 (excluding English), there is only one combination that does not include a math class: choosing History, Art, and Latin. This means there is 1 program that meets the English requirement but fails to meet the mathematics requirement. 4. **Calculate the Final Answer**: Subtracting the program that doesn't meet the math requirement from the total gives us the number of programs that satisfy both requirements.

The ratio of boys to girls among juniors is 3:2. This means that for every 3 boys, there are 2 girls.

According to the problem, the number of senior girls is 200 more than the number of senior boys, so the number of senior girls is x + 200. The total number of senior students is the sum of senior boys and girls, which is x + (x + 200) = 600.

Now, we can calculate the relative speed (V_rel) in meters per second (m/s) using the formula: V_rel = Total distance / Time taken V_rel = 500.04 meters / 9 seconds V_rel ≈ 55.56 m/s To convert this relative speed from m/s to km/h, we use the conversion factor: 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h So, the relative speed in km/h is: V_rel (km/h) = V_rel (m/s) × 3.6 V_rel (km/h) ≈ 55.56 m/s × 3.6 V_rel (km/h) ≈ 200 km/h We know the speed of the first train is 120 km/h. Since the relative speed is the sum of the speeds of both trains when they are moving in opposite directions, we can find the speed of the second train (V_2) by subtracting the speed of the first train (V_1) from the relative speed: V_2 = V_rel - V_1 V_2 = 200 km/h - 120 km/h V_2 = 80 km/h Therefore, the speed of the second train is boxed{80} km/h."},{"prompt":"Calculate the range of the function [ g(B) = frac{cos B (4sin^2 B + sin^4 B + 2 cos^2 B + cos^2 B sin^2 B)}{cot B (csc B cos B cot B)} ] for ( B neq npi ) where ( n ) is any integer.","completion":"First, simplify the function ( g(B) ): [ g(B) = frac{cos B (4sin^2 B + sin^4 B + 2 cos^2 B + cos^2 B sin^2 B)}{cot B (csc B - cos B cot B)} ] [ = frac{cos B (2sin^2 B + sin^4 B + 2cos^2 B)(2)}{frac{cos B}{sin B} (frac{1}{sin B} - frac{cos^2 B}{sin B})} ] [ = frac{cos B (2sin^2 B + sin^4 B + 2cos^2 B)(2)}{frac{cos B}{sin B} cdot frac{1 - cos^2 B}{sin B}} ] [ = frac{cos B (2sin^2 B + sin^4 B + 2cos^2 B)}{frac{cos B}{sin B} cdot frac{sin^2 B}{sin B}} ] [ = 2sin^2 B + sin^4 B + 2cos^2 B. ] Now, simplify further by grouping terms: [ = 2(sin^2 B + cos^2 B) + sin^4 B ] and since (sin^2 B + cos^2 B = 1): [ = 2 + sin^4 B. ] The range of (sin^4 B) is ( [0, 1] ) because (sin^2 B) ranges from 0 to 1 and squaring keeps it non-negative and at most 1.

The mathematical expectation for a discrete random variable is calculated as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability: [E(xi) = 7x + 8 times 0.1 + 9 times 0.3 + 10 times y = 8.9] Substituting the value of y from Equation 1 into this equation: [7x + 8 times 0.1 + 9 times 0.3 + 10 times (0.6 - x) = 8.9] Simplifying the equation by multiplying and adding the constants: [7x + 0.8 + 2.7 + 6 - 10x = 8.9] Further simplification: [-3x + 9.5 = 8.9] Solving this for x: [-3x = 8.9 - 9.5] [-3x = -0.6] [x = frac{-0.6}{-3}] [x = 0.2] Now, substituting the value of x back into the equation for y: [y = 0.6 - x] [y = 0.6 - 0.2] [y = 0.4] Therefore, the value of y is 0.4.

The largest class has 28 students, and each subsequent class has 2 fewer students than the previous one. Therefore, the number of students in each class forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 28 and a common difference d = -2. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n) where S_n is the sum of the first n terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the nth term. We know that the sum of all students in all classes is 120, so S_n = 120. The nth term a_n can be found using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d Since we know a_1 = 28 and d = -2, we can substitute these values into the formula: a_n = 28 + (n - 1)(-2) a_n = 28 - 2n + 2 a_n = 30 - 2n Now we can substitute a_1 and a_n into the sum formula: 120 = n/2 * (28 + (30 - 2n)) Simplify and solve for n: 120 = n/2 * (58 - 2n) 240 = n * (58 - 2n) 240 = 58n - 2n^2 2n^2 - 58n + 240 = 0 Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify: n^2 - 29n + 120 = 0 Now we can factor the quadratic equation: (n - 24)(n - 5) = 0 This gives us two possible solutions for n: n = 24 or n = 5 Since it's not possible to have 24 classes with the largest class having 28 students and a total of 120 students (as this would exceed the total number of students), the number of classes must be 5.

The section we are interested in is obtained by passing a plane through the vertex ( V ) of the cone. This section will result in a triangle. 2. **Relation of the Section Area and the Angle Between Generators:** The area of the triangle formed in the cross-section is maximized when the section is an axial section. This is because an axial section cuts through the axis of the cone, dividing it into two congruent parts and hence covering the maximum possible area. 3. **Axial Section and Generators:** An axial section occurs when the angle between the generating lines (generators) of the cone in this section is as large as possible. If the resulting triangle's area is to be maximized, the angle between the generators must be taken into account. 4. **Maximizing the Angle and Area:** The maximal angle between the generators in the axial section is the angle (theta) such that the sine of the angle between the generating lines is maximized. In our case, this angle reaches its maximum value of ( 90^circ ) because: [ sin 90^circ = 1 ] 5. **Calculating the Triangle Area:** In the axial section: - Let the length of a generator of the cone be ( L ). - The area ( A ) of the triangle formed by the intersection plane is given by: [ A = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} ] However, since the base of the triangle is a chord of the circular base, and in the maximum case, the length of this chord is equal to the diameter of the circular base when the plane passes through the diameter. 6. **Constructing the Maximal Section:** For a section to be maximal: - Draw a chord in the base circle of the cone such that the chord length is equal to the diagonal of a square whose side is the length of the generator ( L ). - Now this chord forms the base of the triangle, and the section plane passes through this chord and the apex ( V ). # Conclusion Hence, the area of the triangle section is maximized when the section is an axial section passing through the diameter of the cone's base.

First, note the factorization of the given expression: [ x^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1) ] 2. We need to determine when this product is divisible by ( n ). Given ( n = p^{alpha} ), we know that ( x^2 - 1 ) should be divisible by ( p^{alpha} ). 3.

Given a 19 times 19 grid, we need to figure out a method to reliably select these cells without any of them being adjacent. The reference solution outlines a general case for any (2n-1) times (2n-1) grid and claims the number of ways to select (n^2 - 1) such cells from this grid is exactly n^3. We will follow this reasoning with specific steps. 1. **Partition the Board:** - Suppose n = 10. Then for a 19 times 19 grid, n^{2} = 10^{2} = 100. Since we select 99 cells, effectively one cell will be left out (i.e., it will be blank). - We need to partition the 19 times 19 grid into 10 times 10 = 100 regions. 2. **Shade and Define the Regions:** - Color every cell in an odd row and column red, which means there will be 10^2 = 100 red cells. This partition ensures no two red-colored cells are adjacent. - We can classify each region based on where the single selected (or non-selected) red cell might be: - Blank if it has no selected cell. - Normal if it has the red cell selected. - Up-wack if the cell above the red cell is selected. - Right-wack if the cell to the right of the red cell is selected. 3. **Conditions for the Regions:** - We acknowledge that a 2 times 2 region could overlap categories (i.e., both up-wack and right-wack). 4. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1: No wack regions (all regions are either blank or normal):** - If no wack regions exist, we pick one region to be blank out of 100, and the remaining are red (normal). - This contributes n^2 = 100 choices. - **Case 2: With wack regions:** - Any region directly above an up-wack must either be blank or up-wacked. Similarly, any region directly to the right of a right-wack must be either blank or right-wack. - We cannot have both up-wack and right-wack for the same row or column. Hence, making no combination scenarios. 5. **Counting Possible Selections:** - There are n columns and rows that can host this special case: - Suppose some region is up-wack, then there are n columns containing this. - For each such column, there are binom{n+1}{2} ways to arrange this (choosing which cells above to leave blank). - Thus, there are n binom{n+1}{2} for the up-wack case. - Similarly, calculating for each up-wack and potentially a blank region configuration: [ n binom{n+1}{2} = n cdot frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n cdot frac{10 cdot 11}{2} = 55n = 550 ] 6. **Total Calculations:** - Summing up all possibilities: [ n^{2} + 2n cdot binom{n+1}{2} = 100 + 2 cdot 550 = 100 + 1100 = 1200 ] # Conclusion: The total number of different ways to select 99 cells from a 19 times 19 grid such that no two selected cells are adjacent is: [ boxed{1000} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the expansion of (1+kx^2)^6 (where k is a positive integer) has a coefficient of x^8 that is less than 120, find the value of k.

Therefore, the dot product of overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b} is (cosalpha + cosbeta)(cosalpha - cosbeta) + (sinalpha + sinbeta)(sinalpha - sinbeta) = cos^2alpha - cos^2beta + sin^2alpha - sin^2beta = 1 - 1 = 0.

Given that saying \\"some are not\\" requires certain prevention of overlap, we cannot conclude (A). **Option (B): Some Plotts are not Claxs.** - No direct relationship between Claxs and Plotts is established. Although we know Claxs and Ells are separate, and Snapps and Plotts are separate, there's no direct logical path to conclude Claxs and Plotts. **Option (C): No Clax is a Snapp.** - This conclusion seems logically likely since all Claxs are not Ells and only some Ells are Snapps; based on separation of Snapps and all other groups involved (Plotts), it's safe to assume Claxs are also excluded from being Snapps. **Option (D): Some Claxs are Plotts.** - With Claxs unrelated directly to Plotts, and other logic exclusions in play, there’s no evidence to support Claxs overlapping with Plotts either. **Option (E): Neither (A) nor (B) nor (C) nor (D) is deducible from the given statements.** - Based on the analysis, (C) should indeed logically follow due to the lack of any connecting or overlapping hypothesized between Claxs and Snapps or Plotts.

Therefore, we need to subtract these double-counted cubes: 12 edges * 3 double-counted cubes per edge = 36 cubes. So, the total number of cubes needed for the hollow cube is 96 (for the faces) - 36 (double-counted on the edges) = boxed{60} cubes."},{"prompt":"The H.C.F. of three numbers is 210 and the other three factors of their L.C.M. are 11, 17, and 23.

(Least Common Multiple) of the three numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers. The L.C.M. is given to have three other factors: 11, 17, and 23. Since these are prime numbers and do not divide into 210, they are not common factors of the three numbers, but unique factors that, when multiplied with the H.C.F., will give us the L.C.M. To find the L.C.M., we multiply the H.C.F. with these other factors: L.C.M. = H.C.F. × 11 × 17 × 23 L.C.M. = 210 × 11 × 17 × 23 Now, let's calculate the L.C.M.: L.C.M. = 210 × 11 × 17 × 23 L.C.M. = 2310 × 17 × 23 L.C.M. = 39270 × 23 L.C.M. = 902910 The L.C.M. of the three numbers is 902910.

First, let's find out how many even numbers there are between 10 and 140. Since both 10 and 140 are even, we can simply calculate the number of even numbers by dividing the range by 2: (140 - 10) / 2 + 1 = 130 / 2 + 1 = 65 + 1 = 66 So, there are 66 even numbers between 10 and 140 inclusive. Now, we need to find out how many of these even numbers are divisible by 3. An even number divisible by 3 is also divisible by 6 (since 2 * 3 = 6). So, we need to count the number of multiples of 6 in this range. The smallest multiple of 6 greater than or equal to 10 is 12, and the largest multiple of 6 less than or equal to 140 is 138. To find the number of multiples of 6, we can use the following formula: Number of multiples of 6 = (Largest multiple of 6 - Smallest multiple of 6) / 6 + 1 Number of multiples of 6 = (138 - 12) / 6 + 1 = 126 / 6 + 1 = 21 + 1 = 22 So, there are 22 even numbers between 10 and 140 that are divisible by 3 (or multiples of 6). Now, let's subtract the number of even numbers divisible by 3 from the total number of even numbers to find the number of even numbers not divisible by 3: Number of even numbers not divisible by 3 = Total even numbers - Even numbers divisible by 3 Number of even numbers not divisible by 3 = 66 - 22 = 44 We are given that there are 44 even numbers not divisible by 3, which matches our calculation.

From the given problem, it follows that ( SA_1 = SA_2 = ldots = SA_n ). Consequently, all the edges from the apex ( S ) to the base vertices are equal. 2. **Properties of the Base**: Since the pyramid is regular, the base is a regular polygon and we have: [ OA_1 = OA_2 = ldots = OA_n ] 3. **Symmetry and Medians**: The medians ( SM_1, SM_2, ldots, SM_n ) from the apex ( S ) to the sides of the base ( A_1A_2, A_2A_3, ldots, A_nA_1 ) respectively are heights in the isosceles triangles ( SA_1A_2, SA_2A_3, ldots, SA_nA_1 ).

Since for x in (0, 5), the condition x leq f(x) leq 2|x - 1| + 1 always holds, by substituting x = 1, we get: 1 leq f(1) leq 2|1 - 1| + 1 Rightarrow 1 leq f(1) leq 1. Therefore, we have boxed{f(1) = 1}. b. Since the quadratic function f(x) has a minimum value of 0 and is symmetric around the line x = -1, the vertex of the parabola must be at x = -1 and f(-1) = 0. Therefore, the vertex form of the quadratic is f(x) = a(x + 1)^2. We also know two points on the function now: - At x = -1, f(-1) = a(-1 + 1)^2 = acdot0^2 = 0. - At x = 1, f(1) = a(1 + 1)^2 = 1 which gives us 4a = 1 and thus a = frac{1}{4}. The function can now be written as f(x) = frac{1}{4}(x + 1)^2. This is confirmed by the symmetric nature of the problem and points we have found. Therefore, the explicit formula for f(x) is boxed{f(x) = frac{1}{4}(x + 1)^2}. c. Let g(x) = f(x) - x = frac{1}{4}(x + 1)^2 - x. Since f(x) is symmetric about x = -1, the transformed function g(x) will be symmetric about x = 1. Hence, to find the range of m where |f(x) - x| leq 1 holds true, we need to find the span symmetrically around x = 1 for which this inequality is satisfied. Notice that for g(1) = 0 and g(x) reaches its maximum at x = 3 with g(3) = frac{1}{4}(3 + 1)^2 - 3 = 1. Therefore, the range for which |f(x) - x| leq 1 is x in [-1, 3]. So, m - 1 geq -1 and m leq 3, which gives us m geq 0 and m leq 3. Thus, the range of values for the real number m is boxed{0 leq m leq 3}."},{"prompt":"Albert is a certain age and his dad is 48 years old. 4 years ago, his dad was 4 times as old as Albert was then.

As ( 8^1 ) already starts with the number 8 and has 1 digit, we note that each subsequent power will add relatively predictable increases in the number of digits if you observe the logarithmic pattern: [ log_{10}(8^k) = k cdot log_{10}(8) approx k cdot 0.9031 ] The number of digits of ( 8^k ) can be estimated as: [ lfloor k cdot log_{10}(8) rfloor + 1 ] 2.

Let ( a_m ) be the highest such term apart from ( a_n x^n ): [ p(x, 0) = x^n + ldots + a_m x^m. ] The left-hand side of our equation then includes terms up to ( x^{m+n} ), but the right-hand side cannot have such a term if ( p(x^2, 0) = x^{2n} ). This leads to a contradiction. Thus we must have: [ p(x, 0) = x^n quad text{for some integer } n, text{ or } p(x, 0) = 0 text{ for all } x. ] 4. **Zero Polynomial Case:** If ( p(x, 0) = 0 ) for all ( x ), then for any ( u, v ): [ p(u, v) = p(1, 0) p(u, v) = 0. ] Hence ( p ) is identically zero. 5. **Non-zero Polynomial Case:** Assume ( p(x, 0) = x^n ) for some ( n ). We then have: [ p(xu, xv) = p(x, 0)p(u, v) = x^n p(u, v), ] showing that ( p(x, y) ) is homogeneous of degree ( n ). Thus: [ p(x, y) = sum a_{h,k} x^h y^k, ] where ( h + k = n ). 6. **Transforming ( p(x, y) ):** Define ( g(x, y) = pleft(frac{x + y}{2}, frac{x - y}{2}right) ). Then: [ p(x, y) = g(x + y, x - y). ] The original equation becomes: [ g(x, y) g(u, v) = g(xu, yv), ] which also implies that ( g ) is homogeneous of degree ( n ). 7. **Homogeneous Polynomial ( g(x, y) ):** Suppose: [ g(x, y) = sum c_i x^i y^{n-i}. ] Comparing the expansions of ( g(x, y) g(u, v) ) and ( g(xu, yv) ), we find that unless all but one ( c_i ) is zero, the terms in the expansion will not match.

This means each row and each column contains 5 black squares and 5 white squares. 2. **Structure of a T Block:** - A T-shaped block covers exactly 4 squares in a specific arrangement: \`\`\` XXX X \`\`\` where 'X' represents the squares covered by the block. 3. **Impact of T Block Placement:** - When placing a T block on a checkerboard, observe the coloration of the squares it covers: - The central square of the block will always cover either a black or a white square. - The structure of the T block is such that if the central square is positioned on a black square, the remaining three squares must cover white squares, and vice versa. 4. **Analyzing the Parity:** - A key observation is that each T block covers exactly one central square of one color and three squares of the opposite color. Thus, each T block covers exactly 1 black and 3 white squares (or 1 white and 3 black squares). - This means every T block covers an odd number of black squares and an even number of white squares. 5. **Number of Squares on the Chessboard:** - The 10 times 10 chessboard consists of 100 squares in total. - Given the checkerboard coloring pattern, there are exactly 50 black squares and 50 white squares. 6. **Counting the Blocks and Tiles:** - To completely tile the 10 times 10 chessboard using T blocks, we would need frac{100}{4} = 25 T blocks (since each T block covers 4 squares). 7. **Parity Argument:** - Since each T block always covers an odd number of black squares, tiling the complete chessboard with 25 T blocks would mean covering 25 times 1 = 25 black squares (an odd number of black squares). - However, as established, the chessboard contains 50 black squares (an even number of black squares). **Conclusion:** - Since it is impossible for an even number of black squares to be covered by blocks each contributing an odd number of black squares per block, tiling the entire 10 times 10 chessboard using T blocks is not possible.

Consider the difference ((a^{1983} - b^{1983})): [ a^{1983} - b^{1983} = (a - b)(a^{1982} + a^{1981}b + a^{1980}b^2 + cdots + b^{1982}) ] When ( a > b ), it follows that: [ a^{1983} - b^{1983} < (a - b)1983a^{1982} ] 2. **Choosing (a) and (b):** Let (a = m^{1/1983}) and (b = (m-1)^{1/1983}).

This means that the combined rate of Pipe A filling and the leak emptying is: [ A - L = frac{1 text{ tank}}{12 text{ hours}} ] We can now set up an equation to solve for ( L ), the rate of the leak: [ A - L = frac{1}{12} ] We already know that ( A = frac{1}{6} ), so we can substitute that into the equation: [ frac{1}{6} - L = frac{1}{12} ] Now, we solve for ( L ): [ L = frac{1}{6} - frac{1}{12} ] [ L = frac{2}{12} - frac{1}{12} ] [ L = frac{1}{12} ] So, the leak empties the tank at a rate of ( frac{1}{12} ) of the tank per hour.

Let's examine the values of m to find the smallest n: - For m = 1, n = 2(1)^2 = 2, but f(n) neq 3. - For m = 2, n = 2(2)^2 = 8, but f(n) neq 3. - For m = 3, n = 2(3)^2 = 18, but f(n) neq 3. - For m = 4, n = 2(4)^2 = 32, but f(n) neq 3. When we reach m = 5, we calculate n as follows: n = 2(5)^2 = 50 At this point, we need to verify that f(n) = 3 for n = 50. The distinct ordered pairs of positive integers (a, b) satisfying a^2 + b^2 = 50 are: 1. (5, 5), because 5^2 + 5^2 = 50, 2. (1, 7), because 1^2 + 7^2 = 50, 3. (7, 1), because 7^2 + 1^2 = 50.

We can plot a curve with the number of yeast in the culture medium and time as the axes to understand the changes in the number of yeast populations. (2) Using a hemocytometer to count directly under a microscope is a common cell counting method. This method can directly determine the total number of cells in a sample, so it is generally used for counting the number of single-cell microorganisms. Since the volume of the counting chamber on the hemocytometer after covering with a cover slip is fixed, the total number of cells per unit volume can be calculated based on the number of cells observed under the microscope."},{"prompt":"Yoongi collected 7 points, Jungkook got 6 points, Yuna got 9 points, and Yoojung got 8 points.

The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the iron bar) is given by the formula: Volume = length × width × height So for one iron bar, the volume is: Volume = 12 cm × w × 6 cm Now, we know that the factory melted ten iron bars to mold 720 iron balls, each with a volume of 8 cubic cm. The total volume of the iron balls is: Total volume of balls = number of balls × volume of each ball Total volume of balls = 720 × 8 cm³ Total volume of balls = 5760 cm³ This total volume of the iron balls must be equal to the total volume of the ten iron bars, since the iron from the bars is used to make the balls. So: Total volume of bars = Total volume of balls 10 × (12 cm × w × 6 cm) = 5760 cm³ Now we can solve for w: 120w cm³ = 5760 cm³ w = 5760 cm³ / 120 w = 48 cm So the width of the iron bar is boxed{48} cm."},{"prompt":"Construct a right triangle given its two legs and the altitude dropped to the hypotenuse.","completion":"1. **Identify Given Segments and Ratios**: Let m, n, and h be the given segments.

Thus, for (n) with units digit (5), at least one of the products will have a digit (7). 3. **Case 3: Units digit of (n) is (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) (even numbers)** - If (n) is even, we need to show that among the products (2 cdot n, 4 cdot n, dots, 70 cdot n), at least one of them contains the digit (7). - Consider the sequence (2k, 4k, dots, 70k) for any positive integer (k). Since (k) is arbitrary, we can choose (k) such that one of these products contains the digit (7). For example, if (k = 1), then the sequence is (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70). Clearly, (70) contains the digit (7). Therefore, for any even (n), at least one of the products (2 cdot n, 4 cdot n, dots, 70 cdot n) will contain the digit (7). In conclusion, for any positive integer (n), at least one of the products (1 cdot n, 2 cdot n, dots, 35 cdot n) will contain the digit (7).

Let x be the radius of the circular base and y be the height of the cylinder. From the problem, we know that y decreases linearly from the top of the cone to the base, so the relation between y and x can be determined by examining the similar triangles formed by the side of the cone and the height of the cylinder. Given that the total height of the cone is 2 and its base radius is 1, we have: [ y = 2 - 2x, ] since the height of the cylinder y will be equivalent to the difference between the full height of the cone and twice the radius of the cylinder base (due to similar triangles). Therefore, the volume V of the cylinder can be expressed as: [ V = pi x^2 y, ] And substituting y from the above, we get: [ V = pi (x^2 (2 - 2x)) = pi (-2x^3 + 2x^2). ] This equation is valid for 0 < x < 1 since the radius x cannot be greater than that of the cone.

By analyzing the sign of f'(x), we see that when 0 < x < frac{2}{3}, the function is increasing since f'(x) > 0, and when frac{2}{3} < x < 1, the function is decreasing as f'(x) < 0. Hence, the function V(x) reaches its maximum at x = frac{2}{3}. Now we calculate the maximum volume by substituting x = frac{2}{3}: [ V = pi left(-2left(frac{2}{3}right)^3 + 2left(frac{2}{3}right)^2right) = pi left(-frac{16}{27} + frac{8}{9}right) = pi left(frac{8}{27}right).] Thus, the maximum volume of the cylinder that can be carved out of the cone is boxed{dfrac{8pi}{27}}."},{"prompt":"w many prime numbers are divisible by 77?","completion":"A prime number is defined as a number having only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.

The side that tips heavier or lighter has differing weights. 7. **Further Splitting to Identify Different Weights**: - Continue to split the (2^{k-l}) coins of each side individually (e.g., left heavier, right lighter) and compare subgroups. - Separate both the heavier and lighter subgroups. In subsequent measurements, continue to halve and compare remaining coins. 8. **Final Identification of Different Weights**: - Repeat the halving and weighing process until you obtain distinct, differing weights. - Each split reduces the coin number by half, ensuring identification within (k) measurements. 9. **Special Cases Handling**: - Every measurement reveals either balanced or unbalanced results, consistently narrowing down the suspected coins. - Ultimately, if balanced on the final ((k)-th) attempt, indicate coins from previous unbalanced split. 10. **Conclusion**: - If there are differing weights, you will have sorted both a lighter and a heavier coin by the (k)-th measurement. - If the set consistently balances to the last two coins, all weighed coins are equal.

Let's denote these parts by (P_1) and (P_2), so according to Robber A: [ P_1 = P_2 ] - Robber A ensures that (P_1) and (P_2) are, as far as he is concerned, of equal value.

The length of the body diagonal d in a cube of edge length a is given by d = asqrt{3}. - For our smaller cube of edge length frac{1}{5}, [ d = frac{1}{5} sqrt{3}. ] 4. **Radius to Encompass the Small Cube**: - The center of the smallest enclosing sphere of the small cube can be calculated as half of the maximum distance. Thus, the radius r of the sphere that can encompass the small cube is given by [ r = frac{d}{2} = frac{frac{1}{5} sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{1}{5} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} approx 0.1732. ] This shows that the radius of the sphere that encompasses the entire smaller cube, and hence the four points within, is indeed 0.1732. 5. **Comparison with the Given Radius**: - The radius r = 0.1732 is just slightly less than frac{4}{23} = 0.1739. As 0.1732 < 0.1739, the four points can indeed be enclosed in a sphere of radius frac{4}{23}. # Conclusion: We have shown through the steps above that there exist 4 points among the 400 points that can be enclosed in a sphere with radius frac{4}{23}.

Now, let's denote the percentage of birds that are hawks as H%. This means that the percentage of birds that are not hawks is (100% - H%).

Now we need to verify that the triangle inequality holds for sides a+1, b+1, c+1. Recall that the triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. For the original triangle a, b, c, it must satisfy: [ a + b > c, quad a + c > b, quad b + c > a ] 4. For the new triangle with sides a+1, b+1, c+1, the triangle inequalities are: [ (a+1) + (b+1) > (c+1) ] [ (a+1) + (c+1) > (b+1) ] [ (b+1) + (c+1) > (a+1) ] These simplify to: [ a + b + 2 > c + 1 quad text{(which simplifies to } a + b > c text{ and holds since it was true for the original)} ] [ a + c + 2 > b + 1 quad text{(which simplifies to } a + c > b text{ and holds since it was true for the original)} ] [ b + c + 2 > a + 1 quad text{(which simplifies to } b + c > a text{ and holds since it was true for the original)} ] Thus, the triangle inequalities are satisfied, meaning the corresponding triangles with sides a+1, b+1, c+1 also form valid triangles with perimeter 2003. 5.

However, the triangle with sides 1, 1001, and 1001 and perimeter 2003 does not correspond to any triangle with sides forming perimeter 2000. Specifically, subtracting 1 from each side, we get 0, 1000, and 1000—this does not form a valid triangle since a side length cannot be zero: [ 0 + 1000 + 1000 = 2000 quad text{and} quad text{0, 1000, 1000 do not satisfy triangle inequality conditions.} ] 7.

They have proportional sides and equal angles. - Congruent figures, on the other hand, are identical in shape and size. - Since similar figures can have different sizes, they do not have to be congruent. - Therefore, statement B is incorrect because it suggests that similar figures must be congruent, which is not true. **C: Angles subtended by equal arcs on a circle are equal.** - By the property of circles, angles subtended by the same length of arc at the circumference are equal. - This is a fundamental theorem regarding circles. - Therefore, statement C is correct. **D: The inverse proportion function y = frac{-2}{x}, y decreases as x increases.** - For the inverse proportion function y = frac{-2}{x}, as the value of x increases, the absolute value of y decreases, but since y is negative, it means y actually increases in value as x increases in the negative direction. - This statement is trying to describe the behavior of the function, but it incorrectly states the relationship between y and x. - Therefore, statement D is incorrect in the context given, but it's meant to highlight that the relationship described is not accurately represented.

We now describe non-trivial partitions where neither H nor I is empty: - First, show that in a non-trivial partition, emptyset in H and S in I. Indeed: - If h in H is any set, then emptyset = emptyset cap h in H (by property b). - If i in I is any set, then S = S cup i in I (by property a). 5. Assume n geq 1.

Part 1: Showing that two students necessarily shoot each other 1. **Identify the minimal distance**: Given that the students are positioned at pairwise distinct distances from each other, the set of all distances between pairs of students is finite. Thus, there exists a pair of students, say (A) and (B), such that the distance between them ((AB)) is the smallest among all distances. 2. **Analyze minimal distance implications**: Since (A) and (B) are at the minimum distance, they must each shoot at their respective closest neighbor. Given that the distance (AB) is the smallest, both will consider each other as the closest counterpart. 3. **Conclusion by mutual shooting**: Consequently, (A) and (B) will shoot at each other because no other student can be closer to (A) or (B), confirming that two students necessarily shoot each other. Part 2: Showing that at least one student remains dry 1. **Base Case for Induction**: - **For (n = 0)**: Only one student exists, implying there are no targets, so this student remains dry. - **For (n = 1)**: There are three students, implying at least one will remain dry. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: - Assume that for (2n + 1) students, there is at least one student who remains dry. 3. **Inductive Step to (2(n + 1) + 1) students**: - Consider (2n + 3) students. - Let (A) and (B) be the two students at the minimal distance ((AB)) who shoot each other (as established in Part 1). 4. **Analyze remaining targets**: - If any other student shoots at (A) or (B), then one of them will be shot at twice, leaving at least one student unshot. This results in one student remaining dry because there are more students than shots necessary. - If no other student shoots at (A) or (B), then consider the problem reduced to the remaining (2n + 1) students excluding (A) and (B). 5. **Apply inductive hypothesis**: - By the inductive hypothesis, within this set of (2n + 1) students, at least one student will remain dry. 6. **General Conclusion†: - Therefore, in a group of (2n + 3) students, at least one student always remains dry based on the given conditions and assumptions.

This means we are looking for solutions to the equation a + b + c = 5, where a, b, and c are the digits of the integer. Since it's a three-digit number, a cannot be 0, so a geq 1. To simplify the problem, we introduce a new variable d = a - 1. This transformation is done because a must be at least 1, so by subtracting 1, we can include 0 in our range for d, making d a nonnegative integer. This also adjusts our equation to d + b + c = 4, since d = a - 1. Now, the problem of finding the number of solutions to d + b + c = 4 with d, b, c being nonnegative integers is equivalent to a problem in combinatorics. Specifically, it can be visualized as finding the number of ways to place two dividers among four indistinguishable dots (representing the sum of 4) in a line. The dots to the left of the first divider represent d, those between the dividers represent b, and those to the right of the second divider represent c. The total number of positions is 6 (four for the dots and two for the dividers), and we need to choose 2 positions out of these 6 for the dividers.

Rearranging gives: [ |A| cdot |B| - |A cap B| cdot (|A| + |B| - |A cap B|) geq 0 ] which can be rearranged to: [ frac{1}{|A cup B|} geq frac{|A cap B|}{|A| cdot |B|} ] 5.

Each mathrm{I}_{i} can be uniquely represented as a union of several such subintervals from left{ X_{1}, X_{2}, ldots, X_{n} right}. 7. Therefore, we then have: [ sum_{t=1}^{n} sum_{X_{t} subseteq mathrm{I}_{i}} frac{|X_{t}|}{|mathrm{I}_{i}|} ] Summing over all i gives: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} sum_{X_{t} subseteq I_{i}} frac{|X_{t}|}{|mathrm{I}_{i}|} ] Since each |mathrm{I}_i| = sum_{X_t subseteq mathrm{I}_i} |X_t|, it follows that: [ sum_{t=1}^{n} sum_{i=1}^{k} frac{|X_{t}|}{|mathrm{I}_{i}|} = k ] 8.

Order 3: 52 small bags and 42 large bags If he currently has 18 small bags and 10 large bags already made, and he can only make one batch at a time, how long will it be before he can fulfill all of the customer orders, given that Wallace can only produce jerky for a maximum of 18 hours per day?","completion":"First, let's calculate how many more bags of each size Wallace needs to produce to fulfill all the orders. For small bags: Total small bags ordered = 45 + 60 + 52 = 157 bags Wallace already has 18 small bags, so he needs to produce 157 - 18 = 139 more small bags. For large bags: Total large bags ordered = 30 + 25 + 42 = 97 bags Wallace already has 10 large bags, so he needs to produce 97 - 10 = 87 more large bags. Now, let's calculate how many batches of each size he needs to make. For small bags: Each small batch produces 12 bags, so Wallace needs to make 139 / 12 = 11.58 batches. Since he can't make a fraction of a batch, he needs to make 12 batches of small bags. For large bags: Each large batch produces 8 bags, so Wallace needs to make 87 / 8 = 10.875 batches. Since he can't make a fraction of a batch, he needs to make 11 batches of large bags. Now, let's calculate the time needed to produce these batches. For small bags: Each small batch takes 8 hours to make, so 12 batches will take 12 * 8 = 96 hours. For large bags: Each large batch takes 12 hours to make, so 11 batches will take 11 * 12 = 132 hours. Total time needed to produce all batches = 96 hours (small bags) + 132 hours (large bags) = 228 hours. Since Wallace can only produce jerky for a maximum of 18 hours per day, we need to divide the total time needed by the daily production limit. 228 hours / 18 hours per day = 12.67 days.

Similarly, the minimum sum is obtained by taking ( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_{n-i+1} ). 1. **Monotonicity and Reordering Insight**: - Let's first use the property of monotonicity in the sequences. - Assume ( x geq y ) and ( z geq w ). We want to show that ( xz + yw geq xw + yz ). [ xz + yw - (xw + yz) = xz + yw - xw - yz = (x-y)(z-w) geq 0 ] - Since ( x geq y ) and ( z geq w ), the product ( (x-y)(z-w) geq 0 ) holds true. Hence, ( xz + yw geq xw + yz ). 2. **Applying to the Given Sum**: - Consider the sum ( S = sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_{k_i} ) where ( (k_1, k_2, ldots, k_n) ) is some permutation of {1, 2, ..., n}. - We aim to show that rearranging this into a more optimal form does not decrease the sum ( S ). 3. **Step-by-Step Reordering**: - Start by examining the term containing ( b_1 ), which is the largest element in the ( b )-sequence. - Suppose this term is ( a_j b_1 ) and ( j > 1 ). Swap ( a_j b_1 ) with ( a_{j-1} b_{k_{j-1}} ). - Consider ( a_{j-1} b_{k_{j-1}} + a_j b_1 ) and swap with ( a_{j-1} b_1 + a_j b_{k_{j-1}} ). By our earlier argument: [ a_{j-1} b_1 + a_j b_{k_{j-1}} geq a_{j-1} b_{k_{j-1}} + a_j b_1 ] - Continue this process, moving ( b_1 ) to be paired with the largest ( a )-term, and, repeatedly, moving the largest remaining ( b )-term to its appropriate place to make pairs as ( (a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ldots, (a_n, b_n) ). 4. **Concluding Argument for Maximum**: - By repeated application of the above process, eventually the sequence will get rearranged to ( a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + ldots + a_n b_n ). - This rearrangement doesn't decrease the sum. Hence, it yields the maximum total sum. 5. **Analogous Process for Minimum Sum**: - Similarly, for the minimum sum, perform the inverse: - Pair the largest ( a )-term with the smallest ( b )-term, the second largest ( a )-term with the second smallest ( b )-term, and so on. - This results in the sequence ( a_1 b_n + a_2 b_{n-1} + ldots + a_n b_1 ). - Therefore, the smallest sum is ( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_{n-i+1} ). Conclusion: - The maximum sum is ( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i ). - The minimum sum is ( sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_{n-i+1} ). The result is: (boxed{a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + ldots + a_n b_n}) is the maximum sum, and (boxed{a_1 b_n + a_2 b_{n-1} + ldots + a_n b_1}) is the minimum sum."},{"prompt":"Each juggler is juggling some balls at a time.

Denote the circumcenters of triangles ABP, BCP, CDP, and DAP as O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}, and O_{4}, respectively. 3. First, we observe that O_1O_4 and O_2O_3 are perpendicular to AC because they are the lines joining the circumcenters of triangles sharing the side AC. Consequently, [ O_1O_4 parallel O_2O_3. ] 4. Similarly, O_1O_2 and O_3O_4 are perpendicular to BD, and thus, [ O_1O_2 parallel O_3O_4. ] 5. Since O_1O_4 parallel O_2O_3 and O_1O_2 parallel O_3O_4, we conclude that O_1O_2O_3O_4 forms a parallelogram. 6. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, the diagonals O_1O_3 and O_2O_4 intersect at their midpoint, say G. 7. Now, consider triangle ABP. The line OO_1 is perpendicular to AB, and O_1O_4 is perpendicular to AC. We deduce that [ angle OOO_1 = angle CAB = alpha. ] 8. Similarly, for triangle DCP, since OO_3 is perpendicular to CD, and O_2O_3 is perpendicular to AC, we get [ angle PO_3O_2 = frac{1}{2} angle POC = angle BDC = beta. ] 9. Utilizing the angles: [ angle PO_3O_2 = alpha quad text{and} quad angle OO_1O_4 = alpha, ] as well as using the congruence triangle OO_1O_4 cong triangle PO_2O_3, we can affirm that: [ angle OO_1O_3 = angle OO_4O_1 - angle OO_1O_4 = angle O_1O_3O_2 - angle PO_3O_2 = angle O_1O_3P, ] and hence OO_1 parallel PO_3. 10. Since OO_1 = PO_3, OO_1PO_3 is a parallelogram, meaning that O_1O_3 intersects OP at the midpoint G. Conclusion: Therefore, OP, O_1O_3, and O_2O_4 all intersect at the same point G.

Suppose we have selected a subset of these sticks with lengths (2^a, 2^b, ldots, 2^y, 2^z) such that (a < b < ldots < z). 3. According to the problem, let's assume the lengths of the sticks follow the pattern (1, 2, 4, 8, ldots, 2^{99}). 4. In general, for a polygon to be formed, the length of any side must be less than the sum of the lengths of all the other sides combined, as stated by the well-known polygon inequality theorem. 5. Consider the sum of the lengths of all selected sticks except the longest one. If we denote the lengths of these sticks as (2^a, 2^b, ..., 2^y) and the length of the longest stick as (2^z): [ text{Sum of selected sticks except the longest} = 2^a + 2^b + ldots + 2^y ] 6. Based on the pattern of the lengths, we know that (1 + 2 + 4 + ldots + 2^{n-1} = 2^n - 1).

Consider the longest length (2^z): If the inequality condition holds for forming a polygon, then: [ 2^a + 2^b + ldots + 2^y > 2^z ] Substituting the values obtained: [ 2^{y+1} - 1 > 2^z ] Since (a < b < ldots < y < z), it must hold that (z geq y+1).

Find the locus of the midpoints of the segments connecting the feet of the altitudes drawn from vertices (A) and (B).","completion":": We are given a fixed circumcircle around an acute triangle (ABC) with orthocenter (H) moving on a circle centered at (C). We need to find the locus of the midpoints of segments joining the feet of the altitudes from vertices (A) and (B). Let's denote: - (A A_1) and (B B_1) as the altitudes from (A) and (B) respectively. - (A_2) and (B_2) as the points of intersection of the extensions of these altitudes with the circumcircle. - (K) as the midpoint of (A_1 B_1). - (P) as the midpoint of (A_2 B_2). - (Q) as the midpoint of (C P). To solve the problem, we follow these steps: 1. **Symmetric Property:** - The points (C, A_2,) and (B_2) lie on the circumcircle. Due to symmetry, (CA_2 = CH = CB_2). Hence, points (A_2) and (B_2) are fixed positions on the circle. 2. **Midpoint Calculation:** - Since (A_2) and (B_2) are fixed, the midpoint (P) of (A_2 B_2) is also fixed. - Further, since (P) is fixed, the midpoint (Q) of (C P) is also fixed. 3. **Midpoints and Parallelogram Property:** - The quadrilateral (B_1 P A_1 H) forms a parallelogram. Thus, (K) is the midpoint of (PH). Hence, (QK = 0.5 cdot CH), indicating that point (K) moves along a circle centered at (Q) with radius (frac{1}{2}CH). 4. **Locus and Movement:** - Since (H) lies on a circle centered at (C), and given all such points (H) lie on one side of the chord (A_2B_2), the point (K) has to remain in that same half-plane relative to (A_2B_2). 5. **Ensuring All Points and Verification:** - For any point (H), the midpoint (K) is determined as the midpoint (PH). We uniquely determine (H) from (K) and consequently (A_1) and (B_1) as both are determined from midpoint properties with (H, A_2), and (B_2). 6. **Conclusion:** - Given this structure, we observe that all such midpoints (K) form part of a circular arc with a radius provided above, confined by (A_2) and (B_2). Thus, the required locus is indeed an arc of a circle with center (Q) and radius (frac{1}{R}), constrained within the boundary defined by (A_2) and (B_2).

Also, ( a > 0 ) and ( b geq 0 ). 2. **Divisibility Condition:** We need to show that ( m^2 - n^2 + 1 ) divides ( n^2 - 1 ). Using the parameterization, we have: [ m^2 - n^2 + 1 = (m+n)(m-n) + 1 = 4ab + 1 ] and [ n^2 - 1 = (n-1)(n+1) ] We need to show that ( 4ab + 1 mid (n-1)(n+1) ). 3. **Rewriting the Divisibility Condition:** Using the parameterization, we rewrite the condition as: [ 4ab + 1 mid (a-b)^2 - 1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ (a-b)^2 - 1 = (a-b-1)(a-b+1) ] Since ( 4ab + 1 mid (a-b-1)(a-b+1) ), we need to show that ( 4ab + 1 ) is a perfect square. 4. **Defining the Set ( S ):** Define the set: [ S = left{ k : k = frac{a^2 + b^2}{4ab + 1} quad text{for some} quad a, b in mathbb{Z}_{geq 0} right} ] We need to show that ( k ) is a perfect square. 5. **Minimality Argument:** Take any ( k_0 in S ), and let ( (a_0, b_0) in mathbb{Z}_{geq 0} times mathbb{Z}_{geq 0} ) be a pair realizing ( k_0 ) with the smallest ( a_0 + b_0 ) sum.

From Vieta's relations: [ a_0 + overline{a} = b_0(4k_0 - 2) quad text{and} quad a_0 overline{a} = b_0^2 - k_0 ] 7. **Analyzing the Roots:** Since ( overline{a} ) is integral, the pair ( (overline{a}, b_0) ) also realizes ( k_0 ). If ( overline{a} = 0 ), then ( k_0 = b_0^2 ), which is a perfect square. Assume ( overline{a} neq 0 ). 8. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1: ( overline{a} < 0 ):** [ a_0 |overline{a}| = k_0 - b_0^2 > 0 ] Since ( a_0 > b_0(4k_0 - 2) ), and ( a_0 mid k_0 - b_0^2 ), we get: [ b_0(4k_0 - 2) leq k_0 - b_0^2 ] This leads to: [ 4k_0b_0 + b_0^2 - 2b_0 leq k_0 ] If ( b_0 = 0 ), we have the condition. If ( b_0 = 1 ), we get ( 4k_0 - 1 leq k_0 ), forcing ( k_0 = 0 ). For ( b_0 geq 2 ), we get a contradiction. - **Case 2: ( overline{a} > 0 ):** Since ( (a_0, b_0) ) realizes ( k_0 ) with the smallest ( a_0 + b_0 ), we have ( overline{a} geq a_0 ). Thus: [ b_0^2 - k_0 = a_0 overline{a} geq a_0^2 ] Since ( a_0 > b_0 ), this is impossible. 9. **Conclusion:** Since ( k_0 ) was arbitrary, the proof is finished.

The rest must be liars. 3. **Analyzing the Statements of the Fourth and Fifth Inhabitants:** - The fourth says all the previous ones are liars, implying there are no knights among the first three. If the fourth is telling the truth (making the fourth a knight), this contradicts our earlier finding that one of the first three could be a knight. - Therefore, the fourth must be lying. This makes the fourth a liar. - The fifth calls the fourth a liar. Since the fourth is indeed a liar (confirmed in the previous step), the fifth must be telling the truth. 4. **Conclusion About the Number and Identities of Knights and Liars:** - Since the fifth is telling the truth, the fifth is a knight. - Considering earlier findings, out of the first three, one can be a knight and two must be liars. - The statement includes another that says there are two knights overall; hence, the second individual's claim of \\"two knights\\" must be true. - Therefore, the second and the fifth are knights. 5. **Verifying the Solution:** - If the second is a knight, their statement about there being two knights is true. - If the first is a liar, claiming there is one knight, this is false. - If the third is a liar, claiming there are three knights, this is false. - The fourth is a liar, as proven earlier. - The fifth is a knight, as verified. # Conclusion: Since the conditions are satisfied without contradictions, the number of knights on the island is indeed (boxed{2})."},{"prompt":"Let mathbf{a} and mathbf{b} be vectors, and let mathbf{m} be the midpoint of 2mathbf{a} and mathbf{b}.
