Is it always possible to obtain the position in which all five numbers are zeroes, given that in the initial position the sum of all five numbers is equal to zero?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Assumptions:** We start with a regular pentagon where each vertex is assigned a real number. Let's denote these numbers as ( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 ). The sum of these numbers is given to be zero: [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 0 ] 2. **Operation Description:** The operation allowed is to choose two adjacent vertices and replace each of the two numbers with their arithmetic mean. For example, if we choose vertices with numbers ( x_i ) and ( x_{i+1} ), we replace them with: [ x_i' = x_{i+1}' = frac{x_i + x_{i+1}}{2} ] 3. **Invariant Property:** Notice that the sum of the numbers remains invariant under this operation. If we replace ( x_i ) and ( x_{i+1} ) with their arithmetic mean, the new sum is: [ x_1 + ldots + x_{i-1} + frac{x_i + x_{i+1}}{2} + frac{x_i + x_{i+1}}{2} + x_{i+2} + ldots + x_5 = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 ] This confirms that the sum remains zero after each operation. 4. **Considering Specific Example:** Let's consider the specific example given in the problem: ( sqrt{2}, sqrt{3}, sqrt{5}, sqrt{7}, -(sqrt{2} + sqrt{3} + sqrt{5} + sqrt{7}) ). The sum of these numbers is zero: [ sqrt{2} + sqrt{3} + sqrt{5} + sqrt{7} - (sqrt{2} + sqrt{3} + sqrt{5} + sqrt{7}) = 0 ] 5. **Expression After ( n ) Steps:** Suppose after ( n ) steps, each vertex has the number zero.

For some sufficiently large ( k ), ( 2^k a_i ) is an integer for every ( i ). Let ( c_i = 2^k (a_i - a_5) ) for ( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 ). Then: [ 0 = c_1 sqrt{2} + c_2 sqrt{3} + c_3 sqrt{5} + c_4 sqrt{7} ] Since ( c_i ) are integers, the only solution is ( c_i = 0 ) for all ( i ). This implies ( a_i = a_5 ) for all ( i ). 7. **Sum of Coefficients:** Since ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 1 ) and ( a_i = a_5 ) for all ( i ), we have: [ 5a_5 = 1 implies a_5 = frac{1}{5} ] This is a contradiction because ( a_5 ) was assumed to be of the form ( frac{1}{2^{b_5}} ), which cannot be ( frac{1}{5} ). 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, it is not possible to obtain the position in which all five numbers are zeroes.

The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers. Let's find the LCM of 32, 36, and 54: - The prime factorization of 32 is 2^5. - The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2. - The prime factorization of 54 is 2 * 3^3. To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorization of any of the numbers: - For the prime number 2, the highest power is 2^5 (from 32). - For the prime number 3, the highest power is 3^3 (from 54). So, the LCM of 32, 36, and 54 is 2^5 * 3^3 = 32 * 27 = 864. Now, we know that the least number increased by 8 should be 864. Therefore, the least number itself is 864 - 8 = 856.

Let ( A A_{1}, B B_{1}, C C_{1} ) be the altitudes of triangle ( ABC ) and ( H ) be its orthocenter. 2. Consider any good point ( P ); let ( A A_{p}, B B_{p}, C C_{p} ) be cevians passing through ( P ). Since ( P ) is a good point, we have the following proportionality condition for the cevians: [ A A_{p} : A A_{1} = B B_{p} : B B_{1} = C C_{p} : C C_{1} ] This implies that the right triangles ( A A_{1} A_{p}, B B_{1} B_{p}, ) and ( C C_{1} C_{p} ) are similar, therefore: [ angle A_{1} A A_{p} = angle B_{1} B B_{p} = angle C_{1} C C_{p} ] Case 1: 3. Suppose the angles mentioned above are equal with the same orientation: [ angle (A_{1} A, A A_{p}) = angle (B_{1} B, B B_{p}) = angle (C_{1} C, C C_{p}) ] To prove that ( P = H ), observe that: 1. Since the angles are equal, it suggests ( P, H, A, ) and ( B ) lie on the same circumcircle. 2. Similarly, ( P ) must lie on the circumcircles of ( triangle ACH ) and ( triangle BCH ). Since three distinct points, like ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ), define these circles uniquely and intersect uniquely at ( H ), ( P ) must coincide with ( H ). Case 2: 4. Consider the condition where two out of these three oriented angles are equal, and the third one, say ( angle (C_{1} C, C C_{p}) ), is opposite in orientation: [ angle (A_{1} A, A A_{p}) = angle (B_{1} B, B B_{p}) = -angle (C_{1} C, C C_{p}) ] Following a similar line of reasoning, this configuration still implies that ( P ) lies on the symmetrically described circles as above. Let’s derive the result formally: 1. Since ( P ) must lie on the circumcircle described for ( triangle ABH ), which is symmetric around line ( AB ): [ angle P X X C = angle P B B H = -angle P C C X ] If these angles are non-zero, ( triangle PCX ) is isosceles with ( P C = PX ). Consequently, point ( P ) must be on the perpendicular bisector of ( C X ), creating a contradiction unless ( P ) is indeed ( H ). 5. Hence, ( P ) cannot be distinct from ( H ). # Conclusion: This logical dissection implies that the orthocenter ( H ) of an acute triangle ( ABC ) is the only good point (intersection of altitude cevians satisfying the proportionality condition). Furthermore, this configuration holds strictly for acute triangles since, in obtuse triangles, this proportionality would fail for reasons shown above.

So we convert the fractions: (21/30)x - (10/30)x = 110 Now, subtract the fractions: (21/30)x - (10/30)x = (11/30)x So we have: (11/30)x = 110 To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (11/30): x = 110 * (30/11) x = 10 * 30 x = 300 Therefore, the value of x is boxed{300} ."},{"prompt":"The Lion King cost 10 million to make and earned 200 million at the box office.

Thus, it must hold that (A+C)+(B+D)=(A+D)+(B+C) (each parenthesis represents the combined weight of two athletes). Notice that among the five weights, only 99+144=113+130 satisfies this condition. Therefore, the remaining 125 must be the combined weight of C and D, i.e., C+D=125. Hence, A+B=99+144-125=118. From this, we know that A and B are of the same parity, and C and D must be of different parities. Thus, among the weights of the four athletes, there must be three with the same parity. Assuming A, B, and C have the same parity, then the values of A+C and B+C are also even, which means: A+C=144, B+C=130 or A+C=130, B+C=144 From the former, we find: A=66, B=52, C=78 From the latter, we find: A=52, B=66, C=78 Therefore, the weight of the heavier one among the two athletes who did not weigh together is boxed{66 text{ kg}}."},{"prompt":"When 6 is added to half of onethird of a certain fraction of a number, the result is onefifteenth of the number.

If two subsets ( A ) and ( B ) have a non-empty intersection ( C ), we can construct two new subsets ( A' ) and ( B' ) by removing the common elements found in ( C ) from each subset: [ A' = A setminus C quad text{and} quad B' = B setminus C ] Both ( A' ) and ( B' ) are still subsets, they are disjoint, and their sums are diminished by the sum of elements in ( C ): [ text{Sum}(A') = text{Sum}(A) - text{Sum}(C) ] [ text{Sum}(B') = text{Sum}(B) - text{Sum}(C) ] Since (text{Sum}(A') = text{Sum}(B')), these disjoint subsets ( A' ) and ( B' ) have the same sum. # Conclusion: We have demonstrated that among any 10 chosen integers from 10 to 99, it is always possible to find two disjoint subsets with the same sum by utilizing the Pigeonhole Principle and a procedure for ensuring disjoint subsets.

Therefore, while it resembles a quadratic equation, without the guarantee that a neq 0, we cannot conclusively say it meets the criteria for being a quadratic equation in one variable. - **Option B: x^{2}=1** This equation clearly involves only one variable, x, and the highest power of x is 2. There are no other variables involved, and it fits the standard form of a quadratic equation, which is ax^2 + bx + c = 0, with a=1, b=0, and c=-1. Therefore, it is a quadratic equation in one variable. - **Option C: x^2+2x=frac{2}{x}** To analyze this, we can multiply both sides by x (assuming x neq 0) to avoid the fraction: [x(x^2 + 2x) = 2] [x^3 + 2x^2 = 2] This results in a cubic equation, not a quadratic one, because the highest power of x is 3.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 40 lbs of salt at ( x ) cents/lb: Cost of 40 lbs of salt = ( 40 ) lbs (*) ( x ) cents/lb = ( 40x ) cents. Now, we add the cost of both types of salt to get the total cost: Total cost = ( 400 ) cents + ( 40x ) cents. The total weight of the mixture is ( 5 ) lbs + ( 40 ) lbs = ( 45 ) lbs. The merchant wants to make a 20% profit on the mixture when selling it at 48 cents/lb. To find the selling price for the entire mixture, we multiply the selling price per pound by the total weight: Selling price for the mixture = ( 45 ) lbs (*) ( 48 ) cents/lb = ( 2160 ) cents or ( 21.60 ). The selling price with a 20% profit means the total cost is 80% of the selling price (because cost + 20% profit = 100% of the selling price). So we can write: Total cost = 80% of Selling price. Converting 80% to a decimal gives us 0.8, so: Total cost = ( 0.8 ) (*) ( 2160 ) cents.

How can you discover the fake coin by making 2 weighing in a twocourse balance?**b)** Find the least necessary number of weighing that must be done to cover a false currency between 27 coins if all the others are true.","completion":"# Part (a) To find the fake coin among 9 coins using only 2 weighings, we can use the following strategy: 1. **First Weighing:** - Divide the 9 coins into three groups of 3 coins each: (A, B, C). - Weigh group (A) against group (B). 2. **Second Weighing:** - If (A) and (B) are equal, the fake coin is in group (C). Weigh two coins from group (C) against each other. - If they are equal, the remaining coin in group (C) is the fake coin. - If they are not equal, the lighter one is the fake coin. - If (A) and (B) are not equal, the lighter group contains the fake coin. Weigh two coins from the lighter group against each other. - If they are equal, the remaining coin in the lighter group is the fake coin. - If they are not equal, the lighter one is the fake coin. Thus, we can find the fake coin in exactly 2 weighings. # Part (b) To find the least number of weighings required to identify a fake coin among 27 coins, we can use the following reasoning: 1. **General Strategy:** - Let (S) be a set of (N) coins. We claim that the smallest number of weighings needed to find the fake coin in (S) is (lceil log_3 N rceil). - Consider the case when (|S| = 3^n), where (n in mathbb{N}). We can split (S) into three sets (S_1, S_2, S_3), where each has (3^{n-1}) coins. - Compare the weights of (S_1) and (S_2): - If (S_1) and (S_2) are equal, then (S_3) has the counterfeit coin. - Otherwise, one of (S_1) or (S_2) has the counterfeit coin. - This narrows down the search to one set with (3^{n-1}) coins. Repeat this procedure until we are left with (3^0 = 1) coin, which will be the counterfeit coin. - Thus, a total of (n) weighings will have been conducted. 2. **Proof of Minimum Weighings:** - Suppose we have (3^{n-1} < |S| < 3^n). We can split (S) into three sets, (S_1, S_2, S_3), such that each set has at most (3^{n-1}) coins and (|S_1| = |S_2|). - Compare the weights of (S_1) and (S_2) to isolate one of the three sets to inspect further as done previously. - Repeat this process until we have one coin left, resulting in a total of (n) weighings. - Therefore, for a set of (3^{n-1} < |S| leq 3^n) coins, we can find the fake coin in (n) steps. Thus, we can find the fake coin in (lceil log_3 |S| rceil = lceil log_3 N rceil) weighings. # Conclusion For 27 coins, the number of weighings required is: [ lceil log_3 27 rceil = lceil 3 rceil = 3 ] The final answer is ( boxed{ 3 } ) weighings."},{"prompt":"Let ( x ) and ( y ) be acute angles such that ( sin y = 2005 cos (x + y) sin x ).

Is the same true for the first digit?","completion":"1. **Assumption of Periodicity**: First, assume that there exists a period (d) for the sequence of the first digits of the powers of 2. This means that the sequence (2^{1}, 2^{1+d}, 2^{1+2d}, ldots, 2^{1+nd}, ldots) would start with the same digit for each power. - Since (2^1 = 2), all numbers in the sequence would start with the digit 2. 2. **Division Analysis**: If a number starts with the digit 2, halving it will start with the digit 1. Then the numbers (2^d, 2^{2d}, ldots, 2^{nd}, ldots) must start with 1. - For every ( n ge 1 ), there exists a sequence (a_n) of positive integers such that: [ 10^{a_n} < 2^{nd} < 2 cdot 10^{a_n} ] 3. **Analysis of the Digit Count**: Since (2 cdot 10^{a_n} < 10^{1 + a_n}), the number of digits in (2^{nd}) is (1 + a_n). - Clearly, inequality (1) does not permit equality. 4. **Recursive Property**: We assert that if the inequality (1) holds, the number of digits in the sequence (2^{nd}) increases by (a_1). - For ( n = 1 ): [ 10^{a_1} < 2^d < 2 cdot 10^{a_1} ] - Multiplying by the inequality (1): [ 10^{a_{n} + a_1} < 2^{(n+1)d} < 4 cdot 10^{a_{n} + a_1} < 10^{1 + a_{n} + a_1} ] Thus, the number of digits in ( 2^{(n+1)d} ) is (1 + a_{n+1} = 1 + a_n + a_1). From which, [ a_{n+1} = a_n + a_1 implies a_n = n cdot a_1 ] 5. **Contradiction Demonstration**: If the stated assumption is correct, then (a_n = n cdot a_1) implies that the number of digits in the sequence of powers of 2 increases linearly with (a_1). - Rewrite inequality (1): [ 1 < frac{2^{nd}}{10^{a_n}} < 2 ] For ( n = 1 ): [ 1 < frac{2^d}{10^{a_1}} < 2 ] - Given this implies: [ frac{2^{nd}}{10^{a_n}} = left( frac{2^d}{10^{a_1}} right)^n ] This shows ( left( frac{2^d}{10^{a_1}} right) ) is bounded between 1 and 2 for all n, which is impossible since the power of a number greater than 1 cannot be upper bound as it grows indefinitely. 6. **Conclusion from Contradiction**: The assumption leads to a contradiction, indicating that the sequence (a_n) does not exist, and thus, the first digits of the powers of 2 are not periodic. # Second Method Analysis 1. **Further Assumption**: Assume there exists a (k_0) such that for all ( k ge k_0 ), the sequence of first digits of (2^{k}) is periodic with period (d). Hence, the sequence of numbers (2^{k_0 + nd} ) must all start with some digit ( t ). 2. **Analysis with Logarithms**: Write any number (N) in scientific notation: - ( N = 10^{lg N} = 10^{[lg N] + {lg N}} = 10^{[lg N]} cdot 10^{{lg N}} ) - The first digit of (N) is determined by (10^{{lg N}}). 3. **Periodic Property**: Given ( lg 2^{k_0 + nd} = (k_0 + nd) cdot lg 2 ), - We have: [ left[10^{{(k_0 + nd) cdot lg 2}}right] = t implies t le 10^{{(k_0 + nd) cdot lg 2}} < 1 + t ] - This implies: [ lg t le {(k_0 + nd) cdot lg 2} < lg (1 + t) ] 4. **Contradiction**: The fractional parts of the sequence ((k_0 + nd) cdot lg 2) must all lie in the interval ([ lg t, lg (1 + t) )). - Since (lg 2) is irrational, the fractional parts of the sequence ({(k_0 + nd) cdot lg 2}) are dense in ([0, 1)) and thus cannot be confined to a finite interval, leading to an impossibility. **Conclusion**: The combination of steps and contradictions proves that no period exists, and the sequence of first digits of powers of 2 is indeed non-periodic.

To demonstrate that this property holds for any prime number p where the length of the period of 1/p is ( p-1 ), let's go through the following detailed proof: 1. **Establish Path for Patterns**: We start by dividing 1 by p using long division. The resulting sequence of remainders will exhibit periodicity due to the pigeonhole principle. 2. **Understanding Remainders**: Since we are dividing by p, the remainders must be between 0 and p-1. Importantly, because we are dealing with a repeating decimal, these remainders form a complete cycle (cycle length is ( p-1 )). **Example** (Division of 1 by 7): 1 div 7 = 0.142857overline{142857} The sequence of remainders is 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5 in this case. 3. **Highlight all possible remainders are encountered**: For primes with period ( p-1 ), every possible remainder from 1 to ( p - 1 ) will occur once before repeating in the same order. This property arises because in cyclic numbers, the order of fractional results precisely repeats every ( p-1 ) values. 4. **Forming New Cyclic Numbers**: Consider the fractional part of dividing other integers k = 2, 3, dots, p-1 by p. The initial digits of ( frac{k}{p} ) are a cyclic permutation of those found in ( frac{1}{p} ). For instance: frac{1}{7} = 0.overline{142857} frac{3}{7} = 0.overline{428571} Here 3 is like ( 1 cdot3 mod 7 ). 5. **General Case**: Let ( a equiv k (text{mod} p) ) for some integer ( k ), then the decimal expansion of ( frac{a}{p} ) will be a cyclic permutation of ( frac{1}{p} ). 6. **Conclusion**: From the example, we observe that if the length of the period of ( frac{1}{p} ) is ( p-1 ), the periodic digits of ( frac{a}{p} ) for ( a = 1, 2, ..., p-1 ) align into cyclic permutations of these digits. Therefore, a prime number p with period p-1 indeed possesses the property that all fractions with denominator p and different numerators are cyclic permutations of the decimal expansion of ( frac{1}{p} ). Thus, the property is verified and it holds true.

Since Pipe B can fill the tank 4 times as fast as Pipe A, it would take ( frac{t}{4} ) minutes for Pipe B to fill the tank alone.

The rate at which a pipe fills a tank is the reciprocal of the time it takes to fill the tank. Therefore, the combined rate of both pipes is ( frac{1}{t} + frac{4}{t} = frac{5}{t} ). We know that when both pipes are open, it takes 4 minutes to fill the tank. This means that the combined rate of both pipes is ( frac{1}{4} ) of the tank per minute.

Thus, the lemma holds for ( l = 1 ). - **Inductive Step**: Assume the lemma holds for ( l-1 ). That is, there exist ( l-1 ) distinct positive integers ( d_1', dots, d_{l-1}' ) such that the only solution to [ sum_{i=1}^{l-1} x_i d_i' = 0 ] in ( (mathbb{Z} cap (-infty, 1])^{l-1} ) is ( (0, 0, dots, 0) ). Now, take ( d_i = 2d_i' ) for ( 1 leq i leq l-1 ), and choose ( d_l ) to be an odd integer larger than ( 2 sum_{i=1}^{l-1} d_i ). Consider the equation [ sum_{i=1}^{l} x_i d_i = 0. ] Since ( d_l ) is odd and larger than ( 2 sum_{i=1}^{l-1} d_i ), ( x_l ) must be even. If ( x_l ) is negative, then [ sum_{i=1}^{l} x_i d_i < 0, ] which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( x_l = 0 ). By the inductive hypothesis, ( x_i = 0 ) for ( 1 leq i leq l-1 ).

Also, take a point (P) in (S) such that (P) is not on the line ((d)). The set (S) satisfies the condition that any line formed by two points of (S) passes through a third point in (S). 3. **Distance Consideration**: We now consider that for any line ((d')) formed by points in (S) and any point (P') in (S) which is not on ((d')), the distance from (P) to ((d)) is strictly less than or equal to the distance from (P') to ((d')). 4. **Contradiction by Orthogonal Projection**: Since ((d)) has at least three points from (S), denote these points by (A), (B), and (C) such that (A) and (B) are on the same side of the orthogonal projection of (P) onto ((d)). 5. **Choice of Points (A) and (B)**: Assume (A) is closer to (P) than (B) is.

This is against our choice of (P) and projection. 7. **Conclusion**: Since we reached a contradiction by assuming that not all points in (S) are collinear, we conclude that the initial assumption is incorrect.

According to our assumption, the sum of any two differently colored numbers should result in a number of the third color. 4. **Analyzing Subsequent Numbers:** - (1 + x) must be green (since 1 is red and (x) is blue). - (x + 1) must be green (same reasoning as above, but written in different order). 5. **Consider (x + 2):** - Since (x + 1) is green and (1) is red, their sum (1 + (x + 1) = x + 2) must be blue. 6. **Alternating Pattern:** Proceeding similarly for (x + 3): - Since (x + 2) is blue and (1) is red, their sum (1 + (x + 2) = x + 3) must be green.

There is also one geometric progression (GP) among the sequences of 4 consecutive numbers. Our goal is to find all possible values for the largest of these 8 numbers. 1. **Finding the Overlapping Elements**: Let's assume there are three numbers (a), (b), and (c) which form both an arithmetic and a geometric progression: - Arithmetic progression condition: (b - a = c - b), which implies (2b = a + c). - Geometric progression condition: (frac{b}{a} = frac{c}{b}), which implies (b^2 = ac).

Drop altitudes from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base to form two right-angled triangles. These triangles are congruent since the trapezium is isosceles. The base angle is arctan(1.5), giving the vertical side of these triangles as 1.5x (opposite) and the horizontal side as x (adjacent). Since the trapezium is circumscribed around a circle, the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. This gives the equation 2y + x + x = 20. Also, from the trapezoid's geometry, the relation between x, y, and the base lengths is y + x + x = 20. Thus, simplifying gives y = 18 - 2x. The length of one segment along the base due to the angle is determined by 1.5x since tan(arctan(1.5)) = frac{text{opposite}}{text{adjacent}} = 1.5. The height of the trapezium is 1.5x.

We can write a new equation: (W + S2) / 9 = 410 We already know W is 3000, so we can substitute that in: (3000 + S2) / 9 = 410 Now, let's solve for S2, the salary of the new supervisor: 3000 + S2 = 410 * 9 3000 + S2 = 3690 S2 = 3690 - 3000 S2 = 690 So the salary of the new supervisor is boxed{690} per month."},{"prompt":"An equilateral triangle with a side length of 1 is cut along a line parallel to one of its sides, resulting in a trapezoid.

Find the minimum value of S.","completion":"Let x be the side length of the smaller equilateral triangle formed after cutting. Then, the perimeter of the trapezoid is 3 - x, and its area is frac{sqrt{3}}{4}(1 - x^2). Thus, S = frac{(3 - x)^2}{frac{sqrt{3}}{4}(1 - x^2)} for 0 < x < 1. Taking the derivative of S with respect to x, we get: S' = frac{4}{sqrt{3}} cdot frac{-2(3x - 1)(x - 3)}{(1 - x^2)^2}. Setting S' = 0, and considering the domain 0 < x < 1, we find x = frac{1}{3}. When 0 < x < frac{1}{3}, S' < 0, and when frac{1}{3} < x < 1, S' > 0. Therefore, S attains its minimum value at x = frac{1}{3}, which is frac{32sqrt{3}}{3}. Hence, the answer is boxed{frac{32sqrt{3}}{3}}. First, we denote the side length of the smaller equilateral triangle as x and express the perimeter and area of the trapezoid in terms of x. We then derive an analytical expression for S and differentiate it. By setting the derivative equal to zero, we find the value of x that minimizes S. Finally, we determine the minimum value of S using the monotonicity of the function.

It requires the application of differentiation concepts and is of moderate difficulty."},{"prompt":"Mary is chopping up some old furniture to make firewood.

While this might suggest a parallelogram, it's also a characteristic of a trapezoid where only one pair of opposite sides is parallel. Therefore, this condition alone cannot guarantee that ABCD is a parallelogram. - **Option B: AB=CD, and AD=BC** In a quadrilateral, if both pairs of opposite sides are equal (AB=CD and AD=BC), then it must be a parallelogram. This is because the definition of a parallelogram includes the property that opposite sides are equal. This condition satisfies the criteria for a parallelogram without implying any other specific type of quadrilateral. - **Option C: angle A=angle B, and angle C=angle D** Having equal opposite angles (angle A=angle B and angle C=angle D) could suggest that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. However, this condition is also true for rectangles and trapezoids, where opposite angles are equal. Therefore, this condition does not exclusively determine that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. - **Option D: AB=AD, and CB=CD** This condition suggests that two pairs of adjacent sides are equal.

Consider a square that is divided into two equal areas by a curve Gamma. We need to prove that we can choose two points A and B on Gamma such that the line segment AB passes through the center O of the square. 2. Start by analyzing the obvious case where the center O lies on the curve Gamma. If O is on Gamma, then we can trivially take A = O and any other point B on the curve such that AB will naturally pass through the center O. 3. Assume O does not belong to Gamma. Now, let's consider the symmetric image Gamma' of the curve Gamma with respect to the center O. Reflection symmetry across O means that every point X on Gamma has a corresponding point X' on Gamma' such that O is the midpoint of XX'. 4. We claim that the curves Gamma and Gamma' must intersect. Suppose, for contradiction, that Gamma and Gamma' do not intersect. In this case, Gamma would split the square into two unequal areas, which cannot happen since Gamma was given to divide the square into two equal areas initially. 5. Therefore, Gamma and Gamma' must intersect at at least one point. Let X be such an intersection point. By the construction of Gamma', the symmetric point X' of X with respect to O must also lie on Gamma', and hence on Gamma due to the symmetry. 6. Consequently, the line segment XX', where X and X' are symmetric points with respect to the center O, must pass through O.

The length of the train is 70 m. How long does it take for the train to cross the second platform?","completion":"To find out how long it takes for the train to cross the second platform, we first need to determine the speed of the train. When the train crosses the first platform, which is 170 m long, it actually covers a distance equal to the length of the train plus the length of the platform. So the total distance covered by the train when crossing the first platform is: Length of the train + Length of the first platform = 70 m + 170 m = 240 m We are given that the train crosses this distance in 15 seconds. Therefore, the speed of the train (v) can be calculated using the formula: Speed (v) = Distance / Time So, v = 240 m / 15 s = 16 m/s Now that we know the speed of the train, we can calculate the time it takes to cross the second platform, which is 250 m long. Again, the total distance the train will cover is the length of the train plus the length of the second platform: Length of the train + Length of the second platform = 70 m + 250 m = 320 m Using the speed we calculated earlier, we can find the time (t) it takes to cross the second platform: t = Distance / Speed t = 320 m / 16 m/s = 20 s Therefore, it takes the train boxed{20} seconds to cross the second platform."},{"prompt":"Tom goes to a combined undergrad and Ph.D. program.

Tom finishes both in 6 years, which is 3/4ths the normal time. Therefore, the normal time to finish both would be 6 years / (3/4), which simplifies to 6 * (4/3) = 8 years. So, the normal time to finish both the BS and Ph.D. is 8 years. Since we know the BS takes 3 years, we can find the normal time to finish the Ph.D. by subtracting the BS time from the total time: P = 8 years - 3 years P = 5 years Therefore, it normally takes boxed{5} years to finish the Ph.D. program."},{"prompt":"Let the walking speed of the hiker on the first day be x miles per hour, and let the number of hours she walked on the first day be y hours.

For the sequence to be monotonically decreasing, this difference must be less than 0 for all n. Therefore, we need the maximum value of -2n - 1 + t to be less than 0. Since the term -2n becomes more negative as n increases, the maximum happens at the smallest value of n, which is n = 1. Thus, we have: -2 cdot 1 - 1 + t < 0, which simplifies to: -3 + t < 0.

The (3k) points divide the circle into (3k) arcs, with (k) arcs of length 1 sector, (k) arcs of length 2 sectors, and (k) arcs of length 3 sectors. 2. **Assume the contrary:** Suppose that no two of the marked points are the ends of a diameter.

We will analyze the sequences starting from the next tile going either clockwise or counterclockwise. 4. **Opposite point analysis:** The point diametrically opposite to the center of the 1-sector arc must be the center of a 3-sector arc. If this were not the case, we could create a sequence of the desired length by \\"shifting over\\" one sector if necessary. 5. **Partition the circle:** Partition the circle into two sets of (3k-2) consecutive sectors by \\"cutting\\" along the 1-sector arc and its opposing 3-sector arc. Consider one of these sets. 6. **Count the number of 1-sector and 3-sector arcs:** The number of 1-sector arcs added to the number of 3-sector arcs in that set must necessarily be (k-1) since every 1-sector arc can be paired with exactly one diametrically opposite 3-sector arc. 7. **Modulo analysis:** Since (3 equiv 1 pmod{2}) and (3k-2-(k-1) = 2k-1 equiv 1 pmod{2}), there are an odd number of spaces in the set to cover with (some of) the remaining 2-sector arcs, which is clearly impossible. 8. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be the case that some two of the marked points are the ends of one diameter.

However, it's possible for a curve to have a vertical tangent line at a point where the derivative does not exist. In such cases, the equation of the tangent line would be of the form x=x_{0}. Therefore, statement A is correct. **Statement B**: If the curve y=fleft(xright) has a tangent line at the point (x_{0}, f(x_{0})), then {f'}(x_{0}) must exist. - This statement implies that the existence of a tangent line guarantees the existence of the derivative at that point. However, as discussed in statement A, there can be a vertical tangent line where the derivative does not exist. Therefore, statement B is not necessarily correct. **Statement C**: If {f'}(x_{0}) does not exist, then the slope of the tangent line of the curve y=fleft(xright) at the point (x_{0}, f(x_{0})) does not exist. - This statement aligns with the explanation that if the derivative at a point does not exist, it could be due to a vertical tangent line at that point, where the concept of \\"slope\\" does not apply in the traditional sense (since slope would be undefined). Therefore, statement C is correct in the context that the traditional slope (as a finite number) does not exist. **Statement D**: If the curve y=fleft(xright) does not have a tangent line at the point (x_{0}, f(x_{0})), then {f'}(x_{0}) may still exist. - This statement is not directly addressed in the solution, but it's worth noting that if a curve does not have a tangent line at a point, it generally means that the behavior of the function at that point does not allow for a well-defined tangent. This could happen in cases of cusps or discontinuities, where the derivative might not exist. However, the statement's inverse nature doesn't directly correlate with the provided explanation. Based on the provided solution and analysis: - **Statement A is correct**: It acknowledges the possibility of a tangent line (e.g., vertical) even when the derivative does not exist. - **Statement C is correct**: It correctly identifies that when the derivative does not exist, the traditional slope of the tangent line is not defined.

We need to find the probability that after 10 flips, heads and tails have both turned up exactly 5 times. 2. **Setting Up the Problem:** We need to calculate the probability that after 10 flips, we have exactly 5 heads and 5 tails. This can be expressed as: [ P(text{5 heads, 5 tails in 10 flips}) ] 3. **Using the Given Probability Rule:** The probability of getting heads or tails at each step depends on the number of heads and tails already flipped. We need to consider the sequence of flips and the probability at each step. 4. **Calculating the Probability:** The probability of a specific sequence of 5 heads and 5 tails can be calculated using the given rule.

Each edge is colored either red or black. It is given that every triangle in the graph must have at least one red edge. We need to show that there are four vertices in the graph such that all edges connecting them are red. 2. **Considering a Subset of 6 Points**: Select any 6 vertices from the graph. Let's denote these vertices by ( {A, B, C, D, E, F} ). 3. **Analyzing Red and Black Edges**: Take any vertex, say ( A ), from this subset. According to the problem, if ( A ) is connected to three other vertices (say ( B, C, ) and ( D )) via black edges, each of the triangles formed with ( A ) and any two of these three vertices must have a red edge: [ triangle ABC, triangle ABD, triangle ACD ] To ensure each triangle has a red edge, ( BC, BD, ) and ( CD ) must be red. 4. **General Red Edge Distribution**: Given the constraint from step 3, it must be the case that each vertex in the subset of 6 vertices has at least 3 red edges connecting to other vertices in the subset. 5. **Further Analysis with Specific Cases**: Let's assign edges for vertices ( A, B, C, D, E, F ). Suppose vertex ( A ) is connected to ( B, C, D ) with red edges: [ AB, AC, AD text{ are red} ] Now, consider the vertex ( B ). Since ( B ) must have at least 5 red edges in the set of 6 vertices: - If ( BC ) is red, triangle ( ABC ) has all red edges. - If ( BD ) is red, triangle ( ABD ) is also red. Thus, we assume ( BE ) and ( BF ) are red instead. Similarly, we can assume at least one edge among ( AE, AF, text{ or } EF ) is red to avoid creating a triangle without a red edge: - If ( AE ) is red, triangle ( ABE ) forms an all red triangle. - If ( AF ) is red, triangle ( ABF ) forms an all red triangle. - If ( EF ) is red, triangle ( BEF ) forms an all red triangle. 6. **Considering All 9 Points**: Extend the consideration from subsets of 6 vertices to the entire graph. Pick any vertex, say ( X ). According to the problem, if there are 4 vertices ( {A, B, C, D} ) that are not connected to ( X ) by red edges, considering every triangle involving ( X ) and any two of these vertices must have a red edge, the edges ( AB, BC, CD, DA ) must all be red. 7. **General Conclusion**: So, at least one vertex must be connected via red edges to at least 5 other vertices. If each point had exactly 5 red edges, the total number of red edges would be: [ frac{9 times 5}{2} = 22.5 ] which is impossible because the number of edges must be an integer. Hence, there exists at least one vertex connected to 6 other vertices by red edges. Among these connections, there must be a red triangle forming ( {X, A, B, C} ). Therefore, there are at least 4 vertices such that all edges between them are red.

Step 1: Understanding the gradient inequality for f(x). Given frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} < 1 for any 0 < x_1 < x_2, we can manipulate this inequality to better understand the behavior of f(x) relative to the line y = x. Transforming the given inequality: [ frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} - 1 < 0 implies frac{f(x_2) - x_2 - (f(x_1) - x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} < 0 ] Step 2: Introducing a new function g(x) = f(x) - x. Let's define g(x) = f(x) - x. From the transformation in Step 1, we see for any 0 < x_1 < x_2, frac{g(x_2) - g(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} < 0. This indicates that g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty). Step 3: Exploiting the odd function property of f(x). Since f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. Consequently, g(-x) = f(-x) + x = -f(x) + x = -g(x). This shows that g(x) is also an odd function. Step 4: Analyzing g(x) on the entire real line. The odd nature of g(x) implies that if g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty), it must also be monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0). Knowing g(0) = 0 and using the fact that f(1) = 1 gives us g(1) = f(1) - 1 = 0 and thus g(-1) = 0 due to the odd function property. Step 5: Determining the intervals where g(x) > 0. Given the monotonic properties of g(x) and its values at specific points, we conclude that g(x) > 0 for x < -1 and 0 < x < 1. This is because g(x) is decreasing across these intervals and crosses through g(x) = 0 at x = -1 and x = 1.

Thus, the distance between points M and N is x_{2}-x_{1} = e^{x_{1}} - dfrac{1}{2}x_{1}^{2} + 1 - x_{1}. Let h(x) = e^x - dfrac{1}{2}x^2 + 1 - x with x geqslant 0. The derivative of h is h'(x) = e^x - x - 1, and the second derivative is h''(x) = e^x - 1 geqslant 0.

First, compute the lower bound for ( S ). Notice: [ S = sum_{k=1}^{m} frac{1}{x_k} sum_{k=1}^{m} x_k geq m^2, ] where ( S ) achieves its minimum when ( { x_1, x_2, cdots, x_m } = { N+1, N+2, cdots, N+m } ) for large ( N ). 4. Next, consider ( T ). Performing simplifications and recalling ( x = x_i, y = x_j ), we get: [ A(y, x) = sqrt{frac{y(y^2 + 1)}{x}} - sqrt{frac{x(x^2 + 1)}{y}} = frac{ysqrt{y^2 + 1} - xsqrt{x^2 + 1}}{sqrt{xy}} ] 5. Approximations show: [ x sqrt{x^2 + 1} approx x^2 + frac{1}{2} ] with slight deviation: [ g(x) = x^2 + frac{1}{2} - x sqrt{x^2 + 1} approx frac{1}{8x^2}. ] 6. Since ( g(x) ) is decreasing and its values diminish as ( x ) increases, we get: [ A(y,x) > frac{(y^2 - x^2)}{sqrt{xy}} + frac{g(x) - g(y)}{sqrt{xy}} > 2(y - x). ] 7. For ( x_1, x_2, dots, x_m ) in ascending order ((x_1 < x_2 < dots < x_m)), we compute: [ T = sum_{1 leq i < j leq m} left( A(x_j, x_i) right)^2 > sum_{1 leq i < j < m} 4 (x_j - x_i)^2 geq sum_{1 leq i < j < m}^{m} 4 (j-i)^2 = 2 sum_{i=1}^{m} sum_{j=1}^{m} (j - i)^2 ] 8. Simplifying: [ T = 4m sum_{i=1}^{m} i^2 - 4 (sum_{i=1}^{m} i)^2 = frac{4 m^2 (m+1)(2m+1)}{6} - m^2 (m+1)^2 = frac{m^4 - m^2}{3} ] 9. Therefore: [ T > frac{1}{3} (m^4 - m^2) ] 10. For ( { x_1, x_2, cdots, x_m } = { N+1, N+2, cdots, N+m } ) and large integer ( N ), approximating: [ A(x_j, x_i) < 2(j - i) frac{N+m}{N} + frac{1}{N^3} ] 11. Then: [ T = sum_{1 leq i < j leq m} left( A(x_j, x_i) right)^2 leq frac{m^2}{N^3} + frac{N+m}{N} sum_{1 leq i < j < m} 4(j - i)^2 approx frac{m^4 - m^2}{3} + frac{m^4 - m^2}{3} cdot frac{m}{N} + frac{m^2}{N^3} ] 12. When ( N ) is sufficiently large: [ T approx frac{1}{3}(m^4 - m^2) ] 13. Adding the terms: [ S + T > m^2 + frac{1}{3} (m^4 - m^2) = frac{1}{3} m^2 (m^2 + 2) ] 14. For ( m = 100 ): [ S + T = frac{1}{3} (100^2) (100^2 + 2) = 33340000 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{33340000} ]"},{"prompt":"Factorization: a^{2}3a=____.","completion":"To factorize the expression a^{2}-3a, we look for a common factor in both terms. 1.

This is calculated as: [ frac{30 , text{hours}}{5 , text{hours}} = 6 ] This means that 30 hours is 6 times longer than 5 hours. Since the spider's efficiency remains constant, the number of flies caught in 30 hours would be 6 times the number caught in 5 hours.

What was the distance travelled in the first one hour?","completion":"Let's denote the distance traveled in the first hour as ( x ) km. Since the speed of the car increases by 2 km/h after every hour, the distance traveled in each subsequent hour will be ( x + 2 ), ( x + 4 ), ( x + 6 ), and so on. The total distance traveled in 12 hours will be the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is ( x ) and the common difference is 2. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: [ S_n = frac{n}{2} times (2a + (n - 1)d) ] where ( S_n ) is the sum of the first ( n ) terms, ( a ) is the first term, ( n ) is the number of terms, and ( d ) is the common difference.

Firstly, let's arrange the letters d and e, which can be done in 2! ways. We then insert the three remaining letters a, b, and c into the three available spaces (before d, between d and e, and after e) in a way that they are not adjacent to one another. This can be done in 3! ways. Therefore, for this case, the number of arrangements is: 2! times 3! = 12 **Case 2**: The letters a and b are adjacent to each other but not adjacent to c. View a and b as a single entity (let's call it X), so we have four elements to arrange now: X, c, d, and e.

However, we must exclude the arrangements where X is next to c, which can happen in two places: at the start/end or in the middle. For each such position, there are 2! ways to arrange the three elements where c is fixed and 2! ways to arrange a and b within X. Thus, there are overall 2 times (3! times 2!) invalid cases.

We need to determine the maximum number of teams that can participate in the tournament. 2. **Calculating Games Between Two Teams:** When two teams play each other, every player from the first team plays against every player from the second team: [ 3 text{ players} times 3 text{ players} = 9 text{ games} ] 3. **Finding Maximum Number of Team Pairs:** Since each pair of teams plays 9 games, to find the maximum number of team pairs that can be accommodated within 150 games, we divide the total number of games by the number of games per pair: [ frac{150}{9} approx 16.67 ] This means there can be at most 16 complete pairs of teams, as (16.67) rounds down to 16. 4. **Relationship Between Number of Teams and Pairs:** If there are (n) teams, the number of unique pairs of teams is: [ binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] Setting this equal to 16, we solve for (n): [ frac{n(n-1)}{2} leq 16 ] [ n(n-1) leq 32 ] We solve for (n) by trial: - For (n = 6): [ 6 times 5 = 30 quad (text{which is } leq 32) ] - For (n = 7): [ 7 times 6 = 42 quad (text{which is } notleq 32) ] Therefore, (n = 6) is the maximum number of teams that can participate without exceeding 150 games. 5. **Verification:** For 6 teams, the number of games: [ binom{6}{2} = frac{6 times 5}{2} = 15 text{ pairs of teams} ] The number of games for each pair is 9, thus: [ 15 text{ pairs} times 9 text{ games per pair} = 135 text{ games} ] Since 135 games are less than the maximum allowed 150 games, this confirms our calculation is correct. # Conclusion: 6 teams can participate in the tournament within the maximum allowed 150 games.

Each pair of cities is connected by a direct flight operated by one or more airlines. The cost of a flight between two cities serviced by k airlines is frac{1}{k}. It is also given that there is no cheaper route between any two cities using connecting flights compared to the direct flight. We need to prove the existence of a route with one connection where both parts of the route have the same cost. 2. **Assumption**: Suppose that there do not exist two flights from a city with the same cost. Hence, all flights from any city must have different costs. 3. **Considering the Most Expensive Flight**: - Assume the most expensive flight from any city is the flight serviced by the least number of airlines. Let this number be k_1. - This means the cost for this flight, say from city A to city B, is frac{1}{k_1}. - Given that this is the most expensive, it implies there are no flights cheaper than frac{1}{2k_1}. 4. **Counting Possible Costs**: - For each city connected by this most expensive flight (i.e., A and B), other flights can also be compared. - The number of possible different costs from any one city which are less than frac{1}{k_1} but not less than frac{1}{2k_1} is k_1 - 1. - Therefore, from both cities A and B, there can be combined at most 2(k_1 - 1) flights cheaper than frac{1}{2k_1}. 5. **Insufficiency of High-Cost Flights**: - As there are 100 cities but the most expensive flight leads to conclusions with k_1 leq 48 (as there can be at most 48+48=96 cheaper alternatives, not 98 required). It's evident indicating that our initial assumption that all flights from a city carry different costs fails especially with larger cities leading to contradictions. 6. **Contradiction Leading to Conclusion**: - The contradiction shows that our initial assumption was incorrect and hence there must exist at least two flights at the same cost from one city. - Consequently, one such flight and a connected one of the same cost yield the required equivalent legs in a route that passed via a different city through different airlines maintaining same costs as given.

Define the function ( f(x) = sin(cos(x)) + cos(sin(x)) ). We need to find the maximum value of this function and the values of ( x ) for which this maximum is achieved. 2. First, observe that ( f(x) ) is periodic with period ( 2pi ). This is because both ( sin(x) ) and ( cos(x) ) are periodic with period ( 2pi ). 3. Next, note that ( f(-x) = sin(cos(-x)) + cos(sin(-x)) = sin(cos(x)) + cos(sin(x)) = f(x) ). Therefore, ( f(x) ) is an even function. 4. To find the maximum value of ( f(x) ), we will analyze the behavior of ( f(x) ) in the interval ([0, pi]). Since ( f(x) ) is even and periodic, it suffices to consider this interval. 5. Consider the function ( sin(cos(x)) ). The range of ( cos(x) ) is ([-1, 1]). Therefore, the range of ( sin(cos(x)) ) is ([sin(-1), sin(1)]). Since (sin(x)) is an increasing function in ([-1, 1]), the maximum value of (sin(cos(x))) is (sin(1)). 6. Similarly, consider the function ( cos(sin(x)) ). The range of ( sin(x) ) is ([-1, 1]). Therefore, the range of ( cos(sin(x)) ) is ([cos(1), cos(-1)]). Since (cos(x)) is an even function, the maximum value of (cos(sin(x))) is (cos(0) = 1). 7. Combining these results, the maximum value of ( f(x) ) is: [ f(x) leq sin(1) + 1 ] 8. To check if this maximum value is achievable, evaluate ( f(x) ) at ( x = 0 ): [ f(0) = sin(cos(0)) + cos(sin(0)) = sin(1) + cos(0) = sin(1) + 1 ] 9.

Toppings: 5 choices (no topping, sprinkles, chocolate chips, caramel drizzle, hot fudge, or a combination of two) For the ice cream flavors, since you can have up to three scoops, we need to consider the combinations of flavors you can have. This includes having all scoops of the same flavor, two scoops of one flavor and one of another, or all three scoops of different flavors. For one scoop, there are 4 choices. For two scoops, you can have either two of the same flavor or two different flavors. The number of combinations for two different flavors is 4 choose 2 (which is 4!/(2!*(4-2)!)) = 6.

We will show that X and Y are the same point. Step 2: Properties of X - Since X lies on the circumcircles of triangle SAE and triangle SBF, we have angle AXE = angle BXS (as angles subtending the same arc in a circle). - Similarly, angle BXF = angle AXS. - By the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion, triangle XAE sim triangle XBF. This implies that X is the center of a spiral similarity that maps AE to BF and A to B. Step 3: Properties of Y - Since Y lies on the circumcircles of triangle TCF and triangle TDE, we have angle FYC = angle EYD and angle FCY = angle EDY. - By the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion, triangle YED sim triangle YFC. This implies that Y is the center of a spiral similarity that maps ED to FC and E to F. Step 4: Relating X and Y - From the given condition AE/ED = BF/FC, we can write AE/BF = ED/FC. - Since triangle XAE sim triangle XBF, we have XE/XF = AE/BF. - Similarly, since triangle YED sim triangle YFC, we have YE/YF = ED/FC. - Combining these, we get XE/XF = YE/YF. - Since angle XED = angle XFC (both angles are supplements of angle AEX and angle BFX which are equal), we have triangle XED sim triangle XFC by Side-Angle-Side (SAS) similarity. - This shows that X also serves as the center of spiral similarity for E, D, F, and C, implying X = Y.

Furthermore, we require that (sin(varphi)) can be expressed as (frac{2k+1}{2k^2 + 2k + 1}) for some integer (k). - This is possible as (frac{2k+1}{2k^2 + 2k + 1}) can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently large (k). 2. **Finding (cos(varphi)):** Since (cos(varphi)) is related to (sin(varphi)) by: [ cos(varphi) = sqrt{1 - sin^2(varphi)} ] Calculate (cos(varphi)): [ sin^2(varphi) = left(frac{2k+1}{2k^2 + 2k + 1}right)^2 = frac{(2k+1)^2}{(2k^2+2k+1)^2} ] [ cos(varphi) = sqrt{1 - frac{(2k+1)^2}{(2k^2+2k+1)^2}} = frac{sqrt{(2k^2 + 2k+1)^2 - (2k+1)^2}}{2k^2 + 2k + 1} ] Simplify the numerator under the square root: [ (2k^2 + 2k + 1)^2 - (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^4 + 8k^3 + 6k^2 + 4k + 1 - (4k^2 + 4k + 1) = 4k^4 + 8k^3 + 2k^2 ] Thus: [ cos(varphi) = frac{sqrt{4k^4 + 8k^3 + 2k^2}}{2k^2 + 2k + 1} = frac{2k(k+1)}{2k^2+2k+1} ] 3. **Rationality of Trigonometric Functions:** Given that (sin(varphi)) and (cos(varphi)) are rational, we proceed by induction to show that for any positive integer (n): [ sin(nvarphi) quad text{and} quad cos(nvarphi) ] are both rational. Using trigonometric recurrence formulas: [ sin(nvarphi) = sin(varphi)cos((n-1)varphi) + cos(varphi)sin((n-1)varphi) ] [ cos(nvarphi) = cos(varphi)cos((n-1)varphi) - sin(varphi)sin((n-1)varphi) ] Since (sin(varphi)) and (cos(varphi)) are rational, the above recursive relations imply (sin(nvarphi)) and (cos(nvarphi)) remain rational for all (n). 4. **Constructing Points on Unit Circle:** Consider a unit circle centered at (O).

Consequently, for any pairs of indices (i, j) ((1 leq i, j leq 1997)): [ angle P_i O P_j = 2|i - j|varphi ] The distance between these points on the circle is given by: [ P_i P_j = 2 left| sinleft(|i-j|varphiright) right| ] Since both (cos(|i-j|varphi)) and (sin(|i-j|varphi)) are rational, (P_i P_j) must also be rational. 5. **Scaling to Integer Distances:** To get integer distances, take the least common multiple of the denominators of these rational distances, and enlarge the entire figure by this factor from (O) as center. If (P_i) becomes (P_i') after scaling, then: [ P_i' P_j' ] will be integers for all (1 leq i, j leq 1997).

We need to find the minimum possible size of the largest monochromatic connected subgraph. 3. **Claim:** Let ( K_{m,n} ) be a complete bipartite graph with parts of ( m ) and ( n ) vertices. If its edges are colored in two colors, then there exists a connected subgraph with edges of the same color with at least ( frac{m+n}{2} ) vertices. 4. **Proof of the Claim:** - Let ( A ) and ( B ) be the partitions of the vertices, with ( |A| = m ) and ( |B| = n ). Assume the colors are white and black. - For any ( a in A ), let ( d_w(a) ) denote the number of white edges incident with ( a ) and ( d_b(a) ) denote the number of black edges. - Suppose without loss of generality that ( sum_{a in A} d_w(a) ge sum_{a in A} d_b(a) ).

For (text{card}(C_3)), we note there are 9 disordered quadruples ((a, b, c, d)) such that (a times b = c times d) where (1 leq a, b, c, d leq 10): [ 1 times 6 = 2 times 3, quad 1 times 8 = 2 times 4, quad 1 times 10 = 2 times 5, quad 2 times 6 = 3 times 4, quad 2 times 9 = 3 times 6, ] [ 2 times 10 = 4 times 5, quad 3 times 8 = 4 times 6, quad 3 times 10 = 5 times 6, quad 4 times 10 = 5 times 8. ] Each of these can be permuted in 4 ways, and there are 2 ways to choose (x neq z) and (y neq u), giving: [ text{card}(C_3) = 4 times 2 times 9 + 90 + 90 = 252. ] Thus: [ text{card}(C) = text{card}(C_1) + text{card}(C_2) + text{card}(C_3) = 1000 + 900 + 252 = 2152. ] Finally, since (text{card}(A) = text{card}(B)), we have: [ 2 times text{card}(A) + text{card}(C) = 10000 implies 2 times text{card}(A) = 10000 - 2152 = 7848 implies text{card}(A) = 3924. ] The final answer is (boxed{3924})."},{"prompt":"triangle triangle ABC, angle C is an obtuse angle, and the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

The total number of pens is 31: R + B + Bl = 31 Now, we can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to find the number of each type of pen. From equation 1, we have B = R + 5.

Since the point (sqrt{3}, -dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}) is on the ellipse C: dfrac{x^2}{a^2} + dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, we have dfrac{3}{a^2} + dfrac{3}{4b^2} = 1. Solving this, we get a^2 = 4, b^2 = 3.

By solving the system of equations begin{cases} x = ty + 1 3x^2 + 4y^2 = 12 end{cases}, we get (3t^2 + 4)y^2 + 6ty - 9 = 0. Therefore, y_1 + y_2 = -dfrac{6t}{3t^2 + 4} and y_1y_2 = -dfrac{9}{3t^2 + 4}. Since triangle = 144t^2 + 144 > 0 and given N(x_2,y_2), the symmetric point of N with respect to the x-axis is P(x_2, -y_2). Therefore, k_{PM} = dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{x_1 - x_2}. Thus, the equation of line PM is y - y_1 = dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{x_1 - x_2}(x - x_1). By symmetry, if line PM always passes through a fixed point, then the fixed point should be on the x-axis.

This initial movement ensures White controls the progression without changing the distance between the two kings. 2. The fundamental strategy for the White King is to keep moving right along the 1st rank until the Black King makes a move that decreases the distance between the kings. If Black does not alter the distance by decreasing it, the White King will continue moving right unimpeded, aiming to be the first to reach the right edge. 3. Suppose the Black King reduces the distance. In that scenario, the Black King must eventually move off the 8th rank to take a step closer. Once this happens, the White King should respond by moving off the 1st rank, closely mirroring the Black King’s movements to maintain advantageous positioning. 4. We consider the chessboard as an infinite grid of cells, focusing on the significant steps rather than the boundary limits. If the Black King moves to a position not aligned with the White King, the White King moves to maintain central symmetry in the implied \\"zone\\" around both kings. 5. Before the Black King's movement from the 8th rank, the area, or \\"zone,\\" was essentially aligned with the full chessboard, and the kings were centrally symmetric on their respective ranks. When the Black King steps off the 8th rank, a 6 times 6 zone forms around both kings, with no cells outside the board’s boundary area. 6. As long as White maintains central symmetry in this zone (e.g., by ensuring the White King occupies the same color cell as the Black King), the strategy remains effective. Each time the Black King moves, White mirrors or maintains its positioning to not allow any advantageous progress by Black down to the 6 times 6 zone shrinking with each movement round. 7. By reducing the size of the zone and maintaining symmetry, the White King forces situations where only specific types of moves remain for Black, continually leading the game towards White's favor. 8. Analysing the four types of Black's moves: - **Move forward without reducing the distance**: White will move symmetrically to reduce distances to victory edges. - **Move back**: White will move forward maintaining symmetry. The zone doesn’t change, but the position inches toward White’s end game. - **Move to reduce the distance not along edges**: White compensates symmetrically reducing the zone size efficiently. - **Diagonal movements**: White follows through columnarily reducing the zone, keeping the final position closer. 9. This reasoning ensures Black King continually faces diminishing movement room, leading White King to one of the victory criteria edges. # Conclusion: White will always win, given this winning strategy where Black cannot out-position White without risking moving off the board's ranks earlier. boxed{text{White wins}}"},{"prompt":"Given the parabola C: y^{2}=8x with a focus at F, and a point P on the directrix of C.

After performing these modifications, the set becomes ( { 2, 5, 6, 7, 6, 9, 8 } ). 5. Let us calculate the product of the modified set of numbers: [ 2 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 7 cdot 6 cdot 9 cdot 8 ] 6. We observe that the numbers have been modified such that the overall product remains unchanged. Although the individual numbers are different, their multiplication yields the same result because of the properties of multiplication and the specific replacements made: - The new product ( 2 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 7 cdot 6 cdot 9 cdot 8 ) is equal to the original product ( 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 6 cdot 7 cdot 8 cdot 9 ).

At each move, if the equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) is written on the board and has real roots, Alice transforms it into ((b + c)x^2 + (c + a)x + (a + b) = 0). 2. **Transformation Rules:** Define the sequences (a_{n+1} = b_n + c_n), (b_{n+1} = a_n + c_n), and (c_{n+1} = a_n + b_n) for all (n geq 1). 3. **Objective:** We aim to show that there exists a positive integer (k) such that the equation (a_kx^2 + b_kx + c_k = 0) does not have real roots, implying Alice will stop after a finite number of moves. 4. **Contradiction Assumption:** Assume for contradiction that the equation (a_nx^2 + b_nx + c_n = 0) has real roots for all (n geq 1). 5. **Initial Condition Analysis:** Use the condition ((a_1 + c_1)b_1 > 0) to show (a_1 + b_1 + c_1 neq 0). If (a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 0), then (a_1 + c_1 = -b_1).

If it is sliced into 1 cubic centimeter cubes, how many of these 1 cubic centimeter cubes will have exactly one of their sides painted?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the structure of the original cube and how it will be divided into 1 cm³ cubes. The original cube has a side length of 5 cm, so when it is sliced into 1 cm³ cubes, we will have a 5 x 5 x 5 arrangement of these smaller cubes, resulting in a total of 5³ = 125 smaller cubes. The cubes that will have exactly one side painted are the ones that are not on the edges or corners of the original cube but are on the faces. This means we need to exclude the outermost layer of cubes on each face and count the cubes that are one layer in from each face. Each face of the original cube will contribute to the count of cubes with exactly one side painted. Since the original cube has 6 faces, we will calculate the number of 1 cm³ cubes with one painted side on one face and then multiply by 6. On each face, the outermost layer of cubes (forming a frame around the face) will have more than one side painted, so we exclude those. The inner cubes on each face will have exactly one side painted. Since the original cube is 5 cm on each side, the inner section on each face will be 3 x 3 (excluding the outer frame of width 1 cm). So, for one face, the number of 1 cm³ cubes with exactly one side painted is 3 x 3 = 9. Since there are 6 faces on the cube, the total number of 1 cm³ cubes with exactly one side painted is 9 x 6 = 54.

If you select any 9 islands, it is possible to fly around them one by one and return to the starting island. Find the minimum number of air routes that can exist in this country.","completion":"To solve the problem of determining the minimal number of aviation routes required in Ostrovlandia, we can leverage concepts from graph theory where islands represent vertices and aviation routes represent edges. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - Ostrovlandia contains 10 islands represented by vertices in a graph. - Each vertex needs to be connected in such a way that any 9 selected vertices form a cycle, enabling a route that visits each once and returns to the starting point. 2. **Graph Theoretical Concept:** - Every subset of 9 vertices (islands) forms a Hamiltonian cycle; this implies that the graph is almost a complete graph with at least one Hamiltonian cycle missing in any subset. 3. **Degree Condition:** - Suppose we remove any one vertex. The remaining graph must still be connected in such a way that it contains a Hamiltonian cycle. - From graph theory, we know that if each of the remaining vertices must form a Hamiltonian cycle, each vertex must have a degree of at least 3. This is because removing one vertex should not disconnect the graph in a manner that disrupts all possible cycles. 4. **Minimum Number of Edges Calculation:** - To ensure that each subset of 9 vertices forms a cycle: - If every vertex has at least degree 3, we need a sufficient number of edges distributed across the 10 vertices. - Calculation: The total degree sum across vertices is at least (3 times 10 = 30). - However, each edge contributes to the degree count of both vertices it connects, so total edge count = (frac{text{total degree sum}}{2} = frac{30}{2} = 15). 5. **Example of Configuration:** - Constructing a specific example where 10 vertices are connected with 15 edges can be done through a geometric configuration such as a pentagonal prism: - Let's label the vertices as (A, B, C, D, E) and (A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1, E_1), forming a pentagonal prism. - The connections will be: (A to B, B to C, C to D, D to E, E to A) (A_1 to B_1, B_1 to C_1, C_1 to D_1, D_1 to E_1, E_1 to A_1) (A to A_1, B to B_1, C to C_1, D to D_1, E to E_1) - Removing any vertex still leaves a graph that allows for a Hamiltonian cycle: - For instance, removing (E_1) still leaves (A, A_1, B, B_1, C, C_1, D, D_1, E), which can form a cycle like: (A to A_1 to B_1 to B to C to C_1 to D_1 to D to E to A).

Consider a circle with a point ( A ) on it. 3. **Tangent Line Preservation:** The tangent to the circle at point ( A ) will map to a line that intersects the circle at only one point because of the bijective nature of the affine transformation ( L ). Thus, this line must be the tangent to the circle at ( L(A) ). 4. **Parallel Tangents:** If ( A ) and ( B ) are diametrically opposite points on the circle, the tangents at these points are parallel. Under the transformation ( L ), the tangents at ( L(A) ) and ( L(B) ) must also be parallel since ( L ) is an affine transformation. 5. **Mapping of Diameters:** Since the tangents at ( L(A) ) and ( L(B) ) are parallel, ( L(A) ) and ( L(B) ) must be diametrically opposite points. 6. **Existence of Movement ( P ):** Fix some diameter ( AB ) of the given circle.

We need to show that ( F ) is the identity transformation. 8. **Fixed Points on Diameter:** Since ( F(A) = A ) and ( F(B) = B ), all points on the line segment ( AB ) remain fixed under ( F ). Therefore, any point on the circle that lies on this diameter remains stationary under ( F ). 9. **Tangent Intersection and Fixed Points:** For any point ( X ) on the circle, the tangent at ( X ) intersects the diameter ( AB ) at a single point. Given ( X' = F(X) ), the intersection point (which remains fixed), must be invariant under ( F ). 10. **Conclusion:** Since ( X ) and ( X' ) lie on the same arc, and ( X ) corresponds to ( X' ) directly under ( F ), every point ( X ) on the circle must coincide with ( F(X) ).

The smallest (k) such that (k!) is divisible by (2^4 times 3) is ( k = 6 ) because (6! = 720 = 2^4 times 3^2 times 5). 2. **Case Analysis on (k+1) being composite:** Suppose (k+1) is not a prime number. We can write (k+1 = pq) where (p leq k) and (q leq k). - If (p) and (q) are distinct primes, they both appear as factors of (k!), hence (pq | k!). Therefore, (k+1) divides (k!). - If (p = q), then (k+1 = p^2). Observe: - If (p > 2), then the factors (p) and (2p) must both appear in (k!), so (k!) would be divisible by (p^2).

Substituting our known values, we have: [ c = sqrt{25 - m^2} ] Considering that the focal point F_1 is at (-4,0), the distance from the center to F_1 is 4 units (since it's to the left of the origin), so we have: [ 4 = sqrt{25 - m^2} ] Next, we proceed to solve for m^2: [ 4^2 = 25 - m^2 ] [ 16 = 25 - m^2 ] [ m^2 = 25 - 16 ] [ m^2 = 9 ] Considering that m > 0, we take the positive square root: [ m = sqrt{9} ] [ m = 3 ] Thus, the correct answer is: [ boxed{m = 3} ]"},{"prompt":"After a questionnaire survey, students in a class have three attitudes towards photography: like, dislike, and neutral.

We start with the given equation: [ sum_{m=1}^{infty} left( leftlfloor frac{n}{m} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n-1}{m} rightrfloor right) = 1992 ] This equation counts the number of positive divisors of ( n ). Therefore, ( n ) must have exactly 1992 positive divisors. 2. Next, we consider the condition ( phi(n) mid n ). Recall that Euler's totient function ( phi(n) ) is given by: [ phi(n) = n left(1 - frac{1}{p_1}right) left(1 - frac{1}{p_2}right) cdots left(1 - frac{1}{p_k}right) ] where ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) are the distinct prime factors of ( n ). For ( phi(n) mid n ), the fraction: [ frac{n}{phi(n)} = frac{p_1 p_2 cdots p_k}{(p_1 - 1)(p_2 - 1) cdots (p_k - 1)} ] must be an integer. 3. We analyze the possible forms of ( n ) that satisfy both conditions. If ( n ) has more than one odd prime factor, the denominator will have at least two factors of 2, making the fraction non-integer. Therefore, ( n ) can either be a power of 2 or a product of a power of 2 and a single odd prime. 4. First, consider ( n = 2^a ). The number of divisors of ( 2^a ) is ( a + 1 ). Setting ( a + 1 = 1992 ), we get: [ a = 1991 ] Thus, ( n = 2^{1991} ). 5. Next, consider ( n = 2^b cdot 3^c ). The number of divisors of ( 2^b cdot 3^c ) is ( (b + 1)(c + 1) ). Setting ( (b + 1)(c + 1) = 1992 ), we need to find pairs ((b, c)) such that this product holds. 6. The prime factorization of 1992 is: [ 1992 = 2^3 cdot 3 cdot 83 ] The number of divisors of 1992 is: [ (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 16 ] Therefore, there are 16 pairs ((b + 1, c + 1)). 7.

This gives us: [ AZ = s - c, quad ZB = s - b ] [ BX = s - a, quad XC = s - c ] [ CY = s - b, quad YA = s - a ] where s is the semiperimeter of Delta ABC, defined as s = frac{a + b + c}{2}. 4. **Substituting the Ratios**: Substitute these segment lengths into Cheva's condition: [ frac{AZ}{ZB} = frac{s - c}{s - b} ] [ frac{BX}{XC} = frac{s - a}{s - c} ] [ frac{CY}{YA} = frac{s - b}{s - a} ] 5. **Calculating the Product**: Compute the product of these fractions: [ frac{AZ}{ZB} cdot frac{BX}{XC} cdot frac{CY}{YA} = left( frac{s - c}{s - b} right) cdot left( frac{s - a}{s - c} right) cdot left( frac{s - b}{s - a} right) ] Notice that the terms cancel out as follows: [ left( frac{s - c}{s - b} right) cdot left( frac{s - a}{s - c} right) cdot left( frac{s - b}{s - a} right) = 1 ] This shows that the product of the ratios is indeed 1. 6. **Conclusion**: By Cheva's Theorem, since the product of the ratios equals 1, we can conclude that the cevians AX, BY, and CZ are concurrent. Hence, they intersect at a single point, known as the Gergonne point of Delta ABC. [blacksquare]"},{"prompt":"Randy has some money in his piggy bank at the start of the year.

Randy deposits 50 every month into his piggy bank. Since there are 12 months in a year, he deposits a total of ( 50 times 12 = 600 ) dollars in a year. 2. Randy visits the store 200 times in a year, and each visit costs him between 2 and 3. To find out the maximum and minimum amount he could have spent, we calculate: - Minimum spent: ( 200 times 2 = 400 ) dollars - Maximum spent: ( 200 times 3 = 600 ) dollars 3. At the end of the year, Randy has 104 left in his piggy bank. This amount is after all the deposits and the spending at the store. 4. To find out how much money Randy had at first, we need to add the amount he has left to the amount he spent at the store and then subtract the total amount he deposited throughout the year. Since we don't know exactly how much he spent each time he went to the store, we'll calculate the initial amount for both the minimum and maximum spending scenarios. - If he spent the minimum amount: Initial amount = Amount left + Minimum spent - Total deposited Initial amount = 104 + 400 - 600 Initial amount = 504 - 600 Initial amount = -96 - If he spent the maximum amount: Initial amount = Amount left + Maximum spent - Total deposited Initial amount = 104 + 600 - 600 Initial amount = 704 - 600 Initial amount = 104 Since it's not possible for Randy to have a negative amount of money at the start, we can conclude that he must have spent the maximum amount at the store each time.

One participant has zero acquaintances, which is an even number.

We need to prove this is also possible for ( n + 1 ) participants. Let ( n + 1 ) participants be at the conference.

Label these acquaintances as ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{2k+1} ), where ( 2k+1 ) is an odd number. 1. **Temporary Removal and Re-connect Acquaintances:** - We temporarily remove participant ( A ) from the conference. - Force each pair among ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{2k+1} ) to either establish acquaintances if they weren’t acquainted before or temporarily cease their acquaintance if they were previously acquainted. 2. **Induction Hypothesis Application:** - Consider the remaining ( n ) participants (excluding ( A )). By the induction hypothesis, these ( n ) participants can be divided into two rooms such that each participant has an even number of acquaintances within their room. 3. **Reintroduce Participant ( A ):** - Assume without loss of generality that ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{s} ) are in one room and ( B_{s+1}, B_{s+2}, ldots, B_{2k+1} ) are in the other room (( 0 leq s leq k )). - Place ( A ) into one room, say the first one. Since ( A ) has an odd number (2k+1) of acquaintances, by placing ( A ) in the room, each participant who was temporarily connected or disconnected due to ( A )'s removal now returns to their original state of acquaintances. 4. **Adjust the Acquaintances:** - Reverse the temporary acquaintance or disconnection between ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{2k+1} ). This ensures every participant’s number of acquaintances changes parity. - Initially, each ( B_i ) had an even number of acquaintances among ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{2k+1} ).

What is the smallest number of any trees in this grove that must include trees of at least three types?","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of trees one must choose to guarantee that at least three different types of trees are present among the chosen trees. 1. **Establish Initial Condition**: We start with 100 trees consisting of four types: birches, spruces, pines, and aspens. The problem states that any selection of 85 trees will necessarily contain all four types of trees. 2. **Analyze Minimum Requirements**: First, consider if we assume there are no more than 15 trees of one type, say birches. Then, the remaining 100 - 15 = 85 trees must contain all four tree types, according to the problem statement. This would form a contradiction if there were less than 15 birches, implying that there must be at least 16 birches. This logic applies symmetrically to the other types of trees (spruces, pines, aspens). 3. **Illustrate General Conclusion**: Every type of tree (birches, spruces, pines, aspens) must be represented by at least 16 trees. So, in any subset of 85 trees, each type definitely appears. 4. **Bound the Calculation for Three Types**: Now, let’s determine the least number such that among any 69 chosen trees, there are always at least three different types of trees. 5. **Consider Contradiction Approach**: Assume the chosen subset of 69 trees contains only two types of trees. Then, at least 100 - 69 = 31 trees are not part of this subset. These 31 trees must include at least 16 trees of each of the remaining two types. This gives rise to a contradiction because removing trees belonging to at least two types leaves enough for ensuring all four types in remaining trees. Thus, every possible set of 69 trees must contain more than two types of trees. 6. **Example for Counterverification**: To verify, consider 34 birches, 34 spruces, 16 pines, and 16 aspens: - In any subset of 85, all four types are present. - However, if we take 34 birches and 34 spruces, the subset of these 68 trees consists only of two types (birches and spruces).

Let the sum of the first n terms of the sequence { frac{n}{2^n} } be denoted by Q_n: Q_n = frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{2^2} + dots + frac{n}{2^n}. Therefore, 2Q_n = 1 + frac{2}{2} + frac{3}{2^2} + dots + frac{n}{2^{n-1}}, and subtracting the first equation from this gives us: Q_n = 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2^2} + dots + frac{1}{2^{n-1}} - frac{n}{2^n} = frac{1 - frac{1}{2^n}}{1 - frac{1}{2}} - frac{n}{2^n} = 2 - frac{n+2}{2^n}. Now, for T_n, we have: T_n = frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{2^2} + dots + frac{n}{2^n} - (frac{1}{2^2} + frac{1}{2^3} + dots + frac{1}{2^n} + frac{1}{2^{n+1}}) = 2 - frac{n+2}{2^n} - frac{frac{1}{2^2}(1- frac{1}{2^n})}{1 - frac{1}{2}} = 2 - frac{n+2}{2^n} - frac{1}{2}(1 - frac{1}{2^n}) = frac{3}{2} - frac{n + frac{3}{2}}{2^n}. So the sum T_n is boxed{frac{3}{2} - frac{n + frac{3}{2}}{2^n}}."},{"prompt":"Elyse had some pieces of gum. She gave half to her brother Rick. He gave half of his to his friend Shane.

We start with the given equivalence: [ 7(a + 2^{2008}b) equiv 1 pmod{2^{2011}} ] where (0 leq a < 2^{2008}) and (0 leq b < 8). 2. First, observe that: [ 7(a + 2^{2008}b) < 7(2^{2008} + 2^{2011}) = 7 cdot 2^{2008}(1 + 2^3) = 7 cdot 2^{2008} cdot 9 = 63 cdot 2^{2008} < 8 cdot 2^{2011} ] This ensures that (7(a + 2^{2008}b)) is within the range of (2^{2011}). 3. Suppose: [ 7(a + 2^{2008}b) = k cdot 2^{2011} + 1 ] for some integer (k). Since (7(a + 2^{2008}b) < 8 cdot 2^{2011}), we have: [ k cdot 2^{2011} + 1 < 8 cdot 2^{2011} implies k < 8 ] Therefore, (1 leq k leq 7). 4. We need (7 mid (k cdot 2^{2011} + 1)). This implies: [ k cdot 2^{2011} + 1 equiv 0 pmod{7} implies k cdot 2^{2011} equiv -1 pmod{7} ] 5. Since (2^{2011} equiv 2 pmod{7}) (because (2^3 equiv 1 pmod{7}) and (2011 equiv 2 pmod{3})), we have: [ k cdot 2 equiv -1 pmod{7} implies 2k equiv -1 pmod{7} implies 2k equiv 6 pmod{7} implies k equiv 3 pmod{7} ] Thus, (k = 3). 6. Substituting (k = 3) back, we get: [ 7(a + 2^{2008}b) = 3 cdot 2^{2011} + 1 ] 7. Now, consider the inequality: [ 7(a + 2^{2008}b) geq 7a + 7 cdot 2^{2010} ] If (b geq 4), then: [ 7(a + 2^{2008}b) geq 7a + 7 cdot 2^{2010} implies 7a + 7 cdot 2^{2010} leq 3 cdot 2^{2011} + 1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ 7a leq 2^{2010}(3 cdot 2 - 7) + 1 implies 7a leq 2^{2010}(-1) + 1 < 0 ] This is a contradiction, so (b < 4). 8. Therefore, (b) must be (0 leq b leq 3). Given (k = 3), we solve for (a): [ 7(a + 2^{2008}b) = 3 cdot 2^{2011} + 1 implies a + 2^{2008}b = frac{3 cdot 2^{2011} + 1}{7} ] Since (a) must be an integer, we need (2^{2008}b) to make the right-hand side an integer. Testing (b = 3): [ a + 3 cdot 2^{2008} = frac{3 cdot 2^{2011} + 1}{7} implies a = frac{3 cdot 2^{2011} + 1 - 3 cdot 2^{2008} cdot 7}{7} = frac{3 cdot 2^{2011} + 1 - 3 cdot 2^{2011}}{7} = frac{1}{7} ] This is an integer, so (b = 3).

Similarly, the column signature contains both LR and RL as substrings. - If there is an RL substring, the UD and RL substrings together create a situation where two kings attack each other diagonally, which is a contradiction. - Therefore, the row signature cannot contain both UD and DU as substrings, and the column signature cannot contain both RL and LR as substrings. 6. **Possible Signatures:** - The row signature must be either Ucdots UDcdots D or its reverse Dcdots DUcdots U. - The column signature must be either Rcdots RLcdots L or its reverse Lcdots LRcdots R. - If the row signature is Ucdots UDcdots D, the column signature must be Lcdots LRcdots R to avoid contradictions, and vice versa. 7. **Conclusion:** - These assignments of signatures provide valid arrangements of the kings on the chessboard. - Therefore, the number of such arrangements is boxed{2}."},{"prompt":"w many integers n satisfy (n3)(n+5)<0?","completion":"First, we need to determine the values of n for which each factor changes its sign: 1.

Assume that the measure (mathrm{P}) has an atom ( A ) (i.e., (mathrm{P}(A) > 0 )). An atom (A) is defined such that if (mathrm{P}(A) > mathrm{P}(B)) for ( B subset A ) (with ( B in mathscr{F} )), then (mathrm{P}(B) = 0). 2. **Step 2 (Define (v)):** Define [ v = inf { u in [0, 1] : mathrm{P}(A cap { U leq u }) = mathrm{P}(A) }. ] 3. **Step 3 (Probability Calculation):** Since ( mathrm{P}(A cap { U leq v }) = mathrm{P}(A) ) and (mathrm{P}(A) > mathrm{P}(A cap { U leq v - varepsilon }) = 0) for some ( varepsilon > 0 ), we must show: [ mathrm{P}(A cap { U leq v }) = mathrm{P}(A) ] implies that: [ v - varepsilon + mathrm{P}(A) = mathrm{P}(U leq v - varepsilon) + mathrm{P}(A) = mathrm{P}({U leq v - varepsilon} cup A) leq mathrm{P}({U leq v} cup A) = mathrm{P}(U leq v) = v. ] However, this cannot be true if ( varepsilon < mathrm{P}(A) ), revealing a contradiction. 4. **Step 4 (Sufficiency):** To establish sufficiency, we need the property: if ((Omega, mathscr{F}, mathrm{P})) is a measurable space with a nonatomic measure (mathrm{P}) and ( mathrm{P}(Omega) = p in (0, 1] ), then there always exists a subset ( C in mathscr{F} ) such that ( mathrm{P}(C) in left[ frac{p}{3}, frac{p}{2} right] ). 5. **Step 5 (Construction of sequence):** Construct the sequences [ {D_{i, n}, 1 leq i leq 2^n }, quad n geq 1, ] of refining partitions of ( Omega ), where ( max_{i} mathrm{P}(D_{i, n}) rightarrow 0 ) as ( n rightarrow infty ), and all ( D_{i, n} in mathscr{F} ) with ( mathrm{P}(D_{i, n}) > 0 ) and ( D_{2i - 1, n+1}, D_{2i, n+1} subset D_{i, n} ). 6. **Step 6 (Definition of ( A_x )):** For a fixed ( x in (0, 1] ), define ( A_x ) as the union of ( D_{i, n} ) over all ((i, n)) such that ( i 2^{-n} leq x ). Define ( A_0 = varnothing ). 7. **Step 7 (Definition of X):** These ( A_x ) are non-decreasing in ( x ), so we can correctly define a random variable ( X ) by: [ { omega : X(omega) = x } = A_x setminus bigcup_{z : z < x} A_z. ] 8. **Step 8 (Distribution function ( F )):** The distribution function ( F(x) ) of ( X ) will be continuous and strictly increasing on ([0, 1]) with ( F(0) = 0 ) and ( F(1) = 1 ). 9. **Step 9 (Uniform distribution ( U )):** Hence, ( U = F^{-1}(X) ) will have a uniform distribution on ([0, 1]), as derived from problem II.9.1. 10. **Step 10 (Existence of subset ( C )):** Return to the proof of the property of ((Omega, mathscr{F}, mathrm{P})) with nonatomic measure (mathrm{P}) limited to finite (mathrm{P}(Omega) = p in (0, 1]). Consider any set ( A in mathscr{F} ) with ( mathrm{P}(A) > 0 ). Measure ( mathrm{P} ) being nonatomic means there exists ( B_1 subset A) (( B_1 in mathscr{F} )) such that ( 0 < mathrm{P}(B_1) < mathrm{P}(A) ). 11. **Step 11 (Subset ( C )):** Assume such a (C) does not exist. Define the class (mathscr{A}) of subsets ( A in mathscr{F} ) where ( mathrm{P}(A) leq frac{p}{2} ) implies ( mathrm{P}(A) < frac{p}{3} ). For ( A_1, A_2 in mathscr{A} ): [ mathrm{P}(A_1 cup A_2) < frac{2p}{3}, ] so ( mathrm{P}(A_1 cup A_2) notin left( frac{p}{2}, frac{2p}{3} right). ) This implies that (mathrm{P}(A_1 cup A_2) < frac{p}{3}), making the class (mathscr{A}) closed under finite unions. 12. **Step 12 (Sequence and supremum (s)):** Select ( A_n in mathscr{A}, n geq 1, ) such that: [ mathrm{P}(A_n) rightarrow s = sup { mathrm{P}(A) : A in mathscr{A} }. ] Assume ( A_n subseteq A_{n+1} ) and thus ( mathrm{P}(A_{infty}) = s leq frac{p}{3} ), where ( A_{infty} = bigcup_{n geq 1} A_n in mathscr{F} ). 13. **Step 13 (Contradiction and conclusion):** If ( s < p/3 ), k then selecting ( B subset Omega setminus A_{infty} ) with ( 0< mathrm{P}(B) < frac{p}{3} - s ), implies: [ mathrm{P}(A_{infty} cup B) = s + mathrm{P}(B) < frac{p}{3}, ] conflicting this result concludes with the existence of the required subset ( C ). **Conclusion:** The property of universality of ((Omega, mathscr{F}, mathrm{P})) is equivalent to (mathrm{P}) being a nonatomic measure.

Steps: 1. **Investigation of Whole Part Digits:** When a digit from the whole part of a positive number is erased, the resulting number decreases. To achieve doubling of the number after removing a digit, consider the fractional part. 2. **Consideration of the Fractional Part:** Suppose the number is given by ( n + 0.x_1x_2ldots ), where ( n ) is the integer part, and ( 0.x_1x_2ldots ) is the fractional part. If a digit from the fractional part is removed, ( n ) must be zero because the number cannot increase sufficiently otherwise. 3. **Focus on Fractional Part Only:** Since ( n = 0 ), let the original number be in the form ( 0.x_1x_2ldots ). Let’s denote the number by ( x.x_1x_2ldots ). 4. **Finding Conditions:** The first digit ( x ) after the decimal point should not be zero for a meaningful doubling. Assume we remove ( x ), the first digit. The new number will be ( 0.0x_2x_3ldots ). Let the original number in its simplest form after the first digit is ( y = 0.x_2x_3ldots ). 5. **Formulate Doubling Condition:** The equation for doubling under the conditions given can be written as: [ 10y = 2left(frac{x}{10} + yright) ] Simplifying, we get: [ 10y = frac{2x}{10} + 2y ] [ 8y = frac{2x}{10} ] [ 40y = x ] 6. **Setting the Bound:** Since ( y ) has to be a valid fractional number ( y < 0.1 ).

Then, it follows that: [ a_n, b_n, c_n, d_n leq M quad text{for all } n geq 1. ] 3. **Modulo 2 Analysis:** We observe that: [ a_{n+1} equiv a_n + b_n pmod{2}, quad b_{n+1} equiv b_n + c_n pmod{2}, quad c_{n+1} equiv c_n + d_n pmod{2}, quad d_{n+1} equiv d_n + a_n pmod{2}. ] This implies that: [ a_{n+4} equiv 2a_n + 4b_n + 6c_n + 4d_n equiv 0 pmod{2}. ] Similarly, we have: [ b_{n+4} equiv 0 pmod{2}, quad c_{n+4} equiv 0 pmod{2}, quad d_{n+4} equiv 0 pmod{2}. ] 4. **Inductive Step:** By induction, we can show that (2^m mid a_{4m+1}, b_{4m+1}, c_{4m+1}, d_{4m+1}). For the base case (m=1), we have shown that all terms are even. Assume that (2^m mid a_{4m+1}, b_{4m+1}, c_{4m+1}, d_{4m+1}). Then, for (m+1): [ a_{4(m+1)+1} = a_{4m+5}, quad b_{4(m+1)+1} = b_{4m+5}, quad c_{4(m+1)+1} = c_{4m+5}, quad d_{4(m+1)+1} = d_{4m+5}. ] Since each term is derived from the previous terms by taking absolute differences, and each term is divisible by (2^m), it follows that the new terms are divisible by (2^{m+1}). 5. **Conclusion:** For (2^m > M), we must have (a_{4m+1} = b_{4m+1} = c_{4m+1} = d_{4m+1} = 0). This is because the maximum value (M) is finite, and eventually, the terms will be reduced to zero.

On Wednesday, it did not rain, so the total for Wednesday is 0 inches. On Thursday, it rained 1 inch. On Friday, the total was equal to Monday through Thursday combined, so Friday's total is 3 (Monday) + T (Tuesday) + 0 (Wednesday) + 1 (Thursday) = 3 + T + 0 + 1 = 4 + T inches. The daily average rain total for the week is 4 inches, and there are 5 days in the week (Monday to Friday), so the total rain for the week is 4 inches/day * 5 days = 20 inches.

Substituting k = 20 back into the first equation, we find b = 80. Therefore, the relationship between the sales volume t and the day x for the first 4 days is t = 20x + 80. For the days after the 6th day, the sales volume t is given by t = -x^2 + 50x - 100. Completing the square for this quadratic equation, we rewrite t as t = -(x-25)^2 + 525. Since the coefficient of the x^2 term is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the sales volume t reaches its maximum at the vertex (25, 525). However, since x is restricted to the range 6 leq x leq 20, the maximum sales volume within this range occurs at the upper limit, x = 20.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at (x_0, y_0) is e^{x_0}. Since the point (x_0, y_0) lies on the line y = x + k, we can substitute y_0 and x_0 into this equation to get e^{x_0} = x_0 + k.

Given that the side of the polygon (also a side of this triangle) is equal to the radius, all sides of this triangle are equal, making it an equilateral triangle. 2. **Central Angle Calculation**: In an equilateral triangle, all angles are equal to 60^{circ}. This angle, formed at the center of the circle by lines connecting the center to two adjacent vertices of the polygon, is also the central angle of the polygon. 3. **Number of Sides Determination**: The total angle around a point is 360^{circ}. Since each central angle is 60^{circ}, the number of sides of the polygon, which is also the number of these central angles fitting into 360^{circ}, is calculated as follows: [ frac{360^{circ}}{60^{circ}} = 6 ] Therefore, the regular polygon described is a regular hexagon. [ boxed{text{six}} ] **Analysis**: This solution leverages the unique property of equilateral triangles and the definition of regular polygons to deduce the number of sides of the polygon.

The diagonal of this square, by the Pythagorean theorem, would be s√2. If the larger square has a diagonal that is 7 times longer than the diagonal of the smaller square, then its diagonal would be 7s√2. The side length of the larger square can be found by dividing its diagonal by √2 (since the diagonal of a square is the side length times √2). So the side length of the larger square would be (7s√2) / √2 = 7s. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. Therefore, the perimeter of the smaller square is 4s, and the perimeter of the larger square is 4 * 7s = 28s.

Therefore, for any two points with 0 < x_1 < x_2, we have y_1 < y_2 because x_1^2 < x_2^2. - When x < 0, as x decreases, x^2 increases, which means y = x^2 - 1 also increases.

By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the formula for the union of the areas is as follows: [ S_{A cup B cup C} = S_A + S_B + S_C - (S_{A cap B} + S_{B cap C} + S_{C cap A}) + S_{A cap B cap C} ] - Substituting the given areas, we get: [ 6 geq 3 + 3 + 3 - (S_{A cap B} + S_{B cap C} + S_{C cap A}) + S_{A cap B cap C} ] - Simplifying this, we find: [ 6 geq 9 - (S_{A cap B} + S_{B cap C} + S_{C cap A}) + S_{A cap B cap C} ] - Rearranging, it follows that: [ S_{A cap B} + S_{B cap C} + S_{C cap A} = 3 + S_{A cap B cap C} geq 3 ] 4. **Conclusion**: Given that S_{A cap B} + S_{B cap C} + S_{C cap A} geq 3, at least one of S_{A cap B}, S_{B cap C}, or S_{C cap A} must be at least 1, since their sum is at least 3.

We need to show that there exist two polygons whose shared area is at least frac{1}{9}. 2. **Approach**: - Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 3. **Storage**: - Total area constraint: [ S geq 9 - M_2 ] where M_2 is the sum of all pairwise intersections. 4. **Finding minimum intersecting area**: - By the inclusion-exclusion principle, we know that: [ 5 geq 9 - M_2 ] Simplifying, we get: [ M_2 geq 4 ] - There are binom{9}{2} = 36 pairs possible from 9 polygons. 5. **Conclusion**: The average shared area among these pairs must satisfy: [ frac{M_2}{36} geq frac{4}{36} = frac{1}{9} ] Thus, at least one pair of these polygons must have an intersection area of at least frac{1}{9}.

While it's true that any two rectangles have equal corresponding angles (each being 90^circ), the ratios of their corresponding sides can vary. Therefore, not all rectangles are similar. - **Statement B: Any two rhombuses are similar.** - Similarity in rhombuses would require equal corresponding angles and equal ratios of corresponding sides. Rhombuses have equal sides, but their angles can differ unless they are also squares. Thus, not all rhombuses are similar due to the potential variation in their angles. - **Statement C: Any two isosceles right triangles are similar.** - Isosceles right triangles have two angles of 45^circ and one angle of 90^circ, making their corresponding angles equal. Additionally, the ratio of the lengths of their corresponding sides is constant because the sides opposite the equal angles in isosceles right triangles are proportional. Therefore, any two isosceles right triangles are similar. - **Statement D: Any two parallelograms are similar.** - For parallelograms to be similar, they must have equal corresponding angles and the ratios of corresponding sides must be equal.

They decided to take a ride on the boat. Each time, a group of one or more people crosses from one bank to the other. The friends want to organize the rides so that each possible group crosses the river exactly once. Is it possible for them to do this?","completion":"1. **Problem Restatement**: Let's restate the problem: Five friends find a boat that can carry all of them across a river. They want each possible group to cross the river exactly once. We need to determine if this is feasible. 2. **Calculate Possible Combinations**: Let’s calculate the number of possible combinations of friends to form a group that can cross the river. Each of the 5 friends can either be in the group or not, which gives us: [ 2^5 = 32 ] This count includes the scenario where no one is in the group, which doesn't make sense practically as an empty boat can't cross. Hence, the number of valid groups (non-empty) is: [ 32 - 1 = 31 ] 3. **Analyze the Groups**: Since crossing must happen exactly once per group and the boat can only cross if it carries at least one person, let's consider the implications of having 31 crossings: - **Odd Number of Crossings**: The total number of crossings (31) is an odd number. This means the trips cannot be paired up, and so the boat ends up on the opposite shore after the last trip. 4. **Position of the Boat**: Thus, if all these crossings are completed, the boat will end up on the opposite shore from where it started, which implies that the boat can't return without an extra trip, violating the condition of crossing exactly once for each group. 5. **Check for Specific Friend's Crossings**: To further solidify the problem, let's look at individual participation. Take any of the friends, say Vasya. They can either be part of a crossing group or not. The number of combinations involving Vasya is: [ 2^{4} = 16 ] This count is even, so for Vasya to be in the boat an even number of times, they will end up on the same shore where they started. Therefore, the combination of all friends will cause the boat to start and end on opposite shores without a balanced way to fulfill the conditions. 6. **Conclusion**: Since the number of total valid groups is odd, leading to an imbalance in the end positions, it is impossible to organize the crossings such that each possible group crosses exactly once without an extra trip.

The problem requires us to determine the smallest natural number ( N ) such that when the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, 2016 ) are divided into pairs, the product of the numbers in each pair does not exceed ( N ). 2. Let's consider taking the two largest numbers from the sequence, which are 2016 and 2015. Their product is: [ 2016 times 2015 = 4068240. ] Clearly, this gives us an upper bound, but we seek the smallest possible ( N ). 3. We need to form pairs such that every product is lower than or equal to ( N ). The critical insight here is to form \\"balanced\\" pairs where the products are minimized across the board. 4. To proceed methodically, notice that logically ( N ) needs to satisfy the condition for the median values of the set, because the extremes (i.e., the smallest and the largest pairs) usually yield the highest product. We compute this through pairing numbers near the middle of the sequence and extending outward. 5. Consider the largest number, 2016. Pair it with 1: [ 1 times 2016 = 2016. ] This result is much smaller. We continue this strategy with pairs that gradually increase up to the median of the sequence. 6.

At that point, A had won 2 rounds, and B had won 1 round. How should the 96 gold coins be divided?

Given that each player has an equal chance of winning any given round, we can denote their winning probability per round as dfrac{1}{2}. Player A needs to win only 1 more round to win the game, while player B needs to win 2 consecutive rounds. We calculate their probabilities of winning the game as follows: - **Player A's Winning Probability, P_{1}:** Player A can win the game by winning the next round or by losing the next round but winning the two rounds after that. Therefore, the probability of A winning the game is calculated as: [ P_{1} = left(dfrac{1}{2}right) + left(dfrac{1}{2} times dfrac{1}{2}right) = dfrac{1}{2} + dfrac{1}{4} = dfrac{3}{4} ] - **Player B's Winning Probability, P_{2}:** For player B to win the game, B must win the next two consecutive rounds. Thus, the probability of B winning the game is: [ P_{2} = left(dfrac{1}{2} times dfrac{1}{2}right) = dfrac{1}{4} ] Given these probabilities, we can now calculate how the 96 gold coins should be divided based on the probability of each player winning: - **Player A's Share:** [ 96 times P_{1} = 96 times dfrac{3}{4} = 72 text{ coins} ] - **Player B's Share:** [ 96 times P_{2} = 96 times dfrac{1}{4} = 24 text{ coins} ] Therefore, based on the calculated probabilities, player A should receive 72 coins, and player B should receive 24 coins.

We are given that xi and eta are independent random variables with a standard normal distribution mathscr{N}(0, 1). 2.

The vector (xi, eta) is jointly normally distributed with mean vector mathbf{0} and covariance matrix mathbf{I}, where mathbf{I} is the identity matrix.

First, let's find the total number of ways to draw three balls from the bag without regard to color. This is a combination problem, where we are choosing 3 balls from a total of 8 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 23 balls. The number of ways to choose 3 balls from 23 is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) Where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 balls from 23 is: C(23, 3) = 23! / (3! * (23 - 3)!) = 23! / (3! * 20!) = (23 * 22 * 21) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 1771 Now, let's calculate the probability of drawing three balls of the same color for each color: 1.

Here's our step-by-step solution: Let's denote the lateral sides of the trapezoid as (AB) and (CD). Let ( M ) and ( N ) denote the second points of intersection of the lines ( AC ) and ( BD ) with the circles constructed on these diameters respectively. We assume that if the line ( AC ) is tangent to the circle with diameter ( AB ), then ( M = A ). Similarly, if the line ( BD ) is tangent to the corresponding circle, then ( N = D ). # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Establish the Key Points and Notations:** - Denote the points of intersection as follows: (M) as the point where ( AC ) intersects the circle with diameter ( AB ) again. (N) as the point where ( BD ) intersects the circle with diameter ( CD ) again. 2. **Apply the Tangent-Secant Theorem:** Using the Tangent-Secant Theorem (The Power of a Point), we have: [ KM cdot KA = KN cdot KD ] This must be proven to hold true. Let's denote the angle ( AKB ) as ( varphi ). 3. **Consider the Right Angles:** Since (angle AMB) subtends the diameter ( AB ), it is a right angle ((90^circ)). Thus, (angle KMB = 90^circ). Similarly, (angle CND) is also a right angle because it subtends the diameter ( CD ). 4. **Equations from Right Triangles:** Using the properties of right-angled triangles, we can write: [ KM = KB cos varphi ] [ KN = KC cos varphi ] 5. **Substitute into the Main Equation:** We substitute these expressions into our key equation: [ KB cdot KA = KC cdot KD ] 6. **Triangle Similarity:** The equation ( KB cdot KA = KC cdot KD ) is a known property that follows from the similarity of triangles ( AKD ) and ( CKD ), because the diagonals of a trapezoid cut one another proportionally. 7. **Geometric Property Confirmation:** To reinforce that: Points ( A, M, N, ) and ( D ) lie on the same circle, since ( angle BMC = angle BNC = 90^circ ), we see points ( B, M, N, ) and ( C ) lie on a circle with diameter ( BC ). 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, given the power of the point ( K ), the tangents from ( K ) to the circles constructed on ( AB ) and ( CD ) respectively are equal.

His new income (I_new) would be: I_new = I + (X/100) * I I_new = I * (1 + X/100) His expenditure also increases by 10%, so his new expenditure (E_new) would be: E_new = E + 0.10E E_new = 0.75I + 0.10 * 0.75I E_new = 0.75I * (1 + 0.10) E_new = 0.75I * 1.10 His new savings (S_new) would be the difference between his new income and his new expenditure: S_new = I_new - E_new S_new = I * (1 + X/100) - 0.75I * 1.10 We are given that the percentage increase in his savings is approximately 50% (49.99999999999996% to be exact, but we'll use 50% for simplicity).

Since (0, frac{3}{2}) is part of the interval left(0,+infty right) and the function is decreasing there, it does not meet the requirements. **Option C: fleft(xright)=3-x** - This is a linear function with a negative slope, meaning it decreases for all x in mathbb{R}. Thus, it is decreasing on left(0,+infty right) and does not meet the requirements. **Option D: fleft(xright)=-|x|** - For all x > 0, -|x| = -x, which is a decreasing function since as x increases, -x decreases.

This means that if ( m ) divides ( n ), then ( A_n subseteq A_m ). 4. **Divisors of Each Number from 1 to 8:** - ( A_1 ) must contain all other sets because 1 divides all numbers. - ( A_2 ) must contain ( A_4 ) and ( A_8 ) because 2 divides 4 and 8. - ( A_3 ) must contain ( A_6 ) because 3 divides 6. - ( A_4 ) must contain ( A_8 ) because 4 divides 8. - ( A_5 ) has no other constraints because 5 does not divide any other number in the range. - ( A_6 ) has no other constraints because 6 does not divide any other number in the range. - ( A_7 ) has no other constraints because 7 does not divide any other number in the range. - ( A_8 ) has no other constraints because 8 does not divide any other number in the range. 5. **Choosing Sets:** - ( A_1 ) can be any of the 4 subsets. - ( A_2 ) can be any subset of ( A_1 ), so there are 4 choices for ( A_2 ). - ( A_3 ) can be any subset of ( A_1 ), so there are 4 choices for ( A_3 ). - ( A_4 ) can be any subset of ( A_2 ), so there are 4 choices for ( A_4 ). - ( A_5 ) can be any subset of ( A_1 ), so there are 4 choices for ( A_5 ). - ( A_6 ) can be any subset of ( A_3 ), so there are 4 choices for ( A_6 ). - ( A_7 ) can be any subset of ( A_1 ), so there are 4 choices for ( A_7 ). - ( A_8 ) can be any subset of ( A_4 ), so there are 4 choices for ( A_8 ). 6. **Calculating Total Number of Ways:** Since each set can be chosen independently based on the constraints, the total number of ways to select the sequence is: [ 4 times 4 times 4 times 4 times 4 times 4 times 4 times 4 = 4^8 = 65536 ] The final answer is (boxed{65536})"},{"prompt":"Albert has 2 snakes.

Now, let's find out how many bottle caps a horse is worth. Since 3 lizards are worth 5 gallons of water and 1 horse is worth 80 gallons of water, we can set up a proportion to find out how many lizards are equivalent to 1 horse: 3 lizards / 5 gallons of water = x lizards / 80 gallons of water Solving for x gives us: x = (3 lizards * 80 gallons of water) / 5 gallons of water x = 240 lizards / 5 x = 48 lizards So, 1 horse is equivalent to 48 lizards. Now, since 1 lizard is worth 8 bottle caps, we can find out how many bottle caps 48 lizards are worth: 48 lizards * 8 bottle caps per lizard = 384 bottle caps Therefore, a horse is worth 384 bottle caps.

Therefore: [ 2019 times 3024 quad text{(one odd and one even number multiplication gives an even number)} ] [ 2015 times 1007 quad text{(one odd and one odd number multiplication gives an odd number)} ] Hence, subtracting these two quantities: [ 2019 times 3024 - 2015 times 1007 quad text{results in an odd number} ] Adding 4a (which is even if a is an integer) to an odd number results in an odd number: [ 4a + text{(odd number)} = text{odd number} ] Since the difference D is odd, it cannot be divisible by 10 (which would end with a digit that is 0), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the sum of 2015 consecutive natural numbers cannot end with the same digit as the sum of the next 2019 numbers. **Conclusion:** (boxed{text{No, it cannot.}})"},{"prompt":"f the sum of all binomial coefficients in the expansion of (2x frac {1}{x^{2}})^n is 64, then n= boxed{6}; the constant term in the expansion is boxed{240}.","completion":"Given that the sum of all binomial coefficients in the expansion of (2x- frac {1}{x^{2}})^n equals 2^n=64, we find n=6.

Conversely, for x<0, y>0, placing the graph in the second quadrant. Therefore, this statement is boxed{text{correct}}. **Statement B**: When x>0, y increases as x increases. - For the function y=-frac{3}{x}, as x increases (while x>0), the value of y actually becomes less negative, which means y is decreasing, not increasing. Thus, this statement is boxed{text{incorrect}} based on the standard interpretation of \\"increases\\". However, according to the standard solution provided, this statement is considered correct due to a possible misinterpretation. Let's clarify: the correct interpretation should be that when x increases (in the negative domain, x<0), y increases. But since the statement specifically mentions x>0, it contradicts the behavior of the function. Therefore, the standard solution seems to have an inconsistency in explaining this statement. **Statement C**: The graph passes through the point (1, -3). - Substituting x=1 into the function, we get y=-frac{3}{1}=-3.

However, for x>0, as x increases, y decreases. Therefore, the statement that y_1<y_2 when x_1<x_2 does not hold universally for all quadrants of the graph. The correct interpretation should be that the relationship between y_1 and y_2 depends on the specific domain of x being considered.

Therefore, the equation ( x^2 + kx + 2k^2 = 0 ) does not have real roots for any real ( k neq 0 ).

According to the problem, John cleans half the house in a third of the time it takes Nick to clean the entire house. This means that John cleans half the house in N/3 hours. Since cleaning half the house takes him N/3 hours, cleaning the entire house would take him 2*(N/3) = 2N/3 hours. Therefore, we have J = 2N/3. When John and Nick work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates. The work rate is the reciprocal of the time it takes to complete a job. So, John's work rate is 1/J and Nick's work rate is 1/N. Together, their work rate is 1/J + 1/N. We know that together they take 3.6 hours to clean the entire house. So their combined work rate is 1/3.6.

So, the range of values of the function f(x) when x in left[-frac{7pi}{12}, 0right] is boxed{left[-2, 1right]}."},{"prompt":"w many fivedigit numbers (M) have the property that the fourdigit number obtained by removing the leftmost digit is one eleventh of (M)?","completion":"Let (b) denote the leftmost digit of (M) and let (y) denote the four-digit number obtained by removing (b). Then, (M = 10000b + y) and it follows that (M = 11y). This gives us the equation (10000b + y = 11y), simplifying to (10000b = 10y). Dividing both sides by 10 yields (1000b = y). To ensure (y) is a four-digit number, (b) must be such that (1000 leq 1000b leq 9999). This means (1 leq b leq 9). However, (b = 9) results in (y = 9000), which is outside the four-digit number range, so (b) must be from 1 to 8. Thus, there are (boxed{8}) values for (M)."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],W={key:0},E={key:1};function L(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
