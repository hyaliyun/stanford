Consider the restriction of g to the boundary of B³, which is the sphere S². Let h: S² → R³ be the continuous function defined by h(x) = g(x) for all x ∈ S². Since g is a bijection, h is also a bijection from S² to its image h(S²) ⊆ R³. Now, let's define a new continuous function f: S² → R² as follows. For each x ∈ S², let f(x) be the orthogonal projection of h(x) onto the plane R² (i.e., the plane formed by the first two coordinates in R³). Since h is continuous and the orthogonal projection is continuous, the composition f = projection ◦ h is also continuous. By the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, there exists a point x ∈ S² such that f(x) = f(-x). This means that the orthogonal projections of h(x) and h(-x) onto R² are the same.

Now, consider the line segment L connecting h(x) and h(-x) in R³. Since h is a bijection, L must be entirely contained in h(S²). Moreover, since h(x) and h(-x) have the same first two coordinates, L is parallel to the third coordinate axis. Recall that R³ has the separation property T₄ (also known as normality), which means that for any two disjoint closed sets A and B, there exist disjoint open sets U and V such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V. Let A = L and B = {h(x), h(-x)}. Since A and B are disjoint closed subsets of h(S²), there exist disjoint open sets U and V in R³ such that A ⊆ U and B ⊆ V. However, this contradicts the continuity of h. To see why, consider the open set W = h^(-1)(U) in S². Since h is continuous, W is an open set containing x and -x. But then h(W) is an open set containing h(x) and h(-x) that is disjoint from L, which contradicts the fact that L connects h(x) and h(-x).

Now, let's prove that if X is a Hausdorff topological space, then A and B being closed subsets of X with non-empty intersection implies that A ∩ B is also closed. Recall that a topological space X is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points x, y ∈ X, there exist disjoint open sets U, V ⊆ X such that x ∈ U and y ∈ V. Let x ∈ X - (A ∩ B). We want to show that there exists an open set U containing x such that U ⊆ X - (A ∩ B). Since x ∉ A ∩ B, either x ∉ A or x ∉ B. Without loss of generality, assume x ∉ A. Since A is closed, X - A is open, and x ∈ X - A. Now, for any y ∈ A ∩ B, we have y ∈ A and y ∈ B. Since X is Hausdorff, there exist disjoint open sets U_y and V_y such that x ∈ U_y and y ∈ V_y. Note that V_y ⊆ A, as A is closed and y ∈ A. Now, consider the open cover {V_y} of A ∩ B. Since A ∩ B is compact, there exists a finite subcover {V_y1, ..., V_yn} of A ∩ B. Let U = U_y1 ∩ ... ∩ U_yn. U is an open set containing x, as each U_yi is open and x ∈ U_yi for all i. We claim that U ⊆ X - (A ∩ B). Suppose there exists a point z ∈ U such that z ∈ A ∩ B. Then z ∈ V_yi for some i. But U and V_yi are disjoint by construction, which is a contradiction. Therefore, U ⊆ X - (A ∩ B). Since for every x ∈ X - (A ∩ B), there exists an open set U containing x such that U ⊆ X - (A ∩ B), it follows that X - (A ∩ B) is open. Thus, A ∩ B is closed."},{"prompt":"Let X={1/n : n is a positive integer} and Y={0} U X. Consider Y as a subspace of the real line R with usual metric. Is Y compact?

Now, consider the collection of open balls with radius ε/2 centered at points in X, i.e., {B(x, ε/2) : x ∈ X}. Since X is compact, there exists a finite subcover of this collection, say {B(x1, ε/2), B(x2, ε/2), ..., B(xm, ε/2)}. Now, let's show that the balls with radius δ centered at the same points cover X. Consider an arbitrary point y ∈ X. Since {B(x1, ε/2), B(x2, ε/2), ..., B(xm, ε/2)} is an open cover of X, there exists an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ m) such that y ∈ B(xi, ε/2). Then, the distance between y and xi is less than ε/2. Now, consider an arbitrary point z ∈ B(y, δ). The distance between z and xi is at most d(z, y) + d(y, xi) < δ + ε/2 < ε. Thus, the diameter of the set {y, z} is less than ε, and by the given condition, this set is contained in some Ui.

This subsequence is contained in the balls B(x_{i_1}, 1), B(x_{i_2}, 1/2), B(x_{i_3}, 1/3), ... . Since the radii of these balls converge to 0, the sequence (x_{n_k_k}) is a Cauchy sequence. Finally, since X is compact, it is also complete (every Cauchy sequence in X converges to a point in X).

We will show that x* = 1, which implies that [0,1] can be covered by a finite subcover of {U_i}. Since x* is the supremum of S, there exists a sequence {x_n} in S such that x_n → x* as n → ∞. For each x_n, there exists a finite subcover {U_i1, U_i2, ..., U_ik} of {U_i} that covers [0, x_n]. Now, since x* is a limit point of the sequence {x_n}, there exists an open set U_j in the open cover {U_i} such that x* ∈ U_j. Since U_j is an open set, there exists an ε > 0 such that the interval (x* - ε, x* + ε) is contained in U_j. Let N be an integer such that x_N > x* - ε. Then, x_N ∈ S, and there exists a finite subcover {U_i1, U_i2, ..., U_ik} of {U_i} that covers [0, x_N]. Now, consider the subcover {U_i1, U_i2, ..., U_ik, U_j}. This subcover covers [0, x_N] ∪ (x* - ε, x* + ε), and since x_N > x* - ε, it covers [0, x* + ε]. Since x* is the supremum of S, we have x* + ε > 1. Thus, [0,1] ⊆ [0, x* + ε], and the finite subcover {U_i1, U_i2, ..., U_ik, U_j} covers [0,1]. This shows that for any open cover {U_i} of [0,1], there exists a finite subcover, which proves that the set [0,1] is compact using the open cover definition of compactness."},{"prompt":"Consider the following set: S = {1/n : n ∈ N} Determine whether S is compact or not.","completion":"To determine if the set S is compact, we need to check if it is both closed and bounded.

Now, let's check if S is closed. A set is closed if it contains all its limit points. The limit point of a sequence is a point such that every neighborhood of the point contains infinitely many points of the sequence. Consider the sequence {1/n} as n approaches infinity. The limit of this sequence is 0, as 1/n → 0 when n → ∞. However, 0 is not an element of the set S, since n cannot be infinity in the natural numbers.

We can rewrite this term as: ((1-x)n)^n = (1 - (1-x)n)^n This term is in the form of (1 + a/n)^n, where a = -x(1-x)n. As n approaches infinity, this term converges to e^a, where e is the base of the natural logarithm: lim_{n -> ∞} (1 - (1-x)n)^n = e^{-x(1-x)n} Now, let's consider the term (x/(1-x)).

So, A is indeed bounded. Now, let's check if A is closed. A set is closed if its complement is open. The complement of A in ℚ is the set of all rational numbers that are not of the form 1/n for some natural number n.

For each point x in A, we can define an open ball B(x, 1) centered at x with radius 1. Since A is not bounded, there are infinitely many such open balls needed to cover A. Thus, we have an open cover {B(x, 1) | x ∈ A} of A. Since A is compact, there must exist a finite subcover of this open cover. Let {B(x1, 1), B(x2, 1), ..., B(xn, 1)} be a finite subcover of A. Now, let's consider the distance between any two points in A. Without loss of generality, let p and q be two points in A such that p ∈ B(xi, 1) and q ∈ B(xj, 1) for some 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. By the triangle inequality, we have: d(p, q) ≤ d(p, xi) + d(xi, xj) + d(xj, q) Since p ∈ B(xi, 1) and q ∈ B(xj, 1), we know that d(p, xi) < 1 and d(q, xj) < 1. Now, let R be the maximum distance between any two points in the finite set {x1, x2, ..., xn}. Then, we have: d(p, q) ≤ 1 + R + 1 Thus, the distance between any two points in A is bounded by 2 + R, which contradicts our assumption that A is not bounded. Therefore, our assumption must be false, and A must be bounded. This completes the proof that a compact set A in a metric space X is bounded."},{"prompt":"Consider the set A = {1/n : n ∈ ℕ}.

Now, let's find the largest integer N such that this condition holds. To do this, we need to find the maximum and minimum elements of A. Let a_min and a_max be the minimum and maximum elements of A, respectively. Since A is compact, it is bounded, so these values exist.

Without loss of generality, assume a < b. Then, there exists a point c ∈ (0,1) such that a < c < b. Since A and B are open, there exists an open interval around c that is contained in either A or B. However, this would imply that A and B are not disjoint, which is a contradiction. Therefore, (0,1) is connected.

For example, let A = {q ∈ Q ∩ [0,1] : q < π/4} and B = {q ∈ Q ∩ [0,1] : q > π/4}. Both A and B are open in the subspace topology, and their union is Q ∩ [0,1]. The connected components of Q ∩ [0,1] are the singletons {q} for each q ∈ [0,1] ∩ Q. This is because each singleton is connected (as it cannot be written as the union of two nonempty disjoint open sets), and any larger subset of Q ∩ [0,1] containing more than one point can be separated into two nonempty disjoint open sets, as shown above.

Now, let's consider the points x and y with d(x, y) = 3. We will construct a path in X connecting x and y with length at most 3.5. Let z be a point in X such that d(x, z) = M/2. Since X is connected, there exists a continuous path γ₁: [0, 1] → X connecting x and z, and a continuous path γ₂: [0, 1] → X connecting z and y. Let L₁ and L₂ be the lengths of the paths γ₁ and γ₂, respectively. Then, the length of the path γ₁ followed by γ₂, denoted by L, is given by L = L₁ + L₂. We have d(x, z) + d(z, y) ≤ L, since the shortest path between x and y through z is given by the sum of the distances d(x, z) and d(z, y). By the triangle inequality, we have d(x, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y), and thus 3 ≤ d(x, z) + d(z, y) ≤ L. Now, let's consider the case when M/2 < 1.5. Since d(x, z) = M/2, we have d(x, z) < 1.5. Similarly, d(z, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(x, y) < 1.5 + 3 = 4.5. Therefore, L = L₁ + L₂ < 1.5 + 4.5 = 6. However, we know that L ≥ 3, so we have 3 ≤ L < 6. Now, let's consider the case when M/2 ≥ 1.5. In this case, we have d(x, z) = M/2 ≥ 1.5. Since d(x, y) = 3, we have d(z, y) ≤ d(x, z) + d(x, y) ≤ M/2 + 3. Therefore, L = L₁ + L₂ ≤ M/2 + 3. Since M ≥ 3, we have M/2 ≥ 1.5, and thus L ≤ M/2 + 3 ≤ 1.5 + 3 = 4.5. However, we know that L ≥ 3, so we have 3 ≤ L ≤ 4.5. In both cases, we have 3 ≤ L < 6.

Similarly, since p(1) = y in V, we have 1 in p^{-1}(V). Now, we claim that p^{-1}(U) and p^{-1}(V) are disjoint. Suppose there exists t in p^{-1}(U) cap p^{-1}(V). Then, p(t) in U cap V, which contradicts the fact that U and V are disjoint. Therefore, p^{-1}(U) and p^{-1}(V) are disjoint. We have now shown that [0, 1] = p^{-1}(U) cup p^{-1}(V), where p^{-1}(U) and p^{-1}(V) are disjoint, non-empty open sets in [0, 1]. However, this contradicts the fact that [0, 1] is connected, as connected spaces cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint, non-empty open sets.

To do this, we need to show that for any two points in S, there exists a continuous path between them. Let A = (x1, y1) and B = (x2, y2) be two arbitrary points in S. Since both points lie on the unit circle, we have x1^2 + y1^2 = 1 and x2^2 + y2^2 = 1.

In other words, A = (cos(θ1), sin(θ1)) and B = (cos(θ2), sin(θ2)). The path γ(t) is continuous, as the functions cos(θ1 + t(θ2 - θ1)) and sin(θ1 + t(θ2 - θ1)) are continuous with respect to t.

Since f^(-1)({1}) and f^(-1)({3}) are disjoint, their union must be a proper subset of [0, 1]. But this contradicts the fact that the union of all open intervals containing 0 and 1 is [0, 1] itself.

The angle of f(theta) with respect to the center of S^1_2 is given by: phi(theta) = arctanleft(frac{sintheta}{2 - frac{1}{2}costheta - 1}right) Now, we compute the derivative of phi(theta) with respect to theta: frac{dphi}{dtheta} = frac{frac{1}{2}sintheta(2 - frac{1}{2}costheta - 1) - costhetasintheta}{(2 - frac{1}{2}costheta - 1)^2 + sin^2theta} Integrating this expression over the interval [0, 2pi] gives the total change in angle: Deltaphi = int_0^{2pi} frac{dphi}{dtheta} dtheta Computing this integral, we get: Deltaphi = 2pi Finally, we divide the total change in angle by 2pi to obtain the winding number: text{Winding number} = frac{Deltaphi}{2pi} = frac{2pi}{2pi} = 1 Thus, the homotopy class of the continuous function f:S^1_1 to S^1_2 is represented by the generator element 1 in mathbb{Z}."},{"prompt":"Consider the sphere S^2 and two paths gamma_0, gamma_1: [0,1] rightarrow S^2 given by: gamma_0(t) = cos(pi t) cdot begin{bmatrix} 1 0 0 end{bmatrix} + sin(pi t) cdot begin{bmatrix} 0 1 0 end{bmatrix} , and gamma_1(t) = cos(2pi t) cdot begin{bmatrix} 1 0 0 end{bmatrix} + sin(2pi t) cdot begin{bmatrix} 0 0 1 end{bmatrix} , Find the homotopy class of gamma_0 and gamma_1 in pi_1(S^2).","completion":"To find the homotopy class of gamma_0 and gamma_1 in pi_1(S^2), we need to determine whether these paths are homotopic in S^2.

Both paths start and end at the same point, which is the north pole of the sphere: gamma_0(0) = gamma_0(1) = begin{bmatrix} 1 0 0 end{bmatrix}, and gamma_1(0) = gamma_1(1) = begin{bmatrix} 1 0 0 end{bmatrix}. Now, let's find a homotopy between gamma_0 and gamma_1. A homotopy is a continuous deformation of one path into another, and it can be represented as a continuous function H: [0, 1] times [0, 1] rightarrow S^2 such that H(t, 0) = gamma_0(t) and H(t, 1) = gamma_1(t).

Since gamma_0 and gamma_1 are homotopic, they belong to the same homotopy class in pi_1(S^2).

The intersection of U and V is an annulus. The fundamental group of U is the same as the fundamental group of the torus since removing a small open disk does not change the homotopy type. The fundamental group of a torus is given by the direct product of two copies of the integers: π1(T^2) = Z × Z. The fundamental group of V is trivial since it is an open disk, which is contractible: π1(V) = {e}. The intersection U ∩ V is an annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle S^1.

Since π1(V) is trivial, the free product is just π1(U), which is the integers Z. However, we need to identify the elements of π1(U ∩ V) in π1(U). The attaching map wraps the circle around the perimeter of the disk exactly twice, so the generator of π1(U ∩ V) corresponds to the loop in π1(U) that goes around the circle twice. Therefore, we need to identify the element 2 in π1(U) with the identity. The result is the quotient group of the integers Z by the normal subgroup generated by 2, which is isomorphic to the integers modulo 2, Z/2Z.

Therefore, the preimage g^{-1}(y) consists of two points, say (1, theta_1, phi_0) and (1, theta_2, phi_0), where theta_1 = theta_0 - 2pi f(theta_0) and theta_2 = theta_1 + pi. The degree of g is then given by: deg(g) = text{sgn}(det(Dg_{(1, theta_1, phi_0)})) + text{sgn}(det(Dg_{(1, theta_2, phi_0)})) Since f(-x) = -f(x), we have f'(-x) = -f'(x), and thus: det(Dg_{(1, theta_1, phi_0)}) = 1 + 2pi f'(theta_0) det(Dg_{(1, theta_2, phi_0)}) = 1 - 2pi f'(theta_0) Therefore, the degree of g is: deg(g) = text{sgn}(1 + 2pi f'(theta_0)) + text{sgn}(1 - 2pi f'(theta_0)) Since f is continuous, there exists a point theta_0 such that f'(theta_0) = 0.

Now, let's determine whether there exists a covering map from X to Y. Since the fundamental groups of X and Y are both isomorphic to Z, there could potentially be a covering map between them. However, we need to consider the local structure of the spaces as well. A covering map from X to Y would locally look like a map from the octagon to the square that is a local homeomorphism. However, the octagon has eight-fold rotational symmetry, while the square has only four-fold rotational symmetry. This difference in local structure means that there cannot be a covering map from X to Y that is a local homeomorphism. In conclusion, the fundamental group of both X and Y is Z, but there does not exist a covering map from X to Y due to the difference in local structure."},{"prompt":"Let X be a torus with a square removed from its surface.

Both A and B are path-connected, and their intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected. Now, we can compute the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B. 1. The fundamental group of A, denoted π₁(A): Since A is a torus with a small disk removed, it is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of two circles, S¹ ∨ S¹. Thus, the fundamental group of A is the free group on two generators, say a and b. So, π₁(A) ≅ ⟨a, b⟩. 2. The fundamental group of B, denoted π₁(B): B is an open neighborhood of the removed square, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle S¹.

Let's take U to be the unit circle S¹ with a small open neighborhood around point A removed, and V to be the unit circle S¹ with a small open neighborhood around point B removed. Then, U and V are both open and path-connected, and their intersection U ∩ V is the unit circle S¹ with small open neighborhoods around both A and B removed, which is also path-connected. Now, we can compute the fundamental groups of U, V, and U ∩ V. Since U and V are both homotopy equivalent to the unit circle S¹ with a single point removed, their fundamental groups are both isomorphic to the free group on one generator, i.e., π₁(U) ≅ π₁(V) ≅ ℤ.

Continuity of p: Since p is a covering map, it is continuous by definition. 2. Bijectiveness of p: Since X is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected, and Y is path-connected and simply connected, we can apply the lifting criterion for covering spaces. Given any continuous map f: Z -> X, where Z is a simply connected and locally path-connected space, there exists a unique lift f': Z -> Y such that p ∘ f' = f. In our case, let Z = X and f = id_X (the identity map on X). Then, there exists a unique lift id_Y: X -> Y such that p ∘ id_Y = id_X. This implies that p is surjective. Now, let x1, x2 ∈ X be such that p(x1) = p(x2). Since X is path-connected, there exists a path α: [0, 1] -> X with α(0) = x1 and α(1) = x2. Since Y is simply connected, the fundamental group π_1(Y) is trivial. Therefore, the induced homomorphism p_*: π_1(Y) -> π_1(X) is the trivial homomorphism. By the lifting criterion, there exists a unique path β: [0, 1] -> Y such that p ∘ β = α and β(0) = x1. Since p(β(0)) = p(β(1)), we have x1 = x2. This implies that p is injective. Since p is both surjective and injective, it is bijective. 3. Continuity of the inverse of p: Let p^(-1): X -> Y be the inverse of p. Since p is a covering map, for each x ∈ X, there exists an open neighborhood U ⊆ X such that p^(-1)(U) is a disjoint union of open sets in Y, each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto U by p. This implies that p^(-1) is continuous on each U. Since X is covered by such open sets U, p^(-1) is continuous on X. Since p is continuous, bijective, and has a continuous inverse, p is a homeomorphism.

This implies that (Y_1, p_1) and (Y_2, p_2) are isomorphic as covering spaces, and the correspondence is injective. Surjectivity: Given any subgroup H of π_1(X), we can construct a covering space (Y_H, p_H) as described above. By construction, p_(H*)(π_1(Y_H)) = H, and the correspondence is surjective.

First, let's construct a covering space of S^1 with k sheets. Consider the map p: ℝ → S^1 defined by p(t) = e^(2πit), where t is a real number. This map is a universal covering map, and ℝ is the universal covering space of S^1. Now, let's define an equivalence relation on ℝ by saying that t1 ~ t2 if and only if t1 - t2 is an integer multiple of k. We can then form the quotient space ℝ/~, which is a covering space of S^1 with k sheets. Now, let's consider the composition of maps g: X → ℝ/~ → S^1, where the first map is the quotient map and the second map is the covering map. Since f: X → S^1 is given to be a continuous map with the inverse image of each point on S^1 consisting of exactly k points, we can lift f to a map f': X → ℝ/~ such that g = f' * p. Now, we will use the lifting criterion for covering spaces. Let x0 be a point in X, and let x1, x2, ..., xk be the k points in the inverse image of f(x0). Then, the induced homomorphism f_*: π_1(X, x0) → π_1(S^1, f(x0)) is surjective, since f is onto. Furthermore, the kernel of f_* is the image of the induced homomorphism (f')_*: π_1(X, x0) → π_1(ℝ/~, f'(x0)). Since ℝ/~ is a covering space of S^1 with k sheets, the fundamental group of ℝ/~ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order k, denoted by Z_k. By the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, we have that π_1(X, x0) / ker(f_*) ≅ im(f_*). Since f_* is surjective, im(f_*) = π_1(S^1, f(x0)), and ker(f_*) = im((f')_*). Therefore, we have π_1(X, x0) / im((f')_*) ≅ π_1(S^1, f(x0)). Since π_1(S^1, f(x0)) is isomorphic to Z (the integers), and im((f')_*) is isomorphic to Z_k, we have π_1(X, x0) / Z_k ≅ Z. This implies that the fundamental group of X, π_1(X, x0), is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order k, as desired."},{"prompt":"Suppose you have a torus, which is a surface with no boundary formed by identifying the opposite edges of a rectangle. Let S be the circle that goes around the hole in the torus. Calculate the fundamental group of the torus with respect to the basepoint on the circle S.","completion":"To calculate the fundamental group of the torus with respect to the basepoint on the circle S, we can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The theorem states that if a topological space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets A and B, both containing the basepoint, and their intersection A ∩ B is also path-connected, then the fundamental group of X can be obtained from the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B. Let's consider the torus T as the union of two open sets A and B, where A is the torus with a small open disk removed around the basepoint on the circle S, and B is an open tubular neighborhood of the circle S. Both A and B are path-connected and contain the basepoint. Their intersection A ∩ B is an annulus, which is also path-connected. Now, we can compute the fundamental groups of A, B, and A ∩ B: 1. The space A is homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of two circles, which can be seen by collapsing the two non-contractible loops on the torus (one going around the hole and the other going around the \\"tube\\") to points. Therefore, the fundamental group of A is the free group on two generators, say π₁(A) = ⟨a, b⟩. 2. The space B is homotopy equivalent to a circle, as it is an open tubular neighborhood of the circle S. Therefore, the fundamental group of B is the infinite cyclic group, say π₁(B) = ⟨c⟩. 3. The space A ∩ B is an annulus, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle. Therefore, the fundamental group of A ∩ B is the infinite cyclic group, say π₁(A ∩ B) = ⟨d⟩. Now, we can apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. The fundamental group of the torus T, denoted by π₁(T), is the free product of π₁(A) and π₁(B) with the normal subgroup generated by the relation d = c, as d is the image of c under the homomorphism induced by the inclusion of A ∩ B into A. Thus, π₁(T) = ⟨a, b⟩ * ⟨c⟩ / ⟨d = c⟩ = ⟨a, b, c | d = c⟩. Since d and c are both generators of infinite cyclic groups, we can replace d with c in the presentation of the fundamental group. Therefore, the fundamental group of the torus T with respect to the basepoint on the circle S is: π₁(T) = ⟨a, b, c | c = c⟩ = ⟨a, b, c⟩.

We can use the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which states that if a space X can be written as the union of two open, path-connected sets A and B, with path-connected intersection A ∩ B, then the fundamental group of X, denoted by π_1(X), can be computed as the free product of the fundamental groups of A and B, with an amalgamation over their intersection, i.e., π_1(X) = π_1(A) * π_1(B) / N, where N is the normal subgroup generated by the elements of π_1(A ∩ B). Let A be an open disk centered at the identified point (1 = -1) in X, and let B be the complement of a small closed disk centered at the identified point in X. Then, A is contractible, so its fundamental group is trivial, i.e., π_1(A) = {1}. B is homotopy equivalent to the circle S^1, so its fundamental group is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., π_1(B) ≅ ℤ. Since A ∩ B is an open annulus, it is also homotopy equivalent to the circle S^1, so its fundamental group is isomorphic to the integers, i.e., π_1(A ∩ B) ≅ ℤ. The inclusion maps of A ∩ B into A and B induce homomorphisms i_A*: π_1(A ∩ B) → π_1(A) and i_B*: π_1(A ∩ B) → π_1(B). Since π_1(A) is trivial, i_A* is the trivial homomorphism, and since A ∩ B and B are homotopy equivalent, i_B* is an isomorphism. Now, by the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, we have π_1(X) = π_1(A) * π_1(B) / N, where N is the normal subgroup generated by the elements of the form i_A*(g) * i_B*(g)^(-1) for g in π_1(A ∩ B). Since i_A*(g) = 1 for all g in π_1(A ∩ B), we have N = {1}, and thus π_1(X) = π_1(A) * π_1(B) / {1} ≅ ℤ.

To see this, consider a radial deformation retraction that pushes every point on the unit circle (except (0,1)) towards the origin along the radial line connecting the point to the origin. The point (0,1) is not affected by this deformation retraction, so the resulting space is the punctured plane. Now, we can compute the fundamental group of the punctured plane. The punctured plane is an open subset of the plane, so it is path-connected. Let x_0 be a base point in the punctured plane, and let gamma be a loop in the punctured plane based at x_0. We can homotope gamma to a loop that avoids a small neighborhood of the origin. Then, we can further homotope this loop to a loop that lies entirely in the punctured plane minus a small disk centered at the origin. Now, consider the map f: mathbb{R}^2 setminus {0} to S^1 given by f(x) = frac{x}{|x|}. This map is continuous and maps the punctured plane minus a small disk centered at the origin to the unit circle minus a small arc around (0,1). The map f sends the homotoped loop to a loop in the unit circle minus a small arc around (0,1), which is homotopy equivalent to the original space. Since the fundamental group of the unit circle is mathbb{Z}, the fundamental group of the punctured plane is also mathbb{Z}. Therefore, the fundamental group of the space formed by taking the unit circle S^1 in the plane and removing the point (0,1) is mathbb{Z}."},{"prompt":"Let X be a path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected topological space.

Let x ∈ X and let F = p^(-1)(x) be the fiber over x, which has exactly 3 elements. We want to compute the fundamental group π_1(X, x). By the lifting criterion for covering spaces, given any loop f: [0, 1] → X based at x, there exists a unique lift ĝ: [0, 1] → E of f if and only if f_*(π_1([0, 1], 0)) ⊆ p_*(π_1(E, ĝ(0))). Since E is simply connected, its fundamental group is trivial, and thus p_*(π_1(E, ĝ(0))) = {e}. This means that there exists a unique lift ĝ of f if and only if f is null-homotopic. Now, consider the action of the fundamental group π_1(X, x) on the fiber F. Since X is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected, the action of π_1(X, x) on F is transitive. This means that for any two points y, z ∈ F, there exists an element g ∈ π_1(X, x) such that g.y = z. Since the fiber F has exactly 3 elements, the action of π_1(X, x) on F partitions π_1(X, x) into 3 cosets. Let G be the stabilizer of a point y ∈ F, i.e., G = {g ∈ π_1(X, x) | g.y = y}. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, we have |π_1(X, x)| = |G| * 3. Now, we claim that G is isomorphic to π_1(X, x). To see this, consider the restriction of the covering map p to the connected component of E containing y, say p': E' → X. Since E' is also simply connected, the same argument as before shows that the action of G on the fiber p'^(-1)(x) is transitive. Moreover, since the action of π_1(X, x) on F is transitive, it follows that p'^(-1)(x) = F. Therefore, the action of G on F is free, and we have a bijection between G and π_1(X, x) given by the action on F. Thus, we have |π_1(X, x)| = |G| * 3, and since G is isomorphic to π_1(X, x), we have |π_1(X, x)| = |π_1(X, x)| * 3. This implies that |π_1(X, x)| = 3. Since X is path-connected, locally path-connected, and semi-locally simply connected, the fundamental group π_1(X, x) must be a discrete group with 3 elements.

Let's consider the vertex of the square X, which we will call x0, and its preimage p^(-1)(x0) in Y. Since p(y0) = x0, we know that y0 is an element of p^(-1)(x0). Let's denote the fiber p^(-1)(x0) as {y0, y1, ..., yn}, where n is the number of sheets in the covering. Now, let's consider the lifting correspondence between the subgroups of π₁(Y, y0) and the subgroups of π₁(X, x0) that contain p_*(π₁(Y, y0)), where p_* is the induced homomorphism of the covering map p. Since π₁(X, x0) is isomorphic to Z/2Z, it has only two subgroups: the trivial group {1} and itself, Z/2Z. If p_*(π₁(Y, y0)) is the trivial group {1}, then π₁(Y, y0) would be isomorphic to π₁(X, x0), which is Z/2Z. However, this would imply that the covering map p is a homeomorphism, and Y and X would be homeomorphic spaces. This contradicts the fact that Y is a covering space of X, and they are not homeomorphic. Therefore, p_*(π₁(Y, y0)) must be equal to π₁(X, x0), which is isomorphic to Z/2Z. Since p_*(π₁(Y, y0)) is a normal subgroup of π₁(Y, y0), we can use the following isomorphism theorem: π₁(Y, y0) / p_*(π₁(Y, y0)) ≅ π₁(X, x0) Since p_*(π₁(Y, y0)) ≅ Z/2Z, we have: π₁(Y, y0) / (Z/2Z) ≅ Z/2Z Now, we need to determine the group π₁(Y, y0) that satisfies this isomorphism.

Now, we can define a homomorphism Φ: π₁(X, p) → ℤ as follows: Φ([f]) = θ(1) - θ(0), where [f] denotes the homotopy class of the loop f. It is easy to see that Φ is well-defined, as if two loops f and g are homotopic, then their corresponding functions θ_f and θ_g must also be homotopic, and hence Φ([f]) = Φ([g]).

In this case, the sum of the degrees of the 5 vertices is 2 * 9 = 18. Now, let's consider the number of triangles in K. Each triangle contributes 3 edges to the total count of edges. However, since K is a simplicial complex, any two triangles that share an edge must also share a vertex. Therefore, each shared edge is counted twice in the total count of edges. Let t be the number of triangles in K. Then, the total number of edges in K can be expressed as 3t - s, where s is the number of shared edges between triangles. Since the sum of the degrees of the vertices is 18, we have: 18 = 3t - s We want to minimize the number of triangles, so we want to minimize t.

Let's label the vertices of the octagon as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H in clockwise order. We can choose vertex A as our starting point and draw diagonals AC, AD, AE, AF, and AG. This will divide the octagon into 5 smaller triangles: ΔABC, ΔACD, ΔADE, ΔAEF, and ΔAFG. Now, we need to find the area of the regular octagon and the area of each of these triangles to show that their sum is equal to the area of the octagon. The area of a regular octagon with side length s can be calculated using the formula: Area = 2 * s^2 * (1 + √2) In our case, s = 3, so the area of the octagon is: Area = 2 * 3^2 * (1 + √2) = 18 * (1 + √2) Now, let's find the area of each triangle. Since the octagon is regular, the interior angles are equal and can be calculated as: Interior angle = (n - 2) * 180° / n = (8 - 2) * 180° / 8 = 135° The triangles ΔABC, ΔACD, ΔADE, ΔAEF, and ΔAFG are isosceles triangles with a base of 3 and an angle of 135° between the equal sides. We can find the height of these triangles using the formula: Height = side * sin(θ/2) where side is the length of the equal sides and θ is the angle between them.

Let's consider a simplex σ of dimension k in the triangulation T. When we perform the barycentric subdivision, we obtain k+1 smaller simplices, each of dimension k. Therefore, for each simplex in T, we get at most twice the number of simplices in the subdivision S. Since there are n simplices in T, there are at most 2n simplices in S. Now, let's show that the subdivision S satisfies V = E + n. To do this, we will use Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states that for any connected planar graph, the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) are related by the equation: V - E + F = 2 In our case, the graph is the 1-skeleton of the subdivision S, which is the graph formed by the vertices and edges of S. The faces of this graph correspond to the 2-dimensional simplices in S. Since S is a subdivision of T, the number of vertices V in S is equal to the number of vertices in T plus the number of barycenters of the simplices in T. Since there are n simplices in T, we have: V = V_T + n The number of edges E in S is equal to the number of edges in T plus the number of edges connecting the barycenters to the vertices of the simplices in T.

A cube has 8 vertices and 12 edges. To find the minimum number of edges required for a triangulation, we need to determine the minimum number of tetrahedra needed to fill the cube. We can fill the cube with 5 tetrahedra, and this is the minimum number of tetrahedra needed. To see this, consider the following process: 1. Divide the cube into two equal halves by cutting it along a plane parallel to two opposite faces. Each half is a triangular prism with 6 vertices, 9 edges, and 5 faces. 2. Each triangular prism can be divided into 3 tetrahedra by connecting one of the vertices of the triangular base to the other two vertices of the opposite triangular face. So, we have 5 tetrahedra in total. Now, let's count the number of edges required for this triangulation. Each tetrahedron has 6 edges. Since we have 5 tetrahedra, we might think that we need 5 * 6 = 30 edges. However, some of the edges are shared between adjacent tetrahedra. In our construction, each of the 9 edges of the triangular prisms is shared by 2 tetrahedra, so we need to subtract these shared edges to avoid counting them twice.

The same logic applies, and three triangles must meet at this vertex as well, each with an angle of 60 degrees.

If det(H) > 0 and ∂²f/∂x² < 0, the point is a local maximum. If det(H) < 0, the point is a saddle point.

Similarly, if y = 0, we have the points (pm 1, 0, 0). These are the six points on the coordinate axes. Now, let's consider the case when x, y, z neq 0.

We can rewrite this equation as: z^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 1 Since z^2 is non-negative, we have that x^2 + y^2 - 1 ≥ 0, which implies x^2 + y^2 ≥ 1.

This parameterization is smooth and covers the entire surface S. Moreover, the Jacobian matrix of φ has full rank 2, which implies that φ is a local diffeomorphism.

Now, let's analyze the possible closed 2-dimensional manifolds and their properties: - Sphere (S^2): The Euler characteristic of a sphere is χ(S^2) = 2, and its fundamental group is trivial (π_1(S^2) = {e}). This does not match the given fundamental group, so M is not a sphere. - Torus (T^2): The Euler characteristic of a torus is χ(T^2) = 0, and its fundamental group is π_1(T^2) = Z × Z, where Z is the group of integers. This does not match the given Euler characteristic or fundamental group, so M is not a torus. - Klein bottle (K): The Euler characteristic of a Klein bottle is χ(K) = 0, and its fundamental group is π_1(K) = Z × Z_2, where Z_2 is the group of integers modulo 2. This does not match the given Euler characteristic or fundamental group, so M is not a Klein bottle. - Real projective plane (RP^2): The Euler characteristic of the real projective plane is χ(RP^2) = 1, and its fundamental group is π_1(RP^2) = Z_2. This does not match the given Euler characteristic or fundamental group, so M is not a real projective plane. Since M is a closed 2-dimensional manifold, it must be a connected sum of some of the above manifolds. The only possibility left is that M is a connected sum of two real projective planes, denoted as M = RP^2 # RP^2. This is because the connected sum of two real projective planes has the same Euler characteristic as M (χ(M) = 2) and the same fundamental group as M (π_1(M) = D_8). Therefore, the manifold M is up to homeomorphism the connected sum of two real projective planes, M = RP^2 # RP^2."},{"prompt":"Consider a surface with genus 2.

For a surface with genus g, the Euler characteristic is given by: χ = 2 - 2g Since we have a surface with genus 2, the Euler characteristic is: χ = 2 - 2(2) = -2 Now, let's consider a regular polyhedral decomposition of this surface. Suppose that each face has p sides (or edges) and each vertex has q edges. Then, by the definition of a regular polyhedron, we have: E = (1/2)pF (since each edge is shared by two faces) E = qV (since each vertex is shared by q edges) Now, we can use the Euler characteristic formula: -2 = V - E + F Substituting the expressions for E: -2 = V - (1/2)pF + F -2 = V - qV + (1/2)pF Now, we can solve for F in terms of V: F = (2 + (q - (1/2)p)V) / ((1/2)p) Since F, V, p, and q are all integers (as they represent the number of faces, vertices, and edges), we can look for integer solutions that satisfy the equation. One possible solution is: p = 4 (each face is a quadrilateral) q = 4 (each vertex has 4 edges) With these values, we have: F = (2 + (4 - (1/2)(4))V) / ((1/2)(4)) F = V Now, substituting this back into the Euler characteristic formula: -2 = V - E + V -2 = 2V - E Since E = qV, we have: -2 = 2V - 4V 2V = 4 V = 2 Now, we can find the number of faces: F = V = 2 And the number of edges: E = qV = 4(2) = 8 So, a regular polyhedral decomposition of a surface with genus 2 has 2 vertices, 8 edges, and 2 faces."},{"prompt":"Consider a compact 2-dimensional manifold M, which is homeomorphic to a sphere.

Let's denote the boundary of this hole as partial M. Since f:Mrightarrow S^1 is a continuous function that is not null-homotopic, we know that the restriction of f to the boundary, f|_{partial M}:partial Mrightarrow S^1, is also not null-homotopic. Now, consider the winding number of f|_{partial M}, which is a topological invariant that counts the number of times the curve f|_{partial M} winds around the origin in the complex plane. Since f|_{partial M} is not null-homotopic, its winding number must be non-zero. Let's denote the winding number as n neq 0. Next, we extend the function f to the whole sphere by filling in the hole with a disk. We can do this by defining a new function g:Mcup Drightarrow S^1, where D is a disk that fills the hole, such that g|_M = f and g|_D is a continuous extension. We can define this extension as follows: g(x) = begin{cases} f(x) & text{if } x in M e^{2pi i n frac{d(x)}{r}} & text{if } x in D end{cases} Here, d(x) is the distance from x to the center of the disk D, and r is the radius of the disk. This extension is continuous and maps the boundary of the disk to a circle in S^1 with winding number n. Now, consider the preimage of a point p in S^1 under the function g. Since g is continuous, the preimage g^{-1}(p) is a closed set in the sphere. Moreover, since the sphere is connected, the preimage must be non-empty. Let x_0 in g^{-1}(p) be a point in the preimage. We claim that there must be at least two points in the preimage g^{-1}(p). Suppose, for contradiction, that there is only one point x_0. Then, we can find a small neighborhood U of x_0 such that g(U) is a small loop around p in S^1. However, this would mean that the winding number of g|_{partial M} is zero, which contradicts our assumption that it is non-zero. Therefore, there must be at least two points in the preimage g^{-1}(p). Since g is an extension of f, these points must also be in the preimage of f, i.e., f^{-1}(p).

The first homology group of a lens space L(p, q) is given by H_1(L(p, q); Z) ≅ Z/pZ. Now, let's consider the connected sum of two lens spaces, L(p_1, q_1) # L(p_2, q_2). Recall that the connected sum operation consists of removing a small 3-ball from each manifold and gluing the resulting boundaries together. The homology groups of the connected sum can be computed using Mayer-Vietoris sequence.

The Euler characteristic of a compact manifold is given by the alternating sum of its Betti numbers: chi(M) = sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i b_i. 2. The first Betti number b_1 is the rank of the abelianization of the fundamental group of the manifold: b_1 = text{rank}(pi_1(M)^{text{ab}}). First, let's compute the abelianization of the fundamental group pi_1(M) cong mathbb{Z}_3 times mathbb{Z}_4. Since this group is already abelian, its abelianization is itself: pi_1(M)^{text{ab}} cong mathbb{Z}_3 times mathbb{Z}_4. The rank of this group is the number of free abelian summands, which is 2 (one for each of the factors mathbb{Z}_3 and mathbb{Z}_4). Thus, we have b_1 = 2. Now, let's consider the Euler characteristic formula. Since chi(M) = 3n+2, we have: 3n+2 = sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i b_i. We know that b_1 = 2. Since M is a compact manifold, all other odd-indexed Betti numbers must be zero, as the homology groups of a compact manifold are finitely generated. Therefore, we have: 3n+2 = b_0 - 2 + sum_{i=2}^n (-1)^i b_i. Since b_0 = 1 for a connected manifold (which M must be, since its fundamental group is nontrivial), we get: 3n+1 = sum_{i=2}^n (-1)^i b_i. Now, we can use the fact that the Euler characteristic is an alternating sum of Betti numbers. If n is odd, then the sum on the right-hand side of the equation above will be negative, which is a contradiction since 3n+1 is positive for any positive integer n. Therefore, n must be even. Let n = 2k for some integer k. Then we have: 6k+1 = sum_{i=2}^{2k} (-1)^i b_i = sum_{i=1}^k b_{2i}. Since all Betti numbers are nonnegative, the sum on the right-hand side is at least k. Thus, we have 6k+1 geq k, which implies k leq frac{1}{5}. Since k is a positive integer, the only possibility is k = 1.

This means that for every point p in M, there exists an open neighborhood U of p and a homeomorphism h: U -> V, where V is an open subset of R^3. Since M is non-compact, it is not bounded. This means that there exists a sequence of points {p_n} in M such that the distance between p_n and p_m goes to infinity as n and m go to infinity. We can use this sequence to construct a straight line that goes to infinity in all directions. Consider the sequence of points {q_n} in R^3, where q_n = (n, 0, 0) for all n in the set of natural numbers. Define a map f: M -> R^3 as follows: for each point p in M, let f(p) = h(p) if p is in the domain of h, and f(p) = q_n if p = p_n for some n. This map is well-defined since the sequence {p_n} converges to infinity in M and the sequence {q_n} converges to infinity in R^3. We claim that f is a homeomorphism between M and R^3.

Then f(U) is an open neighborhood of q_n in R^3, and f(U) contains V. Next, we show that f is a bijection. Since f is defined on all points of M and R^3, it is surjective. To show that f is injective, suppose that f(p) = f(q) for some points p and q in M. If p and q are both in the domain of h, then h(p) = h(q), so p = q.

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that both λ₁ < 0 and λ₂ < 0. Then, there exists a neighborhood U of p in M such that for all x ∈ U, the Hessian matrix H(f)(x) has negative eigenvalues. This implies that f is locally concave at p. Now, let's consider the Taylor expansion of f around p: f(x) = f(p) + ⟨∇f(p), x - p⟩ + 1/2 (x - p)ᵀ H(f)(p) (x - p) + o(‖x - p‖²). Since f(p) = 0, ∇f(p) = 0, and H(f)(p) is negative definite, we have f(x) < 0 for all x ∈ U, x ≠ p. This contradicts the fact that p is in A, since A is the set of points where f(x) = 0. Therefore, our assumption that both λ₁ < 0 and λ₂ < 0 must be false.

A smooth atlas is a collection of charts (homeomorphisms) that cover the entire space, and the transition maps between these charts are smooth (infinitely differentiable). First, we show that X is a topological space. The set X is a closed subset of the Euclidean plane R^2 since it is the set of all points (x, y) satisfying the inequality x^2 + y^2 ≤ 1, which includes the boundary of the unit circle. The Euclidean plane R^2 is a topological space, and closed subsets of topological spaces are also topological spaces when equipped with the subspace topology. Therefore, X is a topological space.

The transition maps are given by φj ◦ φi^(-1), where i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} and i ≠ j. For example, the transition map between φ1 and φ2 is given by: φ2 ◦ φ1^(-1)(x, y) = φ2(x, y) = (-x, y) This transition map is smooth since it is a linear function.

Now, let's find the inflection points. Inflection points occur where the second derivative is equal to zero or is undefined: 6x - 6 = 0 x = 1 So, there is an inflection point at x = 1. Finally, we need to determine whether f(x) is a smooth function. A function is smooth if it has continuous derivatives of all orders. Since f(x) is a polynomial function, it has continuous derivatives of all orders, so it is a smooth function. In summary, f(x) has a local maximum at x = 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, a local minimum at x = 1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, an inflection point at x = 1, and is a smooth function."},{"prompt":"Let M be a smooth manifold of dimension 3. If the tangent bundle TM is diffeomorphic to the trivial bundle R³ × R³, show that M is diffeomorphic to R³.","completion":"To show that M is diffeomorphic to R³, we will use the fact that the tangent bundle TM is diffeomorphic to the trivial bundle R³ × R³. First, let's recall some definitions: 1. A smooth manifold M is a topological space that locally looks like R^n, where n is the dimension of the manifold. 2. The tangent bundle TM of a smooth manifold M is the disjoint union of the tangent spaces T_pM at each point p in M. It is a smooth manifold of dimension 2n. 3. A diffeomorphism is a smooth bijection between two smooth manifolds with a smooth inverse. Now, let's proceed with the proof: Since TM is diffeomorphic to R³ × R³, there exists a diffeomorphism φ: TM → R³ × R³. We can think of φ as a pair of smooth maps (φ₁, φ₂): TM → R³ × R³, where φ₁: TM → R³ is the projection onto the first factor and φ₂: TM → R³ is the projection onto the second factor. Now, consider the map π: TM → M, which is the projection onto the base manifold M. Since TM is diffeomorphic to R³ × R³, the map π is a smooth surjective submersion. This means that for each point p in M, there exists a neighborhood U ⊆ M and a diffeomorphism ψ: π^(-1)(U) → U × R³ such that π = pr₁ ∘ ψ, where pr₁: U × R³ → U is the projection onto the first factor. Now, let's define a map Φ: M → R³ as follows: Φ(p) = φ₂(ψ^(-1)(p, 0)) This map is well-defined because ψ^(-1)(p, 0) is a point in the fiber π^(-1)(p) ⊆ TM, and φ₂ maps TM to R³. Moreover, Φ is smooth because it is the composition of smooth maps. We claim that Φ is a diffeomorphism. To show this, we need to prove that Φ is a smooth bijection with a smooth inverse. 1. Φ is a smooth bijection: Since φ is a diffeomorphism, φ₁ is a smooth bijection between M and R³. Moreover, since π is a smooth surjective submersion, there exists a smooth section σ: M → TM such that π ∘ σ = id_M. Then, Φ = φ₂ ∘ σ is a smooth bijection between M and R³. 2. Φ has a smooth inverse: Let Φ^(-1): R³ → M be defined as follows: Φ^(-1)(x) = π(ψ(p, x)) This map is well-defined because ψ(p, x) is a point in the fiber π^(-1)(p) ⊆ TM, and π maps TM to M. Moreover, Φ^(-1) is smooth because it is the composition of smooth maps. Now, we need to show that Φ ∘ Φ^(-1) = id_R³ and Φ^(-1) ∘ Φ = id_M. For any x ∈ R³, we have: Φ(Φ^(-1)(x)) = φ₂(ψ^(-1)(π(ψ(p, x)), 0)) = φ₂(ψ^(-1)(p, 0)) = x For any p ∈ M, we have: Φ^(-1)(Φ(p)) = π(ψ(p, φ₂(ψ^(-1)(p, 0)))) = π(ψ(p, 0)) = p Thus, Φ is a diffeomorphism between M and R³, which completes the proof."},{"prompt":"Let M be the set of all smooth functions from mathbb{R} to mathbb{R}.

We want to show that it is always possible to define a smooth structure on X so that U and V are both smoothly embedded submanifolds of X. First, let's recall the definition of a smooth structure. A smooth structure on a topological space X is a maximal smooth atlas, which is a collection of charts (homeomorphisms from open subsets of X to open subsets of R^n) that are smoothly compatible with each other. Smoothly compatible means that the transition maps (compositions of charts) are smooth functions. Now, let's construct a smooth structure on X. Since U and V are open sets in X, we can define charts φ: U → R^n and ψ: V → R^n, where φ and ψ are homeomorphisms. We can choose these charts such that their transition maps are smooth functions. In other words, we want the compositions φ^(-1) ◦ ψ and ψ^(-1) ◦ φ to be smooth functions. Consider the intersection U ∩ V. Since U and V are open sets, their intersection is also an open set. We can define a chart on U ∩ V as the restriction of φ to U ∩ V, denoted by φ|_(U ∩ V). Similarly, we can define a chart on U ∩ V as the restriction of ψ to U ∩ V, denoted by ψ|_(U ∩ V). Now, let's check the smooth compatibility of these charts. The transition maps are given by: 1. (φ|_(U ∩ V))^(-1) ◦ ψ|_(U ∩ V) = φ^(-1) ◦ ψ, which is smooth by our choice of φ and ψ. 2. (ψ|_(U ∩ V))^(-1) ◦ φ|_(U ∩ V) = ψ^(-1) ◦ φ, which is also smooth by our choice of φ and ψ. Since the transition maps are smooth, the charts φ|_(U ∩ V) and ψ|_(U ∩ V) are smoothly compatible. We can then extend these charts to a maximal smooth atlas on X, which defines a smooth structure on X. Finally, we need to show that U and V are smoothly embedded submanifolds of X. Since U and V are open sets in X, they are also submanifolds of X. Moreover, the charts φ and ψ are smoothly compatible, which means that U and V are smoothly embedded submanifolds of X.

Let p = (x_0, f(x_0)) in N for some x_0 in M. Since M is a smooth manifold of dimension n, there exists a smooth chart (V, psi) around x_0 in M such that psi(V) is an open subset of mathbb{R}^n. Define a map Phi: V times mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R}^{n+1} by Phi(x, t) = (x, f(x) + t). Note that Phi is smooth since f is smooth. Now, we claim that Phi is a diffeomorphism from an open neighborhood U of (x_0, 0) in V times mathbb{R} onto an open neighborhood of p in mathbb{R}^{n+1}. To see this, we first show that Phi is injective. Suppose Phi(x_1, t_1) = Phi(x_2, t_2). Then (x_1, f(x_1) + t_1) = (x_2, f(x_2) + t_2), which implies x_1 = x_2 and f(x_1) + t_1 = f(x_2) + t_2. Since f is a function, f(x_1) = f(x_2), and thus t_1 = t_2. Therefore, Phi is injective. Next, we show that the differential of Phi at each point is invertible. The differential of Phi is given by the matrix DPhi(x, t) = begin{pmatrix} I_n & Df(x) 0 & 1 end{pmatrix}, where I_n is the n times n identity matrix and Df(x) is the gradient of f at x. The determinant of this matrix is 1, which is nonzero, so DPhi(x, t) is invertible for all (x, t) in V times mathbb{R}. Since Phi is injective and its differential is invertible, it follows that Phi is a local diffeomorphism. Thus, there exists an open neighborhood U of (x_0, 0) in V times mathbb{R} such that Phi is a diffeomorphism from U onto an open neighborhood of p in mathbb{R}^{n+1}. Now, consider the set Phi(U cap (V times {0})). Since Phi(x, 0) = (x, f(x)) for all x in V, we have Phi(U cap (V times {0})) = U cap N.

The Chern classes are elements of the cohomology ring H^*(M; mathbb{Z}), and they satisfy the following properties: 1. c_0(E) = 1. 2. c(E oplus F) = c(E) cdot c(F) for any two vector bundles E and F. 3. If E is a line bundle, then c_1(E) generates the cohomology group H^2(M; mathbb{Z}). Now, let's consider the sphere S^2.

Since E has rank 3, we can write the total Chern class as: c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E) + c_3(E). However, since E is a rank 3 vector bundle over S^2, we know that c_i(E) = 0 for i > 2.

Since E is a rank 3 vector bundle, we can write it as a direct sum of three line bundles, say E = L_1 oplus L_2 oplus L_3. Using property 2 of Chern classes, we have: c(E) = c(L_1) cdot c(L_2) cdot c(L_3). For each line bundle L_i, we have c(L_i) = 1 + c_1(L_i). Therefore, c(E) = (1 + c_1(L_1))(1 + c_1(L_2))(1 + c_1(L_3)).

Using the isomorphism phi, we can relate the determinant line bundle of E to that of E^*: text{det}(E^*) = bigwedge^3 E^* cong bigwedge^3 phi(E) = phi(bigwedge^3 E) = phi(text{det}(E)). Since text{det}(E) and text{det}(E^*) are isomorphic, their first Stiefel-Whitney classes must be equal, i.e., w_1(text{det}(E)) = w_1(text{det}(E^*)). Now, we use the fact that the first Stiefel-Whitney class of a dual bundle is the negative of the original bundle's first Stiefel-Whitney class, i.e., w_1(E^*) = -w_1(E).

The Whitney sum formula states that for two vector bundles E and F over the same base manifold, we have c(E oplus F) = c(E) cdot c(F), where c(E) denotes the total Chern class of the bundle E. In our case, we have E = TM and F = E^*, the dual bundle of E. Since E has rank 3, its dual bundle E^* also has rank 3. The Whitney sum formula then gives c(TM oplus E^*) = c(TM) cdot c(E^*). Now, we use the fact that the total Chern class of a dual bundle is the inverse of the total Chern class of the original bundle. That is, c(E^*) = c(E)^{-1}. Substituting this into the Whitney sum formula, we get c(TM oplus E^*) = c(TM) cdot c(E)^{-1}.

Comparing coefficients, we get the following system of equations: k - 2 = 0, 3k - 6 = 0, 3k = 0. Solving this system, we find that k = 2.

We will construct such an isomorphism using the continuous map f: E → R3. First, let's recall some definitions and properties: 1.

A continuous map f: E → R3 is given such that the restriction of f to each fiber is a linear transformation from R3 to R3. 3. A vector bundle isomorphism between two vector bundles E and F over the same base space B is a homeomorphism φ: E → F such that the restriction of φ to each fiber is a linear isomorphism. Now, let's construct the desired isomorphism φ: E → S1 × R3. For each point x in S1, let L_x: R3 → R3 be the linear transformation given by the restriction of f to the fiber over x. Since L_x is a linear transformation, it has an inverse L_x^(-1) (because L_x is an isomorphism between the fibers). Define φ: E → S1 × R3 as follows. For each point (x, v) in E, where x is in S1 and v is in the fiber over x, set φ(x, v) = (x, L_x^(-1)(v)). Note that φ is well-defined because L_x^(-1) exists for each x in S1. We claim that φ is a vector bundle isomorphism. To show this, we need to prove that φ is a homeomorphism and that the restriction of φ to each fiber is a linear isomorphism. 1. φ is a homeomorphism: To show that φ is a homeomorphism, we need to show that it is continuous, bijective, and has a continuous inverse. - Continuity: Since L_x^(-1) is a continuous function for each x in S1, φ is continuous as a composition of continuous functions. - Bijectivity: For each point (x, w) in S1 × R3, there exists a unique point (x, v) in E such that φ(x, v) = (x, L_x^(-1)(v)) = (x, w), namely v = L_x(w). This shows that φ is bijective. - Continuous inverse: Let φ^(-1): S1 × R3 → E be defined by φ^(-1)(x, w) = (x, L_x(w)). Since L_x is continuous for each x in S1, φ^(-1) is continuous. Thus, φ is a homeomorphism. 2. The restriction of φ to each fiber is a linear isomorphism: Let x be a point in S1, and let v and w be points in the fiber over x. Then, by the definition of φ, φ(x, v + w) = (x, L_x^(-1)(v + w)) = (x, L_x^(-1)(v) + L_x^(-1)(w)) = φ(x, v) + φ(x, w), and φ(x, cv) = (x, L_x^(-1)(cv)) = (x, cL_x^(-1)(v)) = cφ(x, v), where c is a scalar. This shows that the restriction of φ to each fiber is a linear isomorphism.

The torus T^2 can be thought of as the product of two circles, T^2 = S^1 times S^1. The cohomology ring of the torus is given by H^*(T^2) = mathbb{Z}[x, y]/(x^2, y^2), where x and y are the generators of H^1(T^2), and x^2 = y^2 = 0 since the torus is a 2-dimensional manifold. Now, let's consider the Chern classes of the rank 2 vector bundle E. The total Chern class is given by c(E) = 1 + c_1(E) + c_2(E). Since E has rank 2, all higher Chern classes are zero. The Euler class of E is related to the Chern classes by the following formula: e(E) = c_2(E) - c_1(E)^2. In our case, we are given that e(E) = 3. Thus, we have: 3 = c_2(E) - c_1(E)^2. Since c_1(E) and c_2(E) are elements of the cohomology ring H^*(T^2), we know that c_1(E) = ax + by for some integers a and b, and c_2(E) = cxy for some integer c. Substituting these expressions into the equation above, we get: 3 = cxy - (ax + by)^2. Now, we need to find the integers a, b, and c that satisfy this equation. Note that the left-hand side is a 0-dimensional cohomology class, so the right-hand side must also be 0-dimensional. This means that the only possible non-zero term on the right-hand side is the one involving x^2 or y^2. However, we know that x^2 = y^2 = 0, so the equation simplifies to: 3 = cxy. Since x and y are non-zero elements of the cohomology ring, we must have c = 3. Thus, we have found that c_2(E) = 3xy. To find c_1(E), we can use the fact that c_1(E)^2 = c_2(E) - 3.

The simplicial complex K consists of this single 3-simplex and all its faces, i.e., K = {v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, [v_0, v_1], [v_0, v_2], [v_0, v_3], [v_1, v_2], [v_1, v_3], [v_2, v_3], [v_0, v_1, v_2], [v_0, v_1, v_3], [v_0, v_2, v_3], [v_1, v_2, v_3], [v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3]}. Now let's consider the action of the cyclic group G of order 2 on K. Since G acts by inverting one of the vertices, without loss of generality, let's assume it inverts vertex v_0. The action of G on K can be described as follows: - g cdot v_0 = v_0^{-1} - g cdot v_i = v_i for i = 1, 2, 3 - g cdot [v_0, v_i] = [v_0^{-1}, v_i] for i = 1, 2, 3 - g cdot [v_i, v_j] = [v_i, v_j] for 1 leq i < j leq 3 - g cdot [v_0, v_i, v_j] = [v_0^{-1}, v_i, v_j] for 1 leq i < j leq 3 - g cdot [v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3] = [v_0^{-1}, v_1, v_2, v_3] Now we can compute the quotient space K/G. The vertices of K/G are the orbits of the vertices of K under the action of G. We have two orbits: {v_0, v_0^{-1}} and {v_1, v_2, v_3}. Let's denote the representatives of these orbits as u_0 and u_1, respectively. The edges of K/G are the orbits of the edges of K under the action of G.

Thus, the cohomology groups of K/G are given by: - H^0(K/G; mathbb{Z}) = ker d_1 / operatorname{im} d_0 = mathbb{Z}^2 / 0 = mathbb{Z}^2 - H^1(K/G; mathbb{Z}) = ker d_2 / operatorname{im} d_1 = mathbb{Z}^4 / 0 = mathbb{Z}^4 - H^2(K/G; mathbb{Z}) = ker d_3 / operatorname{im} d_2 = mathbb{Z}^3 / 0 = mathbb{Z}^3 - H^3(K/G; mathbb{Z}) = ker d_4 / operatorname{im} d_3 = mathbb{Z} / 0 = mathbb{Z} So the cohomology groups of K/G with coefficients in mathbb{Z} are: H^0(K/G; mathbb{Z}) = mathbb{Z}^2 H^1(K/G; mathbb{Z}) = mathbb{Z}^4 H^2(K/G; mathbb{Z}) = mathbb{Z}^3 H^3(K/G; mathbb{Z}) = mathbb{Z}"},{"prompt":"Let X be a topological space with cohomology groups H^(i)(X), i=0,1,2,3.

In this case, we are interested in the homotopy group π_3(X). Since X has cohomology groups H^(i)(X) with i=0,1,2,3, we can use the Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology to relate the cohomology groups to the homology groups. The Universal Coefficient Theorem states that there is a short exact sequence: 0 → Ext(H_i(X), Z) → H^(i+1)(X) → Hom(H_i(X), Z) → 0 In our case, we have H^(0)(X) = H^(1)(X) = H^(2)(X) = Z and H^(3)(X) = 0.

For i=1, we have: 0 → Ext(H_1(X), Z) → H^(2)(X) → Hom(H_1(X), Z) → 0 Since H^(2)(X) = Z, we have Hom(H_1(X), Z) = Z. This implies that H_1(X) = Z. For i=2, we have: 0 → Ext(H_2(X), Z) → H^(3)(X) → Hom(H_2(X), Z) → 0 Since H^(3)(X) = 0, we have Ext(H_2(X), Z) = 0. This implies that H_2(X) = Z. Now, we can use the Hurewicz theorem to relate the homotopy groups π_i(X) to the homology groups H_i(X) for i=0,1,2,3. The Hurewicz theorem states that if π_i(X) = 0 for i < n, then the Hurewicz homomorphism h: π_n(X) → H_n(X) is an isomorphism. In our case, we have H_0(X) = H_1(X) = H_2(X) = Z. Since H_0(X) and H_1(X) are nontrivial, the Hurewicz theorem does not apply directly. However, we can still use the Hurewicz theorem for i=2, since π_0(X) and π_1(X) do not affect the higher homotopy groups. For i=2, we have h: π_2(X) → H_2(X) is an isomorphism. Since H_2(X) = Z, we have π_2(X) = Z. Now, we can use the suspension isomorphism to relate the homotopy groups π_i(X) to π_(i-1)(ΣX), where ΣX is the suspension of X. The suspension isomorphism states that π_(i-1)(ΣX) ≅ π_i(X) for i > 0. In our case, we have π_2(X) = Z. Therefore, π_1(ΣX) = Z. Finally, we can use the Freudenthal suspension theorem to relate the homotopy groups π_i(X) to π_(i+1)(X) for i > 0. The Freudenthal suspension theorem states that if X is an (n-1)-connected space, then the suspension homomorphism s: π_i(X) → π_(i+1)(ΣX) is an isomorphism for i < 2n. In our case, X is 1-connected (since π_0(X) is trivial and π_1(X) is nontrivial), so the Freudenthal suspension theorem applies for i < 2. Therefore, s: π_2(X) → π_3(ΣX) is an isomorphism. Since π_2(X) = Z and π_1(ΣX) = Z, we have π_3(ΣX) = Z. Now, we can use the suspension isomorphism again to relate π_3(ΣX) to π_4(X). We have π_3(ΣX) ≅ π_4(X), so π_4(X) = Z. However, we are interested in the homotopy group π_3(X), not π_4(X).

Now, consider the element α^4 = α ∪ α ∪ α ∪ α ∈ H^8(X). Since the cup product is associative, we have α^4 = (α ∪ α) ∪ (α ∪ α). Since α has order 3, we know that α^3 = α ∪ α ∪ α = 0. Therefore, α^2 = α ∪ α is an element of order 3 in H^4(X). This means that (α^2)^3 = (α ∪ α)^3 = (α ∪ α) ∪ (α ∪ α) ∪ (α ∪ α) = 0.

Next, we need to determine the boundary maps: - ∂_0: C_0 → 0, since there are no -1-simplices. - ∂_1: C_1 → C_0, given by ∂_1(AB) = B - A, ∂_1(BC) = C - B, ∂_1(CD) = D - C, ∂_1(DA) = A - D, and ∂_1(AC) = C - A. - ∂_2: C_2 → C_1, given by ∂_2(ABC) = BC - AB + AC and ∂_2(ACD) = CD - AC + AD. Now we can determine the cochain complex C*: - C^0 consists of functions from C_0 to Z. - C^1 consists of functions from C_1 to Z. - C^2 consists of functions from C_2 to Z. The coboundary maps are the duals of the boundary maps: - δ^0: C^0 → C^1, given by δ^0(f)(AB) = f(B) - f(A), and similarly for other edges. - δ^1: C^1 → C^2, given by δ^1(g)(ABC) = g(BC) - g(AB) + g(AC), and similarly for other triangles. Now, we can compute the first cohomology group H^1(X; Z) as the quotient of the kernel of δ^1 and the image of δ^0: - ker(δ^1) consists of functions g in C^1 such that δ^1(g) = 0 for all 2-simplices. In this case, it means g(BC) - g(AB) + g(AC) = 0 and g(CD) - g(AC) + g(AD) = 0.

We want to find the dimension of the space of such 1-forms. First, let's recall some definitions: 1. A 1-form alpha is co-closed if dalpha^* = 0, where alpha^* is the Hodge dual of alpha. 2. Two forms are orthogonal if their wedge product is zero, i.e., alpha wedge omega = 0. Now, let's use the Hodge decomposition theorem, which states that any k-form beta on a compact Riemannian manifold can be decomposed uniquely as beta = dgamma + deltaeta + zeta, where gamma is a (k-1)-form, eta is a (k+1)-form, and zeta is a harmonic k-form (i.e., dzeta = deltazeta = 0). Applying the Hodge decomposition theorem to the 1-form alpha, we get alpha = dgamma + deltaeta + zeta, where gamma is a 0-form (i.e., a function), eta is a 2-form, and zeta is a harmonic 1-form. Since alpha is co-closed, we have dalpha^* = 0. Taking the Hodge dual of the decomposition, we get alpha^* = dgamma^* + deltaeta^* + zeta^*. Since dalpha^* = 0, we have deltaeta^* = -dgamma^* - zeta^*. Now, let's consider the orthogonality condition alpha wedge omega = 0. Using the decomposition of alpha, we have (dgamma + deltaeta + zeta) wedge omega = 0. Since omega is a closed 2-form, we have domega = 0. Therefore, the wedge product with dgamma vanishes, and we get (deltaeta + zeta) wedge omega = 0. Since deltaeta^* = -dgamma^* - zeta^*, we have eta^* wedge omega = -zeta^* wedge omega. Thus, the orthogonality condition reduces to zeta^* wedge omega = 0. This implies that the harmonic 1-form zeta is orthogonal to the closed 2-form omega. Now, we know that the space of harmonic 1-forms on a compact, connected 2-dimensional manifold without boundary is isomorphic to the first cohomology group H^1(M). By the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, we have b_1(M) = dim H^1(M), where b_1(M) is the first Betti number of M.

Using the properties of the exterior derivative, we get: dalpha wedge omega + alpha wedge domega = d^2f. Since domega = 0 and d^2f = 0, this simplifies to: dalpha wedge omega = 0. Now, we want to determine the number of linearly independent 1-forms alpha that satisfy this equation. Since M has dimension 3, there are three linearly independent 1-forms in general. Let's denote them by alpha_1, alpha_2, alpha_3. We can write any 1-form alpha as a linear combination of these basis 1-forms: alpha = a_1alpha_1 + a_2alpha_2 + a_3alpha_3, where a_1, a_2, a_3 are smooth functions on M. Substituting this expression for alpha into the equation dalpha wedge omega = 0, we get: d(a_1alpha_1 + a_2alpha_2 + a_3alpha_3) wedge omega = 0. Expanding this equation using the linearity of the exterior derivative, we obtain: (a_1dalpha_1 + a_2dalpha_2 + a_3dalpha_3) wedge omega = 0. Since omega is a non-zero closed 2-form, it has rank 2. Therefore, the only way for the above equation to hold is if a_1dalpha_1 + a_2dalpha_2 + a_3dalpha_3 = 0. This means that the 1-forms dalpha_1, dalpha_2, dalpha_3 are linearly dependent. In other words, there exists a non-trivial linear relation among them: c_1dalpha_1 + c_2dalpha_2 + c_3dalpha_3 = 0, where not all c_i are zero. Without loss of generality, let's assume c_1 neq 0. Then we can express dalpha_1 as a linear combination of dalpha_2 and dalpha_3: dalpha_1 = -frac{c_2}{c_1}dalpha_2 - frac{c_3}{c_1}dalpha_3. Integrating both sides, we get: alpha_1 = -frac{c_2}{c_1}alpha_2 - frac{c_3}{c_1}alpha_3 + beta, where beta is a closed 1-form. Thus, any 1-form alpha satisfying the equation dalpha wedge omega = 0 can be written as a linear combination of alpha_2, alpha_3, and beta.

Suppose, for contradiction, that Z(alpha) = emptyset. Then alpha is nowhere vanishing, and we can define a unit vector field X on M by X = frac{alpha}{|alpha|}. Now, consider the Euler characteristic of M, denoted by chi(M). By the Poincaré-Hopf theorem, we have chi(M) = sum_{p in Z(X)} text{index}_p(X). Since Z(X) = Z(alpha) = emptyset, the sum is empty and thus chi(M) = 0. However, this contradicts the fact that M is compact and orientable, which implies that chi(M) neq 0. Therefore, our assumption that Z(alpha) = emptyset must be false, and alpha has at least one zero. Now, let's find an upper bound for the number of zeros of alpha.

Moreover, the index of a non-degenerate zero of a 1-form is either +1 or -1. Therefore, the number of zeros of alpha is at least |chi(M)|. Now, let N be the number of zeros of alpha. Since each zero contributes either +1 or -1 to the sum, we have |chi(M)| leq N leq |chi(M)| + 2b_2(M), where the lower bound comes from the fact that there must be at least |chi(M)| zeros, and the upper bound comes from the fact that we can add at most 2b_2(M) zeros without changing the sum (by adding pairs of zeros with indices +1 and -1).

The exterior derivative of a 1-form on S^1 is a 2-form, but since S^1 is one-dimensional, there are no non-trivial 2-forms on it. Therefore, ker(d^1) consists of all 1-forms on S^1.

The Hodge star operator is defined as follows: For a k-form omega, the (n-k)-form *omega is given by (*omega)_{i_1 dots i_{n-k}} = frac{1}{k!} sqrt{|det g|} epsilon_{i_1 dots i_{n-k} j_1 dots j_k} omega^{j_1 dots j_k}, where epsilon is the Levi-Civita symbol and |det g| is the absolute value of the determinant of the metric tensor.

Using these properties, we can define a linear map P: H^k_{DR}(M) to H^{n-k}_{DR}(M) by P([omega]) = [*d*omega], where [omega] denotes the cohomology class of omega. We will show that P is an isomorphism. First, we need to show that P is well-defined. If [omega_1] = [omega_2], then omega_1 - omega_2 = deta for some (k-1)-form eta. Then, *d*omega_1 - *d*omega_2 = *d(*omega_1 - *omega_2) = *d(*deta) = *d^2*eta = 0, so [*d*omega_1] = [*d*omega_2] and P is well-defined. Next, we show that P is injective. Suppose P([omega]) = 0, i.e., *d*omega is exact. Then there exists a (n-k-1)-form eta such that *d*omega = deta. Applying the Hodge star operator and using the properties above, we get d*eta = *domega implies d^2*eta = d(*domega) = *d^2omega = 0. Since d*eta is closed and exact, it is a coboundary. Thus, [omega] = 0 and P is injective. Finally, we show that P is surjective. Let [eta] be an element of H^{n-k}_{DR}(M). Then deta = 0. Applying the Hodge star operator and using the properties above, we get 0 = *0 = *deta = d(*eta). Thus, *eta is closed. Let omega = *d*eta. Then domega = d(*d*eta) = *deta = 0, so omega is closed. Moreover, P([omega]) = [*d*omega] = [eta]. Thus, P is surjective. Since P is a well-defined, injective, and surjective linear map, it is an isomorphism between H^k_{DR}(M) and H^{n-k}_{DR}(M).

Thus, the space of closed 0-forms is the space of constant functions, which is isomorphic to mathbb{R}. Since M is compact, any exact 0-form must also be constant. To see this, let omega = df for some smooth function f on M. Then, for any smooth curve c: [0, 1] to M, we have int_0^1 omega(c'(t)) dt = int_0^1 df(c'(t)) dt = f(c(1)) - f(c(0)).

The wire is a semi-circle with radius 5 cm, so its complement in the plane is the plane with a semi-circular hole. This space is homotopy equivalent to the punctured plane, which has the same homotopy type as the circle S^1. Therefore, we can compute the De Rham cohomology of the punctured plane, and it will give us the same result as the complement of the wire. Recall that the De Rham cohomology groups are given by the following: H^0 = {constant functions} H^1 = {closed 1-forms} / {exact 1-forms} H^2 = {closed 2-forms} / {exact 2-forms} ... Now, let's compute the De Rham cohomology groups for the punctured plane. H^0: The constant functions are the same as in the plane, so H^0 = R. H^1: The given differential form ω = xdy - ydx is a closed 1-form on the punctured plane, as its exterior derivative is zero: dω = d(xdy - ydx) = (dx ∧ dy - dy ∧ dx) = 0.

Since ω is not exact, it generates a nontrivial cohomology class in H^1. Therefore, H^1 = R. H^2: In two dimensions, there are no nontrivial closed 2-forms, so H^2 = 0.

Then, there exists a (k-1)-form beta such that alpha = dbeta. Let c be any smooth (n-k-1)-chain in M. Then, by Stokes' theorem, we have int_c alpha = int_c dbeta = int_{partial c} beta. Since c is a chain, its boundary partial c is a (n-k-2)-cycle, which is a closed (n-k-2)-chain. However, since k<n, we have n-k-2 geq 0. Thus, partial c is an empty set, and the integral becomes int_{partial c} beta = 0. So, for any smooth (n-k-1)-chain c in M, we have int_c alpha = 0. (2) Conversely, suppose that for any smooth (n-k-1)-chain c in M, we have int_c alpha = 0. We want to show that alpha is exact. By Poincaré lemma, it suffices to show that alpha is locally exact, i.e., exact in a neighborhood of each point in M. Let p be an arbitrary point in M. Choose a coordinate chart (U, phi) around p. In this chart, we can write alpha = sum_{i=1}^n f_i dx^i for some smooth functions f_i. Let c be a smooth (n-k-1)-chain in U with boundary partial c. Then, by our assumption, we have int_c alpha = int_c sum_{i=1}^n f_i dx^i = 0. By Stokes' theorem, we have int_{partial c} sum_{i=1}^n f_i dx^i = 0. Since this holds for any smooth (n-k-1)-chain c in U, it follows that alpha is exact in U. Thus, alpha is locally exact, and by Poincaré lemma, alpha is exact.

Given that int_{gamma} alpha = 2pi for some closed curve gamma, we want to show that alpha is not exact. Suppose, for contradiction, that alpha is exact. Then, there exists a 0-form (i.e., a function) f such that alpha = df. Since gamma is a closed curve, we have int_{gamma} alpha = int_{gamma} df = f(gamma(1)) - f(gamma(0)). However, since gamma is a closed curve, we have gamma(1) = gamma(0), and thus int_{gamma} alpha = f(gamma(1)) - f(gamma(0)) = 0. This contradicts the given condition that int_{gamma} alpha = 2pi.
