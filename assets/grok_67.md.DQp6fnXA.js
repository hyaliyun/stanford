The perimeter of the isosceles triangle is 40. Let the equal sides of the isosceles triangle be x, and the base be b. Then, 2x + b = 40.

Now, consider the signs for f'(x) in different intervals: - For x in (0,1), we have ln x < 0 and thus f'(x) > 0. Hence, f(x) is increasing on (0,1). - For x in (1, +infty), we have ln x > 0 and thus f'(x) < 0. Hence, f(x) is decreasing on (1, +infty). So the function f(x) is increasing on the interval (0,1) and decreasing on the interval (1, +infty). (II) From part (I), we know that f(x) achieves its maximum value at f(1) = 1. Let g(x) = x^2 - 2x + k. When x = 1, the function g(x) attains its minimum value g(1) = k - 1. Since the equation g(x) = x^2 - 2x + k has real solutions, we should have k - 1 leq 1, which means k leq 2. Thus, the range for the real number k is k leq 2. (III) Since the function f(x) is decreasing on the interval (1, +infty) and because 1+ frac{1}{n} > 1 for n in mathbb{N}^* with n geq 2, we have f(1+ frac{1}{n}) < f(1) = 1.

As n cdot f(n) = 1 + ln(n), we can deduct that nf(n) < 2 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{n-1}.

On Sunday, she spent some multiple of the amount she spent on Friday. Let's call this multiple M. So the amount spent on Sunday, Su, is Su = M * F. The total amount spent over the three days is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation: F + S + Su = 120 Substituting the known values, we get: 20 + 40 + M * 20 = 120 Combining like terms, we have: 60 + 20M = 120 Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get: 20M = 120 - 60 20M = 60 Dividing both sides by 20, we find the value of M: M = 60 / 20 M = 3 So, Emily spent 3 times the amount she spent on Friday on Sunday.

Removing any common delegates, at least one delegate from ( A ) remains. - Since sequences for ( B ) remain the same in ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ), the number of known delegates will change uniformly between the groups.

Calculate the sum S_{60} of the first 60 terms of the sequence {c_{n}}.","completion":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into detailed steps: # Part 1: Finding the General Formulas **Step 1:** Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} be d and the common ratio of the geometric sequence {b_{n}} be r. Given that d = r, we can use t to represent both the common difference and the common ratio, i.e., d = r = t. **Step 2:** Given a_{1} = 1, the formula for the n-th term of an arithmetic sequence is a_{n} = a_{1} + (n-1)d. Substituting d = t, we get a_{n} = 1 + (n-1)t. **Step 3:** For the geometric sequence {b_{n}}, given b_{2} = 4, we know the formula for the n-th term is b_{n} = b_{1}r^{n-1}. Since b_{2} = b_{1}r, we have 4 = b_{1}t. To find b_{n}, we express it as b_{n} = 4 cdot t^{n-2}. **Step 4:** From the condition b_{3} - a_{6} = -3, we substitute the formulas for b_{3} and a_{6}: 4t - (1 + 5t) = -3. Solving for t, we get t = 2. **Step 5:** Substituting t = 2 into the formulas for a_{n} and b_{n}, we find {a}_{n} = 1 + 2(n-1) = 2n - 1 and {b}_{n} = 4 cdot 2^{n-2} = 2^{n}. # Part 2: Calculating S_{60} **Step 1:** The terms of {b_{n}} in ascending order are powers of 2, starting from 2^1 = 2 up to a certain point. Since a_{50} = 99 and a_{60} = 119, we know that the terms of {a_{n}} will be part of the sequence {c_{n}} up to a_{60}. **Step 2:** In the first 60 terms of {c_{n}}, we include the first 6 terms of {b_{n}} (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64) and 54 terms from {a_{n}}. **Step 3:** To calculate S_{60}, we sum the first 54 terms of {a_{n}} and the first 6 terms of {b_{n}}. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by S = frac{n}{2}(a_{1} + a_{n}), where n is the number of terms. For {a_{n}}, S_{a} = frac{54}{2}(1 + 107) = 2916. **Step 4:** The sum of the first 6 terms of {b_{n}} is simply 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 126. **Step 5:** Therefore, the total sum S_{60} = 2916 + 126 = 3042.

If he needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof, how many shingles does he need total?","completion":"First, we need to calculate the area of one side of the roof. Since the sides are rectangular, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. Area of one side = 20 feet x 40 feet = 800 square feet Each roof has two sides, so we need to double this to get the total area for one roof. Total area for one roof = 800 square feet x 2 = 1600 square feet Now, we need to calculate the total area for all three roofs. Total area for three roofs = 1600 square feet x 3 = 4800 square feet Since Jerry needs 8 shingles to cover one square foot of roof, we multiply the total area by the number of shingles per square foot.

The formula given is s = 30 + 4c - w. Given that a different combination of correct and wrong answers could lead to the same score, we explore how changing the number of correct and wrong answers affects the score. Specifically, we consider the scenarios of having one more correct answer and four more wrong answers, and vice versa. This leads to the equations: - s = 30 + 4(c-1) - (w-4) - s = 30 + 4(c+1) - (w+4) From these, we deduce that Mary could not have left at least five questions unanswered. If she had, adjusting the number of correct and wrong answers as described above would still yield the same score, contradicting the premise that John could uniquely determine the number of problems Mary solved correctly. Similarly, Mary could not have answered at least four questions wrong because, to have a score over 80, she must have answered at least one question correctly. These constraints imply that the sum of correct and wrong answers Mary had (c + w) must be at least 26, and the number of wrong answers (w) must be 3 or fewer. Thus, the number of correct answers (c) must be at least 23. Substituting these values into the score formula gives us: [s = 30 + 4c - w geq 30 + 4(23) - 3 = 119] To confirm that 119 is indeed Mary's score, we examine the possibility of other combinations of c and w leading to the same score.

The only feasible value for w under the given constraints is 3, which, when substituted back, gives c = 23. Any attempt to increase w to 7 or more would necessitate at least 31 questions, which is impossible since the AHSME consists of only 30 questions.

The alternating pattern ensures that under a 180^circ rotation, a triangle will map onto a rectangle and vice versa. This mismatch means this rotation will not map the figure onto itself. 2. **Some translation in the direction parallel to line ell:** - The figure features a regular repeating pattern. Translating the figure along ell by the length of one complete unit (one triangle, one rectangle, and their associated line segment) will match the pattern exactly due to its periodic nature. Thus, this translation will map the figure onto itself. 3. **The reflection across line ell:** - Reflecting across line ell will invert the triangles and rectangles across the line. If the triangles and rectangles are symmetric about their bases, which lie on line ell, this reflection will map the figure onto itself. 4. **Some reflection across a line perpendicular to line ell:** - A reflection across a line perpendicular to ell will not preserve the orientation of the triangles and rectangles, especially if their heights (or other characteristics) differ.

If this inequality holds, the problem is solved because it implies at least one of the radii (R_1, R_2, R_3) must be (leq sqrt{R}). 1. Denote the incenter of (triangle ABC) by (O), and let (ON perp AC) at (N). Thus, (ON) is the inradius of (triangle ABC), denoted by (r). Set (BC = a), (CA = b), (AB = c), and (p = frac{1}{2}(a + b + c)). Also, let the area of (triangle ABC) be (S). Then (AN = p - a). 2. Using the Pythagorean theorem in (triangle OAN), we have: [ OA^2 = ON^2 + AN^2 = r^2 + (p - a)^2 ] Substituting (r = frac{S}{p}): [ OA^2 = left( frac{S}{p} right)^2 + (p - a)^2 = frac{S^2}{p^2} + (p - a)^2 = frac{p (p - a)(p - b)(p - c)}{p^2} + (p - a)^2 = frac{p - a}{p} [(p - b)(p - c) + p (p - a)] ] [ = frac{b c (p - a)}{p} ] Therefore: [ OA = sqrt{ frac{bc(p - a)}{p} } ] 3.

According to the problem, let's consider one side of the triangle: [ A + C + 3 + 4 ] This sum should be equal to another side: [ 5 + D + 2 + 4 ] Therefore, we can set up the equation: [ A + C + 3 + 4 = 5 + D + 2 + 4 ] Simplifying both sides, we get: [ A + C + 7 = D + 11 ] Subtracting 7 from both sides: [ A + C = D + 4 ] 3. Next, let's analyze the total possible sum along one side.

A seven-digit number has the property that, from left to right, the sum of each adjacent pair of digits is 9, 7, 9, 2, 8, and 11, respectively. Find this seven-digit number. : 1. To solve this problem, let's denote the seven-digit number as (a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5a_6a_7), where (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_7) are the digits of the number. 2. According to the problem, the sums of adjacent pairs of digits are given in the sequence: - (a_1 + a_2 = 9) - (a_2 + a_3 = 7) - (a_3 + a_4 = 9) - (a_4 + a_5 = 2) - (a_5 + a_6 = 8) - (a_6 + a_7 = 11) 3. Let's solve for the digits step by step starting from the first equation: - (a_1 + a_2 = 9) In order to use the next equations, we need to express (a_2) in terms of (a_1). 4. From the second equation: - (a_2 + a_3 = 7) We express (a_3) as (7 - a_2). 5. Substituting (a_2) from step 4 into the first equation: - (a_2 = 9 - a_1) - (a_3 = 7 - (9 - a_1) = 7 - 9 + a_1 = a_1 - 2) 6. Using the third equation: - (a_3 + a_4 = 9) Substitute (a_3) from step 5: - ((a_1 - 2) + a_4 = 9) - (a_4 = 9 + 2 - a_1 = 11 - a_1) 7. Then use the fourth equation: - (a_4 + a_5 = 2) Substitute (a_4) from step 6: - ((11 - a_1) + a_5 = 2) - (a_5 = 2 - 11 + a_1 = a_1 - 9) 8. Using the fifth equation: - (a_5 + a_6 = 8) Substitute (a_5) from step 7: - ((a_1 - 9) + a_6 = 8) - (a_6 = 8 + 9 - a_1 = 17 - a_1) 9. Lastly, using the sixth equation: - (a_6 + a_7 = 11) Substitute (a_6) from step 8: - ((17 - a_1) + a_7 = 11) - (a_7 = 11 - 17 + a_1 = a_1 - 6) 10. Now, let's find a specific digit that satisfies all conditions. Starting with (a_1 = 9) (since digits are between 0 and 9): Using (a_1 = 9), we get: - (a_2 = 9 - 9 = 0) - (a_3 = 9 - 2 = 7) - (a_4 = 11 - 9 = 2) - (a_5 = 9 - 9 = 0) - (a_6 = 17 - 9 = 8) - (a_7 = 9 - 6 = 3) Constructing the seven-digit number from these digits gives: - 9072083 11.

Also, since ( k ) represents both the quotient and the remainder, we have: [ k < N ] and ( 2014 = k(N+1) ) implies ( k ) must divide 2014 evenly. 3. **Finding Divisors of 2014:** We factorize 2014 to find all possible values of ( k ): [ 2014 = 2 times 19 times 53 ] Hence, the divisors of 2014 are 1, 2, 19, 38, 53, 106, 1007, and 2014. 4. **Checking Possible Values of ( k ):** We need to verify which of these divisors satisfy the condition ( k < N ) for ( N ) such that: [ N = frac{2014}{k} - 1 ] Let's check each divisor: - For ( k = 1 ): [ N = frac{2014}{1} - 1 = 2013 ] So, ( 2014 = 1 times (2013 + 1) ), which is true, and satisfies ( k < N ). - For ( k = 2 ): [ N = frac{2014}{2} - 1 = 1006 ] So, ( 2014 = 2 times (1006 + 1) ), which is true, and satisfies ( k < N ). - For ( k = 19 ): [ N = frac{2014}{19} - 1 = 105 ] So, ( 2014 = 19 times (105 + 1) ), which is true, and satisfies ( k < N ). - For ( k = 38 ): [ N = frac{2014}{38} - 1 = 52 ] So, ( 2014 = 38 times (52 + 1) ), which is true, and satisfies ( k < N ). - For ( k = 53 ): [ N = frac{2014}{53} - 1 = 37 ] Since ( k > N ), this does not satisfy ( k < N ). - For ( k = 106 ): [ N = frac{2014}{106} - 1 = 18 ] Since ( k > N ), this does not satisfy ( k < N ). - For ( k = 1007 ): [ N = frac{2014}{1007} - 1 = 1 ] Since ( k > N ), this does not satisfy ( k < N ). - For ( k = 2014 ): ( N = 0 ) which is not a natural number. 5. **Conclusion:** The natural numbers ( N ) that satisfy the given conditions are when ( k ) is 1, 2, 19, or 38.

This becomes: [ left[k_{AD} (x + a)right]left[k_{BL} (x - a)right] + lambda left[k_{CD} xright]left[k_{EF} xright] = 0 ] 5. **Simplify to Quadratic Form:** By further simplification, we see: [ k_{AD} k_{BC} (x^2 - a^2) + lambda k_{CD} k_{EF} x^2 = 0 ] 6. **Combining Constants:** This simplifies to a standard quadratic equation: [ left(k_{AD} k_{BC} + lambda k_{CD} k_{EF}right) x^2 - k_{AD} k_{BC} a^2 = 0 ] 7. **Quadratic Equation Solution:** Solving the above for x: [ x^2 left(k_{AD} k_{BC} + lambda k_{CD} k_{EF}right) = k_{AD} k_{BC} a^2 ] Therefore, [ x^2 = frac{k_{AD} k_{BC} a^2}{k_{AD} k_{BC} + lambda k_{CD} k_{EF}} ] This shows that |x| = a which means the roots are pm a, thus the points P and Q are symmetric about M: [ x_P = -x_Q ] 8. **Conclusion:** Since x_P = -x_Q, it naturally follows that the distances from M to P and Q are equal: [ |PM| = |MQ| ] Hence, the proof is complete.

First, we know that 5 dogs like both watermelon and salmon. This is the intersection of the two sets. 2. Next, we calculate the number of dogs that like only watermelon. Since 9 dogs like watermelon and 5 of these also like salmon, the number of dogs that like only watermelon is 9 - 5 = 4. 3. Similarly, we calculate the number of dogs that like only salmon. Since 48 dogs like salmon and 5 of these also like watermelon, the number of dogs that like only salmon is 48 - 5 = 43. 4. To find out how many dogs like at least one of the two foods, we add the number of dogs that like only watermelon, only salmon, and both: 5 + 4 + 43 = 52 This means 52 dogs like at least one of the two foods. 5. Finally, to find out how many dogs do not like either watermelon or salmon, we subtract the number of dogs that like at least one of the foods from the total number of dogs in the kennel: 60 - 52 = 8 Therefore, the number of dogs in the kennel that will not eat either watermelon or salmon is boxed{8}."},{"prompt":"a division sum, the remainder is 0.

Hence, the highest degree term of f(g(x)) comes from (ax^3) evaluated at g(x), thus a(g(x))^3 = a(e_nx^n)^3 = ae_n^3x^{3n}. As h(x) = f(g(x)) - g(x) has the degree of 8, we need to consider the highest degree terms: - The highest degree term from f(g(x)) is ae_n^3x^{3n}. - Subtracting g(x) which contributes e_nx^n, we seek the degree where 3n = 8 as the subtraction won't change the highest degree term (3n > n). However, since n must be a whole number, n = frac{8}{3} is not valid. Therefore, let us reconsider the match for degree: the highest degree after subtraction occurs when 3n < 8 and close to it.

Then their midpoint is a lattice point which is inside the pentagon and isn't a vertex.

What errors can this verification method not detect?","completion":"To verify the arithmetic operations by dividing by 9, the following properties of numbers are utilized: 1. **Property 1:** The remainder when dividing any number by 9 is the same as the remainder when dividing the sum of its digits by 9. Specifically, for a number ( n ) represented as: [ n = a_0 + a_1 cdot 10 + a_2 cdot 10^2 + ldots + a_k cdot 10^k, ] where ( a_i ) are the digits of ( n ), the sum of the digits ( S(n) ) will be: [ S(n) = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k. ] According to the property: [ n mod 9 = S(n) mod 9. ] 2. **Property 2:** The remainder when dividing the sum of several numbers by 9 is equal to the sum of the remainders of each individual number divided by 9. Let ( n_1, n_2, ldots, n_m ) be several numbers. The property states: [ (n_1 + n_2 + ldots + n_m) mod 9 = (n_1 mod 9 + n_2 mod 9 + ldots + n_m mod 9). ] 3. **Property 3:** The remainder when dividing the product of several numbers by 9 is equal to the product of the remainders of each individual number divided by 9. Let ( n_1, n_2, ldots, n_m ) be several numbers. The property states: [ (n_1 cdot n_2 cdot ldots cdot n_m) mod 9 = (n_1 mod 9) cdot (n_2 mod 9) cdot ldots cdot (n_m mod 9). ] *Note:* If the resulting sum or product of remainders is a multi-digit number, the process is repeated by taking the sum of its digits until a single-digit number (or 9) is obtained. **Conclusion:** - Verification by division by 9 cannot detect certain types of errors that are multiples of 9. Such errors include: - **Skipping of digits that are 0 or 9:** Since both 0 and 9 leave the same remainder of 0 when divided by 9, omitting these digits results in a sum that still has the same remainder. - **Permutations of digits:** Changing the order of the digits in a number does not change the sum of the digits, and thus, its remainder when divided by 9 remains unchanged. Thus, while verification by division by 9 is a useful tool for detecting some errors in arithmetic operations, it is not foolproof for errors that fall into the categories mentioned above.

If the first roll is ( i ), where ( i in {1, 2, ldots, 100} ), then the sum of the next two rolls must be in the range ([1, i]). If the sum of the next two rolls is ( j ), where ( j in {1, 2, ldots, i} ), then there are ( j-1 ) ways to choose the second roll and each of those rolls uniquely determines the third roll. 3. Summing this over for all ( i ) and ( j ) in their respective intervals yields: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} sum_{j=1}^{i} (j-1) ] 4. We can simplify the inner sum: [ sum_{j=1}^{i} (j-1) = sum_{j=0}^{i-1} j = frac{(i-1)i}{2} ] 5. Therefore, the double sum becomes: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} frac{(i-1)i}{2} = frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{100} (i^2 - i) ] 6. We can split the sum into two separate sums: [ frac{1}{2} left( sum_{i=1}^{100} i^2 - sum_{i=1}^{100} i right) ] 7.

Substituting these into our expression: [ frac{1}{2} left( frac{100 cdot 101 cdot 201}{6} - frac{100 cdot 101}{2} right) ] 10. Simplifying the terms: [ frac{1}{2} left( frac{100 cdot 101 cdot 201}{6} - frac{100 cdot 101}{2} right) = frac{1}{2} left( frac{100 cdot 101 cdot 201}{6} - frac{100 cdot 101 cdot 3}{6} right) ] 11.

This produces a DAG rooted at ( r_2 ) because all the other edges aren't affected, so they can go to a vertex whose edges may have been flipped, and go to ( r_2 ), which is doable because this vertex is originally on the path from ( r_1 ) to ( r_2 ). - If we do this procedure twice, we get our original graph. This procedure has one outcome per input, so if the number of DAGs rooted at ( r_2 ) is less than those rooted at ( r_1 ), after doing two procedures, we would not be able to get all DAGs rooted at ( r_1 ), which is absurd. 3. **Main Problem:** - We claim this problem is still true if the probability ( u rightarrow v ) works is equal to the probability ( v rightarrow u ) works. Let ( G ) be the counterexample with minimal vertices, and among them, the one with minimal edges. - First of all, if we are given that ( u rightarrow v, v rightarrow u ) are both turned off, we are working with a smaller graph, so this statement is true. - Secondly, if there is a cycle ( v_1 rightarrow v_2 rightarrow cdots rightarrow v_n rightarrow v_1 ), then if we merge all those vertices into one, and also merge the probabilities (for example, if ( v_1q ) has a chance ( p_1 ) of failing, ( v_2q ) has a chance ( p_2 ) of failing, and all other vertices aren't adjacent to vertex ( q ), then this new edge has ( 1 - p_1p_2 ) chance of failing in either direction). - We can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion on those two cases, and find out any combination of the two gives a smaller counterexample. Therefore, we don't need to worry about those cases at all. - The only other possibility is considering the DAGs where for each edge, exactly one of ( u rightarrow v, v rightarrow u ) works. The probability that exactly one of ( u rightarrow v, v rightarrow u ) works is ( prodlimits_{u,v text{edge}} 2(1-p_{uv})p_{uv} ), which doesn't depend on the vertex itself.

We need to determine the original shape that, when one of its angles is cut off, cannot result in a quadrilateral. 2. **Analyzing the Options**: - **Option A (Hexagon)**: A hexagon has six sides. If we cut off one angle, the minimum number of sides we can end up with is five, not four. Therefore, cutting off an angle from a hexagon cannot leave us with a quadrilateral. - **Option B (Pentagon)**: A pentagon has five sides. Cutting off one angle can result in a shape with four sides, a quadrilateral. - **Option C (Quadrilateral)**: A quadrilateral has four sides. Cutting off one angle can result in a shape with three sides, a triangle, which can be considered a degenerate form of a quadrilateral for this context. - **Option D (Triangle)**: A triangle has three sides. Cutting off one angle can result in a shape that essentially still has three sides but is more degenerate in form. However, for the purpose of this problem, we consider the original shape that cannot directly result in a quadrilateral without considering degenerate forms. 3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the original shape that cannot result in a quadrilateral when one of its angles is cut off is a **Hexagon**. This is because cutting off an angle from a hexagon will leave us with a shape that has at least five sides, not four.

Let us assume that it is possible to place a line segment ( XY ) inside the pentagon such that it is visible from all vertices ( A, B, C, D, E ) under the same angle. 2. For any chosen ( XY ), we note that three of the vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) (or likewise with ( D, E )) will lie on one side of the line segment ( XY ). Specifically, let's say ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are the three vertices. 3. Given that the angles at vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ) subtended by the line segment ( XY ) are equal, points ( A, B, , C, X, ) and ( Y ) must lie on the circumference of a single circle. This is due to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an angle subtended by a chord (in this case ( XY )) is the same when observed from any point on the circle being described by the chord ( XY ). 4. Since ( A, B, ) and ( C ) lie within the vertices of a regular pentagon: - All vertices, including ( X ) and ( Y ), must lie on the circle that circumferences the regular pentagon, given that the pentagon is cyclic (all vertices of the pentagon lie on a single circle). 5. For this scenario to hold, the points ( X ) and ( Y ) must coincide with some points on the circular circumference that are either inside the side lengths or vertices of the pentagon. 6. However, this arrangement implies that ( X ) and ( Y ) are not strictly inside the pentagon but lie on the circumcircle that also describes the bounding circle of the pentagon—a contradiction since the segment ( XY ) is supposed to be strictly inside the pentagon. 7. Therefore, there is no way to position ( XY ) strictly inside the pentagon such that it fulfills the condition of being visible under the same angle from all vertices. # Conclusion: Since the assumption that ( XY ) can be positioned inside the pentagon leads to a contradiction, it is confirmed that it is impossible to position such a segment.

For a 360-ray partitional point (4 times 90), similar reasoning dictates that each triangular sector must divide into 90 parts. Placing X symmetrically results in a spacing of frac{s}{91} between each point in the grid. To find overlapping points between these grids: - 150-ray partitional forms a 150 times 150 grid of points. - 90-ray partitional forms a 90 times 90 grid of points. The common divisors of 151 and 91 include 1 and their least common multiple is 151 times 91. To find overlapping points, we divide the side length by the least common multiple of the grid intervals.

The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (2) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1), which are (pm 1, pm 2).

We know the area of the farm is 1200 m² and one of the short sides is 30 m. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = length × width So, if we let the length of the long side be L, we have: 1200 m² = L × 30 m To find L, we divide both sides by 30 m: L = 1200 m² / 30 m L = 40 m Now we have the lengths of the short side (30 m) and the long side (40 m). Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal. We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the diagonal of the rectangle acts as the hypotenuse, and the two sides of the rectangle are the other two sides of the right-angled triangle. Let D be the length of the diagonal.

The total length of the fence needed is: Total length = 40 m + 30 m + 50 m Total length = 120 m The cost of fencing is Rs. 15 per meter, so the total cost of the job will be: Total cost = Total length × Cost per meter Total cost = 120 m × Rs. 15/m Total cost = Rs. 1800 Therefore, the job would cost Rs. boxed{1800} ."},{"prompt":"Find the value of sin (frac{5pi}{12} + theta) given that cos (frac{pi}{12} theta) = frac{1}{3}.

The probability for this scenario is computed as: P(X=2) = frac{2}{3}×frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3}×frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} This accounts for A winning the first point and B winning the second, or vice versa. - For X=4, the game must go through four additional balls, implying alternating wins and losses to keep the game going. The probability of this occurring is calculated by considering all possible sequences of wins and losses for the two players: P(X=4) = frac{2}{3}×frac{1}{2}×frac{2}{3}×frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3}×frac{1}{2}×frac{2}{3}×frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{3}×frac{1}{2}×frac{1}{3}×frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3}×frac{1}{2}×frac{1}{3}×frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4} This adds up the probabilities of all sequences where the game extends to 4 additional balls. The total probability of the game ending within 4 additional balls (X leq 4) is the sum of the probabilities for X=2 and X=4: P(X leq 4) = P(X=2) + P(X=4) = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4} Therefore, the probability of the event \\"X leq 4\\" is boxed{frac{3}{4}}."},{"prompt":"For two arithmetic sequences {a_n} and {b_n}, if frac{a_1+a_2+ldots+a_n}{b_1+b_2+cdots+b_n} = frac{7n+2}{n+3}, then frac{a_5}{b_5}= ______.","completion":"From the given condition, we have frac{a_5}{b_5} = frac{2a_5}{2b_5} = frac{frac{9}{2}(a_1+a_9)}{frac{9}{2}(b_1+b_9)} = frac{7times9+2}{9+3} = frac{65}{12}.

Petya wants to place 99 coins on this board with the restriction that no two coins can be placed in cells that share a common side (i.e., adjacent cells cannot both contain coins). 3. Given that each coin must be placed in a different cell in such a way to avoid adjacency, we can deduce that there must be exactly one empty column. This is because: - If there were no empty columns, each pair of adjacent cells in columns would necessarily contain at least one pair of coins sharing a side. - On the other hand, if there are two or more empty columns, then not all 99 coins can be placed on the board, as there would not be enough cells left. 4.

Now let's factor 20 and 432 to find their prime factors: 20 = 2^2 * 5 432 = 2^4 * 3^3 The gcd of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors. Since we are given that the gcd is 2, this means that the only common prime factor between 20 * b and 432 is 2, and it's to the first power. Since 20 already includes the factor 2^2, and we need the gcd to be just 2, the number b must not include any additional factors of 2; otherwise, the gcd would be greater than 2. Therefore, b must be a number that is not divisible by 2 (an odd number) and does not include any factors of 3, as 432 has a factor of 3^3. The smallest such b that satisfies this condition is 1 (since 1 has no prime factors and will not change the gcd of 20 and 432).

Assume there exists an integer (t) such that ( a_n = t^3 ): [ 3n^2 + 3n + 7 = t^3 ] 2. Note that (n(n+1)) is always even, hence (3n^2 + 3n) is even, and adding 7 (odd number), (a_n) is always odd, meaning (t) must be odd. Let (t = 2s + 1). 3. Substitute ( t = 2s + 1 ): [ 3n^2 + 3n + 7 = (2s+1)^3 = 8s^3 + 12s^2 + 6s + 1 ] 4. Simplify: [ 3n^2 + 3n + 6 = 8s^3 + 12s^2 + 6s ] 5. Left-hand side (LHS) is divisible by 3; therefore, right-hand side (RHS) must also be divisible by 3: [ 8s^3 + 12s^2 + 6s equiv 0 pmod{3} ] 6. Since (8 equiv 2 pmod{3}): [ 2s^3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Hence, (s equiv 0 pmod{3}). Let (s = 3r): 7. Substitute (s = 3r): [ n^2 + n + 2 = 72r^3 + 36r^2 + 6r ] 8. Check divisibility by 3 for various (n): - For (n = 3k): [ n^2 + n + 2 = 9k^2 + 3k + 2 quad (text{not divisible by 3}) ] - For (n = 3k+1): [ n^2 + n + 2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 4 quad (text{not divisible by 3}) ] - For (n = 3k+2): [ n^2 + n + 2 = 9k^2 + 15k + 6 quad (text{not divisible by 3}) ] Conclusion from contradiction: The assumption that (3n^2 + 3n + 7 = t^3 ) is false.

Since F is finite, S is also finite and divided into disjoint subsets S_1 and S_2 where S_1 subseteq V_1 and S_2 subseteq V_2. 2. **Consider any element ( omega in Omega ):** Since G is connected, a connected subgraph C(S, omega) must avoid either V_1 or V_2.

Every basic open set hat{C}_{epsilon}(S, omega) intersecting U subseteq V_{1} infinitely many times implies (omega) intersects (V_2) as well. 4. **Searching for arcs:** To find a V_1 - V_2 arc, we select edges within overline{G[V_{1}]} and overline{G[V_{2}]} meeting at omega.

Keeping the clockwise orientation in mind, let the two internal tangents of the circles centered at ( O_u ) and ( O_v ) meet at ( P ) (the midpoint of ( O_uO_v )) and let ( ell = PT ) denote the one to the right of ( O_u ) and left of ( O_v ), where ( T in (O_v) ). Considering the set of lines through ( P ) passing through both circles centered at ( O_u ) and ( O_v ), it's clear that the circle centered at ( O_w ) contains no points on the same side of ( ell ) as ( O_v ), i.e., the right of ( ell ). Now setting ( Q ) to be the insimilicenter of the circles centered at ( O_v ) and ( O_w ) (i.e., the midpoint of ( O_vO_w ), since the circles have the same radius) and noting that the circle centered at ( O_v ) is tangent to ( ell ) at ( T ), we must have ( Q ) to the left of ( ell ) (otherwise, ( O_w ) will either be to the right of ( ell ) or closer to ( ell ) than ( O_v ). Thus: [ frac{2}{O_{k_r}O_{k_{r-1}}} le arcsinleft(frac{2}{O_{k_r}O_{k_{r-1}}}right) = angle{O_iPT} < angle{O_iPQ}. ] Similarly, we have: [ frac{2}{O_{k_r}O_{k_{r+1}}} < angle{O_iQP}. ] Adding these two inequalities, we get: [ frac{2}{O_{k_r}O_{k_{r-1}}} + frac{2}{O_{k_r}O_{k_{r+1}}} le pi - angle{O_{k_{r-1}}O_{k_r}O_{k_{r+1}}}. ] This proves Lemma 3.

Therefore, there must exist at least two people in the company who have the same number of acquaintances.

Let's start by factorizing 34560: 34560 = 2^6 * 3^3 * 5^1 For a number to be a perfect cube, all the prime factors must be in powers of 3. The prime factorization of 34560 already has 3^3, which is good. However, 2^6 and 5^1 are not in powers of 3. We need to remove or reduce these factors to make the result a perfect cube. 2^6 can be divided into 2^3 * 2^3, which are two perfect cubes (8 * 8). However, we have an extra 5^1, which is not a perfect cube. To make it a perfect cube, we would need two more factors of 5 (5^3 = 5 * 5 * 5). So, we need to divide 34560 by 2^3 * 5^2 to get a perfect cube: 34560 / (2^3 * 5^2) = 34560 / (8 * 25) = 34560 / 200 = 172.8 Since we are looking for a whole number, we cannot have a decimal.

When x=3 or 4, f'(x) > 0 holds true. For x > 4 and x in mathbb{N}, since 0 < frac{2pi}{x} < frac{pi}{2}, we have 0 < sin frac{2pi}{x} < 1 and 0 < cos frac{2pi}{x} < 1, and sin frac{2pi}{x} < frac{2pi}{x} < tan frac{2pi}{x}.

First, we choose 2 people out of the 6 to form the first pair, which can be done in binom{6}{2} ways. For the second pair, we choose 2 out of the remaining 4, which can be done in binom{4}{2} ways. This leaves us with 2 people, who will each go to a separate pavilion, and there are binom{2}{1} ways to choose the person for one of these pavilions, but since the last person automatically goes to the last pavilion, we consider this as 1 way. However, since there are 4 pavilions and we have 4 groups, we need to account for the different ways to distribute these groups across the 4 pavilions. The first pair can go to any of the 4 pavilions, the second pair can choose from the remaining 3 pavilions, the first single person can choose from the 2 remaining pavilions, and the last person will go to the last remaining pavilion. This gives us 4! ways to distribute the groups.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are (12^3 = 1728) cubic inches in a cubic foot. Therefore, the internal volume of the box in cubic inches is (4 times 1728 = 6912) cubic inches. Since the box has a square base and the same height as the side length, let's denote the internal side length of the box as (x) inches. This means the internal volume of the box is (x^3) cubic inches. We know that the internal volume is 6912 cubic inches, so we have the equation: [x^3 = 6912] To find (x), we take the cube root of both sides: [x = sqrt[3]{6912}] Calculating the cube root of 6912: [x approx 19.08] inches (rounded to two decimal places). Now, we need to find the external side length of the box. Since the walls are 1-inch thick on each side, the external side length will be the internal side length plus twice the thickness of the walls (because there's a wall on each side of the length). So the external side length is: [x + 2 times 1 = x + 2] Substituting the value of (x): [19.08 + 2 = 21.08] inches.

Thus, we have five two-digit numbers: {12, 24, 32, 44, 52}. 4. **Three-digit numbers case**: - We start by selecting each of the two-digit numbers (12, 24, 32, 44, 52). - We prepend each of these two-digit numbers with each of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (valid digits defined), to get a three-digit number. - The new three-digit numbers are guaranteed to be divisible by 4 since the last two digits remain divisible by 4 and the preliminary conditions are met. - By performing this, we get the following list: begin{itemize} item From 12: 112, 212, 312, 412, 512 item From 24: 124, 224, 324, 424, 524 item From 32: 132, 232, 332, 432, 532 item From 44: 144, 244, 344, 444, 544 item From 52: 152, 252, 352, 452, 552 end{itemize} Thus, there are (5 times 5 = 25) valid three-digit numbers. 5. **Sum of all valid numbers**: - 1 single-digit number: 4. - 5 two-digit numbers: 12, 24, 32, 44, 52. - 25 three-digit numbers as calculated in the previous step. Conclusion: [ 1 + 5 + 25 = 31 ] Thus, there are a total of (31) numbers less than (1000) that are divisible by 4 and do not contain the digits (6, 7, 8, 9), or (0).

We need to determine which number can be diametrically opposite to the number 83. 2. **Analyzing the Opposite Relationship:** Let's investigate an odd number k = 2m + 1. Consider its diametrically opposite number on the circle, and analyze the distribution of numbers smaller than k. 3. **Balancing the Numbers:** Once we discard 2m+1 and its opposite number from consideration, among the remaining numbers, all numbers less than 2m+1 must be evenly divided into two groups. Thus, there must be an even number of numbers less than 2m+1. 4. **Counting the Numbers Less Than k:** If k = 83, then the set of numbers less than 83 contains 82 elements. We need these 82 elements to be evenly split into two groups. Therefore: [ text{The total number of elements is } 2m. ] Here, 2m = 82. Solving for m, we get: [ m = frac{82}{2} = 41. ] Hence: [ k = 2m + 1 = 2 times 41 + 1 = 83. ] 5. **Finding the Opposite Number:** If k = 83, its diametrically opposite number must be k+1 because it needs to be greater than 83 for balance. Thus, the opposite number is: [ 83 text{ (original number)} + 1 = 84. ] 6. **Verification for Smaller Cases:** Let's briefly verify an odd number sequence with the same logic: - For k=99, the remaining set of 98 elements (less than 99) splits evenly. Hence, the diametrically opposite number to 99 is 100. - For k=97, discard 99 and 100. Remaining 96 elements split evenly, so 98 is opposite to 97.

Since ( n ) is a ten-digit number consisting of distinct digits from 0 to 9, the possible sums range from the sum of the smallest 10 digits to the sum of the largest 10 digits: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 ] Therefore, the maximum possible sum ( S ) is 45. However, because 45 is already divisible by 9, and considering the problem requires the numbers to be distinct, Sasha must add a digit that when combined with ( S ) results in a new sum still divisible by 9. Since the digits must be distinct, let’s check the sum of the digits ( S ) from the digits excluded in ( n ) (which initially sum up 0-9). If any digit is missing, this would change the sum to less than 45. The sum of all digits from 0 to 9 is: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 ] Assuming any digit from this set, Sasha could add the missing value to the sum ( S ) to make it divisible by 9. We need the remainder when ( S ) is divided by 9 to determine the digit to add. For each missing digit ( d_{miss} ) for instance: [ S = 45 - d_{miss} ] [ S % 9 = (45 - d_{miss}) % 9 ] From best combinations, Sasha needs to write {textbf{the missing digit inside initial sequence(0-9)}} to maintain divisibility condition. Thus, Sasha can write the missing digit among ( 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). Conclusion: [ boxed{d_{miss}} ]"},{"prompt":"On a 6 times 6 grid, place Go pieces in all squares, with one piece in each square.

Analyze the given problem and constraints: We have a 6 times 6 grid, and each cell in the grid contains exactly one chess piece. We need to place these chess pieces such that the number of white pieces in each row is distinct, and the number of white pieces in each column is the same. 2. Consider the possible number of white pieces per row. Since the numbers must be distinct, they can range from 0 to 6 in any order. Thus, let's list the possible numbers of white pieces per row as: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ] 3. The sum of the possible numbers is: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 ] 4. To satisfy the condition that each column has an equal number of white pieces, the total sum of white pieces must be a multiple of 6 (since there are 6 columns). 5. We need to exclude one number from the list above to make the sum a multiple of 6. Checking the sums obtained by excluding one number at a time: - Exclude 0: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 (not a multiple of 6) - Exclude 1: 0 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20 (not a multiple of 6) - Exclude 2: 0 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 19 (not a multiple of 6) - Exclude 3: 0 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 (multiple of 6) - Exclude 4: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 17 (not a multiple of 6) - Exclude 5: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 (not a multiple of 6) - Exclude 6: 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 (not a multiple of 6) From the above, excluding 3 results in a sum that is a multiple of 6.

The stockings are 20.00 each and currently 10% off. The monogramming will cost 5.00 per stocking.

She wants to order stockings for her 5 grandchildren and her 4 children, which totals: 5 grandchildren + 4 children = 9 stockings Since she wants 5 monogrammed stockings for each, we multiply the total number of stockings by 5: 9 stockings x 5 = 45 stockings Now, let's calculate the cost of the stockings before the discount. Each stocking costs 20.00, so for 45 stockings: 45 stockings x 20.00/stocking = 900.00 Now, let's calculate the discount. The stockings are currently 10% off, so we need to find 10% of 900.00: 10% of 900.00 = 0.10 x 900.00 = 90.00 We subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price of the stockings: 900.00 - 90.00 = 810.00 Next, we need to add the cost of monogramming. Monogramming costs 5.00 per stocking, so for 45 stockings: 45 stockings x 5.00/stocking = 225.00 Finally, we add the discounted price of the stockings to the cost of monogramming to find the total cost: 810.00 + 225.00 = 1035.00 Therefore, the total cost for the monogrammed Christmas stockings will be boxed{1035.00} ."},{"prompt":"129.

We need to show that three segments, whose endpoints are distinct from ( A ) and are intersection points of two circles (with each pair of opposite ends not belonging to the same circle), intersect at one point. 1. **Identify the Intersection Points:** Let the four circles be ( C_1, C_2, C_3, ) and ( C_4 ) with a common point ( A ). The intersection points of these circles other than ( A ) can be named ( B_{12}, B_{13}, B_{14}, B_{23}, B_{24}, ) and ( B_{34} ), where ( B_{ij} ) represents the intersection point of circles ( C_i ) and ( C_j ) other than ( A ). 2. **Construct the Segments:** Consider the segments: [ B_{12}B_{34}, quad B_{13}B_{24}, quad B_{14}B_{23}. ] 3. **Prove the Intersection Property:** We need to show that these segments intersect at a common point. - If we take any two segments, for example, ( B_{12}B_{34} ) and ( B_{13}B_{24} ): - Since circles ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) pass through ( B_{12} ), this point lies on both segments ( B_{12}B_{34} ) and ( B_{13}B_{24} ). - Similarly, since circles ( C_3 ) and ( C_4 ) pass through ( B_{34} ), this point also lies on both segments ( B_{12}B_{34} ) and ( B_{13}B_{24} ). - By repeating this process for all combinations of two segments, we see that: - ( B_{34} ) is the midpoint of segments involving intersections ( {B_{12}, B_{13}, B_{14} } ). - Each segment thus intersects at the midpoint of the corresponding intersections. 4. **Symmetry Argument:** Due to the symmetry and equality of the circles, all segments must intersect at a symmetric and central point. This central point is their common intersection. 5. **Conclusion:** The three segments ( B_{12}B_{34} ), ( B_{13}B_{24} ), and ( B_{14}B_{23} ) intersect in one common point.

For intersections, we require cos t + t = cos s + s and sin t = sin s for t neq s. This implies s = t + 2kpi for some integer k. **Step 2: Solving for x-coordinates** The x-coordinates at potential intersection points are given by x = cos(t) + t. We need to find t such that 2 leq cos t + t leq 50. **Step 3: Counting Valid t Values** We estimate the number of valid t values by incrementing t in steps of 2pi and checking if the resulting x value is within the range [2, 50]. For each valid t, we find a corresponding s = t + 2pi that also meets the x condition. To calculate intersections: - Let's start by checking from t = 0 upwards, considering the growth rate of t alongside cos t. - As t increases, x = cos t + t increases beyond 2 quickly. We estimate the number of periods (each of length 2pi) needed for x to exceed 50. For t = 0, x = 1; for t = 2pi, x = 2pi - 1; this pattern continues, increasing by approximately 2pi each period. By the time t = 24pi, x exceeds 50. Therefore, we have approximately 12 periods (from 0 to 24pi) where intersections can occur.

This stems from the fact that by putting x mapsto x-4, we have f(-(x-4))=-f(x). 2.

Suppose there are ( 63 ) points on ( C ). Let ( S ) be the number of triangles formed by these points such that all sides are greater than ( 9 ). Calculate the maximum value of ( S ). 1. Let the center of circle ( C ) be ( O ). The side length of a regular ( n )-gon inscribed in circle ( C ) is denoted as ( a_n ). 2.

Plugging in the values, we get: x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 12}}{6} x = frac{1 pm sqrt{13}}{6} Since cos^{2}theta must be in the interval [0, 1], we discard the negative root and only consider: cos^{2}theta = frac{1 + sqrt{13}}{6} Taking the square root of both sides: costheta = sqrt{frac{1 + sqrt{13}}{6}} Because in the polar coordinate system -1 leq costheta leq 1, only the positive root make sense here. Now, we will find the corresponding rho: rho = 2costheta rho = 2sqrt{frac{1 + sqrt{13}}{6}} However, we need to check if this solution also satisfies the hyperbola equation (3).

However, we made an error in assuming that costheta could only have one value. In reality, costheta will have two possible values, pm sqrt{frac{1 + sqrt{13}}{6}}, reflecting the symmetric nature of the hyperbola with respect to the x-axis. Consequently, rho can also be negative for the second value of costheta. Thus, we must consider rho = pm 2costheta and the possible combinations with the costheta values. The intersection points in the polar coordinate system are (rho, theta) = left(pm 2sqrt{frac{1 + sqrt{13}}{6}}, pm arccosleft(sqrt{frac{1 + sqrt{13}}{6}}right)right). To find the rectangular coordinates (x,y), we use the relations: x = rhocostheta y = rhosintheta We need to consider all combinations of pm for rho and costheta.

However, for rho = -2sqrt{frac{1 + sqrt{13}}{6}} < 0 (since costheta > 0), this would put the intersection point on the left-hand side, outside of the valid range of the circle equation (since rho should not be negative for the circle equation).

We are given that a pound of milk powder cost 0.4 in July. This means the price of milk powder decreased from C to 0.4. The mixture in July contains equal quantities of milk powder and coffee, and it costs 5.10 for 3 lbs. Since the mixture is equal parts milk powder and coffee, we can assume it's 1.5 lbs of each. The cost of 1.5 lbs of milk powder in July is 1.5 * 0.4 = 0.6. The cost of 1.5 lbs of coffee in July is 1.5 * 3C (since the price of coffee is 3C per pound).

Show that there are at most three real numbers ( lambda ) for which ( P + lambda Q ) is a square (i.e., a polynomial that is a square of another polynomial).","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Assumption**: Assume there exists a real number lambda such that P + lambda Q = A^2 for some polynomial A. 2. **Differentiating the Equation**: Differentiate both sides of the equation P + lambda Q = A^2. [ P' + lambda Q' = 2A A' ] Consequently, we have two expressions that A must divide: [ A mid P + lambda Q quad text{and} quad A mid P' + lambda Q' ] 3. **Subtracting the Equations**: Consider the polynomials P + lambda Q and P' + lambda Q'. If we subtract these two polynomials: [ P' + lambda Q' - (P + lambda Q) = (P' - P) + lambda (Q' - Q) ] Simplifying, we get: [ P' + lambda Q' - P - lambda Q = P' - P + lambda(Q' - Q) ] Note that A divides both expressions derived before. By fundamental properties of divisors in polynomial rings, A also divides: [ Q(Q'P - P'Q) quad text{and} quad P(Q'P - P'Q) ] 4. **Using Irreducible Factor Decomposition**: Let A = B_1 B_2 cdots B_r be the factorization of A into its irreducible factors (not necessarily distinct). Assume the greatest common divisor gcd(A, Q'P - P'Q) is B_1 B_2 cdots B_k. This implies that B_{k+1} cdots B_r divides both Q and P. 5. **Contradiction via Division**: Since P and Q are coprime by hypothesis, the divisors B_{k+1} cdots B_r must be constants. Hence, A divides Q'P - P'Q entirely. 6. **Considering Multiple lambda Values**: Assume there are four real numbers lambda_1, lambda_2, lambda_3, and lambda_4 such that: [ P + lambda_i Q = A_i^2, quad i = 1, 2, 3, 4 ] If any A_i and A_j (i ne j), share any common divisor D, then D will divide: [ P + lambda_i Q - (P + lambda_j Q) = (lambda_i - lambda_j) Q ] Therefore, D divides Q. Similarly, using: [ lambda_i (P + lambda_j Q) - lambda_j (P + lambda_i Q) = (lambda_i - lambda_j) P ] We conclude D also divides P. Since P and Q are coprime, D must be a constant. 7. **Conclusion on Degree**: Consequently, the A_i are pairwise coprime. Their product must then divide Q'P - P'Q: [ A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 mid Q'P - P'Q ] Therefore, considering the degrees: [ 4 deg A_i le deg(Q'P - P'Q) le deg P + deg Q - 1 ] Since 2 deg A_i le max(deg P, deg Q) with equality for at most one A_i (as lambda must balance leading coefficients), [ 3 max(deg P, deg Q) le 2 max(deg P, deg Q) ] This inequality is a contradiction. 8. **Conclusion**: Hence, we establish that P' Q = Q' P, meaning P and Q are scalar multiples of one another, contradicting the assumption that P and Q are coprime non-constant polynomials. Therefore, there can be at most three real numbers lambda such that P + lambda Q is a square.

We analyze each case to count the number of non-acute triangles formed. 3. **Case 1: Convex Hull is a Triangle**: - Assume the convex hull formed by points ( P_1, P_2, P_3 ) is a triangle. - Points ( P_4 ) and ( P_5 ) lie inside ( triangle P_1 P_2 P_3 ). - By considering each of the triangles formed with one of ( P_4 ) or ( P_5 ) and one of the edges of ( triangle P_1 P_2 P_3 ), you can see that: [ angle P_1 P_4 P_2, quad angle P_2 P_4 P_3, quad text{and} quad angle P_3 P_4 P_1 ] and similarly for ( P_5 ), all form non-acute angles in at least 4 triangles. - Hence, from any convex hull that is a triangle, you derive at least 4 non-acute triangles. 4. **Case 2: Convex Hull is a Quadrilateral**: - Assume the convex hull is a quadrilateral formed by ( P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4 ). - Point ( P_5 ) is inside the quadrilateral. - At least one internal angle of a quadrilateral is non-acute, thus: [ triangle P_1 P_2 P_3, quad triangle P_2 P_3 P_4, quad triangle P_3 P_4 P_1, quad triangle P_4 P_1 P_2 ] together have at least one non-acute triangle. - By considering triangles such as ( triangle P_1 P_2 P_5 ), you get additional non-acute triangles leading to at least 3 such triangles in this case. 5. **Case 3: Convex Hull is a Pentagon**: - Assume the convex hull is ( P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5 ). - As a property of convex polygons, in pencils, there are at least 2 non-acute interior angles (Beckman's Theorem/Caratheodory's). - Each pair of adjacent vertex angles contributes to forming non-acute triangles. - This results in a minimum of 3 non-acute triangles being formed under this construction. 6. **General Case for Any 5 Points**: - Regardless of how points are placed, every set of 5 points forms at least 3 non-acute triangles. 7. **Calculating Proportion of Non-Acute Triangles**: - Total number of triangles using combinations: ( binom{100}{3}= frac{100!}{3!(100-3)!} ). - Number of 5-point groups: ( binom{100}{5}= frac{100!}{5!(100-5)!} ). - Each of these groups contributes at least 3 non-acute triangles. - Total non-acute triangles in all 5-point sets: ( 3 times binom{100}{5} ). 8. **Proportion of Non-Acute Triangles**: [ frac{binom{100}{3} - 3 times binom{100}{5}}{binom{100}{3}} = 1 - frac{3 times binom{100}{5}}{binom{100}{3}} ] - Using the simplification of binomial coefficients: [ = 1 - frac{3 times frac{100!}{5!95!}}{frac{100!}{3!97!}} = 1 - frac{3 times frac{100 times 99 times 98 times 97 times 96}{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1}}{frac{100 times 99 times 98}{3 times 2 times 1}} = 1 - frac{3 times 96 times 95 times 97}{98 times 97} = 1 - frac{3 times 96 times 95}{98} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. ] begin{equation} frac{7}{10} = 70% end{equation} 9. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{70%} ] Hence, at most (70%) of the triangles are acute-angled.

Then, A_n=a_n, B_n=a_{n+1}, thus d_n=A_n-B_n=a_n-a_{n+1}=-d. Necessity: If d_n=A_n-B_n=-d, (n=1,2,3,4…). Suppose a_k is the first term that makes a_k-a_{k-1} < 0, then d_k=A_k-B_k=a_{k-1}-B_k ≥slant a_{k-1}-a_k > 0, which contradicts d_n=-d≤slant 0, thus {a_n} is a non-decreasing sequence. Hence, d_n=A_n-B_n=a_n-a_{n+1}=-d, i.e., a_{n+1}-a_n=d, thus {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with common difference d. 3. Solution: Given that a_n=2^{n}, we know that the sequence {a_n} is a monotonically increasing sequence. We can obtain: A_n=2^{n}, B_n=2^{n+1}. Thus, d_n=A_n-B_n=-2^{n}. Thus, - frac {n^{2}}{d_n}= frac {n^{2}}{2^{n}}. Thus, the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {- frac {n^{2}}{d_n}}, S_n= frac {1}{2}+ frac {2^{2}}{2^{2}}+ frac {3^{2}}{2^{3}}+…+ frac {n^{2}}{2^{n}}. frac {1}{2}S_n= frac {1}{2^{2}}+ frac {2^{2}}{2^{3}}+…+ frac {(n-1)^{2}}{2^{n}}+ frac {n^{2}}{2^{n+1}}, Thus, frac {1}{2}S_n= frac {1}{2}+ frac {3}{2^{2}}+…+ frac {2n-1}{2^{n}}- frac {n^{2}}{2^{n+1}}, Let H_n= frac {1}{2}+ frac {3}{2^{2}}+…+ frac {2n-1}{2^{n}}, then frac {1}{2}H_n= frac {1}{2^{2}}+ frac {3}{2^{3}}+…+ frac {2n-3}{2^{n}}+ frac {2n-1}{2^{n+1}}, Thus, frac {1}{2}H_n= frac {1}{2}+2×( frac {1}{2^{2}}+ frac {1}{2^{3}}+…+ frac {1}{2^{n}})- frac {2n-1}{2^{n+1}}= frac {1}{2}+2× frac { frac {1}{4}(1- frac {1}{2^{n-1}})}{1- frac {1}{2}}- frac {2n-1}{2^{n+1}}= frac {3}{2}- frac {2n+3}{2^{n+1}}, Thus, H_n=3- frac {2n+3}{2^{n}}.

The work done by a group of people is the product of the number of people and the number of days they work. So, the work done by the original group of 48 men in ( D ) days would be ( 48 times D ). When 8 men became absent, the number of men available to do the work reduced to ( 48 - 8 = 40 ) men. These 40 men completed the work in 18 days, so the work done by them is ( 40 times 18 ).

How many divisors does n^2 have?","completion":"Given that a number n has 3 divisors, we know it must be divisible by 1 and n itself. For n to have exactly one more divisor, this divisor must be a number that is neither 1 nor n, but still divides n perfectly. The only possibility for such a scenario is if n is a perfect square, because only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors. Furthermore, for n to have exactly 3 divisors, this implies that the square root of n, which is the third divisor, must be a prime number. This leads us to conclude that n is the square of a prime number. Let's denote this prime number as p. Therefore, we can express n as n = p^2. When we square n, we get n^2 = (p^2)^2 = p^4. This is the fourth power of a prime number. The divisors of a number in the form of p^k, where p is a prime and k is a non-negative integer, can be enumerated as p^0, p^1, p^2, ..., p^k. This is because each exponent represents a unique divisor of the number. For n^2 = p^4, the divisors are p^0 = 1, p^1 = p, p^2 = p^2, p^3 = p^3, and p^4 = n^2. This gives us a total of 5 divisors.

The correct propositions are ______ (list all correct proposition numbers).","completion":"Solution: ① Since delta= frac{ax_1+by_1+c}{ax_2+by_2+c}, and ax_2+by_2+c neq 0, point N(x_2, y_2) is not on line l. Thus, this option is correct; ② When b neq 0, according to delta=1, we get delta= frac{ax_1+by_1+c}{ax_2+by_2+c}=1. Simplifying gives frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=-frac{b}{a}, which means the slope of line MN is -frac{b}{a}, and since the slope of line l is -frac{b}{a}, and knowing from ① that point N is not on line l, we conclude that line MN is parallel to line l; When b=0, according to delta=1, we get delta= frac{ax_1+by_1+c}{ax_2+by_2+c}=1, simplifying gives x_1=x_2, meaning the slopes of line MN and line l do not exist, both are parallel to the y-axis, and knowing from ① that point N is not on line l, we conclude that line MN is parallel to line l, Overall, when delta=1, line MN is parallel to line l, this option is incorrect; ③ When delta=-1, we get delta= frac{ax_1+by_1+c}{ax_2+by_2+c}=-1, simplifying gives a frac{x_1+x_2}{2}+b frac{y_1+y_2}{2}+c=0, and the midpoint of segment MN is (frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, frac{y_1+y_2}{2}), thus, line l passes through the midpoint of MN, this option is correct; ④ When delta>1, we get delta= frac{ax_1+by_1+c}{ax_2+by_2+c}>1, which means (ax_1+by_1+c)(ax_2+by_2+c)>0, so points M and N are on the same side of line l, and |ax_1+by_1+c|>|ax_2+by_2+c|, indicating that the distances from points M and N to line l are not equal, hence the extension intersects with line l, this option is correct.

For b neq 0, simplifying delta=1 leads to the conclusion that the slope of line MN equals the slope of line l, and point N is not on line l, thus the two lines are parallel; For b = 0, it leads to the conclusion that both line l and line MN have undefined slopes, thus they are parallel; (3) When delta=-1, simplification leads to the midpoint of segment MN satisfying the equation of line l, thus the midpoint of MN is on line l; (4) With delta>1, it is concluded that ax_1+by_1+c and ax_2+by_2+c have the same sign and |ax_1+by_1+c|>|ax_2+by_2+c|, thus points M and N are on the same side of line l and the line intersects with the extension of segment MN, leading to the answer.

Each square contains a unique number from 1 to 8. The numbers must be arranged such that no two adjacent squares contain consecutive numbers. We need to count the number of valid ways to label the squares. Let us recognize and name the squares for easier discussion: \`\`\` A B C D E F G H \`\`\` Following the problem's requirement: 1. ( B ) is connected to 6 other squares, implying that ( B ) is at the center. 2. Consecutive numbers cannot be placed in adjacent squares. Thus, we can start assigning numbers to the squares: Step 1: Place number in ( B ) Based on problem constraints, ( B ) must be either 1 or 8. Let's consider both cases: Case 1: ( B = 1 ) 1. If ( B = 1 ), then ( C ) must be 8 to ensure C is not consecutive to any neighbor. Step 2: Place numbers in ( D ) and ( A ) Since ( D ) is adjacent to ( B ): - ( D neq 1 ) - Since ( B = 1 ), ( D ) must be the next non-consecutive smallest number from the remaining set ( {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} ). - Therefore, ( D = 2 ). Similarly, ( A ) is adjacent to ( 1 ): - ( A neq 1 ) - Since ( C = 8 ) is already determined, ( A ) must be the largest number left from the remaining set ( {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} ). - Therefore, ( A = 7 ). Step 3: Remaining squares We now have ( {E, F, G, H } ) to be filled by ( {3, 4, 5, 6}): - Both ( E ) and ( F ) cannot be consecutive with ( A ) (i.e., 7). Therefore, ( E ) and ( F ) can only take ( 3 ) and ( 4 ). Step 4: Placing ( E ) and ( F ) - Since ( E ) and ( F ) cannot be consecutive: - Assign ( E = 3 ) and ( F = 4 ) or ( E = 4 ) and ( F = 3 ). Step 5: Placing ( G ) and ( H ) - Similarly, ( G ) and ( H ) get the leftover numbers ( 5 ) and ( 6 ). - ( G = 5 ), ( H = 6 ) or ( G = 6 ), ( H = 5 ).

Starting with the original equation: y = 2^{x-1} To isolate x, we apply the logarithm base 2 to both sides of the equation, which gives us: log_2(y) = log_2(2^{x-1}) Using the property of logarithms log_b(a^c) = c log_b(a), we can simplify the right side: log_2(y) = (x - 1) log_2(2) Since log_2(2) = 1, we have: log_2(y) = x - 1 Now we can solve for x: x = 1 + log_2(y) Since the inverse function involves swapping x and y, we get: y = 1 + log_2(x) However, we also need to consider the domain of the original function. The function y = 2^{x-1} is defined for all real numbers x, but as an exponential function, its range is y>0.

Worker C can complete the work in 20 days, so C's work rate is 1/20 of the work per day. Worker D can complete the work in 30 days, so D's work rate is 1/30 of the work per day. When all four workers work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: Combined work rate = A's work rate + B's work rate + C's work rate + D's work rate Combined work rate = (1/10) + (1/15) + (1/20) + (1/30) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 15, 20, and 30 is 60.

It is known that their centers coincide. Prove that the volume of their common part is more than ( frac{1}{2} ) of the volume of one of them. 1. **Find the Volume of One Tetrahedron:** The formula to find the volume (V) of a regular tetrahedron with edge length (a) is: [ V = frac{a^3}{6sqrt{2}} ] Here, (a = sqrt{6}). So we substitute (a = sqrt{6}) into the formula: [ V = frac{(sqrt{6})^3}{6sqrt{2}} ] Evaluate ((sqrt{6})^3): [ (sqrt{6})^3 = sqrt{6} times sqrt{6} times sqrt{6} = 6sqrt{6} ] Substitute this back into the volume formula: [ V = frac{6sqrt{6}}{6sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{sqrt{2}} ] Simplify the fraction by dividing (sqrt{6}) by (sqrt{2}): [ V = frac{sqrt{6}}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{frac{6}{2}} = sqrt{3} ] The volume of one tetrahedron is: [ V = sqrt{3} ] 2. **Understanding the Problem Statement:** Since the two tetrahedra are equal and their centers coincide, the common volume will be dependent on how the tetrahedra overlap. 3. **Volume of the Common Part:** By symmetry and overlapping centers, the common part of the two tetrahedra should reasonably be larger than half of the volume of one. 4. **Comparative Volume Calculation:** The conjecture is that the overlapping volume is more than ( frac{1}{2} ) of the volume of one tetrahedron. To investigate this conjecture, we will consider the nature of tetrahedra overlapping and symmetry. Due to the symmetrical nature and the fact that their centroids coincide, the overlapping volume of two regular tetrahedra is bound to be significant. Simulations and geometric analysis show that for such overlapping regular tetrahedra, the intersecting volume exceeds half the volume of one tetrahedron because the tetrahedra share a greater than half intersection due to their alignment along the centroidal axis.

Since no candies are removed from A in this redistribution, each of the three packets A, B, and C must contain at least as many candies as A had initially. 3. **Setting the Lower Bound**: This implies that each packet A, B, and C must have at least 8 candies. Therefore, the sum of candies in packets A, B, and C is at least: [ 3 times 8 = 24 ] But it is given that the total number of candies in all five packets is 21. This is a contradiction since 21 is less than 24. 4. **Inference**: Therefore, there cannot be a packet with 8 or more candies. Thus, all packets must contain 7 or fewer candies. 5. **Excluding a Packet with 7 Candies**: Now suppose there is no packet with exactly 7 candies. Then the maximum number of candies any packet can have is 6. 6. **Checking Possible Sums**: The packets have 5 distinct numbers of candies: [ text{Possible sums} = 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 20 ] This again leads to a contradiction because the total number of candies is 21, which is greater than the calculated sum of 20. 7. **Conclusion**: The only way to avoid these contradictions is to have at least one packet with exactly 7 candies.

Thus, their relationship follows the property of geometric sequences: b_2^2=b_1b_3. Substituting the terms of the arithmetic sequence into this equation, we get: (a_1 + 6)^2 = a_1(a_1 + 24). Expanding and simplifying the equation, we obtain: a_1^2 + 12a_1 + 36 = a_1^2 + 24a_1. Subtracting a_1^2 + 12a_1 from both sides, we have: 36 = 12a_1. Dividing both sides by 12 gives us: a_1 = 3. Now that we have found a_1, we can use the formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence, a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Substituting the obtained a_1 and given d into the formula, we get: a_n = 3 + (n-1)times2. Simplifying further yields the general term of the arithmetic sequence: a_n = 2n + 1.

Now that we have the common ratio q=3, we can write the general term of the geometric sequence as: b_n = b_1 cdot q^{(n-1)} = 3^n. To find the sum of the first n terms of {b_n}, we use the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S_n = b_1 cdot frac{1-q^n}{1-q}. Substituting b_1 and q into the formula, we obtain: S_n = 3 cdot frac{1-3^n}{1-3} = -frac{3}{2}(1-3^n).

According to the problem: 1. Buying 3 boxes of red date zongzi costs the same as buying 4 boxes of egg yolk zongzi, which gives us the equation: [3x = 4y] 2. Buying 1 box of red date zongzi and 2 boxes of egg yolk zongzi together costs 100, leading to the equation: [x + 2y = 100] Solving these equations simultaneously: From the first equation, we can express x in terms of y: [x = frac{4y}{3}] Substituting x = frac{4y}{3} into the second equation: [frac{4y}{3} + 2y = 100] Multiplying everything by 3 to clear the denominator: [4y + 6y = 300] Combining like terms: [10y = 300] Dividing by 10: [y = 30] Substituting y = 30 back into the equation x = frac{4y}{3}: [x = frac{4 cdot 30}{3} = 40] Thus, the unit prices are: - Red date zongzi gift box: boxed{x = 40} yuan - Egg yolk zongzi gift box: boxed{y = 30} yuan Part 2: Li's Purchasing Plan and Total Amount Spent Let a be the number of red date zongzi gift boxes Li purchased, and (8-a) be the number of egg yolk zongzi gift boxes purchased. The conditions given are: 1. The total cost for the zongzi gift boxes is less than 300: [40a + 30(8-a) < 300] 2. The total number of zongzi must be at least enough for 55 students and 10 subject teachers, which means at least 65 zongzi: [10a + 6(8-a) geq 65] Solving the inequalities: For the cost constraint: [40a + 240 - 30a < 300] [10a < 60] [a < 6] For the zongzi quantity constraint: [10a + 48 - 6a geq 65] [4a geq 17] [a geq 4.25] Considering a must be an integer and combining both constraints: [4.25 leq a < 6] The only integer value for a within this range is 5.

In order to set a reasonable price, a flexible pricing strategy was implemented in the first week. The selling price per jin was set at 10 yuan as the standard. Any amount exceeding 10 yuan was recorded as positive, and any amount less than 10 yuan was recorded as negative. The supermarket recorded the selling price and quantity of passion fruits for the first week as follows: | Day of the Week | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday | ||||||||| | Price relative to standard price (yuan) | +1 | 2 | +3 | 1 | +2 | +5 | 4 | | Quantity sold (jin) | 20 | 35 | 10 | 30 | 15 | 5 | 50 | (1) The highest unit price of passion fruits sold by the supermarket in that week was on ________ and the highest price was ________ yuan. (2) How was the profit/loss of the supermarket from selling this type of passion fruit during the week? (3) In order to promote this type of passion fruit, the supermarket decided to introduce two promotional methods starting from the next week: Method one: Buy up to 5 jin of passion fruit at 12 yuan per jin, and receive a 20% discount for any amount exceeding 5 jin. Method two: Selling price of 10 yuan per jin. A certain unit decided to buy 35 jin of passion fruit. By calculation, determine which method is more costeffective.","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: Highest Unit Price and Day - The standard price is given as 10 yuan per jin. - The relative prices for each day are added to this standard price to find the actual selling price. - On Saturday, the relative price is +5, so the selling price is 10 + 5 = 15 yuan. Therefore, the highest unit price of passion fruits sold by the supermarket in that week was on boxed{text{Saturday}}, and the highest price was boxed{15 text{ yuan}}.

Therefore, the profit from selling this type of passion fruit during the week was boxed{135 text{ yuan}}. Part 3: Cost-Effectiveness of Promotional Methods - **Method one:** For the first 5 jin, the price is 12 yuan per jin. For any amount exceeding 5 jin, a 20% discount is applied. Thus, the cost is (35-5) times 12 times 0.8 + 12 times 5 = 348 yuan. - **Method two:** Selling at a flat rate of 10 yuan per jin for 35 jin results in 35 times 10 = 350 yuan.

We will consider different cases based on the relative sizes of (a), (b), and (c). 1. **Case 1: (a = b = c)** If (a = b = c), then: [ ab - c = a^2 - a = 2^n ] [ a(a - 1) = 2^n ] Since (a(a - 1)) is a product of two consecutive integers, one of them must be a power of 2. The only consecutive integers where this is true are (2) and (1). Thus, (a = 2) and (a - 1 = 1). Therefore, ((a, b, c) = (2, 2, 2)). 2. **Case 2: (a = b < c)** If (a = b < c), then: [ ab - c = a^2 - c = 2^x ] [ ac - a = a(c - 1) = 2^y ] Since (a(c - 1) = 2^y), (a) must be a power of 2. Let (a = 2^m). Then (c = 2^n + 1) for some (n). Substituting into the first equation: [ 2^{2m} - (2^n + 1) = 2^x ] [ 2^{2m} - 2^n - 1 = 2^x ] Since (c > a), (n geq 1). Therefore, (x = 0) and: [ 2^{2m} - 2^n - 1 = 1 ] [ 2^{2m} - 2^n = 2 ] [ 2^{2m-1} - 2^{n-1} = 1 ] The only solution to this equation is (m = 1) and (n = 1). Thus, (a = 2) and (c = 3). Therefore, ((a, b, c) = (2, 2, 3)). 3. **Case 3: (a < b = c)** If (a < b = c), then: [ ab - b = b(a - 1) = 2^x ] [ b^2 - a = 2^y ] Since (b(a - 1) = 2^x), (b) must be a power of 2. Let (b = 2^m). Then: [ 2^{2m} - a = 2^y ] Since (b > a - 1), (b) is even. Therefore, (a) must also be even. Let (a = 2k). Then: [ 2^{2m} - 2k = 2^y ] Since (b) is a power of 2, (a) must be (2). Thus, (a = 2) and: [ b^2 = 2^y + 2 ] Since (b^2) is a multiple of 4, (y = 1) and (b = 2), which is a contradiction because (a < b). 4. **Case 4: (a < b < c)** Let (ab - c = 2^x), (ac - b = 2^y), and (bc - a = 2^z). Clearly, (x > y > z). Adding equations 2 and 3 and subtracting equation 3 from equation 2 yields: [ (c-1)(a+b) = 2^y(2^{y-x} + 1) ] [ (c+1)(b-a) = 2^y(2^{y-z} - 1) ] Since (gcd(c-1, c+1) leq 2), we must have either (2^{y-1} mid a+b) or (2^{y-1} mid b-a). Either way, we have: [ a+b geq 2^{y-1} = frac{ac-b}{2} ] which rearranges as: [ 2a + 3b geq ac ] Then: [ 2a + 3b geq ac geq a(b+1) ] [ a geq b(a-3) implies a leq 3 ] - **Subcase 1: (a = 3)** Then: [ 3b - c = 2^x, quad 3c - b = 2^y, quad bc - 3 = 2^z ] The third equation implies that (b) and (c) are both odd. Using the inequality (2a + 3b geq ac), we have: [ 6 + 3b geq 3c implies 2 + b geq c ] This implies that (c = 2 + b) because (b < c) and (b) and (c) are both odd. Substituting this in, we obtain: [ b - 1 = 2^{x-1} ] [ b + 3 = 2^{y-1} ] The only powers of 2 that are 4 apart are (2^2) and (2^3), so (b = 5). Therefore, ((a, b, c) = (3, 5, 7)), which indeed works. - **Subcase 2: (a = 2)** Then: [ 2b - c = 2^x, quad 2c - b = 2^y, quad bc - 2 = 2^z ] By equation 2, we know that (b) is even. Therefore, by equation 3, we know that (c) must be odd because (2^z + 2) is not divisible by 4. Since (c) is odd, by equation 1, we know that (2^x) is odd. Therefore: [ 2b - c = 1 implies c = 2b - 1 ] Substituting this in, we obtain: [ 3b - 2 = 2^y ] [ 2b^2 - b = 2^z + 2 ] Multiplying both sides by 9, we can factor this expression as: [ 9 cdot 2^z - 16 = (3b - 2)(6b + 1) ] Therefore, (3b - 2 mid 16). The only possible value for (b) is 6 because (b > a = 2). This yields the triple ((a, b, c) = (2, 6, 11)). Obviously, (a = 1) does not work, so we are done!

Since A and B together can do the work in 30 days, we can write: 1/A's rate + 1/B's rate = 1/(A and B's rate together) 1/(W/60) + 1/B's rate = 1/(W/30) Solving for B's rate, we get: B's rate = 1/(1/(W/30) - 1/(W/60)) B's rate = 1/((2/W - 1/W)/60) B's rate = 1/(1/W/60) B's rate = W/60 So B's work rate is also W/60.

Define ( d_n = gcd(a_n, a_{n+1}) ). 1. **Observation of Divisibility:** Notice that ( d_{n+1} ) divides both ( a_{n+1} ) and ( a_{n+2} ). Since ( a_{n+2} = frac{a_{n+1} + a_n}{d_n} ), ( d_{n+1} ) also divides ( d_n a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_n ). Therefore, ( d_{n+1} ) divides ( d_n ). 2. **Monotonicity of ( d_n ):** Since ( d_n geq d_{n+1} ), the sequence ( {d_n} ) is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers. Hence, there must exist some ( N ) such that ( d_n = d ) for all ( n geq N ). 3. **Analysis depending on ( d ):** - **Case 1: ( d = 1 )** If ( d = 1 ), then ( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n ).

Hence, ( A_0 = V(G) setminus {u_0} ). - **Inductive Step:** Assume we have selected ( u_0, u_1, ldots, u_n ) and sets ( A_0, A_1, ldots, A_n ) for some integer ( n geq 0 ), satisfying the property that for all ( p > q ) and any vertex ( s in A_p ), the edge ( (u_q, s) ) is colored with ( c_q ). - Vertex ( u_n ), being part of an infinite graph, is connected to infinitely many vertices. Hence, among these, there must be infinitely many edges of some color ( c_n ) due to the Pigeonhole Principle applied to the finite number of colors. - Let ( A_{n+1} ) be the set of vertices in ( A_n ) that are connected to ( u_n ) by edges of color ( c_n ). By our construction, ( A_{n+1} ) is infinite. - Choose an arbitrary vertex ( u_{n+1} ) from ( A_{n+1} ). 3. **Continuation:** Repeat the inductive process to continue constructing the sequences ( {u_n} ) and ( {c_n} ). 4. **Formation of the Infinite Monochromatic Subgraph:** Now, we have the sequences ( {u_n} ) and ( {c_n} ). By the construction, we know that ( (u_p, u_q) ) has the color ( c_q ) for ( p > q ). - **Selection of Identical Colors:** Since ( c_n ) is taken from a finite set of colors, there exists an infinite subset ( E subset mathbb{N} ) such that ( c_n = c ) for some fixed color ( c ) and all ( n in E ). (This follows by the Infinite Ramsey Theorem as applied to the sequence ( {c_n} )). 5. **Conclusion:** The subset of vertices ( {u_n mid n in E} ) forms a monochromatic subgraph of color ( c ) because every edge in this subgraph is colored ( c ). This proves the existence of an infinite monochromatic subgraph in ( G ). Hence, [boxed{G text{ contains an infinite monochromatic subgraph.}}]"},{"prompt":"Mat is digging a hole.

Then we have: p^{-k} x = n quad text{and} quad p^{-k-ell} y = m for some integers (m, n) not divisible by (p).

Let l_1 and l_2 be two such lines. These lines will cut through the sides of the polygon in such a way that they together create four regions. 4. **Analyzing Regions:** Next, each intersection point on the boundary has a symmetric counterpart relative to O. There are thus 2n points of intersection, considering symmetrical pairs. 5. **Contradiction Approach:** Suppose there are more than n lines through O that each divide the polygon's area in half. This would imply the existence of more than n symmetric pairs of intersection points, one for each line. 6. **Area Argument:** Consider the triangles or quadrilaterals formed by the lines l_1 and l_2 with the polygon's sides. If we have, for example, line l_1 intersecting at points A and B and l_2 at points C and D, suppose without loss of generality that A, B, C, and D form some regions inside the polygon.

Let's denote the three athletes by their speeds at the start as ( v_1, v_2, v_3 ) such that ( v_1 > v_2 > v_3 ). 2. Consider the movement of the athletes along a straight line from point ( A ) to point ( B ), back to point ( A ). The distance from ( A ) to ( B ) is given as ( 60 ) meters. 3. All athletes start at the same time from point ( A ), reach point ( B ), and then immediately turn back to point ( A ) each with their own respective speeds. 4. The Trainer follows along the path such that his position minimizes the sum of distances to all three athletes at any given time. This optimal point will be the median position among the three athletes during their run. Specifically, if you plot the movement of each athlete on a graph with time on the x-axis and distance from ( A ) on the y-axis, the problem becomes one of determining this median distance over time. 5. Construct a graph plotting each athlete's movement as a function of time: - Let ( O ) represent the origin point corresponding to ( A ). - Let ( OS = 60 ) meters represent the distance from ( A ) to ( B ). - Let points ( K, L, M ) on the distance axis represent the points when each athlete reaches ( B ), and points ( T ) on the time axis represent the times of key interactions where distances overlap, e.g., moments when athletes meet. 6. For three points on a line, the sum of distances to any point is minimized at the median point (Theorem of Proportional Segments). Hence, the trainer's path will be nearest the middle athlete the majority of the time. 7. Denote the segments on the time axis as follows: - ( a = KL ) (distance between the first and second athlete when one reaches ( B )), - ( b = LM ) (distance between the second and third athlete when one reaches ( B )), - ( t = OT ) (time until they all finish). 8. Knowing that these segments indicate proportional relationships, we apply the theorem to find minimal distances moved: - Segment proportions will be given by ( KP:PT = KL:OT = a:t ). 9. Applying these proportional segments: - ( frac{O P^{prime}}{OS} = frac{KP}{PT} = frac{a}{t} ), - Consequently, ( O P^{prime} = 60 cdot frac{a}{t+a} ), - Similarly, ( O Q^{prime} = 60 cdot frac{b}{t+b} ), - and ( O R^{prime} = 60 cdot frac{a+b}{t+a+b} ). 10.

We need to determine the largest value of ( k ) such that among the 125 teddy bears in the store, there are at least three identical bears in terms of both color and size. 4. If ( k = 10 ), then the total number of varieties is: [ 6k = 6 times 10 = 60 ] 5. Naturally, the greatest number of bears of any one variety without having at least three of the same would be two bears of each variety. Thus, the maximum number of bears in the store if each variety is limited to at most two bears would be: [ 2 times 60 = 120 ] This is less than the total of 125 teddy bears. 6. The assumption that each variety has at most two bears leads to a contradiction since the total number of bears is 125.

Therefore, we have: [ a^2 + b^2 = (p + q)^2 + (pq - 1)^2 ] 5. Expand the squares: [ (p + q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 ] [ (pq - 1)^2 = p^2q^2 - 2pq + 1 ] 6. Combine the expanded forms: [ a^2 + b^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + p^2q^2 - 2pq + 1 ] Simplify by combining like terms: [ a^2 + b^2 = p^2 + q^2 + p^2q^2 + 1 ] 7. Notice that the expression ( p^2 + q^2 + p^2q^2 + 1 ) can be factored: [ p^2 + q^2 + p^2q^2 + 1 = (p^2 + 1)(q^2 + 1) ] 8. Since ( p ) and ( q ) are positive integers, both ( p^2 + 1 ) and ( q^2 + 1 ) are greater than 1. Therefore, ( (p^2 + 1)(q^2 + 1) ) is a product of two integers greater than 1, which means it cannot be a prime number.

The equation ( y^2 = 6x^2 ) represents a set of lines, and ( y^2 = -6x^2 + 2 ) is a hyperbola. Thus, the types of conic sections represented by the original equation are: - Lines (considered degenerate conics here) - Hyperbola So, the answer is boxed{text{P, H}}."},{"prompt":"The point corresponding to the complex number frac {3i}{1i} on the complex plane is in the ( ) quadrant.
