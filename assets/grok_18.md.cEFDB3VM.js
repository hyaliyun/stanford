Discrimination, in any form, is an unjust and harmful practice that we must strive to eradicate from our hearts, our minds, and our communities. Discrimination takes many forms, such as racism, sexism, ageism, and homophobia, among others. It is based on fear, ignorance, and the unwillingness to accept others who are different from ourselves. Discrimination robs individuals of their dignity, their opportunities, and their fundamental human rights. Racism, perhaps one of the most pervasive forms of discrimination, has caused immense pain and suffering throughout history. People have been judged and mistreated solely based on the color of their skin. This ignorance has denied society the opportunity to embrace diversity and learn from different cultures and perspectives. Sexism, another prevalent form of discrimination, restricts women from fully participating in social, economic, and political life. Women have faced discrimination in the workplace, being paid less than their male counterparts for the same work. This inequality hinders progress and undermines the principle of equal opportunity for all. Ageism is yet another form of discrimination that targets older individuals, denying them equal access to employment, healthcare, and social activities. We must recognize and appreciate the wisdom and experience that older generations bring to our society, instead of marginalizing and dismissing their contributions. Homophobia is a discrimination against individuals based on their sexual orientation. It denies people their basic human rights, such as the right to marry or adopt children, and creates a hostile environment that perpetuates fear and intolerance. Discrimination, in any form, goes against the principles of equality, respect, and justice that are the foundation of a fair and inclusive society. It reinforces stereotypes, divides communities, and damages the very fabric of our humanity. However, we have the power to change this. Education plays a key role in eradicating discrimination. By promoting diversity and inclusivity in our schools, we can teach future generations the value of acceptance, empathy, and equality. It is essential to instill in our children the understanding that our differences should be celebrated, for they are the building blocks of a vibrant and prosperous society. Laws and policies must be enacted and enforced to protect individuals from discrimination. Companies and organizations should create inclusive environments that promote diversity in their workplaces. Governments must actively combat discrimination by prohibiting discriminatory practices and ensuring equal opportunities for all citizens. However, eliminating discrimination cannot depend solely on laws and policies. Each one of us has a responsibility to challenge discriminatory behavior and promote inclusivity in our everyday lives. We must stand up against any form of discrimination, whether witnessed in our communities, schools, or workplaces. By leading by example, we can influence others to embrace diversity and break down the barriers that perpetuate discrimination. In conclusion, discrimination in any shape or form is a blot on our society. It is a cancer that undermines our progress, divides our communities, and obstructs our potential for growth. However, by recognizing the beauty in our differences, cultivating empathy, and promoting inclusivity, we can build a world free from discrimination. Let us join hands in this noble mission, for only together can we create a future where everyone is treated with dignity, respect, and equality. Thank you."},{"prompt":"请用英语写一篇主题为歧视的演讲稿，逻辑顺序为什么是歧视、有哪些歧视、歧视的影响、以及我们应该怎么面对歧视","completion":"Ladies and gentlemen, Today, I would like to address a pressing issue that continues to plague our society - discrimination. Discrimination is a destructive force that not only harms individuals but also tears apart the very fabric of our communities. It is imperative that we understand the roots, various forms, and profound effects of discrimination, as well as stand united in our efforts to combat it. First and foremost, why does discrimination exist? At its core, discrimination stems from fear, ignorance, and prejudice. People often fear what they do not understand or what they perceive as different. This fear, unfortunately, has led to countless instances of discrimination throughout history. Discrimination manifests itself in many forms. Racism, for instance, is a deeply embedded system that devalues and mistreats individuals based on their race or ethnicity. It is an ugly stain on our society that prevents us from embracing diversity and appreciating the richness of different cultures. Sexism, another prevalent form of discrimination, places women at a disadvantage, denying them the same opportunities and rights as their male counterparts. It is both unfair and unjust that individuals are judged purely on their gender, rather than their capabilities and talents. Discrimination is not limited to race or gender alone. Other forms, such as ageism, homophobia, and religious discrimination, continue to pervade our society. Ageism disregards the contributions and experiences of older individuals, while homophobia and religious discrimination create hostile environments that exclude and marginalize certain groups. The impact of discrimination cannot be overstated. It tears at the very fabric of our society, hindering progress and tearing apart communities. Discrimination robs individuals of their self-esteem, opportunities, and basic human rights. It perpetuates cycles of inequality, hampers social cohesion, and undermines the values of fairness and justice that should guide us as a society. So, how do we confront discrimination? It starts with fostering awareness and education. We must strive to educate ourselves and others about the harm and consequences of discrimination. By understanding the experiences and perspectives of marginalized groups, we can break down the barriers that fuel discrimination. Legislation and policies play a crucial role in combating discrimination. Governments must enact and enforce laws that protect individuals from discrimination and create equal opportunities for all. Companies and organizations should establish inclusive practices and cultivate diversity within their ranks. But combating discrimination is not solely the responsibility of governments and organizations. It falls upon each and every one of us as individuals to challenge discriminatory behavior and promote inclusivity in our daily lives. We must practice empathy, strive for fairness, and speak up against discrimination whenever and wherever we encounter it. Furthermore, fostering dialogue and creating spaces for open discussions can help break down stereotypes and biases. Engaging in meaningful conversations and promoting understanding between different groups can contribute to a more inclusive and accepting society. In conclusion, discrimination is a deeply divisive force that continues to hinder progress and create imbalances in our society. We must recognize its various forms, understand its impact, and take collective action to combat it. By fostering awareness, advocating for equal rights, and promoting inclusivity, we can create a society that values and respects each individual, regardless of their race, gender, age, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs. Together, let us strive for a future free from discrimination so that every individual can thrive and contribute to a more harmonious world.

We witness his internal struggles, torn between his original quest for true justice and the newfound power of vengeance. Sebastian's justifications and inner turmoil create a psychological rollercoaster, forcing viewers to question their own beliefs. As The Shadows' actions intensify, the city plunges into a state of unrest. Sebastian's dark charisma captivates the vulnerable and disillusioned, drawing them into his twisted world. Amidst the chaos, however, sparks of doubt and the flickers of a conscience are ignited within Sebastian's heart. In a thrilling climax, The Shadows plan one final, audacious act that will expose the city's corrupt underbelly – a move that challenges not only their enemies but also the very fabric of Sebastian's soul. As he navigates the consequences of his choices, the lines between hero and villain begin to blur, leaving both Sebastian and the audience questioning not only society's illusive concept of justice but also their own morals and values. \\"Shadows of Redemption\\" delves deep into the shadows of the human psyche, unraveling the motivations and complexities behind the actions of a villain. Through its intense storytelling, it elicits empathy for a character typically condemned, providing a chilling exploration of what drives individuals to break society's rules while exposing the flaws within the system itself."},{"prompt":"DEVIS en informatique","completion":"Pour établir un devis en informatique, veuillez fournir les informations suivantes : 1.

Market supply is given as 𝑄=3P. Each identical firm has MC=3Q and ATC=1.5Q. What quantity of output will a typical firm produce?","completion":"To determine the quantity of output a typical firm will produce, we need to find the level of output at which the firm's marginal cost (MC) is equal to the market price (P). From the given information, we know that MC = 3Q. Since the market demand is given by Q = 60 - P, we can substitute this into the MC equation: 3Q = 60 - P Now we can solve for Q in terms of P: 3Q + P = 60 Q = (60 - P) / 3 Since we're looking for the quantity of output a typical firm will produce, we need to find the level of output that sets MC equal to P: 3Q = P Substituting (60 - P) / 3 for Q, we get: 3(60 - P) / 3 = P 60 - P = P 60 = 2P P = 30 Now we can substitute the value of P back into the market demand equation to find Q: Q = 60 - P Q = 60 - 30 Q = 30 Therefore, a typical firm will produce 30 units of output."},{"prompt":"Consider a monopoly’ s decision on how many workers to hire. Assume that the monopoly faces a linear demand curve for its product: P=40-Q, where P is the price of the good and Q is the output. Letting L be the number of workers it hires, the monopoly’ s production function is also linear: Q=3L. The wage rate is constant at 30. Given this information. how many workers will this profit-maximizing monopoly hire?","completion":"To determine the number of workers that the profit-maximizing monopoly will hire, we need to compare the marginal cost (MC) and the marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor. The production function is given as Q = 3L, meaning that the quantity produced (Q) is equal to three times the number of workers (L). The wage rate is constant at 30, so the cost of hiring an additional worker is equal to the wage rate: MC = 30. Now, we need to calculate the marginal revenue product of labor, which is the additional revenue generated by hiring an additional worker. To do this, we take the derivative of the total revenue function (TR) with respect to the input (L): TR = P × Q = (40 − Q) × Q = 40Q − Q^2 MRP = d(TR) / d(L) = d(40Q − Q^2) / d(L) = 40 − 2Q Substituting the production function Q = 3L into the MRP equation: MRP = 40 − 2(3L) = 40 − 6L To maximize profit, the monopoly needs to equate MC and MRP: MC = MRP 30 = 40 − 6L Rearranging the equation, we get: 6L = 40 − 30 6L = 10 L = 10 / 6 L ≈ 1.67 Since the number of workers must be a whole number, the profit-maximizing monopoly will hire 2 workers."},{"prompt":"When a single-price monopoly reaches profit-maximizing quantity, what can you tell about the price elasticity of demand under this quantity? A. It is unit-elastic B. lt is in the inelastic region of demand curve C. It is in the elastic region of demand curve D. It is perfectly inelastic. E. It is perfectly elastic.","completion":"When a single-price monopoly reaches its profit-maximizing quantity, the price elasticity of demand under this quantity can be described as: B. It is in the inelastic region of the demand curve. A monopoly typically sets its price higher than the marginal cost in order to increase profits. In this scenario, the monopoly is producing at a quantity level where the price elasticity of demand is inelastic, meaning that a change in price will result in a proportionally smaller change in quantity demanded. In other words, the demand for the monopolist's product is relatively insensitive to changes in price at this profit-maximizing quantity."},{"prompt":"In a perfectly competitive increasing-cost industry, when existing firms are earning economic profits, what will happen to the existing firms’ production cost curves in this industry in the long run?

Shift upward. In the long run, new firms will be attracted to the industry due to the economic profits being generated by existing firms. As new firms enter the industry, the market supply will increase, leading to an increase in the input prices required to produce the goods or services.

The wage for all workers is 10 and the marginal product of the last worker hired is 40. The marginal product of the last robot that the firm utilizes is equal to 80. The firm is currently minimizing its costs. In this case, what is the price of each robot? A. 120 B. 60 C. 40 D. 20 E. 10","completion":"To determine the price of each robot, we need to compare the marginal product of robots with their price. The firm is currently minimizing costs, which means it is optimizing the ratio of the marginal product of each input to its price. In this case, the ratio of the marginal product to the price should be the same for both workers and robots. Given that the wage for all workers is 10 and the marginal product of the last worker hired is 40, we can calculate the value of worker's marginal product per dollar spent on wages: 40 / 10 = 4. Assuming the firm is optimizing the same ratio for robots, we can set up the following equation: 80 / price of each robot = 4 To solve for the price of each robot, we rearrange the equation: price of each robot = 80 / 4 = 20 Therefore, the price of each robot is 20.

Linear pricing' s profit is twice as much as perfect price discrimination' s. C. Linear pricing' s profit is the half of perfect price discrimination' s. Without further information or calculations, we cannot conclusively determine whether linear pricing or perfect price discrimination would result in higher or lower profits. The comparison between the two pricing strategies would depend on the specific conditions and the shape of the demand curve. D. Perfect price discrimination will earn more consumer surplus than any other pricing strategies. This statement is not necessarily true. While perfect price discrimination would result in the highest possible revenue for the monopoly firm, it does not necessarily mean it will earn more consumer surplus. In fact, perfect price discrimination often results in a reduction or elimination of consumer surplus, as each consumer pays the maximum price they are willing to pay.

When a monopolistic firm earns positive economic profits in the short run, it signals to potential entrants that there are opportunities for profit in the market. This attracts new firms to enter the market in the long run, increasing competition. As a result of this increased competition, the monopolistic firm's market power decreases, and it is unable to maintain the high prices it charged in the short run.

Regulile de competență teritorială sunt, de obicei, stabilite în Codul de procedură civilă al țării respective. În general, regulile de competență teritorială determină care dintre instanțe este competentă pentru a judeca un anumit caz. În România, de exemplu, potrivit Codului de procedură civilă, regulile de competență teritorială sunt stabilite în principal pe baza domiciliului pârâtului. Totuși, sunt și excepții de la această regulă, cum ar fi: 1. **Locul unde s-a produs fapta prejudiciabilă**: În cazuri legate de răspunderea delictuală şi obligațiile care decurg din fapte ilicite, instanța de la locul unde s-a produs fapta poate fi de asemenea competență teritorială să judece cazul. 2. **Obligația de a face sau de a nu face**: Dacă cererea privește obligația de a face sau de a nu face ceva, poate fi competentă să judece acțiunea instanța în a cărei circumscripție trebuie să fie executată obligația. În speța prezentată, pârâtul B își are domiciliul în sectorul 2, dar accidentul cauzat de bucată de zidărie care s-a desprins din imobil a avut loc în sectorul 3. Reclamantul a ales să se adreseze Judecătoriei Sectorului 3 pentru că acolo a avut loc evenimentul prejudiciabil. Astfel, având în vedere că există reguli care permit sesizarea instanței de la locul unde s-a produs fapta prejudiciabilă, instanța ar fi motivat corect respingerea excepției de necompetență teritorială invocată de pârât. Concluzionând, soluția pronunțată de instanță în respingerea excepției de necompetență teritorială par să fie legală și în conformitate cu principiile de competență teritorială, în ipoteza în care legea aplicabilă permite instanței de la locul săvârșirii faptei prejudiciabile să fie competentă în soluționarea cazului.

Cu toate acestea, pentru a produce efecte, instanța trebuie să ia act de renunțare. Este important de menționat că dacă renunțarea lui A la dreptul dedus judecății este de natură să aducă atingere unui drept al lui B, atunci este necesar acordul pârâtului, chiar și în faza de recurs. b) **Aceasta poate fi făcută prin înscris sub semnătură privată sau verbal în fața instanței**: Potrivit dreptului român, este posibil ca o parte să renunțe la dreptul său subiectiv dedus judecății fie verbal în fața instanței, în cadrul unei ședințe de judecată, fie printr-un înscris, document care trebuie să fie legalizat dacă legea cere în mod expres acest lucru.

In computer graphics, we synthesize 3D shapes and 2D images, render novel views of scenes, and animate articulating human bodies. In computer vision, we reconstruct 3D appearance, shape, object pose, and deformation. In humancomputer interaction (HCI), we enable the interactive investigation of spacetime data. Beyond visual computing and into adjacent disciplines like robotics, we use the structure of 3D scenes to plan and execute actions. Within these disciplines, fields are widely used to continuously parameterize an underlying physical quantity of an object or scene over space and time. For instance, fields have been used to visualize physical phenomena [Sab88], compute image gradients [SK97], compute collisions [OF03], or represent shapes via constructive solid geometry (CSG) [Eva15]. In visual computing tasks, we solve many different optimization problems, including using machine learning and training data. One class of methods has gained significant attention since 2019: coordinate-based neural networks that represent a field. We refer to these methods as neural fields. Given sufficient parameters, fully connected neural networks can encode continuous signals over arbitrary dimensions at arbitrary resolution. Recent success with neural networks has caused a resurgence of interest in visual computing problems, leading to more accurate, higher fidelity, more expressive, and memory-efficient solutions. This has allowed neural fields to gain traction as a useful parameterization of 2D images [KAL∗ 21], 3D shape [PFS∗ 19,MON∗ 19,CZ19], viewdependent appearance [SZW19, MST∗ 20], and human bodies and faces [NMOG19,DLJ∗ 20,SYMB21,YTB∗ 21,RTE∗ 21]. Such attention manifests as rapid progress and an explosion of papers (Figure 2), with a need to consolidate the discovered knowledge. However, a shared mathematical formulation to describe related techniques has not yet emerged, making it hard to communicate ideas and train students.

Reading the books doesn't change the number of books physically present in the room; it only changes the number of books you have read."},{"prompt":"CONDUCTOR ENERGY BAND DIAGRAM","completion":"A conductor energy band diagram shows the arrangement of energy levels in a conductor material. It illustrates the energy levels of the valence electrons and the conduction electrons within the material. In a conductor, the valence band is partially filled, and it is separated from the conduction band by a small band gap. The valence band represents the energy levels occupied by the valence electrons, which are tightly bound to their respective atoms. These electrons do not have enough energy to move freely throughout the material. The conduction band, on the other hand, represents the energy levels available for the movement of conduction electrons. These electrons have higher energy and are not tightly bound to specific atoms. They are able to move freely throughout the material, contributing to the flow of electric current. In a conductor energy band diagram, the valence band is typically represented as a filled band situated below the conduction band. The band gap between the valence and conduction bands is usually very small or nonexistent, allowing for easy movement of electrons between the two bands. The diagram also shows the Fermi level, which represents the highest occupied energy level at absolute zero temperature. In a conductor, the Fermi level coincides with the top of the filled valence band, indicating that there are available energy levels for conduction electrons to occupy. Overall, the conductor energy band diagram provides a visual representation of the energy levels and their occupancy in a conductor material, allowing us to understand its electrical conductivity properties."},{"prompt":"if there are 4 people on the team and 9 more are added, how many additional channels of communication does this create","completion":"To calculate the number of additional channels of communication created, we can use the formula for the number of communication channels in a team, which is n * (n-1) / 2, where n is the number of people in the team.

To derive the electromagnetic field strength tensor, we start with the electromagnetic potential 4-vector, denoted by A. The components of A are given by the scalar potential (φ) and the vector potential (A): A = (φ, A) The electromagnetic field strength tensor, F, is then defined as the antisymmetric derivative of the potential 4-vector: F = dA - AdA Here, dA represents the exterior derivative of the potential 4-vector A, and AdA represents the exterior product of A with itself. In terms of differential forms, we can express F as follows: F = dA - A∧A where dA is the 2-form exterior derivative of A, and A∧A is the wedge product of A with itself. In terms of components, the electromagnetic field strength tensor can be written as: F = [ 0 -E₁/c -E₂/c -E₃/c ] [ E₁/c 0 -B₃ B₂ ] [ E₂/c B₃ 0 -B₁ ] [ E₃/c -B₂ B₁ 0 ] Here, E is the electric field vector, and B is the magnetic field vector. The relation to differential forms arises from the fact that the components of the electromagnetic field strength tensor can be expressed as the exterior derivatives of the electromagnetic potential components. This allows us to write Maxwell's equations (which describe the behavior of the electromagnetic field) in a concise and elegant form using the language of differential forms."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

保持耐心：等待总监的回复，有时候过于急切可能会给人一种压力。 - 跟进：如果过了一天或两天仍然没有消息，可以再发一条微信或者邮件，礼貌地询问是否有更新。 - 备选方案：同时要准备好可能的备选方案，以防结果不如预期。 至于现在已经是下午五点，如果你昨天发的微信至今未得到回复，可以考虑第二天的工作时间给对方发送一个礼貌的跟进消息，表示你希望得到更新和指导。这样，不仅显得你对这个工作机会很认真，也能体现出你的职业素养。同时不要显得过于着急或者不耐烦，因为聘用过程往往需要时间和多方面的考量。"},{"prompt":"其实我也满纠结，实际上他们的考核指标是三个月三百万，像我们这里的三四线小城市，难度很大，我又没什么人脉","completion":"面对这样的考核指标确实会比较有压力，特别是在三四线小城市，且如果没有太多的人脉资源，那么做销售类的工作难度就会加大。面临这种情况，你可以考虑以下几个方面： 1. **理解业务**：深入理解华安证券提供的服务和产品，这对于销售和建立信任至关重要。 2. **资源评估**：审视自己目前可以调用的资源，不仅限于人脉，还包括专业知识、市场趋势等。 3. **人脉关系**：就算当前人脉不足，也可以逐步建立。多参加行业活动，积极建立新的联系。并与客户保持良好关系，提供优质服务，这样可以通过口碑获得推荐。 4. **市场研究**：详细了解本地市场的特点和潜在客户，制定相应的营销策略，可能比简单依靠人脉更有效。 5. **学习成长**：考虑是否有机会通过培训进一步发展自己的销售技能和专业知识，提高工作效率和成功率。 6. **工作风险**：考虑一下如果不能达到考核指标，公司提供的支持和你的应对策略。 7. **职业规划**：思考这份工作能否帮助你实现自己长远的职业目标，不要只考虑短期。 在这种情况下，尤其重要的是，你需要确保你的决定与你的长期职业规划相符。如果你觉得这个岗位的挑战符合你的职业成长目标，并且你愿意接受这样的考核压力，那你可以选择接受这份工作，并开始制定相应的策略来应对挑战。 记得与营销总监谈及这方面的顾虑，了解公司是否提供新员工的培训及辅导，或者有无灵活的考核机制等，这样可能会有助于你做出决定。如果公司能提供一定的支持和培训，你的压力可能会小一些，而且也表明企业对员工的成长抱有积极态度。最终决定需基于你对职位的理解、个人的能力以及职业发展的规划。"},{"prompt":"我的目标一直都是考公务员，这些工作只是过渡","completion":"如果考公务员是你的长期目标，那么在选择其他工作时，你可能需要考虑以下几个因素： 1. **时间安排**：确保工作安排能为你提供足够的时间来准备公务员考试。如果工作压力过大，可能会影响你的备考。 2. **工作内容**：选择与公务员工作性质相似或能够在未来申请公务员职位时增加竞争力的工作。 3. **工作环境和压力**：考虑工作环境和压力是否有助于你保持心理健康和动力，或者是否会对备考产生不利影响。 4. **工作地点**：最好选择工作地点接近备考课程或资源，以便能更方便地进行公务员考前准备。 考虑到华安证券的工作考核压力大，并且你表达了没有太多人脉来帮助达成业绩目标，可能会给你的公务员考试备考增加额外的压力。因此，在选择是否接受这份工作时，你需要仔细权衡它是否能够帮助你在公务员考试前保持一个良好的状态，并且考虑它对你备考时间的影响。 由于你明确了考公务员的目标，建议在接受任何工作前，考虑以下建议： - **明确优先级**：如果备考公务员是你的首要任务，那么尽量选择能够给予你足够备考时间的工作。 - **寻求稳定性**：可能需要寻找一个工作压力相对较小、工时较为固定的工作，这样更有助于你的公务员备考。 - **谈判工作条件**：如果可能，与雇主商讨是否有灵活工作时间、学习支持或减少加班的可能性。 最后，与A或B部门的负责人讨论你的职业规划和考公务员的目标，看看他们是否可以提供支持或理解。选择你认为对目标有利、生活和工作平衡较好的部门。如果工作对备考公务员影响较大，也要做好调整策略，保证你的最终目标不会受损。"},{"prompt":"你推荐我做这份工作吗？A营销总监没回复我，已经超过一天了，我需要给他发信息吗？","completion":"作为一个智能助理，我不能直接推荐你是否应该接受这份工作，因为这取决于你个人的情况和优先级。不过，我可以帮助你考虑这个决策的不同方面。 考虑以下几个要素： - **目标一致性**：这份工作是否与你考公务员的目标相冲突？它是否会分散你的精力，或者给你带来额外的压力？ - **时间管理**：这份工作是否允许你有足够的时间和精力去准备公务员考试？ - **经济需求**：你是否需要这份工作来满足你的经济需求，比如生活开销和备考费用？ - **经验积累**：这份工作能否为你提供有价值的工作经验，即使最终你决定成为公务员？ - **人脉网络**：这份工作是否有助于你建立在任何情况下都有益的职业网络？ 对于营销总监没有回复的问题，这是个常见的情况，而通常推荐的做法是等待至少48小时再次跟进。这给了对方足够的时间处理他们的事务，并且避免你显得太过于急切。当你发信息时，保持专业和礼貌，简要地提醒对方你的上一个消息，并表明你期待他们的回复。例如： \\"尊敬的[总监姓名]，您好！上周我与您就加入贵部门的可能性进行了一次愉快的交谈。我理解您可能非常忙碌，只是想礼貌地询问关于我的申请是否有任何更新。我非常期待有机会成为华安证券团队的一部分，并期待着您的回复。感谢您抽出宝贵时间。祝好！\\" 此外，在考虑是否接受工作时，也可以进一步了解一下职位的条件和要求，以及是否能在你备考期间给予你足够的弹性和支持，这些都是做出最后决策时的重要因素。"},{"prompt":"Exemple d’un devis pour un grand imprimerie avec une somme au total.","completion":"Devis pour un grand imprimerie Nom de l'entreprise : XYZ Imprimerie Adresse : XX Rue, Ville, Pays Numéro de téléphone : xxx-xxx-xxxx Numéro de devis : XYZ-1234 Date : [Date du devis] Destinataire : Nom de l'entreprise Adresse de l'entreprise Ville, Pays Cher [Nom de la personne], Nous avons le plaisir de vous soumettre notre devis pour les services d'impression pour votre entreprise.

George Orwell, an English novelist, wrote the satirical ‘1984’ after the atrocities of World War II and it remains one of the most powerful warnings ever issued against the dangers of a totalitarian society. Through the novel's protagonist Winston Smith and his desire to rebel against an oppressive regime, important themes of the abuse of absolute power and control, the obliteration of human spirit and the manipulation of truth are highlighted to audiences. Prose fiction elements in ‘1984’ not only shape our understanding of a fictional world but also forge parallels between the plight of its characters and the potential destiny of our own society if we succumb to a totalitarian regime. The relentless pursuit for power and control within society can lead to oppressive regimes which use this power to suppress and malform the masses. Through a concerning depiction of a dystopian society, Orwell’s 1984 uses an overarching theme of power and control to exhibit the terrifying capabilities of totalitarian regimes to dominate every aspect of an individual’s existence by stripping away their rights and freedom in hopes of warning audiences. The unseen figurehead of the party's authoritarian regime, Big Brother, is a chilling emblem of the absolute power the Party exercises over the citizens of Oceania, operating both literally and metaphorically throughout the text. One of the first pieces of propaganda that Winston Smith encounters in the novel is an enormous poster captioned “BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.”, reminding the populace that they are under constant observation. Orwell uses simple and direct language in this recurring slogan to immediately encapsulate the theme of the novel, leaving no room for ambiguity. Big Brother himself is an Orwellian construct, used as an ultimate form of propaganda meant to invoke love and loyalty toward the Party, as well as fear of reprisal for any non-conformance. The recurrence of the quote is a constant reminder of the party's control which Orwell uses to create a deeply unsettling tone The Ministry of Truth where Winston works is one of the four major government buildings prominently displays the Party slogan “WAR IS PEACE/FREEDOM IS SLAVERY/IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.” The paradoxical slogan serves as a tool of control through manipulating the truth and shaping the citizens’ ideology. Orwell purposefully uses contradiction within each of the three phrases to reflect the distorted logic of the party and force their citizens to reject their perception of reality and believe the party without question. This manipulation by the government resonates with the human experience of the audience, displaying the powerful influence language and ideology has over our reality. O’Brien, the grand inquisitor of the totalitarian regime is the personification of the Party as he uses manipulation and torture to control Winston. When Obrien states “ If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face – forever,” he is explaining to Winston in a seemingly offhand manner, daring Winston to imagine that there is no hope for overthrowing the party. Through O'briens dialogue, Orwell details to audiences that the abolishment of a totalitarian government once they gain power is helpless as they easily have the control to metaphorically stamp on the faces of the ambitious few. Through the use of prose fiction elements of setting, character and plot, Orwell's 1984 projects the experiences of his characters onto a potential future for our own society. The manipulation of truth, language, and individual thought depicted in “1984” draws a somber parallel to our own society if totalitarian powers go unchecked, illustrating how such practices can lead to the total subjugation of a society and destruction of the human experience. Totalitarian regimes systematically destroy an individual's will, autonomy and sense of self by suppressing the human capacity for love, resilience and hope. In 1984, the Party used relentless control, psychological manipulation and oppression to obliterate the human spirit. Orwell employs this depiction to warn readers of the distressing future we face should society succumb to authoritarian powers Throughout the novel Winston is portrayed to inwardly rebel against the party, holding onto hope for a revolution. However once subjected to brutal psychological and physical torture, the concluding sentence of 1984 states “He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.” This phrase is deeply ironic, as the victory is actually a failure of his resistance against the party who are the real victors. The paradoxical motif throughout the novel that freedom is slavery comes true as Winstons ‘freedom’ from rebellious thoughts comes through submission to the parties' mental slavery. Orwell is warning audiences how a totalitarian regime can easily lead to the elimination of one's human spirit and complete loss of self. The glass paperweight is an antique of a time before the Party's rise to power, representing Winston's desire to connect with the past and the fragility of his world, particularly the romantic bond between Julia and himself. The paperweight shattering during a thought police raid on Mr Charrington's shop is a pivotal moment in the novel, symbolising the destruction of Winston's ideals and metaphorically displays the Parties abilities to break an individual's spirit. Orwell uses the collapse of Winston's private world and hopes to display the ease of a totalitarian government to crush our ideals and hopes of returning to the past. The Party is constantly changing the historical records to align with its ever changing political narrative to deny their citizens the ability to accurately remember or learn from the past. Their slogan surrounding this states “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past,\\" Orwell uses anaphora to emphasise how controlling the past allows the Party to manipulate one's understanding of history and personal experience which inherently allows them to dominate people's consciousness. Through this quote he warns audiences about the dangers of allowing those in power to rewrite or manipulate history and how it will result in losing their freedom and human spirit along the way. Orwells 1984 utilises elements of prose fiction such as symbolism to draw attention to the parallels between fiction and faction, warning audiences of a totalitarian government's ability to obliterate the human spirit. The human desire for freedom and justice will lead a brave few, trapped in a totalitarian regime, to challenge those in power through resistance and rebellion. Winston embodies the human desire for autonomy by rebelling against the party, despite the crushing power the Party possesses. Orwell’s characterisation of Winston illustrates the indomitable spirit that leads some to resist and rebel in a totalitarian state. Winston takes a bold and dangerous step in asserting his rebellious thoughts during chapter 1 by writing “Down with Big Brother” five times over in his secret diary. The use of repetition emphasises that this phrase is somewhat of a personal mantra to Winston, mirroring the Party’s use of relentless propaganda but in reverse. The direct and simple language reflects his pure hatred for Big Brother. Orwell uses Winstons act to assert the importance of free will in combating governmental powers. By having an intimate and sexual relationship, Winston and Julia rebel against the party who restrict sexual behaviour to being solely for reproduction and not enjoyment. This rebellious act was described as “Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.” This depiction uses metaphor in “battle”, “victory”, and “blow struck against the Party” to compare their act to that of a war scene, as they combat against the oppressive regime and personally triumph over the Party's rules. Orwell uses this moment to display how totalitarian control can attempt to dehumanise us and rebellious acts of intimacy are valid and necessary. Winston's diary serves as an outlet for his rebellious thoughts and to question the nature of freedom, reality, and the principles upon which the Party operates. This is dangerous as owning a diary is an act of thoughtcrime, punishable by death yet Winston is willing to resist against these rules to maintain a sense of self. The diary symbolises his individuality in a society that expects complete loyalty. Orwells demonstrates how simple acts of rebellion and resistance against an oppressive government can help retain one's individualism. The plot, language and symbolism used within 1984 allow audiences to learn key messages about how resistance and rebellion within Oceania is vital to survival. Through the world of the text, Orwell helps readers draw connections to their wider world. George Orwell's timeless 1984 stands as a stark warning to readers about the dangers and brutality of totalitarian regimes. Through Winston’s journey, Orwell uses the elements of prose fiction to mirror the real-world potential for such dystopian despair through Winston's journey which uncovers how the abuse of power and control, the destruction of human spirit and the nature of rebellion and resistance affects society. Orwell not only illustrates how a powerful regime can manipulate and oppress but also offers a warning to readers to remain vigilant against oppressive powers.","completion":"To cut down the essay to 1320 words, you'll need to condense each paragraph and eliminate repetition while ensuring the main points and the flow of the argument remain intact. Here is a streamlined version that retains the core message of the original essay, though keep in mind some detailed examples or explanations may be lost due to the word count restriction. You should also review and adjust the reduction to match your own voice and priorities. --- George Orwell's '1984' is a seminal work that explores the perils of totalitarianism through the experiences of protagonist Winston Smith. The novel’s portrayal of a dystopian society serves as a potent warning against the control and manipulation inherent in absolute power, highlighting significant themes such as the corruption of truth and the erosion of human spirit. Orwell’s narrative, through its characters, setting, and plot, effectively draws parallels to real-world totalitarian potential, emphasizing the importance of vigilance to preserve our freedom and humanity. In '1984', oppressive systems are depicted as wielders of power, capable of engulfing every aspect of individual existence to enforce conformity and suppress dissent. The motif of Big Brother, representing absolute power, is conveyed through simplistic, yet haunting propaganda, such as the ubiquitous slogan “BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU”, instilling fear and loyalty. The Ministry of Truth, where Winston works, manipulates reality through slogans like “WAR IS PEACE/FREEDOM IS SLAVERY/IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH,” paradoxical statements that twist logic and perpetuate the Party’s stranglehold on society. Language becomes a tool for ideological control and distortion. O’Brien, embodying the Party's authority, utilizes torture to crush resistance. His chilling words to Winston, “If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face – forever,” epitomize the hopelessness of defying a totalitarian regime. Through O'Brien's actions, Orwell underscores the futility in challenging such an entrenched power structure. The insidious impact of totalitarianism is demonstrated through the destruction of individuality and personal agency. Winston clings to the hope of resistance but ultimately succumbs to the Party's oppressive force, encapsulated in the ironic victory of his love for Big Brother. The glass paperweight, symbolizing Winston's fragile connection to the past and his doomed romance with Julia, is shattered – a metaphor for the Party's ability to obliterate resistance and rewrite history. Through Winston’s downfall, Orwell highlights the crushing effect of totalitarianism on the human spirit. Despite the risks, Winston's acts of rebellion, such as his secret diary and defiant intimacy with Julia, affirm the intrinsic human desire for freedom. Orwell frames these acts, even the mere possession of a diary, as resistance to the Party’s repression. This defiance underscores how individuality can persist even under the most suffocating regimes. Through the narrative of ‘1984’, Orwell warns of the grave consequences of unchecked power and stresses the importance of guarding against the erosion of freedoms. Winston’s experience reflects the broader implications of resistance and compliance in society. Orwell’s novel serves not only as a cautionary tale of manipulation and control but also as a reminder to remain alert and resilient in the face of oppressive forces. --- The revised version above provides an overview of each major thematic element while maintaining the original's intent and structure.

Концепт – це інформаційна структура свідомості, що містить знання про об’єкт пізнання. Він є різносубстратною та організованою одиницею пам’яті, яка може мати вербальною та невербальне вираження [Фоміна, 2010, c. 87–90]. Одним із засновників теорії концепту є Жорж Лакофф, який визначив концепт як «основну одиницю когнітивної структури, через яку ми сприймаємо та категоризуємо світ» [Lakoff, 1987, p. 12–13]. Ж. Лакофф і М. Джонсон розробили теорію «метафоричного мислення», яка стверджує, що наше розуміння світу засноване на метафорах, які ми використовуємо для опису абстрактних понять через конкретні образи [Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, p. 7–9]. У лінгвістиці концепт розглядається як базова одиниця мислення, яка створюється у розумінні людиною певного фрагмента дійсності. Концепт являє собою абстрактні ідеї, які описують основні характеристики та властивості певного об’єкта, явища чи процесу. Концепти можуть бути простими, наприклад, «колір», «форма», «розмір», або складними, наприклад, «демократія», «екологія», «трансцендентальність». Прості концепти представляють собою базові характеристики об’єктів, явищ та процесів. Вони відображають основні сприйняття, які ми маємо щодо світу. Наприклад, коли ми спостерігаємо різні об’єкти, ми розрізняємо їх за їхнім кольором, формою і розміром. Ці прості концепти допомагають нам описувати та сприймати світ навколо нас. З іншого боку, складні концепти відображають більш абстрактні та складні ідеї. Вони представляють собою концептуальні уявлення про абстрактні поняття, соціальні явища, філософські конструкції та інші комплексні теми [Старко, 2012, с. 42–48]. Важливим складником теорії концепту є ідея про те, що концепти пов’язані з культурними нормами та цінностями. Як зазначає В. Яковлєва, «Концепти як одиниці людського знання/свідомості віддзеркалюють світ національного світосприймання предметів і понять засобами певної мови.» [Яковлєва, 2008]. Це означає, що наші концепти формуються під впливом культурних і соціальних чинників, таких як релігія, історія, політика тощо. Наприклад, концепт СІМ’Я може мати різне змістове наповнення в різних культурах, що свідчить про те, що концепти відображають різні культурні цінності та переконання [Яковлєва, 2008]. Теорія концепту досліджує, як структуровані та організовані певні фрагменти знання людини про світ у людському розумі, а також те, як ці фрагменти використовуються для мислення та комунікації. Відповідно до теорії концепту, наші сприйняття та розуміння світу навколо нас відбито у концептах, які ми формуємо на основі досвіду. Кожен з нас має свій унікальний набір концептів, який формується внаслідок нашого життєвого досвіду, взаємодії з навколишнім середовищем та культурою, в якій ми виросли [Голобородько, 2006, c. 27–30]. В лінгвістиці художній концепт належить до аналізу літературних творів та мовних засобів, використаних для вираження художньої ідеї. Аналіз художнього концепту сприяє розкриттю його сутності, розумінню та ефективності в мовному виразі. Цей аналіз передбачає виявлення основних художніх ідей, емоційно-оцінних компонентів, особливостей авторської концептуалізації та їх втілення у художньому тексті [Петренко, 2020, c. 49–52]. Дослідження концепту складається з декількох етапів, включаючи побудову номінативного поля, аналіз та опис семантики мовних засобів, що належать до цього поля, та когнітивну інтерпретацію результатів опису семантики мовних засобів. Номінативне поле концепту описується як сукупність мовних засобів, що відображають даний концепт. Воно включає лексичні та фразеологічні одиниці, структурні та позиційні схеми речень, текстів та сукупностей текстів. Це означає, що дослідник аналізує різні лексичні та граматичні варіанти, які використовуються для вираження даного концепту у мові [Слободян, 2009, c. 104–115.]. Такий аналіз надає можливість зрозуміти, яким чином концепт репрезентується і передається в мовленнєвому виразі. Когнітивна інтерпретація полягає у виявленні когнітивних ознак, що формують досліджуваний концепт як ментальну одиницю. Це означає, що дослідник зосереджується на тому, які ментальні процеси та уявлення пов’язані з даним концептом. Цей аналіз дозволяє розкрити глибинний сенс та значення концепту, а також розуміння того, як він взаємодіє з іншими концептами та поняттями у когнітивній системі. В номінативне поле концепту входять не лише його прямі номінації, а й похідні та метафоричні номінації, контекстуальні синоніми, лексикографічні тлумачення, фразеологічні одиниці, паремії, суб’єктивні словесні дефініції та ім’я концепту, яке найповніше виражає його основний зміст. Це різноманіття мовних засобів допомагає уявити всебічний спектр вираження концепту в мові та розкрити його багатогранність [Остапчук, 2018, c. 84–88]. Для вивчення структури концепту важливим етапом є також компонентний та дескриптивний аналіз словникових дефініцій, оскільки лексична система, представлена в словниках, є відображенням специфіки мовної картини світу [Остапчук, 2018, c. 84–88]. Отже, концепт – це інформаційна структура свідомості, що включає знання про об’єкт пізнання. Він може бути вербальним або невербальним, а також має різні рівні складності. У лінгвістиці концепт розглядається як базова одиниця мислення, яка створюється у розумінні людиною певного фрагмента дійсності, тоді як поняття використовуються для досягнення взаєморозуміння між носіями мови. Теорія концепту досліджує структуру та організацію понять у людському розумі, та вказує на те, що концепт є складною структурованою сутністю, яка включає в себе різні аспекти, такі як фізичні характеристики, взаємодію з іншими об’єктами та інтерпретації людьми. Також, наші концепти формуються під впливом культурних і соціальних чинників, тому що концепти є частиною культурного досвіду та відображають ідеологічні й культурні норми, які присутні в суспільстві, де використовується мова. Отже, наше сприйняття та розуміння світу навколо нас базуються на наших концептах, які ми формуємо на основі досвіду та культурних впливів.","completion":"Концепт — це інформаційна структура свідомості, що включає знання про об’єкт пізнання і може виражатися вербально або невербально.

У віршах Лесі Українки символи, такі як червоний колір (який може символізувати полум'я проти обмежень), вогонь (який виражає палкість та енергію боротьби), мечі (які представляють силу), квіти (які символізують надію та красу в боротьбі), іскри (які можуть відображати ідеї, що запалюють серця) — усі вони створюють атмосферу боротьби та віри в перемогу [Семененко, 2013]. У статті проведено детальний дефініційний аналіз концепту «боротьба». Визначено, що основні семи концепту включають «боротьба за щось, проти чогось», «енергія або схильність до боротьби», «бійка між людьми чи групами людей», «битва між арміями» та «суперечка». Наприклад, у художньому контексті концепт «боротьба» може виявлятися через зображення боротьби героїв за свої переконання [Семененко, 2013]. Дослідники звертають увагу на концепт боротьба і в англомовному дискурсі, а саме «Вербалізація концепту fight в англомовному художньому дискурсі та особливості його відтворення в українському перекладі». Автор Капуш розглядає вербалізацію концепту FIGHT у англомовних художніх текстах та перекладі цього концепту на українську мову. Ця стаття досліджує, якими мовними засобами можна передати ідеї боротьби та як цей концепт відтворюється в українських перекладах [Капуш, 2018]. Автор Капуш використовує методи аналізу перекладу та синонімічного аналізу для вивчення вербалізації концепту FIGHT у художніх текстах та його перекладі на українську. Автор статті досліджує лексеми FIGHT як дієслово, вказуючи на основні класи семем, такі як «воювати», «боротися за щось», «битися», «боротися проти чогось» та «сперечатися». У статті також проводиться синонімічний аналіз лексеми FIGHT, де розглядаються синоніми, такі як «struggle», «battle», «combat» та «conflict». Наприклад, у романі «Harry Potter» синонім «struggle» може використовуватися для передачі ідеї боротьби головного героя проти сил зла. Капуш аналізує, як концепт FIGHT виражається в англомовних художніх текстах. Наприклад, у романі «Hunger Games» вербалізація концепту FIGHT виявляється через зображення героїв, які вступають у боротьбу за власне виживання та свободу [Капуш, 2018]. Обидва дослідження демонструють, що концепт БОРОТЬБА є універсальним та актуальним у різних культурних та мовних середовищах. Він відображає глибокі аспекти людського досвіду та прагнення до перемоги над труднощами. Аналізуючи результати досліджень, можемо зрозуміти, як специфічність мови та культурного контексту впливає на сприйняття та інтерпретацію концепту БОРОТЬБА. Підкреслюється значущість вибору лексичних одиниць та символів для виразу цього концепту в різних мовних середовищах. Аналіз концепту БОРОТЬБА в романах «New Moon» Стефені Мейєр і «Beyond the blossoming fields» Юнічі Ватанабе, англомовний переклад роману японської літератури, відкриває різні аспекти та варіації цього концепту. В обох романах, боротьба стає ключовим мотивом і впливає на розвиток головних персонажів та сюжету. Обидва романи використовують символіку та образи, щоб підкреслити боротьбу героїв. Але на відміну від вище аналізованих робіт, де представленні різні види боротьби, в цих романах складником концепту БОРОТЬБА є особистісна. У романі «New Moon», символи, такі як місяць та сонце, відображають стан головної героїні. А «Beyond the blossoming fields» образ молодого дерева підкреслює рост Гінко як лікаря. Ці приклади свідчать про різноманітність та багатогранність концепту БОРОТЬБА у літературі та лінгвістиці. У романі «New Moon» дуже гарно описується внутрішня боротьба. Белла, головна героїня, змушена боротися не лише з вампірськими перешкодами, але й із власними прагненнями та емоціями. Вона представляє внутрішню боротьбу, де вибір між вампірським життям та людськими цінностями важливий. Її боротьба відображається в її рішеннях та внутрішніх конфліктах, а також у мові та лексиці, яку використовує автор для опису її стану душі [Riskitya, Teguh, 2019]. Гінко Огіно, головна героїня роману «Beyond the blossoming fields» є прикладом іншого варіанту боротьби. Її боротьба - це прагнення стати лікарем у часи, коли жінкам було важко досягти професійного визнання. Цей роман демонструє зовнішню боротьбу за досягнення мрії та надзвичайну мотивацію головної героїні. Внутрішні монологи та роздуми Гінко допомагають читачеві зрозуміти її внутрішні конфлікти та рішучість [Sri Wirda and Purwarno, 2019]. Аналіз концепту БОРОТЬБА вказує на те, що цей концепт універсальний і може мати різноманітні вияви у житті та літературі. Він відображає силу людської волі та визначеності, а також внутрішній боротьбу між різними цінностями та пріоритетами. Концепт БОРОТЬБА залишається актуальною і важливою у літературі та суспільстві. Вона відображає глибокі аспекти людської природи та надає нам можливість краще розуміти себе та інших. БОРОТЬБА також є важливим аспектом лінгвістики та культурології, і його вивчення допомагає розкрити глибинні аспекти людського існування. Проаналізовані дослідження свідчать про універсальність цього концепту та різноманітність його вербалізації в літературних текстах. Аналіз цього концепту допомагає нам краще розуміти не лише мову, але й сутність культур та суспільства.","completion":"Концепт боротьба є одним з ключових об'єктів сучасних лінгвістичних досліджень, представляючи універсальне значення в різних контекстах – фізичному, моральному, психологічному, і соціокультурному. Цей концепт репрезентований у різних культурах та має різні відтінки значень. Як пише Семененко, в ліриці Лесі Українки, концепт БОРОТЬБА має багатий спектр емоцій та аспектів, від особистої боротьби до загальнолюдських ідеалів, виражених через образи як червоний колір або мечі [Семененко, 2013]. У дослідженні Капуша аналізується вербалізація концепту FIGHT у англійській мові, акцентуючи на специфіці і його передачі в українському перекладі. Дослідник розглядає лексеми як \\"боротися\\", \\"битися\\", \\"сперечатися\\", і як ці слова відображають різні грані боротьби у творах [Капуш, 2018]. Вивчення концепції БОРОТЬБА охоплює різні аспекти, такі як внутрішні та зовнішні конфлікти, ідеологічні суперечки та наполегливість у досягненні цілей. У художніх романах, як \\"New Moon\\" та \\"Beyond the blossoming fields\\", концепт розкривається через особистісну боротьбу головних персонажів з власними бажаннями та середовищем, де образи місяця, сонця, або молодого дерева втілюють боротьбу за самовираження та професійний розвиток [Riskitya, Teguh, 2019; Sri Wirda and Purwarno, 2019]. Всі дослідження демонструють, що концепт боротьби є ключем до розуміння глибинних культурних, моральних та психологічних аспектів суспільства, відображаючи силу людського духу та волі. Аналіз різних проявів концепту боротьби в мовному та літературному контексті важливий для розуміння ідей та ідеалів, які формують культуру та суспільство."},{"prompt":"ти дуже сильно прибрав початок про боротьбу. мені потрібно, щоб ти дав відповідь на це запитання: концепт боротьба як объект сучасних лінгвістичних досліджень","completion":"Концепт боротьба є важливим об'єктом сучасних лінгвістичних досліджень, адже він зустрічається у багатьох культурних та соціальних контекстах, включаючи літературу, публічні виступи та повсякденне спілкування. Цей концепт асоціюється з волею до життя, стійкістю, витривалістю та запеклою боротьбою з перешкодами. Як об'єкт лінгвістичних досліджень, концепт боротьба виражається через різноманітні мовні засоби, включаючи метафори, синекдохи, символіку та інші стилістичні фігури, що передають не лише зовнішній конфлікт але й внутрішню динаміку. В літературних дослідженнях концепт боротьба використовується для аналізу сюжетів, образів та тем, досліджуючи як герої ведуть боротьбу за свої переконання, ідеали та мети. У літературознавстві образи боротьби допомагають дослідникам розкривати глибинні пласти людської психіки, соціальних зв'язків та культурних взаємовпливів. Зокрема, у поезіях Лесі Українки образ боротьби знайдемо у мотивах боротьби за свободу, з якими вона виступає проти гнітючих сил, використовуючи символічні образи такі як полум'я, вогонь чи меч, що доносять силу волі та незламність духу [Семененко, 2013]. У англомовному дискурсі концепт \\"fight\\" аналізується як боротьба у широкому сенсі цього слова, включаючи воєнні дії, спортивні змагання, аргументацію чи психологічну боротьбу з особистими перешкодами. Дослідження перекладу концептів також важливе, адже вони можуть зазнавати трансформації при переході з однієї культури в іншу. Капуш розглядає як різні мовні засоби передають ідеї боротьби та як англійський концепт \\"fight\\" відтворюється в українську мову, вивчаючи лексеми \\"боротися\\", \\"битися\\" та синонімічні ряди [Капуш, 2018]. Таким чином, концепт боротьба слугує не лише для зображення конфліктів або викликів у фізичному світі, але також символізує внутрішні стани та емоційну реакцію людини, роблячи його важливим елементом у психологічних, соціальних та культурних дослідженнях."},{"prompt":"ти змінив мій текст, я просила його не міняти. ще раз пиши","completion":"Концепт \\"боротьба\\" в сучасній лінгвістиці досліджується як багатогранний об'єкт, який включає в себе не тільки фізичну дію, але й моральні, психологічні й соціокультурні боротьби, виявляючи особливості культури та індивідуальні аспекти людського існування. Цей концепт охоплює велику кількість значень: від змагань і конфліктів до внутрішньої боротьби з особистими переконаннями, що знайшло відображення у дослідженні Семененка, де концепт \\"боротьба\\" розглядається через призму лірики Лесі Українки [Семененко, 2013]. Концепт \\"боротьба\\" також вивчається у контексті перекладознавства, як показано у дослідженні Капуша, де досліджується англійський концепт \\"fight\\" у художньому дискурсі та його відтворення в українському перекладі [Капуш, 2018]. Дослідження концепту \\"боротьба\\" допомагає виявити як ментальні образи і смислові поля, пов'язані з поняттям боротьби, представлені в різних мовах і культурах, так і впливи цих культурних репрезентацій на розуміння і сприйняття самих актів боротьби. Враховуючи широкий спектр значень і асоціацій, концепт \\"боротьба\\" є цінним інструментом для розуміння мовних механізмів вираження конфлікту, мотивації, взаємодії особистості та суспільства, а також динаміки культурного розвитку.

The formulas to calculate EV and CV are as follows: 1. Equivalent Variation (EV): EV measures the change in income that would make a consumer indifferent between the new economic condition and the initial condition. It represents the income levels at which the consumer's utility remains the same before and after the change. The formula to calculate EV is: EV = U2 - U1 Where: U2 = Utility level under the new economic condition U1 = Utility level under the initial condition 2. Compensating Variation (CV): CV measures the amount of monetary compensation required to restore the consumer's utility to the initial level after the change in economic conditions. It represents the change in income needed to make the consumer equally as well off as before the change.

举个例子，假设消费者在初始条件下每月收入为1000美元，面临某种商品的价格上涨。在新的经济条件下，该商品价格上涨20%。为了计算等效变化和补偿变化，我们还需要知道消费者对该商品的边际效用。假设在初始条件下，消费者将每月100美元用于购买该商品，价格上涨后，消费者减少了每月购买该商品的数量。 现在我们来计算等效变化和补偿变化： 第一步，计算等效变化： 假设在初始条件下，消费者对该商品的边际效用为10。根据等效变化的公式，等效变化（EV）可以计算为新条件（价格上涨后）的效用减去初始条件的效用。 U2 = (1000 - 100 * (1 + 0.2)) * 10 = 9900 U1 = 1000 * 10 = 10000 EV = U2 - U1 = 9900 - 10000 = -100 等效变化为-100美元，表示消费者因价格上涨而损失了100美元的福利。 第二步，计算补偿变化： 补偿变化（CV）衡量需要多少经济补偿才能使消费者对新条件感到和初始条件一样满意。根据补偿变化的公式，补偿变化可以计算为初始收入减去新条件的收入。 I1 = 1000 I2 = (1000 - 100) * (1 + 0.2) = 1180 CV = I1 - I2 = 1000 - 1180 = -180 补偿变化为-180美元，表示消费者需要额外获得180美元的收入来弥补价格上涨所带来的福利损失。 因为等效变化和补偿变化都是负数，所以这个价格上涨对消费者造成了福利损失，并且需要一定的经济补偿来达到初始的福利水平。"},{"prompt":"如果u1>u0,c(u1,p)>c(u0,p),证明cv和ev同号","completion":"在此情况下，U1（新经济条件下的效用）大于U0（初始经济条件下的效用），这意味着消费者在新条件下的福利更高。C(U1, P)（新条件下的代价）大于C(U0, P)（初始条件下的代价），这表示在新条件下消费者需要支付更多的成本。 现在，我们来证明在这种情况下，补偿变化（CV）和等效变化（EV）会具有相同的符号。 根据补偿变化的计算公式：CV = I1 - I2，其中I1是初始收入，I2是新条件下的收入。由于新条件下消费者的福利更高，他们可能会愿意为了享受这个更高的福利而支付更多的成本。因此，我们可以假设新条件下的收入I2大于初始收入I1，即I2 > I1。在这种情况下，CV为正数。 根据等效变化的计算公式：EV = U2 - U1，其中U2是在新条件下的效用，U1是在初始条件下的效用。由于新条件下消费者的福利更高，他们在新条件下的效用U2大于在初始条件下的效用U1，即U2 > U1。在这种情况下，EV为正数。 因此，在U1 > U0且C(U1, P) > C(U0,

接下来，根据EV的定义，EV = U2 - U1，其中U2是在新条件下的效用，U1是在初始条件下的效用。我们已经知道U1 > U0，也可以推导出U2 > U1。因此，EV = U2 - U1是正数减去正数，结果仍然为正数，即EV > 0。 综上所述，当U1 > U0和C(U1, P) > C(U0,

在这种情况下，我们无法从c(u1,p)>c(u0,p)直接推出CV和EV的符号关系，请忽略我之前给出的错误解释。CV和EV的符号关系需要根据效用函数和成本函数的具体性质来确定，不能以c(u1,p)>c(u0,p)为依据。

product","completion":"Differential forms and the wedge product are fundamental concepts in differential geometry and algebraic topology. Let's start by explaining differential forms, and then we'll see how they relate to the wedge product and the tensor product. # Differential Forms A differential form of degree (k) (also called a k-form) on an (n)-dimensional smooth manifold (M) is an object that can be integrated over (k)-dimensional submanifolds of (M). More formally, a k-form is a smooth section of the (k)th exterior power of the cotangent bundle of (M). Here are some examples: - A 0-form is just a smooth function on (M). - A 1-form is a mapping that assigns to each point (p in M) a linear functional on the tangent space at (p), (T_pM). - A 2-form assigns to each point (p in M) a bilinear functional that is antisymmetric on the tangent space at (p). # Wedge Product The wedge product is an operation that takes two differential forms of degree (k) and (l) and produces a new differential form of degree (k+l). It is denoted by (wedge). The wedge product is antisymmetric, meaning that if (alpha) is a k-form and (beta) is an l-form, then (beta wedge alpha = (-1)^{k cdot l} alpha wedge beta). The antisymmetric nature of the wedge product is what distinguishes it from just taking the product of two functions: when you switch the order of the factors, the sign of the result may change. This is related to the orientation of the manifold and the orientation of the submanifolds over which you would integrate these forms. # Tensor Product The tensor product is an operation that combines vectors, vector spaces, or tensors in a way that results in a new tensor of higher rank. Given a vector space (V), its tensor product with itself, denoted (V otimes V), is a vector space whose elements correspond to ordered pairs of elements from (V). The operation can also be extended to differential forms. If (alpha) is a k-form and (beta) is an l-form, their tensor product, denoted (alpha otimes beta), is a ((k+l))-tensor—but not necessarily a ((k+l))-form, because the tensor product does not automatically incorporate the antisymmetry necessary for differential forms. # Relation Between the Wedge and Tensor Products The wedge product is basically a \\"skew-symmetrized\\" version of the tensor product for differential forms. It can be considered as taking the tensor product of two forms, then antisymmetrizing the result to enforce the property that swapping two inputs changes the sign of the output, in line with how differential forms should behave. Here's a rough sketch of how you might construct the wedge product from the tensor product: 1. Take the tensor product of two differential forms. 2. Antisymmetrize the result by summing over permutations of the tensor indices, with a factor of the signature (±1) of the permutation for each term. 3. Divide by the appropriate factorial to normalize the result. The resulting wedge product respects the antisymmetry that is characteristic of differential forms. When you integrate a k-form over a k-dimensional oriented manifold (or submanifold), the orientation is naturally accounted for by the antisymmetry in the wedge product. In conclusion, the wedge product is vital for handling differential forms in the context of integration over manifolds and related geometric and topological constructions. It brings together the algebraic structure given by the tensor product with the antisymmetry that is physically and geometrically meaningful."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

ISA, assume Walmart International Business Unit was creating a B2B2C Cross-Border Marketplace integration platform. The platform aimed to streamline the process of online selling by small merchants in one country and online buying of those products across international borders by international shoppers, offering seamless integration of Walmart Digital USA’s marketplace.walmart.com to multiple of its Walmart International Online Marketplaces (for example, Walmart U.K. walmart.uk, Walmart Canada walmart.ca, Walmart Mexico walmart.mx) and also to the international marketplaces of Walmart’s Strategic Partners like JD.com in China and Rakuten.com in Japan. The different white-label products by the vendor Payoneer to optimize working capital and manage cash flows for cross-border online small merchants/sellers listed on Walmart International's B2B2C Cross-Border Marketplace. 0nce those sellers lists on Walmart International's B2B2C Cross-Border Marketplace, they would seamless be able to select countries to sell into to cross-border shoppers in other countries around the world where Walmart International's Local Marketplace and/or where Walmart International's Strategic Partners have local/country online marketplace. Note: In terms of the marketplace’s role (like Walmart International's B2B2C Cross-Border Marketplace) in the facilitation of working capital to cross-border online small merchants/sellers, the marketplace may facilitate transactions between merchants and consumers but the marketplace does not take on the capital and credit risks associated with the financial services provided by Payoneer to the cross-border online small merchants/sellers listed on Walmart International's B2B2C Cross-Border Marketplace. It is Payoneer that maintains and manages these risks. **Payoneer Overview** Payoneer is a technology company specializing in procurement and finance solutions. **Payoneer White-Label Products' Highlights:** - **Overall Capabilities:** Payoneer's technology is highly functional, enabling users to manage a wide range of complex B2C and B2B transactions, with B2G not being as strong. It provides services such as Payments and Financing. Managed Services in the E2P and O2C sectors (End-to-Pay and Order-to-Cash) are also offered by Payoneer. - **Source-to-Pay / AP Automation:** This feature breaks away from the traditional dynamic of the supplier having to align their payment terms with the buyer's requirements. Instead, suppliers decide how and when they want to be paid. This is done by preconfiguring the method of payment during the onboarding process. - **Order to Cash:** Corcentric's O2C solutions enable companies to have an automated credit management, discrepancy, and dispute resolution system. The focus here is on minimizing manual touchpoints and reducing credit decisioning time. **Payoneer's Vendor Differentiation:** - **Positioning:** Payoneer positioned themselves on the Order-to-Cash side as an extension of a (Accounts Receivable) department to the suppliers who supply cross-border sellers selling on cross-border marketplaces. - **Credit underwriting:** Payoneer was one of the few vendors offering continuous credit underwriting for sellers selling on cross-border marketplace, which helps in reducing risks and understanding the complexity involved. Also, with Payoneer, sellers selling on cross-border marketplace could have preconfigured how they wanted to pay their suppliers. The suppliers then could have chosen from a menu of options during onboarding. Here's a breakdown of Payoneer's various platforms back then: 1. **Payoneer FastTrack** **Payoneer FastTrack's Platform Highlights:** - Comprises a Portal for sellers selling on cross-border marketplace, Portal for suppliers to sellers selling on cross-border marketplaces, Accounts Receivable Management Dashboard for suppliers to sellers selling on cross-border marketplace. - Offered in-depth analysis, reporting, and custom credit monitoring to allow enterprises of all sizes to offer supply chain finance, dynamic discounting, and accounts receivable finance to their ecosystem of suppliers to sellers selling on cross-border marketplaces. - Incorporated funding stability and advanced analytics, insights, and risk monitoring. 2. **Payoneer FastTrack's Differentiation:** - Payoneer FastTrack's primary objective was to assist suppliers in growing sales, maintaining financial health, and building resilience. - Payoneer FastTrack specialized back then in credit expertise for companies with complex, unrated, and private credit. - Payoneer FastTrack provided a one-stop interface solution with risk monitoring and sellers-selling-on-cross-border--marketplaces portal success. - Offered lightweight onboarding solutions that don't interfere with current payment solutions. - Partnerships with AP automation and strategic management solutions. 3. **Payoneer Previse** 3.1. **Category: WC (Working Capital)** - Positioned as a data science-first solution. - Provided instant cash on invoice. 3.2. **Payoneer Previse's Value to Clients:** - Supported small and medium-sized suppliers. - Instant cash on the invoice using algorithms, regardless of the payment terms offered to sellers-selling-on-cross-border--marketplaces. - Had high onboarding success rates. 3.3. **Payoneer Previse's Core Working Capital Offering:** - Included a series of platform features, including third-party processing, supplier onboarding process, financing solutions, and invoice validation process. 3.4. **Payoneer Previse's Managed Services:** - Covered aspects from buyer engagement to data extraction and cleansing 4. **Payoneer PrimeRevenue** Payoneer PrimeRevenue was a cloud-based platform that provides solutions for accounts receivable finance. Here's a quick summary of the features and benefits presented back then: **Payoneer PrimeRevenue Platform Highlights**: 4.1. **SCI Customer**: This was a solution that helps companies to sell their accounts receivable to their largest customers for immediate payment. Essentially, it leveraged Payoneer PrimeRevenue's multi-funder network to offer competitive financing rates across multiple jurisdictions. It allowed businesses to control when they want to get paid early and is available globally. 4.2. **Strong Analytics & Deep Procurement Expertise**: The Payoneer PrimeRevenue platform was said back then that it had been designed to tailor and structure programs that align with customer needs. [It was also claimed that it aided in procurement negotiations, benchmarking suppliers for onboarding, and analyzing performance against predefined metrics. - As the the FP&A-and-Finance-Business-Partner supporting Product-and-Engineering-Leadership with Walmart's cross-border trade marketplace integration platform business unit back then, what actual analytical role would I have played supporting the Product Manager who himself was working with Payoneer on integrating Payoneer PrimeRevenue into Walmart's Cross-Border Trade Marketplace Platform back then, for specifically a solution that enabled the discussed procurement negotiations, benchmarking suppliers for onboarding, and analyzing performance against predefined metrics?] 4.3. **Continuous Performance KPIs Analysis**: [Payoneer PrimeRevenue was claimed to had been built to continuously assess the performance of suppliers against working capital, DPOs, early payment utilization rates, and various other performance metrics - what actual analytical role here would I have played supporting the Product Manager who himself was working with Payoneer on integrating Payoneer PrimeRevenue into Walmart's Cross-Border Trade Marketplace Platform back then?] **Payoneer PrimeRevenue Differentiation**: **Flexible Funding Structures**: The platform provideD various funding options to support the client's strategic goals. This included structures like the Payoneer PrimeRevenue platform directly supporting their programs, or using a third-party syndicate to support transactions. **Payoneer PrimeRevenue Supply Chain Finance**: This was believed to be one of the cornerstones of Payoneer offering. By leveraging the platform, suppliers and buyers can achieve a win-win scenario where suppliers to sellers selling on cross-border marketplaces got paid early while sellers selling on cross-border marketplaces can extend their payment terms. **Unique Features for Supplier Early Payment**: Payoneer PrimeRevenue offered two unique features to facilitate early payments for suppliers to sellers selling on cross-border marketplaces: - **Electronic Time Drafts (ETD)**: A patented solution exclusive to Payoneer PrimeRevenue that replaces traditional paper drafts, streamlining payment processes and reducing transaction costs. - **Discounting by Supplier**: A feature that enabled suppliers to offer discounts in return for early payments. This supposedly aided in improving cash flow and managing working capital effectively. **Takeaways**: Payoneer PrimeRevenue offered what it seemed to me back then to be a comprehensive solution for businesses looking to optimize their accounts receivable processes, with a focus on flexibility, analytical insights, and global reach. The platform's unique features, such as ETDs and supplier discounting options, further differentiated it in the market.","completion":"Analyzing the scenario where a Finance Business Partner/Tech-Finance-Manager supports an Engineering-and-Product division at Walmart International's B2B2C Cross-Border Marketplace, particularly with respect to integrating Payoneer’s White-Label products, the following analytical analyses would typically be undertaken: **Detailed Financial Planning and Analysis around the Payoneer Integration:** 1. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Determine the financial costs of integrating Payoneer's services versus the projected benefits in terms of enhanced working capital management and cash flow for the platform's small merchants. 2. **ROI Analysis**: Calculate the return on investment for the Payoneer integration by projecting incremental revenue growth and cost savings from improved working capital cycles. 3. **Transaction Volume Analysis**: Project and monitor the volume of cross-border transactions facilitated by Payoneer’s financial solutions and assess associated revenue impacts. **Specific to Payoneer PrimeRevenue and Marketplace Analytics:** 4. **Procurement Negotiation Analysis**: Analyze historical data to identify the optimal terms for procurement negotiations, including payment terms and benchmark prices, and examine how Payoneer PrimeRevenue can facilitate better deal structuring. 5. **Supplier Onboarding Benchmark Analysis**: Develop metrics to evaluate the success rate and efficiency of the supplier onboarding process managed by Payoneer, including time to onboard and supplier drop-off rates. 6. **Performance Metrics Analysis**: Track and evaluate supplier performance using predefined KPIs, including working capital metrics, DPO, early payment rates, and compare against industry benchmarks to identify areas for improvement. 7. **Liquidity Analysis and Cash Flow Optimization**: Study the overall cash flow improvement for small merchants by using Payoneer’s instant cash on invoice solution and assess how it impacts the marketplace liquidity. 8. **Credit Risk Analysis**: Work closely with Payoneer to understand the credit underwriting process and continuously assess the credit risk profile of the marketplace’s participants. 9. **Revenue Impact Analysis**: Evaluate the impact of Payoneer’s services on the platform’s revenue.

Here is a step-by-step process to integrate econometric models: 1. **Define Economic Variables**: Identify key macroeconomic variables that could impact cross-border e-commerce, such as exchange rates, inflation rates, interest rates, GDP growth, and consumer spending patterns in different countries. 2. **Data Collection**: Gather historical data on the identified variables. Utilize reliable sources such as central banks, international financial institutions, and economic research databases to ensure data accuracy. 3. **Preliminary Analysis**: Conduct exploratory data analysis to detect trends, seasonal patterns, and potential outliers in the macroeconomic data. 4. **Model Specification**: Choose the appropriate econometric model framework. For cross-border transactions, regression models that account for time-series data, panel data models, or vector autoregression (VAR) models may be suitable. 5. **Estimation and Testing**: Use econometric software to estimate the model's parameters and test the model for statistical significance, ensuring that the relationships inferred are robust and not due to random chance. 6. **Integration with Financial Forecasts**: Link the insights from econometric models to Walmart’s financial forecasts. For instance, if the model suggests that marketplace sales are negatively impacted by currency volatility, this could lead to adjustments in revenue projections for regions with unstable currencies. 7. **Scenario Building**: Construct scenarios based on different macroeconomic conditions. This could include a best-case scenario where global economic conditions are favorable, a status-quo scenario, and a worst-case scenario with economic downturns or sudden market changes. 8. **Policy Simulation**: Simulate various policy changes (for example, changes in tariffs or cross-border taxes) and annotate their potential effect on the marketplace, guiding strategies to mitigate risks or capitalize on new opportunities. 9. **Continuous Model Refinement**: As new data becomes available and economic conditions evolve, continually refine the model. Backtest the model against recent historical events to improve its predictive accuracy. 10. **Reporting and Decision-Making**: Translate the econometric model’s findings into actionable insights for senior management, providing recommendations on how to adjust the marketplace strategy in response to economic projections. In practical real-world terms for Walmart International's Cross-Border Marketplace, the integration of econometric models means having a sophisticated forecast tool that informs financial planning not just based on past company performance, but also on future economic landscapes. This could be critical for decisions on pricing strategy, inventory management across different geographies, or even which countries to prioritize for expansion or scaling back operations. **Continuing with Depth on Other Elements:** **Predictive Modeling for Future Financial Metrics:** Predictive modeling goes beyond assessing current trends to forecast future financial outcomes using techniques like regression analysis, machine learning, and time-series forecasting. Implementing predictive modeling involves: 1. **Define Financial Outcomes**: Start with clear definitions of the financial metrics Walmart International aims to predict – revenue, costs, or customer growth on the marketplace, among others. 2. **Feature Selection**: Identify internal factors (like website traffic, average spend per user) and external factors (like seasonality, economic indicators) likely to influence the outcomes. 3. **Historical Data Analysis**: Use historical data to observe how changes in selected features have been associated with shifts in financial outcomes over time, establishing a cause-effect relationship. 4. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Depending on the complexity, utilize machine learning algorithms that can handle large datasets and uncover non-linear relationships between predictors and financial outcomes. 5. **Model Training and Validation**: Allocate a portion of historical data to 'train' the machine learning models, and a separate portion to 'validate' the predictions, ensuring the model has not overfitted to the training data. 6. **Integration with Financial Planning**: Incorporate the predictive model’s outputs into financial planning exercises in Excel, allowing the forecasts to adjust in real-time as input variables change. 7. **Continuous Learning**: As actual financial outcomes materialize, feed them back into the model to learn from any prediction errors and adjust future predictions accordingly. In utilizing these advanced techniques, Walmart can fine-tune its operational and marketing efforts, allocating resources efficiently to maximize financial returns and enhance marketplace performance. **Optimization Algorithms for Strategic Financial Strategies:** Optimization algorithms are a subset of operations research used to find the best possible solutions under given constraints. For Walmart’s context, following steps can be undertaken: 1. **Identify the Optimization Objective**: This could be minimizing costs, maximizing revenues, or achieving the optimal balance between inventory levels and shipping times in cross-border transactions. 2. **Define Constraints and Variables**: List down the constraints (like budget limits, supply chain capacities) and variables (variables that decision-makers can control, such as marketing spend). 3. **Choose Optimization Technique**: Depending on the nature of the financial problem, select the right optimization algorithm – linear programming for simple linear relationships, integer programming for decision variables that are integers, or more sophisticated algorithms like genetic algorithms for highly complex problems. 4. **Implement the Algorithm**: Use software tools that can handle advanced optimization routines, like MATLAB or R, to solve the optimization problem. 5. **Analyze Optimal Solutions**: Evaluate the solutions provided by the algorithm for feasibility and practicality. Sometimes, the mathematically optimal solution might not be the best strategic fit due to unmodeled business considerations. 6. **Incorporate into Strategic Decision-Making**: Use the insights from the optimization model to inform strategic decisions, like resource allocation or market prioritization. Each of these modeling techniques advances Walmart International's ability to anticipate challenges, seize opportunities, understand complex marketplace dynamics, and remain a competitive force in the global e-commerce landscape. The financial department plays a central role in marrying technical modeling expertise with business acumen to propel informed, data-driven strategy across the organization."},{"prompt":"Please continue with more depth on Econometric Models for Walmart International’s Cross-Border Marketplace","completion":"To provide more depth on integrating Econometric Models for Walmart International’s Cross-Border Marketplace, we’ll delve into the specifics like model selection, data considerations, and implementation strategies.

The rapid development of AI technologies has ushered in a period of significant transformation in the labor market, compelling industries to re-envision their approach to innovation, production, and value creation. Within the creative industries, such as music, literature, and visual arts, AI is redefining the boundaries of expression and raising existential questions about the role and identity of the artist in the digital age. In professional realms, AI-driven automation and decision-making tools offer promises of increased efficiency and accuracy, yet also provoke serious contemplation regarding the future of human skills, jobs, and ethical considerations in this symbiotic relationship. As companies are seeking to strategically position themselves to leverage AI’s potential, they confront a myriad of complicated questions: How can businesses integrate AI into their daily practices without undermining their workforce? What strategies ensure a competitive edge in a market that is rapidly mutating under the influence of intelligent systems?

Fostering a competitive edge in such a dynamic environment mandates more than mere adoption of AI; it calls for a radical restructuring of business strategies. Organizations need to envision a future where AI is not merely a tool but a fundamental part of the business ecosystem. This involves not just understanding and implementing AI technologies but also nurturing an organizational culture that can adapt to AI-led innovations. The societal complexity surrounding AI's ascendance is not solely limited to professional or creative spheres. It extends to the very ethics of AI deployment – how to ensure that AI systems are fair, transparent, and free of biases that can perpetuate societal ills.

Organizations need to envision a future where AI is not merely a tool but a fundamental part of the business ecosystem. This involves not just understanding and implementing AI technologies but also nurturing an organizational culture that can adapt to AI-led innovations. The societal complexity surrounding AI’s ascendance is not solely limited to professional or creative spheres. It extends to the very ethics of AI deployment – how to ensure that AI systems are fair, transparent, and free of biases that can perpetuate societal ills. As AI systems become increasingly autonomous in their decision-making capabilities, the responsibility to instil ethical considerations into their programming becomes paramount. In conclusion, as we stand at the doorway to a future rich with AI potential, we face a cascade of profound questions and decisions. The transformation brought about by AI in both the creative and professional realms is not merely about the evolution of technology but also a reflection of human adaptability. It is essential that as a society, we engage in inclusive dialogues, forward-thinking policy-making, and collaborative efforts to ensure that the rise of AI, while inevitable, is navigated with a focus on augmenting human potential and safeguarding the quintessential human essence that underpins our civilizations.","completion":"# 1.

БОРОТЬБА - це універсальний концепт, який має значення як в фізичному, так і в моральному, психологічному та соціокультурному контекстах. Цей концепт відображає важливі аспекти людського існування, включаючи волю, наполегливість, рішучість, справедливість і багато інших. Вивчення способів, якими цей концепт вербалізується та сприймається в літературі та перекладі, допомагає розкрити глибокі культурні, моральні та психологічні аспекти суспільства. Це дослідження допомагає розуміти, як цей концепт ідеалізується, трансформується та відображається в мові, що має значення для лінгвістики та культурознавства. Концепт БОРОТЬБА є одним з ключових концептів у мовному та культурному аналізі. У вивченні концепту БОРОТЬБА важливим є розуміння його різних аспектів, включаючи внутрішню та зовнішню боротьбу, конфлікти, цілі та цінності, ідеологічну суперечку та наполегливість у досягненні цілей. Дослідження концепту БОРОТЬБА широко представлено в літературній та лінгвістичній спільноті. Результати досліджень вказують на те, що концепт БОРОТЬБА репрезентований в різних культурних контекстах та може мати різні відтінки значень. Розглядаючи різні аспекти боротьби, дослідники вивчають як внутрішні, так і зовнішні конфлікти, їхні впливи на головних героїв, а також способи виразу цього концепту мовними засобами. Дослідники використовують різні методи та підходи для вивчення концепту БОРОТЬБА. Один із підходів - аналіз художніх текстів, таких як романи, поезії які дозволяють досліджувати, як боротьба розкривається в мові та діях героїв. Інші методи включають аналіз діалогів, символіку, образи та лексику, пов’язану з боротьбою. У статті «Концепт боротьби в ліриці Лесі Українки» автор Семененко проводить глибокий аналіз того, як репрезентація концепту БОРОТЬБА відображається у поезіях та ліриці видатної української поетеси Лесі Українки. Дослідження показує, що цей концепт має багато відтінків та аспектів у творчості поетеси, від боротьби за особисту волю до загальнолюдських ідеалів. У віршах Лесі Українки символи, такі як червоний колір (який може символізувати полум’я проти обмежень), вогонь (який виражає палкість та енергію боротьби), мечі (які представляють силу), квіти (які символізують надію та красу в боротьбі), іскри (які можуть відображати ідеї, що запалюють серця) — усі вони створюють атмосферу боротьби та віри в перемогу [Семененко, 2013]. У статті проведено детальний дефініційний аналіз концепту «боротьба». Визначено, що основні семи концепту включають «боротьба за щось, проти чогось», «енергія або схильність до боротьби», «бійка між людьми чи групами людей», «битва між арміями» та «суперечка». Наприклад, у художньому контексті концепт «боротьба» може виявлятися через зображення боротьби героїв за свої переконання [Семененко, 2013]. Дослідники звертають увагу на концепт боротьба і в англомовному дискурсі, а саме «Вербалізація концепту fight в англомовному художньому дискурсі та особливості його відтворення в українському перекладі». Автор Капуш розглядає вербалізацію концепту FIGHT у англомовних художніх текстах та перекладі цього концепту на українську мову. Ця стаття досліджує, якими мовними засобами можна передати ідеї боротьби та як цей концепт відтворюється в українських перекладах [Капуш, 2018]. Автор Капуш використовує методи аналізу перекладу та синонімічного аналізу для вивчення вербалізації концепту FIGHT у художніх текстах та його перекладі на українську. Автор статті досліджує лексеми FIGHT як дієслово, вказуючи на основні класи семем, такі як «воювати», «боротися за щось», «битися», «боротися проти чогось» та «сперечатися». У статті також проводиться синонімічний аналіз лексеми FIGHT, де розглядаються синоніми, такі як «struggle», «battle», «combat» та «conflict». Наприклад, у романі «Harry Potter» синонім «struggle» може використовуватися для передачі ідеї боротьби головного героя проти сил зла. Капуш аналізує, як концепт FIGHT виражається в англомовних художніх текстах. Наприклад, у романі «Hunger Games» вербалізація концепту FIGHT виявляється через зображення героїв, які вступають у боротьбу за власне виживання та свободу [Капуш, 2018]. Обидва дослідження демонструють, що концепт БОРОТЬБА є універсальним та актуальним у різних культурних та мовних середовищах. Він відображає глибокі аспекти людського досвіду та прагнення до перемоги над труднощами. Аналізуючи результати досліджень, можемо зрозуміти, як специфічність мови та культурного контексту впливає на сприйняття та інтерпретацію концепту БОРОТЬБА. Підкреслюється значущість вибору лексичних одиниць та символів для виразу цього концепту в різних мовних середовищах. Аналіз концепту БОРОТЬБА в романах «New Moon» Стефені Мейєр і «Beyond the blossoming fields» Юнічі Ватанабе, англомовний переклад роману японської літератури, відкриває різні аспекти та варіації цього концепту. В обох романах, боротьба стає ключовим мотивом і впливає на розвиток головних персонажів та сюжету. Обидва романи використовують символіку та образи, щоб підкреслити боротьбу героїв. Але на відміну від вище аналізованих робіт, де представленні різні види боротьби, в цих романах складником концепту БОРОТЬБА є особистісна. У романі «New Moon», символи, такі як місяць та сонце, відображають стан головної героїні. А «Beyond the blossoming fields» образ молодого дерева підкреслює рост Гінко як лікаря. Ці приклади свідчать про різноманітність та багатогранність концепту БОРОТЬБА у літературі та лінгвістиці. У романі «New Moon» дуже гарно описується внутрішня боротьба. Белла, головна героїня, змушена боротися не лише з вампірськими перешкодами, але й із власними прагненнями та емоціями. Вона представляє внутрішню боротьбу, де вибір між вампірським життям та людськими цінностями важливий. Її боротьба відображається в її рішеннях та внутрішніх конфліктах, а також у мові та лексиці, яку використовує автор для опису її стану душі [Riskitya, Teguh, 2019]. Гінко Огіно, головна героїня роману «Beyond the blossoming fields» є прикладом іншого варіанту боротьби. Її боротьба - це прагнення стати лікарем у часи, коли жінкам було важко досягти професійного визнання. Цей роман демонструє зовнішню боротьбу за досягнення мрії та надзвичайну мотивацію головної героїні. Внутрішні монологи та роздуми Гінко допомагають читачеві зрозуміти її внутрішні конфлікти та рішучість [Sri Wirda and Purwarno, 2019]. Аналіз концепту БОРОТЬБА вказує на те, що цей концепт універсальний і може мати різноманітні вияви у житті та літературі. Він відображає силу людської волі та визначеності, а також внутрішній боротьбу між різними цінностями та пріоритетами. Концепт БОРОТЬБА залишається актуальною і важливою у літературі та суспільстві. Вона відображає глибокі аспекти людської природи та надає нам можливість краще розуміти себе та інших. БОРОТЬБА також є важливим аспектом лінгвістики та культурології, і його вивчення допомагає розкрити глибинні аспекти людського існування. Проаналізовані дослідження свідчать про універсальність цього концепту та різноманітність його вербалізації в літературних текстах. Аналіз цього концепту допомагає нам краще розуміти не лише мову, але й сутність культур та суспільства.","completion":"Концепт \\"боротьба\\" важливий для розуміння культурних та особистісних аспектів життя людини в контекстах соціокультурних, психологічних та моральних норм.

Семененко вивчав концепт \\"боротьба\\" в ліриці Лесі Українки, акцентуючи на символіках червоного кольору, вогню, мечів, квітів та іскор, що репрезентують цей концепт [Семененко, 2013].

Капуш аналізує \\"fight\\" в англійській літературі та його українські переклади, досліджуючи лексему \\"FIGHT\\" та її синонімічний аналіз з \\"struggle\\", \\"battle\\", \\"combat\\", \\"conflict\\", а також вербалізацію концепту в англійських текстах, таких як \\"Harry Potter\\" і \\"Hunger Games\\" [Капуш, 2018]. Обидва дослідження підтверджують універсальність та різноманітність даного концепту в мові та культурі, виражаючи людську прагнення до перемоги над труднощами. Автори також акцентують на відмінностях вербалізації боротьби в різних культурних та мовних контекстах. У романах \\"New Moon\\" і \\"Beyond the blossoming fields\\" концепт \\"боротьба\\" є ключовим, де образи місяця, сонця і молодого дерева ілюструють особисті й зовнішні боротьби головних персонажів [Riskitya, Teguh, 2019; Sri Wirda and Purwarno, 2019]. Дослідження концепту \\"боротьба\\" дає можливість глибше зрозуміти сутність мови, культур та суспільства, показує його значення для лінгвістики та культурології, і демонструє універсальну природу людської боротьби за свої ідеали."},{"prompt":"Why did light pollution become less in much of the UK and France from 2014-2020","completion":"There are several reasons why light pollution may have become less in much of the UK and France from 2014 to 2020: 1. Adoption of LED lighting: Many cities and municipalities have been replacing traditional lighting fixtures with energy-efficient LED lights. LED lights can be directed more effectively, resulting in reduced light spillage and wastage. They also typically emit a 'cooler' light that is less likely to scatter in the atmosphere, further reducing light pollution. 2. Lighting regulations and policies: Governments and local authorities have implemented stricter lighting regulations and policies to control light pollution. These measures often include guidelines on shielding lights, using lower-intensity lights, and reducing unnecessary outdoor illumination. Increased awareness and enforcement of these regulations could have contributed to decreasing light pollution. 3. Public awareness and initiatives: There has been a growing awareness among the general public about the negative impact of light pollution on the environment, wildlife, and human health. This awareness has led to grassroots initiatives and campaigns encouraging individuals, businesses, and organizations to take steps to minimize light pollution. These efforts can have a cumulative effect in reducing light pollution levels over time. 4. Astronomical concerns: The reduction in light pollution is also driven by astronomical and scientific interests. There is a growing appreciation for the beauty and clarity of dark skies for stargazing and astronomical observations. This has led to increased efforts to preserve areas with minimal light pollution, such as dark sky reserves and parks. It's important to note that the reduction in light pollution may vary in different regions and is influenced by various factors. While some areas experience a decrease, others may still face challenges related to light pollution."},{"prompt":"Give me 15 name ideas for gigantic steampunk spider-leg robot fire armed with cannons.","completion":"1.

Var specific i din feedback – inkludera datum, tid och linjenummer på den buss som du hade problem med. 3. **Gå via Appen:** Om du använder en app för kollektivtrafik som har stöd för feedback, använd den funktionen. Ofta samlar apputvecklare in sådan feedback och vidarebefordrar den till relevant trafikbolag. 4. **Sociala Medier och Öppen Dialog:** Du kan även använda sociala medier för att kommunicera med trafikbolaget. Ibland kan detta leda till snabbare åtgärder eftersom företag tenderar att snabbt reagera på offentlig kritik eller förfrågningar. 5. **Kontakta din Lokala Politiker eller Kommun:** Ibland kan det vara effektivt att ta upp problemen med din kommun eller lokala politiker som kan ha ett inflytande över kollektivtrafikens kvalitet. 6. **Gå Samman med Andra Resenärer:** Om många människor har samma problem kan ni gå samman och framföra era klagomål tillsammans.

Unlike the t-test, which assumes that the data are normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney U test does not require the assumption of normality and is therefore used when this assumption cannot be met. The test is useful for comparing medians between two independent samples, especially when the sample sizes are small or when the data are ordinal or not normally distributed. Here's how the test works: 1. Rank all the values from both groups together, from the smallest to the largest. The smallest value gets rank 1, the next smallest gets rank 2, and so on. If there are ties (equal values), assign to each the average of the ranks they would have received had they not been tied. 2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for each of the two groups. These are often denoted as ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ). 3. Calculate the test statistic, U, for each group. The U value is essentially the number of times a score from one group precedes a score from the other group in the ranking. The formulae for each U are usually as follows: [ U_1 = n_1n_2 + frac{n_1(n_1+1)}{2} - R_1 ] [ U_2 = n_1n_2 + frac{n_2(n_2+1)}{2} - R_2 ] Here, ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) are the sample sizes for groups 1 and 2, respectively. 4. The smaller of the two U values (often denoted as U) is the one used to assess significance. 5. Look up the critical U value from the Mann-Whitney U distribution table (for small sample sizes, typically n < 20) or approximate significance using the normal distribution (for larger sample sizes, typically n ≥ 20). The large sample theory allows the following z-score approximation: [ z = frac{U - frac{n_1n_2}{2}}{sqrt{frac{n_1n_2(n_1+n_2+1)}{12}}} ] 6. If the U test statistic is less than or equal to the critical value from the table, or if the p-value associated with the z-score is less than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), reject the null hypothesis of the test. The null hypothesis typically states that there is no difference in the medians of the two groups. An important consideration when interpreting the results of a Mann-Whitney U test is that it assesses whether the distributions differ from each other, not just whether median values differ. Thus, a significant test outcome indicates that it is unlikely that the two samples come from identical populations with the same distribution."},{"prompt":"whole proof","completion":"The proof of the Mann-Whitney U test is quite extensive and requires knowledge of probability theory and mathematical statistics. I'll provide an outline of the underlying logic, which is based on ranks and the concept of a null hypothesis. Here we go: # Null Hypothesis (H0): The null hypothesis of the Mann-Whitney U test states that the distributions of both populations are equal. That is, there's no difference between the two populations in terms of the tendency to generate larger values. # Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference between the distributions of the two populations. # Ranks and U Statistic: In the Mann-Whitney U test, data from both groups are pooled and ranked together. The test statistic U is calculated based on these ranks. U represents the number of wins between the two groups when comparing all possible pairs of observations, with one member from each group. # Distribution of U under H0: When H0 is true (the two populations are the same), every ranking combination of the data is equally likely. Hence, the distribution of the U statistic under the null hypothesis can be known. For small samples, the exact distribution of U can be tabulated, but for large samples, the distribution becomes approximately normal, thanks to the Central Limit Theorem. # Expected Value and Variance of U under H0: Under H0, we can calculate the expected value of U and its variance. When there are no ties, the expected value of U is given by: [ E(U) = frac{n_1 n_2}{2} ] For the variance of U, the formula is: [ Var(U) = frac{n_1 n_2 (n_1 + n_2 + 1)}{12} ] # Test Statistic: As sample size increases, the standardized test statistic, which is (U - E(U)) normalized by the standard deviation of U (i.e., the square root of Var(U)), follows a standard normal distribution increasingly close. The standardized form is the z-score: [ z = frac{U - E(U)}{sqrt{Var(U)}} ] # Critical Values and P-Values: The test involves comparing the calculated U (or the corresponding z-score for large samples) to critical values of the U distribution (or the normal distribution) to determine statistical significance. # Conclusion: If the calculated statistic is more extreme than the critical value (or if the p-value is less than the chosen significance level), you reject H0, concluding that there is evidence of a difference in the distributions between the two groups. A formal proof would include the derivation of the expected value and variance of U under the null hypothesis, as well as the application of the Central Limit Theorem to justify the normal approximation for large samples. It's important to remember that the power of this proof comes from the fact that under the null hypothesis, all rank combinations are equally likely, and the test analyzes ranks, not raw data, avoiding the need for normal distribution of the data. This rank-based approach alleviates the requirements on the data distribution, which is why the Mann-Whitney U test is praised for its nonparametric nature."},{"prompt":"Mann whitney u test","completion":"The Mann-Whitney U test is a nonparametric statistical test widely used for comparing independent data samples. It's an alternative to the t-test when the data do not satisfy the assumptions necessary for t-tests, such as when the data are not normally distributed or when sample sizes are small. The Mann-Whitney U test is used to determine whether two independent samples were selected from populations having the same distribution. It is not limited to comparisons of the median but rather the overall distribution of the data. Here's how to conduct the test step by step: 1. **Combine and Rank the Data**: Combine all data from the two groups into a single set, then rank the data from smallest to largest, with the smallest data point getting a rank of 1, the next smallest a rank of 2, and so on up to the largest. In the case of tie scores, each tied value receives the average of the ranks they would have received if they were not tied. 2. **Sum the Ranks**: Calculate the sum of the ranks for each of the two groups, often denoted as ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ). 3. **Calculate U-statistic**: Use the rank sums to calculate the U-statistic for each group. The U-statistic is the number of times a data point from one group precedes a data point from the other group in the rank order. Calculate U for each group using the formulas: [ U_1 = n_1 cdot n_2 + frac{n_1 (n_1 + 1)}{2} - R_1 ] [ U_2 = n_1 cdot n_2 + frac{n_2 (n_2 + 1)}{2} - R_2 ] Here, ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) are the sample sizes for groups 1 and 2, respectively. 4. **Find the Smaller U**: The test statistic for the Mann-Whitney U test is the smaller of the two U-statistics, often denoted as U (when reporting the results, you would specify which group it corresponds to). 5. **Determine Significance Using a Critical Value or p-Value**: - For **small sample sizes**, you may use the critical values from Mann-Whitney U distribution tables to determine significance. - For **larger sample sizes**, you can approximate the significance of the U statistic by converting it to a standard normal Z-score using the formula: [ Z = frac{U - E(U)}{sqrt{sigma_U^2}} ] Where, [ E(U) = frac{n_1 n_2}{2} ] And the variance of U is given by, [ sigma_U^2 = frac{n_1 n_2 (n_1 + n_2 + 1)}{12} ] Check this Z against a normal distribution to find the p-value, which tells you the probability of seeing a value as extreme as or more extreme than the test statistic under the null hypothesis. 6. **Interpret the Results**: If your calculated U-statistic or corresponding Z-score is more extreme than the critical value from the Mann-Whitney U distribution, or if the p-value is less than the significance level (typically set at 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups' distributions. The Mann-Whitney U test does not specify the direction or magnitude of the difference, only that one exists. If the test is significant and you need information about the direction of the effect, you would look at the median or mean ranks of the two groups."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This tensor is particularly valuable in the formulation of electrodynamics because it makes the theory compatible with the theory of special relativity and allows for writting Maxwell's equations in a very compact form. Let's start by defining the electromagnetic field tensor in the context of flat spacetime, using the Minkowski metric (with signature (-+++)). In three-dimensional space we describe the electric field as a vector (mathbf{E}) and the magnetic field as a vector (mathbf{B}). To include these in a relativistically covariant framework, we combine them into an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor known as the electromagnetic field strength tensor or the Faraday tensor. We define this tensor (F^{munu}) as [ F^{munu} = begin{pmatrix} 0 & -E_x/c & -E_y/c & -E_z/c E_x/c & 0 & -B_z & B_y E_y/c & B_z & 0 & -B_x E_z/c & -B_y & B_x & 0 end{pmatrix} ] where c is the speed of light in vacuum. The tensor components are defined using SI units, and the electric field (E) has units of volts per meter (V/m), while the magnetic field (B) has units of teslas (T). In this tensor, the time-space components (i.e., the first row and column) encode the electric field, and the spatial components encode the magnetic field. In the language of differential forms or exterior calculus, this tensor is equivalent to a 2-form field on spacetime. Next, let's see how the electromagnetic field tensor relates to Maxwell's equations. In the absence of sources (charges and currents), Maxwell's equations in free space are: 1. (nabla cdot mathbf{E} = 0) (Gauss's law for electricity describing the absence of free charge) 2. (nabla cdot mathbf{B} = 0) (Gauss's law for magnetism stating there are no magnetic monopoles) 3. (nabla times mathbf{E} = -frac{partial mathbf{B}}{partial t}) (Faraday's law of induction) 4. (nabla times mathbf{B} = mu_0 epsilon_0 frac{partial mathbf{E}}{partial t}) (Ampère-Maxwell law without currents) When we move to tensor notation in four-dimensional spacetime, these equations are written compactly in terms of the field strength tensor and using four-vectors and differential operators. The inhomogeneous equations (1 & 4) can be written as: [ partial_mu F^{munu} = mu_0 J^nu ] where (J^nu) is the four-current density (including charge density and current density). For the homogeneous equations (2 & 3), which in differential form language are essentially the statement that the 2-form F is closed (dF = 0), one needs to introduce the dual tensor (G^{munu}), also known as the Faraday tensor's dual or the Maxwell tensor, which is defined by: [ G^{munu} = frac{1}{2} epsilon^{munurhosigma} F_{rhosigma} ] where (epsilon^{munurhosigma}) is the Levi-Civita symbol in four dimensions. Using this dual tensor, the homogeneous Maxwell equations can be written as: [ partial_mu G^{munu} = 0 ] In this way, the entire content of Maxwell's equations is embedded within the properties of the electromagnetic field strength tensor F and its dual G.

Vienas iš dažnai naudojamų algoritmų yra dvigubos linijos interpoliacija. Šis algoritmas vidutinės taškų reikšmes priskiria tarp dabartinio taško ir jo kaimyninių taškų. Tai padeda išlyginti kontūrus ir suteikia šiek tiek daugiau detalių padidintame vaizde arba vaizdo įraše. Kitas populiarius algoritmas yra dvigubos pikselių reikšmės kopijavimas. Šis algoritmas tiesiog kopijuoja pikselio reikšmę į padidinamą tašką. Taigi, jei turime pikselį su reikšme (R, G, B), kopija bus (R, G, B) ir taip toliau visam padidintam vaizdui arba vaizdo įrašui. Be to, yra ir įvairių gilesniųjų mokymosi algoritmų, kurie gali išmokti suderinti geresnės kokybės vaizdą pagal pradinį vaizdą. Šie algoritmai gali būti mokomi su dideliu kiekiu aukštos kokybės vaizdų, kad galėtų priderinti tinklą geresnei padidinimo rezultatams. Svarbu paminėti, kad video ir vaizdų padidinimas gali būti efektyvus tik iki tam tikro taško. Kai padidiname vaizdą per daug, prarandame detalių ir kokybę. Tai vadinama „įlindimu“. Tam tikri algoritmai stengiasi sumažinti šią problemą, naudodami papildomas metodikas, pavyzdžiui, akies judėjimo stebėjimą arba pasikartojančių modelių analizę. Sumažinant vaizdų ar vaizdo įrašų skiriamumą, laikoma, kad pagrindinė informacija yra prarasta ir negali būti padaryta taip, kad būtų gautas originalus skiriamumas. Tačiau vis daugiau pažangių algoritmų atsiranda šioje srityje, kurių tikslas yra sumažinti šią informacijos praradimo problemą ir padaryti padidintus vaizdus ar vaizdo įrašus kuo kokybiškesnius. Galų gale, video ir vaizdų padidinimas yra nuolat plėtojama sritys, kurias dirba daugybė inžinierių ir mokslininkų. Šie algoritmai nuolat tobulinami, kad būtų galima gauti kuo aukštesnės kokybės vaizdą ar vaizdo įrašą, atitinkantį mūsų poreikius ir lūkesčius."},{"prompt":"辨证唯物主义的基本观点对科技工作有什么指导意义？","completion":"辩证唯物主义的基本观点对科技工作有以下几个指导意义： 1. 实践第一：辩证唯物主义认为，实践是认识的基础，唯有通过实践探索、实践创新，才能得到真正可靠的科技成果。在科技工作中，应该注重实践，注重实验、观察和实地调研，不断积累经验，通过实践发现问题并解决问题。 2. 与时俱进：辩证唯物主义认为，事物是不断发展变化的。科技工作应该紧紧跟随时代的步伐，关注社会的需求变化，不断改进和创新技术，以适应社会发展的需求。 3. 全面分析：辩证唯物主义要求以全面的、系统的方法来分析问题。科技工作中，应该避免片面性和孤立性的分析，要考虑问题的多个方面，多个维度，从整体上来看待科技发展和应用。 4. 实事求是：辩证唯物主义强调实事求是，反对主观主义和教条主义。在科技工作中，应该坚持实事求是的态度，以客观、科学的方式来处理问题，不抄袭和追随潮流，而是根据实际情况制定计划和决策。 5. 科学方法：辩证唯物主义主张采用科学方法进行研究和实践，包括归纳与演绎、实证与理论、实验与观察等方法。在科技工作中，要注重运用科学方法，进行实证研究、实验验证和数据分析，以确保科技成果的可靠性和有效性。 总的来说，辩证唯物主义的基本观点为科技工作提供了坚实的思想基础和方法论指导，同时也要求科技工作者以实践为基础，不断与时俱进，全面分析问题，始终坚持实事求是和科学方法。这些指导意义对科技工作的创新和发展具有重要的指导意义。"},{"prompt":"辨证唯物主义自然观的基本观点对科技工作有什么指导意义？","completion":"辩证唯物主义自然观的基本观点对科技工作有以下几个指导意义： 1. 自然与人的关系：辩证唯物主义自然观认为，自然是人类生存和发展的基础，人类需要善待自然、与自然和谐相处。在科技工作中，应该充分认识到自然与人的关系，注重保护生态环境，倡导可持续发展，避免对自然资源的过度开发和破坏。 2. 统一物质与运动观：辩证唯物主义自然观认为，物质是永恒存在的，运动是物质的基本属性。在科技工作中，应该从物质运动的角度去理解和探索自然现象，注重对事物发展变化规律的研究，努力创造出具有物质基础的可靠科技成果。 3. 相互作用和条件性：辩证唯物主义自然观认为，自然界的事物相互作用、相互制约、相互依存。在科技工作中，应该考虑事物间的相互关系和相互影响，注重系统思维和综合分析，不仅关注狭隘的局部问题，而是要理解整体和全局，充分认识到科技发展具有系统性和复杂性。 4. 实践导向：辩证唯物主义自然观认为，科学研究和技术创新必须紧密结合实践，通过实践实证和验证理论，通过技术创新改变生产方式和社会发展。在科技工作中，应该注重实践导向，在实践中不断验证和改进科技理论，加强科技应用的实践探索，真正解决实际问题。 总的来说，辩证唯物主义自然观的基本观点为科技工作提供了保护自然、探索自然、尊重自然的指导原则，提醒科技工作者应该注重生态环境保护和可持续发展，在科技研究和创新中注重对事物发展规律的研究，重视相互作用和条件性的综合分析，坚持实践导向，以实现科技工作的可持续发展和社会效益。"},{"prompt":"扩写上文至1500字","completion":"辩证唯物主义自然观的基本观点对科技工作有着深远的指导意义。自然是人类生存和发展的基础，因此科技工作必须注重与自然的关系、保护生态环境和实现可持续发展。辩证唯物主义自然观强调统一物质和运动的观点，指导科技工作者从物质运动的角度去理解自然现象，研究事物的发展变化规律。此外，辩证唯物主义自然观还强调相互作用和条件性，要求科技工作者考虑事物间的相互关系和相互影响，进行系统思维和综合分析。最后，辩证唯物主义自然观明确了科技工作的实践导向，强调科学研究和技术创新必须与实践紧密结合，通过实践实证和验证理论，解决实际问题。 首先，辩证唯物主义自然观强调自然与人的关系。自然是人类赖以生存和发展的基础，我们必须善待自然、与自然和谐相处。在科技工作中，我们面临着众多的环境问题，如气候变化、生物多样性丧失、污染和资源匮乏等。辩证唯物主义自然观要求我们关注并保护生态环境，避免对自然资源的过度开发和破坏。科技工作者应该积极参与环境保护，研发绿色环保技术，推动可持续发展，实现人与自然的和谐共处。 其次，辩证唯物主义自然观强调统一物质与运动的观点。辩证唯物主义认为物质是永恒存在的，运动是物质的基本属性。在科技工作中，我们应该从物质运动的角度去理解和探索自然现象。科学研究的目的是揭示事物的本质和规律，而技术创新的目标是根据这些规律改变生产方式、提高社会效益。辩证唯物主义的物质运动观指导着科技工作者应该注重深入研究事物的本质和发展规律，努力创造出具有物质基础的可靠科技成果。 第三，辩证唯物主义自然观强调相互作用和条件性。辩证唯物主义认为自然界的各种事物相互作用、相互制约、相互依存。在科技工作中，我们不能孤立地看待问题，而是要考虑事物间的相互关系和相互影响，进行系统思维和综合分析。科技工作者应该重视整体和全局，不仅关注狭隘的局部问题，而是要理解整个系统、整体发展的要求。例如，我们在开发新技术的过程中，需要充分考虑与周围环境的相互影响，避免产生负面的环境影响。 最后，辩证唯物主义自然观明确了科技工作的实践导向。辩证唯物主义认为，科学研究和技术创新必须紧密结合实践，通过实践实证和验证理论，解决实际问题。在科技工作中，理论研究和实践创新相互促进，理论应该为实践服务，实践又是对理论的检验和修正。科技工作者应该注重实践导向，在实践中不断验证和改进科技理论，加强科技应用的实践探索，真正解决实际问题，推动科技成果的转化。 总结起来，辩证唯物主义自然观的基本观点为科技工作提供了坚实的思想基础和方法论指导。科技工作者要善待自然、保护生态环境，注重物质运动的研究，考虑事物间的相互作用和条件性，坚持实践导向，才能不断推动科技工作的发展和进步。辩证唯物主义自然观的指导意义在于提醒科技工作者应该紧密结合自然规律、关注整体和全局，同时注重实践验证，实现科技工作的可持续发展和社会效益。这些原则和观点对于探索自然、创新科技具有重要的借鉴和指导作用。"},{"prompt":"给以前购买的客户发信息，邮件如何写","completion":"尊敬的[客户名]， 我希望您一切都好。我是您以前购买过产品/服务的销售代表，给您写信是为了感谢您一直以来对我们公司的支持和信任。我们非常珍视您作为我们的客户，并且希望能够继续为您提供优质的产品和服务。 首先，我想向您致以最诚挚的感谢。感谢您的信任和支持，因为有了您的信任，我们才能不断地改进和创新，确保我们的产品和服务始终能够满足您的需求和期望。 在过去的合作中，您对我们的产品/服务给予了高度评价，这对我们而言是一份宝贵的认可和鼓励。我们会一直努力提供更好的产品/服务，让您继续得到满意的体验。 我们也很愿意听取您的意见和建议，以帮助我们改进和提升我们的产品/服务品质。如果您有任何问题、反馈或要求，请随时与我们联系。我们会尽力解决您的问题并满足您的需求。 再次，感谢您对我们公司的一贯支持。我们衷心希望我们的合作能够继续下去，并愿意为您提供任何帮助和支持。如果您有任何需要购买我们产品/服务的计划，或是想要了解更多关于我们公司的信息，请随时与我们联系。 祝您生活愉快，事业蒸蒸日上！ 最诚挚的问候， [您的名字] [您的职位] [您的公司名] [您的联系方式]"},{"prompt":"简洁","completion":"尊敬的[客户名]， 感谢您一直以来对我们公司的支持和信任。作为您过去的销售代表，我想向您表达我最诚挚的感谢。您对我们的产品/服务的肯定和支持是我们不断努力的动力。 我们珍视您作为我们的客户，并会一直努力提供优质的产品/服务，以满足您的需求和期望。如果您有任何问题、反馈或需要购买我们的产品/服务，请随时联系我们。我们将竭诚为您服务。 再次感谢您的信任和支持。愿与您继续合作，在未来取得更多共同的成就。 最诚挚的问候， [您的名字] [您的职位] [您的公司名] [您的联系方式]"},{"prompt":"英文","completion":"Dear [Customer's Name], I hope this email finds you well.

Общепринятое определение терроризма подразумевает использование незаконного насилия или угроз для достижения политических, идеологических или религиозных целей, часто направленное против гражданского населения и с целью внушения страха. В случае Моссада, израильской разведывательной службы, ее операции, включая тайные убийства вражеских боевиков, шпионов или ядерных ученых, обычно классифицируются как упразднение или \\"целенаправленные убийства\\". Израиль зачастую оправдывает такие действия необходимостью обеспечения национальной безопасности и самообороны от угроз со стороны террористов или агентов стран, которые посягают на безопасность Израиля. Точка зрения других стран и организаций по данному вопросу варьируется: некоторые считают такие действия законным актом самообороны в рамках международного права, в то время как другие осуждают их как незаконные экстерриториальные экзекуции или даже терроризм. Многое зависит от контекста каждой операции, законности действий в соответствии с международным правом, включая гуманитарное право и правила вооруженных конфликтов, а также от того, являются ли цели таких операций гражданскими лицами или комбатантами.

На выборах президента США в 2016 году Хиллари Клинтон действительно получила большинство голосов избирателей на национальном уровне. Однако, по системе выборческого коллегия, победителем становится кандидат, набравший большинство голосов выборщиков в каждом отдельном штате. В итоге, Дональд Трамп набрал большинство важных выборщиков и одержал победу в выборах, несмотря на то, что у Клинтон было более высокое национальное голосование."},{"prompt":"А почему среди выборщиков большинство было у Трампа, не смотря на то, что голосов было больше у Клинтон?","completion":"Это связано с особенностями системы выборческого коллегия в США. В каждом штате есть определенное количество выборщиков, которые голосуют от имени своего штата в президентских выборах. Количество выборщиков в каждом штате зависит от его населения. В некоторых штатах, где население сконцентрировано и где Клинтон набрала большее количество голосов, было меньше выборщиков, чем в штатах, где Трамп победил. Например, в Калифорнии - густонаселенном штате с большим количеством голосов за Клинтон - было 55 выборщиков, в то время как в штатах, таких как Огайо или Флорида, где Трамп победил, было больше ключевых выборщиков. Это означает, что Трамп смог набрать большинство голосов выборщиков, выиграв в определенных штатах, хотя у Клинтон было больше общих голосов избирателей на национальном уровне. Система выборческого коллегия в США может иногда приводить к таким \\"разъединенным\\" результатам."},{"prompt":"Правда ли то, что на выборах в 2020 были явные фальсификации? Вбросы, рисование результатов, недопуск наблюдателей?","completion":"Нет надежных доказательств того, что на выборах в 2020 году в США произошли явные фальсификации результатов. Множество аргументов о фальсификации были представлены различными людьми и группами, но множество судебных исков были отклонены или не прошли ревизию. Государственные организации, такие как Комиссия по выбору президента, а также местные организации и наблюдатели, заявили о том, что выборы проходили достаточно честно и без системных нарушений.

Explain how the monopoly of Mylan was exacerbated by the FDA and how their margins were huge. LITERATURE REVIEW Mylan is run by Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch. The company was founded in 1961 with a mission statement reading “helping people in small West Virginia towns and rural communities gain access to affordable medicine” (Peters). Four decades later, in 2007, Mylan 2 Academic Festival, Event 17 [2021] https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2021/all/17 had grown into a global firm going by a new mission statement reading “At Mylan, we are committed to setting new standards in healthcare. Working together around the world to provide 7 billion people access to high quality medicine” (Peters). The company also emphasizes innovation, reliability, leadership, and specifically “do what’s right, not what’s easy”. Following the purchase of EpiPen from Merck, the Mylan website read “At Mylan, we put people first, trusting that profits will follow” (Peters). All these messages are contradictory to the actions of price gouging performed by the company. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has played its own role in the crisis. As of 2016 the only company in the United States selling EpiPens was Mylan, holding monopolistic power over the market. The FDA has rejected many companies who have tried to join the market. In comparison to the United States single producer of EpiPen, Europe has eight. Competition is extremely important, and if new companies do not compete with Mylan in the United States, then price gouging will continue to be a legitimate concern (Ho). One potential competitor was approved but the product was later recalled. Two other companies saw their bids to sell the product rejected by the FDA. The FDA is responsible for the safety of the public when it comes to drug administration, however, it should not be a challenge to develop delivery devices that the FDA can approve of. Forbes recommended if the government intended to increase competition in the market, waiving or increasing the speed of aspects of the FDA approval process would lower costs of entry and encourage companies to pursue the new markets (Dorfman). In “GOP E&C Members Ask if FDA Criteria to Blame in Part for EpiPen Mess”, according to lawmakers, laws and regulations “must promote a competitive prescription drug market” and “ultimately lower the cost of prescription drugs for America’s Patients” (Lim). Lawmakers asked questions of the FDA such as ‘how many applications for generic EpiPen’s have been submitted and how many 3 Fusari: Ethics Versus Economics: The EpiPen Scandal and the Role of the F Published by DigitalCommons@SHU, 2021 have failed’. They asked about pending applications and whether these applications are being prioritized. They even inquired about the approval criteria for such products (Lim). The increase in prices due to Mylan’s monopolistic position on the EpiPen market stirred much political debate. Politicians such as Chuck Grassley, a republican of Iowa, and Amy Klobuchar, a democrat of Minnesota, both pushed bills to prevent what is known as a ‘pay-fordelay’ (*Lim). This tactic was used to delay the appearance of Teva’s generic EpiPen in 2011. Mylan filed a citizen’s petition to challenge Teva’s entry to the market just weeks prior to the deadline for the FDA’s approval on the product (Lim). Klobuchar believes “this outrageous increase in the price of EpiPens is occurring at the same time that Mylan Pharmaceuticals is exploiting a monopoly market advantage that has fallen into its lap… Patients all over the U.S. rely on these products” (*Lim). An unnamed congressional staffer spoke with Inside Health Policy on a matter concerning Impax Laboratories Adrenaclick, a product explained as nonequivalent to EpiPen not being covered by insurance companies. The staffer says “Companies are finding ways of taking advantage of entry level barriers that aren’t supposed to be there for competitive windfall… It seems like market failure, maybe it’s the FDA, maybe not” (*Lim). Mylan’s Price Hike of EpiPens: Holding the Pharmaceutical Giant Accountable analyzes the need for the trade commission to investigate antitrust law violations in relation to anticompetitive and exclusionary contracts. The article also offers recommendations of how congress can approach the issue (Hadland). Mylan does not own a patent on the drug epinephrine but rather on the auto-injector of the EpiPen. The efficiency and convenience of the auto-injector also makes the Epi-Pen so valuable compared to tradition administration. Author Hannah Hadland broadly suggests the FDA should “allow more competing auto-injectors on the market” (Hadland). References for this include the FDA’s recall on Auvi-Q auto-injector, sighting 4 Academic Festival, Event 17 [2021] https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2021/all/17 deficiencies in the delivery methods of the drug. According to the article, the number of times Auvi-Q auto-injector failed was about equal in ratio to the number of EpiPen failures, also mentioning many of the failures could be due to operator error. Hannah concludes that the FDA should allow more auto-injectors into the market as there is “no real fundamental differences” and then way things stand the FDA is only encouraging Mylan’s price gouging (Hadland). Lowering the standards for FDA acceptance on auto-injectors is a potential option. However, it may be even more beneficial to remove the prescription only requirement on the product, says Hannah. Several politicians presented more alternative options to creating competition for Mylan Pharmaceuticals on the market. One group of bipartisan senators sought to explore if it would be justified to include a drug on the FDA’s drug shortage list due to price hikes. In turn, resulting in the FDA accelerating the approval process for more similar products on the market. In 2016, Hillary Clinton pledged to hold pharmaceutical companies responsible through funding research programs and requiring companies to justify their price tags. She called on Mylan to immediately reduce prices, as there was no justification for the current costs (Durkin). In 2018, Teva pharmaceutical was finally granted approval from the FDA on its generic EpiPen product in limited quantities. These generic pens now can be purchased anywhere from 300 to 400 dollars in comparison to the name brand 600 dollars. The generic price tag remains 600% higher than the 50 price in 2007 (Kokosky). While not illegal for a company to get rich, price gouging tactics are unethical, and the government has the responsibility to make live saving medications readily accessible to those in need. Investors should consider the ethics of companies they invest in, rather than continue to enable malpractice. CEO of Mylan, Heather Bresch, continued to insist the company had increased availability of the product. She also claimed the company made important contributions to society through its awareness ad campaigns. In 2019 she stepped down from her position of CEO. However, the issues of the scandal and rise in profitability numbers continue and the issue speaks for itself. Adding competition to the market for EpiPens will eventually eliminate the ability to raise prices unethically, however, the FDA has made this extremely difficult prior to Teva’s acceptance. The 8 Academic Festival, Event 17 [2021] https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2021/all/17 FDA easing necessary acceptance requirements, investing in other pharmaceutical companies to ease the difficulty of entry, banning contracts such as pay-to-delay agreements, or simply declaring the drug as non-prescription all would benefit the consumers in this monopolistic market. Use the extract to show how Mylan was actually found guilty for lying about their margins, On September 21, 2016, Heather Bresch was sworn in to testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. In her prepared testimony, Bresch said, “Looking back, I wish we had better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration of the rising financial issues for a growing minority of patients who may have ended up paying the full [list] price or more. We never intended this” (Lopez & Ramsey, 2016, para. 4). During further questioning, Bresch used poster boards to show that Mylan makes a profit of 275 on each 2-pack of EpiPens with a profit margin of about 50 per pen. 9 The low profit margin, she explained, was due to the number of middlemen involved between the list price and the profit that Mylan gets at the end of the transaction. The committee members found the figures hard to believe. “If I could sum up this hearing, it would be that the numbers don’t add up,” Rep. Elijah Cummings said toward the end of the hearing (Ramsey, 2016, para 4). Further attention was drawn to the fact that family had influenced the EpiPen markets. Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who had earlier written to the US Attorney General to question the EpiPen schools program, alleged during her questioning that Bresch intentionally created a monopoly by using her mother’s influence to ensure that schools across the country are required to buy EpiPens. Bresch repeatedly denied the allegations, saying suggestions that her mother was involved in lobbying efforts are inappropriate (Radnofsky, 2016a). Bresch was also questioned about her compensation which had increased from 2.4 million in 2007 to 18.9 million in 2015. Florida Republican John Mica asked her about her compensation. “About 18 million,” she said, quietly. “Sounds like you’re doing pretty well out of this,” he replies. Is that high or low for industry peers, he wondered. “It’s in the middle,” she says, also quietly (Radnofsky, 2016b, para. 2). Source: The Wall Street Journal Bresch was questioned further on the price hikes by the committee. She responded by saying the company made profits far less than what the list price of 605 might suggest. “We believe it was a fair price, and we now just lowered it by half,” she said (Rockoff, Radnofsky & Hernandez, 2016, para. 3). “I am a very conservative and pro-business Republican, 10 but I am sickened by what I’ve heard,” Rep. John Duncan (R-TN) said (para.5). Rep. Gerald Connolly (D-VA) said if he relied solely on Ms. Bresch’s testimony, he would think “what humanitarians” those at Mylan are. “You virtually have a monopoly, and used it to your advantage; but unfortunately, it is at the expense of people who need it” (para 6). On September 26, 2016, the Wall Street Journal published a report revealing that the figures Mylan presented to Congress as profits on the EpiPen included taxes applied at the statutory corporate tax rate of 37.5%, which was five times more than Mylan’s actual overall tax rate of 7.4% for 2015. This means that Mylan’s profits on each 2-pack of the EpiPen was 166, a figure that is 60% higher than the 100 and 50 per pen figure it earlier gave to Congress (Maremont, 2016b). On October 7, 2016, Mylan agreed to pay 465 million to the U.S. Department of Justice to settle the allegations made by senators and federal health officials that it overcharged Medicaid, the government assistance program for low-income families, by wrongly classifying the EpiPen as a generic product instead of brand name to avoid additional taxes (Walker, 2016). In its form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mylan stated that the settlement did “not provide for any wrongdoing on the part of Mylan Inc. or any of its affiliated entities or personnel.” It also announced that it expects adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share (EPS) of between 4.70 - 4.90 as compared to the previous full year guidance of 4.85 - 5.15 per share (US Securities and Exchange Commission, 2016) Economic Standpoint and Profit Adequacy Amid Monopolistic Leverage From an economic standpoint, the scrutiny of Mylan’s monopoly over the EpiPen market must consider profitability and the market mechanisms that influenced its pricing strategies. Mylan’s substantial growth over the decades, paired with its 2007 EpiPen acquisition, marked the transition from a mission centered around affordable access to a more global and ambiguous commitment to setting new standards in healthcare. While the loftiness of its vision implies beneficence, the price escalation of the EpiPen raises the question of whether profit maximization overshadowed the company’s purported ethical compass. Mylan’s monopolistic hold on the EpiPen market in the United States, facilitated to an extent by the regulatory environment of the FDA, became a source of immense profitability. The rejection of competitor products and the complexities of bringing a rival auto-injector to market cultivated an environment where Mylan’s pricing decisions faced little opposition. The case studies suggest that Mylan’s margins on the EpiPen were indeed substantial, contributing significantly to the company’s bottom line. Europe’s multiple producers of epinephrine auto-injectors stand in stark contrast to the American landscape, where Mylan enjoyed uncontested economic leverage—a gap that the FDA’s stringent approval process helped to preserve. The interplay between Mylan’s monopoly and FDA regulatory action is critical. The hurdles faced by potential competitors, such as recall of competing products and rejections of entry bids by the FDA, highlight structural impediments to market competition. While the safety of the public is non-negotiable, the equivalence or adequacy of competing auto-injectors appeared to become secondary to the more pressing issue of accessibility and affordability, exacerbated by Mylan’s aggressive pricing. Mylan’s use of tactics like ‘pay-for-delay’ and the questioning of its EpiPen school program’s ethics further underline the discrepancy between public service and self-interest. Political interventions to address the prospect of price gouging indicated an understanding that regulatory measures could serve as effective deterrents to economic exploitation. Proposals ranged from expedited FDA approvals for generic products to fundamental changes such as eliminating the prescription-only requirement for EpiPens—each with implications for competition and pricing. Upon investigation, Mylan’s professed profit margins from the sales of EpiPens, as presented to the House Oversight and Reform Committee by CEO Heather Bresch, came under skepticism. Not only did law enforcement officials challenge the veracity of these figures, but subsequent disclosures revealed that Mylan had significantly understated its profit margins by including taxes at the statutory corporate tax rate, rather than the substantially lower rate they actually incurred. Further, the 465 million settlement for wrongly classifying EpiPen as a generic to dodge higher rebates to Medicaid exemplified a corporate maneuvering to retain high profitability at the expense of ethical practice and societal expectations. Thus, in the context of Mylan’s history, mission, and vision, the surge in EpiPen’s price and the observed monopolistic dominance—which crowded out competition and led to public outcry—reflect a breach of both economic equity and the company’s purported ethical framework. The economic adequacy of Mylan’s pricing strategy, which raised profitability while arguably neglecting the affordability for those in dire need of EpiPens, stands at odds with the initial mission statement to “help people…gain access to affordable medicine.” The literature therefore suggests that from both an economic and ethical standpoint, Mylan’s pricing of the life-saving EpiPen was neither adequate nor justifiable, inciting valid controversy and regulatory action. Write it again but include numbers such as dates and prices or percentages and remember to connect it with the prompt: To what extent has the exorbitant price of Epi-pens been ethically and economically adequate? To what extent has the exorbitant price of EpiPens been ethically and economically adequate? From an ethical and economic standpoint, the reasons behind Mylan’s significant increase in the price of EpiPens—which surged from around 50 per pen in 2007 to a list price of approximately 600 for a two-pack in 2016—invite critical examination. Economically, while higher prices can correlate with increased company profits, suspect in Mylan’s case is whether the monopolistic pricing was necessary or justifiable given the actual production and distribution costs. Additionally, the ethical implications of a life-saving medication becoming less accessible to those in need puts the adequacy of such a pricing model into question. Mylan’s monopolistic standing was supported in part by the FDA’s regulatory environment, which indirectly contributed to Mylan’s control over the EpiPen market. Between rejecting potential competitors and adhering to stringent approval processes, the FDA played a role in fortifying Mylan’s market position. The lack of competition in the US, contrasted with Europe’s eight EpiPen producers, illustrated the disparity between an open market and a monopolized one. Yet, the level of profitability remains the central concern; Mylan’s CEO Heather Bresch presented to Congress a profit figure for a two-pack of EpiPens around 100, a number later contested and revealed to underrepresent true profits by as much as 60% when tax rates were appropriately calibrated. Further complicating matters, Mylan engaged in strategies like ‘pay-for-delay’ to prevent the appearance of generic competitors such as Teva’s version of the EpiPen, which was delayed until 2018. From a market perspective, Mylan’s settlement in October 2016 for 465 million regarding Medicaid misclassification highlights both the economic and ethical impropriety at the core of Mylan’s pricing strategy. By classifying the EpiPen as generic rather than as a brand-name product, Mylan avoided paying higher rebates, a maneuver that contributed to its ability to maintain artificially high margins at the expense of a government program designed to aid low-income families. Economic profiteering at this level suggests a clear departure from Mylan’s original mission of ensuring affordable access to medicine. Increased scrutiny revealed that Mylan’s profit on each EpiPen was significantly understated in their testimonies before Congress. When taking into account Mylan’s actual overall tax rate of 7.4% in 2015 instead of the 37.5% statutory corporate tax rate presented, the profit per two-pack of EpiPens was closer to 166, not the 100 initially claimed. This revelation indicated a 60% disparity in reported profits, raising substantial questions about the economic rationale behind the company’s pricing model. In light of these factors, one must consider whether the increased price of EpiPens has been ethically or economically adequate. Ethically, the pricing actions of Mylan conflicted with the company’s own stated mission to prioritize people over profits. Economically, while Mylan indeed profited from its monopolistic stance, the adequacy of such profits comes into question when one considers the impact on affordability and access to essential medication. Political efforts to address this issue have varied, ranging from proposed legislation aiming to enhance market competition to public calls by figures such as Hillary Clinton for accountability and fair pricing in 2016. Yet, even with the eventual introduction of a generic EpiPen by Teva, the price remained 600% above the 2007 figure, casting further doubt on the justification of Mylan’s pricing strategy from both an economic and moral perspective. The extent of the ethical and economic breach is perhaps best encapsulated by the public and regulatory backlash that Mylan faced. The continue d insistence on justifying high list prices, even after the introduction of a less expensive generic, underscores a tension between the pursuit of profit and the provision of affordable, life-saving medication. Indeed, while Mylan’s practices were not found illegal, the economic benefit extracted from their monopolistic pricing has been widely regarded as unethical, prompting legal and legislative scrutiny. In sum, given the disclosures about tax rates and profit margins, along with the broader context of Mylan’s conduct and its impact on access to EpiPens, the price hikes cannot be deemed ethically or economically adequate. The high prices ultimately undermined the spirit of the company’s initial mission statement and placed significant financial strain on individuals and the healthcare system. The economic adequacy of Mylan’s pricing, from a market competition and fairness perspective, was further questioned by the company’s apparent misrepresentation of profit margins and the regulatory settlements that followed. Subsequent legislative and regulatory actions pointed to a market failure that was corrected only through external intervention, suggesting that left to its own devices, Mylan’s pricing would have remained unacceptably high both economically and ethically. Now for the next topic explore how the Image of Mylan was hurt by the scandal and use the topic 5.7 of business studies to explore this issue, remember to link back to the prompt. :Crisis Management refers to the steps taken by an organization to limit the effects of a damaging event by handling, containing and resolving the causes and effects. While some crises can be foreseen, others cannot, and so the way a company handles the situation while navigating through one defines its level of success and the level of damage taken at the end of the period. Crises vary in size and strength, ranging from a simple problem to a terrible situation that could possibly lead to a company’s death.

CONTINGENCYSimilarly to crisis management, contingency planning is all about dealing with situations that can affect the performance of a firm. The main difference, however, is that contingency planning deals with forecasting possible scenarios and preparing for them ahead of time. Although a lot of crises happen unexpectedly, a lot of other scenarios can be forecasted due to the analysis of trends and extrapolation of pathways. The less you’re caught off-guard during a crisis, the more control you’ll have over the situation and you’ll also have a higher chance at solving the problem quickly and effectively. CONTINGENCYIn order to make contingency plans, the following characteristics need to be taken into consideration: COST TIME RISKS SAFETY 1 2 3 4 Good contingency plans are costly, but they are cheaper on the long run than dealing with crises. They are also very time-consuming, but a well-developed and trained plan makes dealing with crises much smoother. Risks of all different levels and likelihoods need to be assessed and taken into consideration to make the plan. Safety of all stakeholders is the top priority of a good contingency plan. This is the 5.7 idea which you will use to analyze Mylans media response. Mylan and CEO Heather Bresch took a minimalistic approach to communicating about the EpiPen price increase. There is no mention of the Congressional hearing on either Mylan or Bresch’s Twitter or Facebook accounts, nor an explanation for the price increase. On August 25, 2016, Mylan tweeted about Bresch’s interview with CNBC Squawk Box and put out press releases on PRNewswire announcing the “Immediate Action” it plans to take on expanding on already existing assistance programs to make EpiPens more available to those who do not have the money to afford the medicine (Mylan, 2016f). A few days later, on August 29, 2016 Mylan put out a press release on PRNewswire announcing that its 300 generic EpiPen, would be offered at more than a 50% discount, and be on the market soon (Mylan, 2016g). On October 7, 2016 Mylan put out a third press release on PRNewswire saying the company had agreed to pay the 465 million settlement on the Medicaid rebate classification for the EpiPen (Mylan, 2016h). 3.2 | Public Response Revelations from the Congressional hearing was met with outrage by the public. On Twitter, some questioned Mylan’s justification for the price increases and wondered why a device that delivers only 1 worth of drugs to patients could cost over 600. Some pointed to the potential impact of the lifesaving drug on patients who could not afford it, while others wondered why the EpiPen which costs 290 in Canada could cost 620 in the United States. In a tweet, Senator 11 Bernie Sanders alleged that Mylan engaged in corporate inversion to reduce the taxes it pays in the US. Its decision to offer a generic version was also seen as a preemptive strike against Teva Pharmaceuticals, a company set to launch its generic version of epinephrine in 2017 (Bomey, 2016). Source: Twitter.com, 2016 The situation also gave rise to public petitions. Some angry consumers took to Facebook and created a page titled, “Fire the Wicked Witch of Mylan Pharmaceutical Heather Bresch Today.” The page shares multiple articles dating back to the beginning of the crisis on August 25, 2016. On August 27, 2016, the user of the page shared a petition asking followers to request that President Obama get the “FDA to strip Mylan’s monopoly over EpiPen”. So far, the petition has been signed by more than 50,000 people. The goal is to obtain more than 100,000 signatures. Business and Social Impact Given the outcomes outlined above such as falling stock prices, the filing of class action lawsuits and the development of DIY-EpiPens, it is evident that the crisis is already making an impact on Mylan’s bottom-line and on society. In terms of direct financial costs, Mylan has lost 465 million which it agreed to pay in a settlement with the Department of Justice for overcharging Medicaid due to its misclassification of brand name EpiPens. On November 9, 2016, Mylan posted a third quarter loss of 119.8 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with a profit of 428.6 million, or 83 cents a share during the same period in 2015. Shareholders took a hit as adjusted earnings fell to 1.38 a share. Sales were down 4% as wholesalers cut back purchases in anticipation of the introduction of a 300 generic EpiPen (Steele & Rockoff, 2016). This outcome translates not only into huge losses in stock value and reduction in operating capital, it also resulted in lower earnings for shareholders. From a social perspective, the crisis also created a risk for the millions of patients who might turn to makeshift cures, hacks and dangerous DIY-EpiPens because of rising prices. Source: Twitter.com, 2016 4.3 | Corporate Governance and Reputational Impact The handling of the Congressional hearing by Mylan CEO, Bresch and her team raises questions about the consistency between Mylan’s professed corporate governance policies and its actual corporate actions and decisions. The company presented conflicting figures about its profits to the committee, raising doubts about its integrity, transparency, and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles. Congress also raised questions about fair pricing, conflicts of interest with family about its lobbying activities, anticompetitive practices and the connection between high prices, and the rising compensation of its top executives. These are allegations which the CEO struggled to defend even though policies to prevent such situations are enshrined in the company’s corporate governance handbook. The results of a sentiment analysis conducted with Crimson Hexagon, a social media monitoring and analytics tool, showed that the Mylan EpiPen price increase received on average about 4% basic positive, 69% neutral, and 26% basic negative sentiment on social media during the height of the crisis. Additionally, the results from the emotion analysis 14 conducted, surprisingly show that 82% of emotions recorded are neutral. However, out of the 18% remaining, about 75% are negative emotions ranging from sadness, disgust and anger to fear and surprise (forsight.crimsonhexagon.com, 2016). Sentiment + Emotion Analysis Source: Crimson Hexagon, 2016 Given the reaction from Congress and the public, the EpiPen crisis is certainly not without an effect on Mylan’s corporate reputation. Because the company had to go before Congress to defend allegations leveled against it, questions were raised about trust, transparency, accountability and credibility. In comparison to its peers in the pharmaceutical industry, Mylan was not included in the 2016 Harris Interactive’s Reputation Quotient (RQ) Poll or by the Reputation Institute’s 2016 Global RepTrak 100 for top companies for the best reputation in the world. It was, however, ranked 21st in the SyncForce Top 50 for global pharma companies, a ranking based on sales in 2015. The EpiPen pricing crisis may have moved the needle in the perception of Americans about corporate governance in the healthcare industry and strengthened the idea that action needs to be taken to assert more control over the sector through legislation and regulation. In a HealthDay/Harris poll conducted online among 2,100 Americans aged 18 and over between October 12-15, 2016, most respondents said they favored price caps and were in support of Medicare’s right to negotiate the cost of drugs. Eighty one percent support control caps on drugs and medical devices compared to 73% in 2015, while 74% expressed support for Medicare to negotiate prices for all insurers, a jump from 66% in 2015. Many also agree with some common criticisms of the pharma industry. Ninety percent agree that \\"raising the prices of life-saving medications is taking advantage of consumers” and that \\"pharmaceutical companies make too much money off 15 of life-saving medications.” Eighty-eight percent also agree that “pharmaceutical industries have too much freedom to set prices for life-saving medications” (Thompson, 2016, para. 12). “The very large majorities of people who support tough government measures to rein in drug prices – including government price controls and drug importation – have become even larger,” said Humphrey Taylor, chairman emeritus of The Harris Poll” (Thompson, 2016, para. 4). The EpiPen pricing scandal severely impacted Mylan’s corporate image and tested its crisis management skills. According to the 5.7 topic of business studies, crisis management is the process by which an organization addresses a disruptive and unexpected event to limit damage. Effective crisis management encompasses transparency, communication, speed, control, and having contingency plans. Crisis Management: Mylan’s response to the EpiPen crisis demonstrated flaws in several key crisis management areas. Transparency was lacking, as observed in the company’s Congressional hearing, where Mylan presented conflicting profit figures and faced allegations of anticompetitive actions and conflicts of interest. This raised serious concerns about the company’s integrity and transparency, crucial aspects of crisis management, which dictate honesty and openness about a crisis and its implications. Communication with stakeholders is vital during crises, and Mylan’s approach was minimalistic, failing to adequately explain the price increase through social media channels. Their response was reactive rather than proactive, focusing on damage control measures like announcing a generic EpiPen version and financial assistance programs after considerable public backlash. The speed of their response could have been swifter and more comprehensive. A faster, more decisive response might have helped Mylan exert more control over the situation and mitigate the damage to its reputation. Contingency Planning: Contingency planning was clearly insufficient. Mylan seemed unprepared for the magnitude of the public and political reaction. Adequate contingency plans should account for cost, time, risks, and safety, with the aim of preventing crises or managing them effectively. Mylan’s public relations strategy did not reflect a robust contingency plan to address such foreseeable adverse reactions. Public and Corporate Governance Repercussions: The public response was overwhelmingly negative. Mylan’s strategy led to outrage on social media, a call for the CEO’s dismissal, and petitions for regulatory intervention. This negatively affected Mylan’s stock prices and sales, reflecting how a crisis can impact a company’s bottom line. The reputational damage became evident as Mylan was scrutinized for its corporate governance. Despite having policies to prevent such scenarios, the company struggled to align its practices with those policies, leading to a public question of Mylan’s credibility and accountability. Impact on Mylan’s Image: Mylan’s handling of the EpiPen crisis damaged its corporate image, leading to erosion of trust among stakeholders. They were not listed on the 2016 Harris Interactive’s Reputation Quotient (RQ) Poll or by the Reputation Institute’s 2016 Global RepTrak 100, reflecting a potential decline in their industry standing. Social media sentiment analyses further revealed negative public sentiment during the crisis. The broader impact on Mylan’s corporate reputation and the healthcare industry at large was palpable. The crisis fueled public perception that the pharmaceutical industry requires greater regulation and oversight, with many Americans supporting government-imposed price controls and negotiation rights for Medicare. In Conclusion: Mylan’s crisis management during the EpiPen scandal highlighted the company’s shortcomings in transparency, communication strategy, speediness of response, and contingency planning. Despite Mylan’s efforts to mitigate the situation, the crisis led to significant damage to the company’s reputation and finances. Public opinion shifted towards stronger regulatory measures, resulting in a clear and lasting impact on Mylan’s image and the perception of the pharmaceutical industry. This case underlines the importance of having a well-prepared crisis management and contingency plan that can swiftly and effectively address public concerns and regulatory compliance. answer it again but in paragraph format, with topic sentences and then sentences The EpiPen pricing scandal severely tested Mylan’s crisis management skills, highlighting areas of deficiency in the company’s approach, and ultimately causing significant damage to its corporate image. Effective crisis management requires key elements such as transparency, communication, speed, and control, all of which Mylan failed to appropriately leverage during the scandal. Mylan’s lack of transparency during the crisis was particularly evident. The conflicting figures presented to the Congressional committee about EpiPen’s profitability and Mylan’s defensive stance on pricing strategies undermined public trust. A fundamental tenant of crisis management is the honest and open disclosure of information to all stakeholders, and Mylan’s opaque handling of the crisis called into question its integrity and transparency. When it came to communication, Mylan’s effort fell short. The company’s decision not to address the Congressional hearing or the justification for the price increase on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook was a glaring omission. Timely and clear communication is crucial during a crisis; Mylan’s belated responses in press releases and interviews were reactive rather than proactive, offering solutions such as generic versions of EpiPen only after significant backlash had already taken place. Moreover, the speed of Mylan’s response was inadequate. The company’s slow and reserved reaction allowed the negative public opinion to fester, exacerbating the crisis’s impact on its reputation. A faster, more decisive response could have provided Mylan with greater control over the narrative and potentially limited the reputational fallout. In terms of contingency planning, Mylan appeared to be unprepared for the crisis. Effective contingency planning involves forecasting possible scenarios and having strategies in place to address them, which Mylan evidently lacked. A well-prepared plan might have prevented the extent of the damage or at least provided the company with a roadmap for swiftly addressing the crisis. Public perception and corporate governance repercussions following the scandal further demonstrate the breadth and depth of Mylan’s reputational damage. The public outcry on social media, the impact on the company’s stock prices, and the concerns raised about corporate governance practices all reflect the far-reaching consequences of the crisis. In conclusion, the EpiPen pricing debacle revealed significant flaws in Mylan’s crisis management and corporate governance strategies, resulting in a damaged public image and eroded stakeholder trust. The company’s post-crisis response, although geared towards remediation, was insufficient to reverse the reputational harm. The scandal underscored the critical importance of transparency, communication, prompt action, and robust contingency planning as integral components of effective crisis management. Use the numbers, dates, percentawges, prices, and evidence that I gave you in your response, the more the ebetter The EpiPen pricing scandal tested Mylan’s crisis management proficiency profoundly, yielding significant damage to the company’s image. Effective crisis management underscores the importance of transparency, communication, speed, and control, aspects that Mylan seemingly neglected, as evidenced by the series of events that unfolded. Transparency was starkly absent in Mylan’s crisis management. When grilled by Congress in September 2016, Mylan presented conflicting profit figures, initially claiming a 100 profit for a two-pack of EpiPens, only for a later report by The Wall Street Journal to reveal profits were closer to 166 after accurate tax considerations – underscoring a stark 60% disparity. These conflicting accounts led to skepticism about the company’s transparency and integrity. Mylan’s communication strategy during the EpiPen crisis also faltered, evident in the minimal disclosure on social channels and lackluster explanations for the price hike, which jumped from approximately continue 50 per EpiPen in 2007 to around 600 for a two-pack by 2016. As the crisis ensued, Mylan’s reaction was belated and predominantly observed through a series of defensive press releases on PRNewswire. The first, on August 25, 2016, promoted CEO Heather Bresch’s television interview and existing assistance programs, while another on August 29 announced a forthcoming 300 generic EpiPen. These post hoc communications, meant to quell discontent, came well after public outrage had gained momentum, signifying Mylan’s misstep in not promptly and proactively addressing the crisis. The speed of Mylan’s engagement with the public did not meet the necessities of effective crisis management. As the scandal regarding the price increases of the EpiPen unfolded and public scrutiny escalated, Mylan’s responses were deemed too slow to stave off criticism and forestall the reputational harm. This sluggish reaction failed to demonstrate the agile and decisive crisis management needed to exert control over the evolving narrative. Contingency planning was evidently inadequate. As Mylan faced backlash culminating in their questionable handling of the heated Congressional hearing, their strategies did not seem to account for the risks and safety concerns inherent in such a highly regulated market. Such a reactive stance indicates a lack of foresight in anticipating the crisis, a departure from best practices in contingency planning which demands meticulous preparations for potential scenarios. The ramifications of the crisis on Mylan’s public image and corporate governance were severe. The adverse public response included widespread outrage on Twitter, the creation of Facebook pages calling for the CEO’s dismissal, and a petition that garnered over 50,000 signatures demanding action against Mylan’s monopoly. A sentiment analysis using Crimson Hexagon during the peak of the crisis showed that about 26% of social media sentiment was basic negative, with approximately 75% of all negative emotions expressed ranging from anger to fear. Additionally, Mylan’s third-quarter reports on November 9, 2016, revealed a loss of continue 119.8 million, a stark contrast to the 428.6 million profit of the same quarter the previous year, indicative of the financial strain the scandal had inflicted. The EpiPen pricing scandal and its aftermath illustrate Mylan’s shortcomings in crisis management and the profound impact such crises can have on a corporation’s image and financial health. Mylan’s handling of the scandal damaged the trust of stakeholders, fueled public demand for policy changes, and reinforced the notion that companies in the healthcare industry must be prepared to manage crises effectively or suffer considerable consequences. The lesson is clear: companies must have robust crisis management frameworks and contingency plans in place to respond swiftly, transparently, and ethically when facing public scrutiny.

Employees / Labor Managers Shareholders / Enterprise Customers Suppliers Government Banks and other Creditors Pressure Groups Competitors THEY CAN BE INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL SOME STAKEHOLDER NEEDS CAN BE CONFLICTING LABOR x ENTERPRISE: while labor will want the company to be on the safe side because they value job security, enterprise will value risk because of the possibility of higher profits. Labor will want higher costs because of quality of life, while enterprise will want lower costs because of higher profits. SUPPLIERS x CUSTOMERS: suppliers want to sell their items for the highest price possible, while customers want to pay the least possible price for the product.

Mylan’s EpiPen Pricing Scandal September 14, 2017 Mylan’s EpiPen Price Gouging By: Andreas Kanaris Miyashiro Each year about 3.6 million Americans are prescribed EpiPen, the epinephrine auto-injector. The EpiPen is a life-saving treatment for anaphylactic reactions, which are caused by allergens such as nuts, seafood, and insect bites. A sharp increase in EpiPen’s price between 2009 and 2016 caused outrage, and prompted debate over whether Mylan N.V, the owner of EpiPen, acted unethically. Beyond the behaviour of Mylan, EpiPen’s price increases raise questions about the conditions of the US pharmaceutical market, and whether existing regulations and laws are sufficient to protect consumers. Epipen Price Increases In 2007, Mylan N.V. acquired the right to market EpiPen as part of its acquisition of Merck KgaA. In 2009, Mylan began to steadily increase the price of EpiPen. In 2009, the wholesale price (the price which pharmacies paid) was 103.50 for a two-pack of autoinjectors. By July 2013 the price was up to 264.50, and it rose a further 75 percent to 461 by May of 2015. By May of 2016, the price rose again up to 608.61. Over a seven year period, the price of EpiPen had risen about 500% in total. Mylan’s EpiPen Price Gouging Mylan’s Colossal Marketing Efforts In tandem with these price increases, Mylan embarked on a strategy to cement the market dominance of EpiPen, while expanding the market for epinephrine as a whole. The first element of this strategy consisted of extensive marketing campaigns designed to raise awareness about the dangers of anaphylactic reactions. Mylan’s marketing efforts including television advertising, as well as some other less traditional advertising approaches. In 2014, for example, Mylan struck a deal with Walt Disney Parks and Resorts which produced a website and several storybooks designed for families living with severe allergies distributed in 2015. In addition, Mylan embarked on an extensive lobbying campaign. Mylan successfully lobbied the FDA in order to broaden the wording of the label of the drug, such that it could be prescribed to those who were ‘at risk’ of experiencing an anaphylactic reaction, in addition to those who had experienced anaphylaxis in the past. The company also added lobbyists in 36 states between 2010 and 2014, in order to pressure lawmakers to require epinephrine be made available in public schools. The rate at which Mylan hired new lobbyists during this period was faster than any other US company, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Increasingly, states have passed laws designed to encourage epinephrine injections to be made available in schools. In 2006, Nebraska became the first state to introduce a requirement that public schools must be able to provide epinephrine injections. Mylan’s lobbying efforts helped to accelerate this trend. A further nine states have introduced similar requirements since 2006, some prompted by much publicised deaths as a result of anaphylaxis. Virginia’s 2012 law, for example, followed 7-year-old Amarria Johnson’s death at a Chesterfield County school from a reaction to peanuts. A further 38 states passed laws permitting epinephrine in schools during the same period. In 2013, President Obama signed off on a federal law, which provides financial incentives for states to require epinephrine treatments in schools. The rate at which Mylan hired new lobbyists during this period was faster than any other US company, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Mylan’s lobbying efforts helped to increase the availability of epinephrine in schools. Simultaneously, Mylan attempted to increase the number of EpiPens sold to schools by establishing the ‘Epipen4Schools’ program in 2012. Schools that sign up to the program receive four free EpiPens. The scheme not only helps to increase the visibility of the EpiPen brand, but also has the potential to be lucrative for the company in the short term. Donations of EpiPens are tax deductible. Mylan is likely able to deduct the cost of producing each EpiPen which it donates plus 50% of the difference between the production cost and the sticker price. In addition, schools which signed up for the EpiPen4Schools program were offered discounted prices to buy more EpiPens, provided they signed an agreement to the effect that the schools would ‘not in the next 12 months purchase any products that are competitive to EpiPen® Auto-Injectors.’ This provision was discontinued in July, 2016, according to a statement Mylan gave to Congress. In the long term, Mylan’s Epipen4Schools program was clearly designed to cement a strong consumer base for the EpiPen. Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School, describes the company’s business model as giving customers ‘the first hit’ for free. Mylan’s strategy to increase sales and market share of EpiPen proved highly effective between 2007 and 2016. The product gained market share, from about 90% in 2007 when Mylan first purchased the rights to produce EpiPen to around 95% in 2015 and early 2016. Annual prescriptions for EpiPen products more than doubled to 3.6 million during the same period, according to IMS Health data. In 2007, the total US market for epinephrine was around 207 million a year. In 2015, and 2016, Mylan alone exceeded a billion dollars in EpiPen sales. Controversy and Lawsuits in Response to Price Increases In the summer of 2016, however, Mylan’s fortunes began to turn. The last round of price increases, which saw the wholesale price of a two pack of auto injectors rise to about 608 drew widespread criticism from the public and lawmakers. Multiple congressional committees requested Mylan explain the rapid price increases, resulting in a hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in September of 2016. Heather Bresch, CEO of Mylan since January of 2011, faced harsh criticism during her testimony. Bresch was unable to answer questions about revenues and the company’s patient assistance programs, but defended Mylan’s business practices and refused to accept the assertion the company had raised the prices of EpiPen’s to increase profits. Bresch insisted the price surge was a result of increased research and development costs, as well as the costs of Mylan’s EpiPen4Schools program. In addition, she claimed that half of the wholesale price of EpiPens are received by middlemen such as insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, and that the US healthcare system was partially to blame for rising costs. In response to criticism about the price increases, Mylan announced it would reduce the price of EpiPen through increased financial assistance in the form of savings cards that would cover up to 300 of the cost for those who have private health insurance. In addition, Mylan raised the income threshold for families who are uninsured or underinsured to be eligible for free EpiPens from under 48,600 a year to under 97,200 a year. Despite the fact that the new savings cards allowed patients to eliminate up to 300 of co-pay in buying an EpiPen, critics have pointed out the scheme is not a substitute for lowering prices. Though the amount the patients pay in co-pay for EpiPen is significantly reduced in using the savings card, insurance companies continue to pay for the high remaining cost of the drug. This results in higher healthcare premiums. For this very reason, such savings cards cannot be used by patients covered by Medicaid. Discounts such as this are considered ‘kickbacks’ which incentivise patients to buy pharmaceutical products, while leaving the government to pay for the remaining costs. As such, Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim criticised the savings cards as a ‘classic public relations move’ which fails to address the fundamental problem of high prices. Lawsuit 1: Mylan Misclassified EpiPen as a generic drug In September, 2016, increased scrutiny of Mylan’s business practices led to questions being raised about the drug classification of EpiPen. Mylan misclassified EpiPen as a generic drug, in order to avoid the higher rebates drug companies must pay when they sell their brand-name products to state Medicaid programs. Pharmaceutical companies selling generic drugs pay rebates of 13 percent of the average manufacturer’s price, while companies which sell brand-name drugs must offer discounts of 23 percent off either the average price, or the difference between the average price and the best price they have negotiated with any other American payer, depending on which option provides the bigger discount. Brand-name manufacturers must also pay further rebates if their products’ prices rise faster than inflation. Mylan misclassified EpiPen as a generic drug, in order to avoid the higher rebates drug companies must pay Patented drugs such as EpiPen are typically considered to be brand-name drugs, but Mylan classified the EpiPen as a generic on the basis that the active substance (epinephrine) used in EpiPens is common and widely used. This clearly was a misclassification, considering the extremely high market share which EpiPen enjoys, and the fact that Mylan owns a patent for EpiPen which will expire in 2025. The Department of Justice pursued legal action against Mylan in September of 2016. The case was resolved in a 465 million settlement in October. As part of the settlement, Mylan agreed to reclassify EpiPen as a branded drug. Lawsuit 2: Antitrust violation Also in September of 2016, New York attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman launched an antitrust investigation into Mylan, on the basis that the sales contracts with schools as part of the EpiPen4Schools program violated antitrust laws. The investigation is ongoing, but it seems likely that Mylan may eventually face consequences for the illegal contracts, which forced schools to refrain from buying EpiPen’s competitors in order to buy EpiPens at discounted prices. In December of 2016, Mylan again attempted to address criticisms of EpiPen’s price by releasing a generic version of EpiPen with a list price of 300 for a two-pack, less than half the price of the brand-name version. A press release from Mylan stated this ‘unprecedented action, along with the enhancements we made to our patient access programs, will help patients and provide substantial savings to payors.’ It is highly unusual for a pharmaceutical company to release a generic competitor for its own brand name product. As well as serving as an attempt to quiet criticism of EpiPen’s price, the move may have been motivated by Teva pharmaceutical’s development of its own generic epinephrine auto-injector, expected to win FDA approval at some point in 2017. Mylan’s release of its own generic device might have been an attempt to steal market share from Teva’s product Lawsuit 3: Class action based on RICO In April of 2017, Mylan faced two new lawsuits related to their business practices in selling EpiPen. The first, filed April 3rd, was a class-action lawsuit filed by three EpiPen purchasers who claim that Mylan engaged in illegal schemes to dominate the market with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs). PBMs serve as intermediaries between insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and pharmacies. The plaintiffs claim that agreements reached between Mylan and a number of PBMs including CVS Caremark, Express Scripts Holding Co and OptumRX, were illegal under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Mylan allegedly offered the PBMs large rebates in exchange for favouring EpiPen over competitors. Lawsuit 4: Anti-competitive acts The second lawsuit, filed April 24th by pharmaceutical company Sanofi SA, also accused Mylan of illegally attempting to prevent competition for the EpiPen. Sanofi claims that Mylan offered rebates to PBMs, insurers, and state Medicaid agencies on the condition they would not reimburse patients to buy Sanofi’s Auvi-Q rival auto-injector device. Sanofi seeks damages against Mylan for the hundreds of millions of dollars they may have lost in sales due to these illegal agreements. Any damages which Mylan pays to Sanofi will be tripled under US antitrust law. Determinants of EpiPen Pricing A number of different factors interact in determining the price for a specific drug in a particular country. These include the market for the drug in question, the judgment and business practices of the manufacturer, and the conditions of the wider pharmaceutical market and healthcare system in the country of interest. Examining these factors in relation to the EpiPen can explain the dramatic increase in its price between 2009 and 2016. Background on the Epinephrine Market Epinephrine is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxis (severe allergic reactions) since 1977. Anaphylactic reactions can be deadly due to swelling and closing of the airways. Epinephrine injections, by triggering the ‘fight or flight’ response, quickly causes patients’ airways to open, preventing death from suffocation. Marginal Costs Epinephrine is widely used and very cheap to produce. It takes less than one US dollar to manufacture one millilitre of epinephrine. A single EpiPen dispenses less than a third of that amount. What makes the EpiPen valuable is it quickly administers the correct dose of epinephrine, and is simple enough to operate that a person suffering from anaphylaxis can self-administer the treatment if necessary. Still, the manufacturing cost of EpiPen is estimated to be under 10 per two pack. R&D Cost The marginal costs of most drugs to manufacturers are typically low. More influential supply-side factors in determining drug pricing are research and development costs and marketing costs. Heather Bresch, in her September 2016 congressional hearing, testified that the price increases for Epipen were in part due to research and development costs involved in improving the drug. Since purchasing EpiPen in 2007, Mylan has made incremental upgrades to the EpiPen, designed to make the drug easier to administer and clarify instructions about how to use the product. Daniel Kozarich, an expert on pricing, suggests that the EpiPen price increases up to 2013, by which time the price of a two-pack had risen to 264.50, could justifiably be explained as compensation for research and development costs. This cannot be said for the subsequent price increases between 2013 and 2016. Marketing Cost Mylan engaged in extensive marketing of the EpiPen, paying about 35 million for advertising in 2014, for example. Usually, such heavy marketing costs are reserved for new products, which are often advertised widely in order to introduce to the drugs to the medical community. The amount Mylan spends in advertising, however, is dwarfed by its yearly sales of EpiPen, which exceeded 1 billion for the first time in 2015. Mylan’s aggressive advertising efforts have proved very successful in expanding the size of the market for EpiPen, and cannot justify an over 500% increase in price during a seven year period. ‘Willingness to Pay’ and Pricing While supply-side factors may have played a part in Mylan’s determination to increase prices, demand-side factors may have been more influential. For the most part, drug prices in the US predominantly rest on demand-side considerations. As William Comanor and Stuart Schweitzer, professors at the UCLA School of Public Health explain, the key factor in determining pharmaceutical prices is patients’ ‘willingness to pay’ for a given product. The most important factor determining the magnitude of patients’ ‘willingness to pay’ for a product is the therapeutic advance it provides. New drugs with a significant therapeutic advantage over old ones are the subject of large amounts of demand, which warrant high prices. The EpiPen, however, has been on the market since 1987. Typically, innovative products such as the EpiPen offering a large therapeutic advance are introduced with high prices that decrease over time. This pricing strategy is referred to as ‘skimming’. EpiPen’s price increases under Mylan are unusual given that the product has been on the market for three decades. A Lack of Competition The high price of EpiPen can better be explained by the lack of competition the product faces. The amount of competition a particular drug faces in its specific category has a significant effect on price, as prescribing physicians must select between rival drugs. A 1998 study by Lu and Comanor finds that launch prices of pharmaceutical products are significantly lower when there are more branded rivals in direct competition with them. During the period in which Mylan increased EpiPen prices, few direct competitors existed to threaten EpiPen’s market dominance in the US. In the UK and other European countries, the EpiPen competes against the Jext auto injector from ALK pharma, and the Emerade auto injector from Valeant, among others. In contrast, prior to June of 2013, when the Adrenaclick autoinjector was reintroduced by Amedra, few direct competitors to the EpiPen existed in the US. Since its relaunch, the Adrenaclick has faced manufacturing constraints, which prevented it from gaining significant market share until recently. Auvi-Q, manufactured by French pharmaceutical Sanofi S.A., was designed to rival the EpiPen, but was on the market for only three years before Sanofi voluntarily recalled all Auvi-Q devices due to concerns the auto injectors were administering incorrect doses. The Auvi-Q is the most significant competitor to EpiPen worldwide, but its recall in the US damaged its reputation. Since the beginning of 2017, EpiPen has lost a significant amount of market share in the US, partly to cheaper products such as the generic version of the Adrenaclick which costs only 110, but also to Mylan’s own generic version of EpiPen. Between 2007, and 2016, EpiPen’s market share in the US hovered between 90 and 95%. Between January and March of 2017, EpiPen’s market share in the US has been only 71%, according to a study by AthenaInsight. Fiona Scott Morton and Lysle T. Boller of the Yale School of Management comment on the subject of EpiPen’s lack of competition that “there is a tension between imitating a reference product like EpiPen without imitating its injector”. Generic applicants hoping to create a new version of a patented product face navigating through unclear FDA guidelines concerning how to avoid infringing on the existing patent. In the case of EpiPen, developing competitor drugs may have been particularly difficult due to the fact the patented element being the injector rather than epinephrine, which is an old generic. Any injector imitating EpiPen is likely to infringe on EpiPen’s patent protection. A similar patent issued helped to facilitate the recent dramatic price increases of Evzio, an autoinjector for naloxone, used to treat opioid overdose. As with EpiPen, Evzio’s patented element is the delivery device rather than the drug itself. It should be noted that one factor which helped reduce competition for the EpiPen in the US was Mylan’s own business practices. Multiple lawsuits, such as the 2016 lawsuit regarding the EpiPen4Schools program, revealed Mylan may have violated antitrust laws by offering rebates and discounts to buyers such as insurance companies and schools, in exchange for agreements which would preclude those buyers from purchasing any of EpiPen’s competitors. The US Healthcare System and EpiPen pricing The list price of a two-pack of EpiPen is about 69 in the UK, about 100 in France, and about 200 in Germany. These prices are dramatically lower than the 609 list price of EpiPen in the US. As was mentioned previously, EpiPen prices in Europe are lower in part due to a larger number of direct competitors to the EpiPen there. But the most significant factor causing this price differentiation is the healthcare system in the US. The UK, France, and Germany all have different forms of universal health care systems, which severely restrict the price of pharmaceutical drugs. UK Pharmaceutical Price Controls In the UK, there exists a long-held consensus among lawmakers that there is a need for price regulation of pharmaceuticals, as the supply of pharmaceuticals is viewed as non-competitive due to the patent system. Within the Medicines, Pharmacy, and Industrial (MPI) division of the UK Department of Health, the Pricing and Supply branch oversees drug price controls. The Pricing and Supply branch negotiates an agreement, called the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) with the pharmaceutical industry that sets a cap to profits which pharmaceutical companies can make on NHS business. Pharmaceutical companies are required to repay any amount that exceeds this fixed cap. This agreement is renegotiated every time the existing PPRS agreement expires, which typically occurs 4-5 years after they come into effect. PPRS agreements explicitly aim to create a balance between ‘[supporting ] the NHS by ensuring that the branded medicines bill stays within affordable limits and [delivering] value for money’ and ‘promoting a strong and profitable pharmaceutical industry that is both capable of and willing to invest in sustained research and development’. The UK is a hub of research and development in the pharmaceutical sector, and has continued to attract investment, despite the decline in pharmaceutical research and development in Europe as a whole. PPRS agreements aim to control prices such that pharmaceutical companies’ profits are largely in line with the profits of British industry in general, without damaging this important sector of the UK economy. Of course, the PPRS was implemented on the basis that the NHS is the sole healthcare provider for about 90% of the UK population. A system such as the one the PPRS sets out is not be feasible in the US, where no universal public healthcare option exists. The effects of the PPRS in relation to the cost of EpiPen are striking. The National Health Service (NHS), the public healthcare provider in the UK, pays £53 per two pack for EpiPen, then distributes them to patients who pay only £8.40. A Lack of Price Controls in the US In the US, in contrast, a lack of price controls set by the government allows drugs to be sold at whatever prices pharmaceutical companies see fit. State Medicaid programs mandate that pharmaceutical companies sell these drugs at a rebate, which is higher or lower depending on whether the drugs in question are classed as innovators (brand-name drugs) or generics. However, even taking into account rebates, certain drugs such as EpiPen are sold to state Medicaid programs at far higher prices than they are sold to the NHS in the UK. This does not necessarily mean all drug prices are much higher in the US than they are in other countries. Reports by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 1992 and 1994 show that the cash prices for the same branded products are generally higher in the United States than elsewhere. However, the GAO reports, and other studies of a similar nature fail to account for a number of factors which obfuscate price comparisons. Mylan’s EpiPen Price Gouging One issue is the GAO report relies on established nominal prices of drugs. These prices do not take into account the rebates and discounts granted to large-scale buyers of pharmaceutical products. This is a huge oversight, considering these bulk buyers comprise the largest segment of demand for pharmaceutical products in the US. Given the prices at which large-scale buyers buy drugs are not disclosed, it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of how this skews the GAO results. Even more significantly, the GAO report fails to account for the influence of generic drugs in the US pharmaceutical market. Generic drugs are more widely used in the US than in most other countries, accounting for about half of the total sales in pharmaceutical products, and are also generally much cheaper than their branded counterparts. The generic version of the EpiPen introduced by Mylan costs about half the price of the branded version, for example. As such, it is insufficient to simply compare US prices of popular branded drugs to those in other countries. The market share of generic drugs, and their prices should also be compared. William Comanor and Stuart Schweitzer, professors at the UCLA School of Public Health provide the following example to illustrate this point: ‘Suppose that half of US prescriptions for Cimetidine, a popular H2 blocker for gastric reflux and ulcers, are filled by the generic version, the price of which is, say, 104 per hundred, while the price of the branded product, Tagamet, is 167. The average price is 135.50. Suppose further that the prices of both versions of the drug are lower in Canada, with a price of Tagamet of 150 and a generic price of 100. If the generic version’s market share is only 20% in Canada, the average price there is 140, which is higher than the average US price, even though the prices charged for both products are lower in Canada.’ It should be noted this argument is predicated on the idea that generic drugs are identically effective to branded drugs, which is not necessarily the case. Generic drugs must be bioequivalent to their branded counterparts under US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules, and the FDA considers generic drugs therapeutically equivalent to brand-name drugs. However, the inactive ingredients in branded drugs may result in slightly different outcomes for patients than generic drugs in some cases. Furthermore, as was the case with the EpiPen until Mylan introduced its own generic version of the product, some pharmaceutical products do not have generic counterparts. In sum, the problem of inflated pharmaceutical prices does not apply to all drugs in the US. Many drug prices are well regulated in the US by market forces. The main conclusion from empirical studies comparing US drug prices to drug prices in other countries is the US system gives pharmaceutical companies license to sell certain drugs, most often brand-name drugs, at extremely inflated prices. Many drug prices are well regulated in the US by market forces. The main conclusion from empirical studies comparing US drug prices to drug prices in other countries is the US system gives pharmaceutical companies license to sell certain drugs, most often brand-name drugs, at extremely inflated prices. PBMs and Pricing Opacity Heather Bresch, during her December 2016 testimony to the House Oversight committee, claimed the ‘opaque and frustrating’ healthcare system in the US was partly to blame for price increases. Rather than a lack of regulation in the US giving license to companies to increase prices, the healthcare system actually forces companies such as Mylan to raise prices, according to Bresch. There is some degree of truth to this assertion. Some commentators suggest the US healthcare system suffers from a lack of transparency, which results in inflated pharmaceutical prices. Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), the ‘middlemen’ who bridge the gap between drug manufacturers, insurance companies, and pharmacies are one of the players who are most at fault for creating opacity in the US health system. Fundamentally, PBMs serve an important function in the US health system. Their core purpose is to aid insurance companies, HMOs, and large employers who purchase drugs for their beneficiaries. PBMs help these large buyers to process claims, and make transactions between the various players involved in providing drugs to insured patients. The beneficiaries themselves buy drugs from local pharmacies. PBMs reimburse pharmacies for the cost of the drug, based on the price the pharmacy paid for the drug, and the size of the co-payment. The PBMs themselves receive payments both from the large-scale buyers of drugs such as insurance companies, but also from drug manufacturers who pay them rebates taken from the amount that they receive from pharmacies who sell their drugs. The drug manufacturers receive revenue equal to the list price of drugs minus the rebates they provide to PBMs. PBMs negotiate rebates with manufacturers, meaning that various PBMs receive differential rebates when selling the same brands of drugs. This system, working effectively, has a number of advantages. The rebates system permits manufacturers to charge different prices to different buyers and creates a complex system of differential pricing, responsive to differential demand. Large-scale buyers pay less than the full list price of drugs due to rebates. Patients receive drugs, and pay only the co-pay amount. Mylan’s EpiPen Price Gouging In addition, PBMs should have a beneficial effect on the demand side of the pharmaceutical market, as PBMs buy drugs in large quantities on behalf of insurance companies. Ideally, PBMs should augment the elasticity of demand, and improve competition in place of consumers, whose demand is inelastic and who are uninformed about competing products. On the other hand, if PBMs do not respond to price changes in an appropriate way, they risk distorting the market. If a rival company begins selling a drug, which is a close substitute for another drug at a lower price, demand for the rival’s drug should rise accordingly. If PBMs, as large-scale buyers, fail to increase the amount of the rival drug that they purchase, there is a risk the rival company will not be able to generate sales and market share. The incentive to lower prices in the first place is removed, and pharmaceutical companies are likely to continue charging their existing customers high prices rather than attempt to increase sales by lowering prices. As such, PBMs have the capacity to distort the effects of competition. The fundamental problem with the operation of PBMs currently is that the savings generated by rebates are not passed on directly to consumers. As Fiona Scott Morton and Lysle T. Boller of the Yale School of Management note, ‘rebates are never made public because they reflect the competitive advantage of both the PBM and the brand’s manufacturer’. As such, PBMs are able to profit from the discrepancies between the price at which the manufacturers sell them the drugs, and the prices at which pharmacies and insurance companies buy them. For example, if a manufacturer increases the price of a particular drug, the PBM might be paid a rebate for the extra cost. However, the insurance company purchasing the drugs eventually will not be aware of this additional rebate the PBM is receiving. The rebate simply becomes profit for the PBM. As such, PBMs have strong incentives to buy and distribute drugs from companies offering them high rebates, rather than those who sell drugs at lower prices. Low prices save patients and insurance companies money, whereas high rebates result in higher profits for PBMs. PBMs’ earnings would be significantly reduced if pharmaceutical companies curtail price hikes, as is illustrated by a 2013 Morgan Stanley report. As a result, PBMs distort demand rather than improving its elasticity. PBMs facilitate high drug prices, encouraging pharmaceutical companies to raise prices but increase rebates. High prices are translated into higher premiums charged to consumers by insurance companies, but fall hardest on those without insurance, who face paying the full list price of expensive products such as EpiPen. Bresch’s comments have an element of truth in light of these facts. If EpiPen were to lower prices rather than reduce rebates to PBMs, they would risk losing sales given that PBMs prefer to purchase products with high prices. On the other hand, the buying practices of PBMs do not necessarily encourage price increases as they do not profit from price increases in themselves. Furthermore, Mylan may have entered into illegal, anticompetitive agreements with PBMs as is alleged by the class action lawsuit filed in April 2017. The lawsuit raises the possibility that rather than suffering from the practices of PBMs, Mylan benefitted from them. Ultimately, Mylan is culpable for increasing prices. Background on Mylan N.V. Mylan N.V., an American generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals company, was founded in 1961. Initially, Mylan was a small generics-only drug company, but it expanded into the brand-name sector when it introduced a highly successful new formulation of the diuretic Dyazide in 1987. Through a number of acquisitions, Mylan grew to be one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the US, and one of the largest generic drug producers in the world. In 2007, Mylan made its most significant acquisition ever, purchasing Merck KGaA’s generic’s arm in a 6.6 billion deal. As part of the same deal, Mylan gained the right to produce and distribute EpiPen. According to a press release by Mylan, the acquisition had the potential to triple the company’s revenue. A History of Controversial Business Practice The recent controversy surrounding Mylan’s practices is unsurprising given Mylan’s history of questionable business decisions: In December 1998, the FTC charged Mylan with restraint of trade, monopolisation and conspiracy to monopolise the markets as a result of their price increases for two widely-prescribed anti-anxiety drugs, lorazepam and clorazepate. In January 1998, Mylan raised the wholesale price of clorazepate from 11.36 to 377.00 per bottle of 500 tablets. In March of 1998, the wholesale price of lorazepam was increased from 7.30 for a bottle of 500 tablets to 190.00. According to the FTC, Mylan entered into anticompetitive agreements with ProFarmica, a company producing raw ingredients required to manufacture the two drugs. The agreements restricted the supply of these raw ingredients in order to facilitate Mylan’s dramatic price increases. After 32 states joined the suit against Mylan, a 100 million settlement was reached in 2000. In October 2009, the US Justice Department brought a lawsuit was brought against Mylan concerning false claims to State Medicaid programs. The plaintiffs claimed that Mylan had deliberately misclassified drugs (including nifedipine extended release tablets, flecainide acetate, selegiline HCL) sold to State Medicaid companies as generic drugs, when they should have been classified as innovator drugs. Mylan misclassified the drugs for the purpose of avoiding the higher rebates which generic drugs are subject to under state Medicaid programs. In October of 2009, the case was settled for 124 million. What is striking about these cases of illegal misconduct is that they closely mirror misconduct that Mylan would later carry out in relation to EpiPen. The September 2016 lawsuit against Mylan, resulting in a 465 million settlement, was a result of Mylan illegally avoiding rebates to state Medicaid programs just as it had done in 2009. The three separate lawsuits Mylan has faced since the October 2016 settlement are all related to claims that Mylan violated antitrust laws in contracts selling EpiPen, the same crime Mylan was charged with in 1998. While illegal behaviour such as this is unfortunately common amongst Pharmaceutical companies operating in the US, Mylan’s repeat offences suggest the company has bred a culture of questionable business practices transcending changes in management over time. Studying Mylan’s history of illegal and exploitative conduct, the company’s decision to raise EpiPen prices to an unethical extent is unsurprising. According to reporting by the New York Times, high level executives at Mylan operate on principles far removed from what Mylan’s mission statement espouses. According to Mylan’s website, management ‘[challenges] every member of every team to challenge the status quo’ and the business model of the company puts ‘people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow’. According to anonymous sources within the company who spoke to the New York Times, a number of mid-level executives began to grow concerned about EpiPen price increases in 2014, feeling the prices were reaching exploitative levels. When these concerns were aired to Robert Coury, Mylan’s chairman, he replied that ‘anyone criticising Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves’. Ethics Analysis of Mylan N.V. Acts As the analysis illustrates, there are a number of interrelated factors contributing to the high prices of pharmaceutical products in the US. These factors deserve to be the subjects of scrutiny, and inform attempts to reform the US health market. However, the ultimate responsibility for drastic price increases lies with pharmaceutical companies. Heather Bresch’s Response to Criticism of Mylan In her 2016 testimony to Congress, Heather Bresch argued Mylan was responsible for a ‘tremendous amount of good… for millions of patients in the U.S and around the world’. She made a number of claims to prove this assertion. Firstly, she argued Mylan was responsible, through its advertising and advocacy efforts, for dramatically increasing awareness and use of EpiPens. The cost of these efforts contributed to price increases. According to Bresch ‘the issue of EpiPens has two equally critical dimensions — price and access.’ Secondly, Mylan had invested in research and development aimed at improving the EpiPen. This also contributed to price increases. The combined costs of research and development of EpiPen, plus advertising and lobbying costs amounted to 1 billion. Thirdly, the opacity and complexity of the drug distribution chain in the US resulted in higher prices. Finally, Bresch claimed that Mylan only profited about 50 per EpiPen, or 100 per two pack in total. Furthermore, a new generic version of EpiPen was being developed which would be priced at 300, and new savings vouchers had been introduced which offered patients up to 300 off the price of their co-pay for EpiPen. Refuting Bresch’s Response Bresch’s response to criticism of EpiPen’s price was disingenuous and misleading, for a number of reasons. Overriding goal was to increase sales Mylan’s advertising and advocacy efforts were beneficial in that they successfully increased awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis. However, they clearly were aimed at increasing EpiPen’s sales rather than preventing harm. The strategies Mylan employed as part of this campaign demonstrate this. Mylan enticed schools in to signing anticompetitive agreements that precluded them from purchasing EpiPen’s competitor products as part of the EpiPen4Schools program. Mylan’s aim was not only to encourage schools to make epinephrin injections available, but also to ensure that schools would buy its product alone. Mylan’s advertising campaign also crossed ethical boundaries, deliberately misleading customers. In 2012, Mylan released an advertisement that implied that as long as anaphylaxis sufferers had an EpiPen on hand, they could eat whatever allergenic foods they wanted. Heather Bresch and other executives approved the ad, despite concerns being raised about its misleading message in a number of stages of the internal review process. Reportedly, Bresch suggested that it was best to be ‘bold’ in advertising. Mylan pulled the ad subsequent to a record number of consumer complaints being sent to the FDA. The complaints claimed the ad overstated the efficacy of EpiPen. In 2012, Mylan released an advertisement that implied that as long as anaphylaxis sufferers had an EpiPen on hand, they could eat whatever allergenic foods they wanted. These details of Mylan’s advertising and advocacy campaign illustrate that the overriding aim of the campaign was clearly to increase sales of EpiPen. The campaign may also have had altruistic motivations, as Bresch suggests, but these were a secondary objective. In any case, Mylan’s advertising and lobbying were highly successful in expanding the market for epinephrine auto injectors, increasing sales of EpiPen by over 400%. The increases in sales more than compensated for the costs of the campaign R&D costs insufficient to explain price increase Furthermore, the research and development costs of improving the EpiPen, as previously mentioned, can only reasonably be used to justify the price increases which occurred up to 2013. While Bresch claimed the combined cost of advertising, lobbying, research and development exceeded 1 billion, the House Oversight Committee commented that none of Bresch’s financial data presented was substantiated. Bresch also claimed during the hearing that Mylan had saved the federal government 180 billion during its ownership of EpiPen. Bresch presented no evidence in support of this claim, and failed to even elaborate the reason why it might have been the case. Bresch’s claims about the amount of profit from each EpiPen were proved to be incorrect after subsequent analysis. Independent estimates suggest that Mylan profits 80 per EpiPen, and 160 per two-pack, 60% more profit than Bresch claimed in the hearing. EpiPen price an outlier, even in the context of the US While Bresch’s claims about the opacity and complexity of the US health system have an element of truth, it is doubtful that the operation of PBMs could have necessitated price increases of the magnitude that Mylan carried out. PBMs were responsible for the price increases only insofar as they may have discouraged competition and enabled Mylan to increase prices without reducing sales. The ultimate responsibility for raising prices lies with Mylan, particularly considering Mylan may have entered into anticompetitive agreements with PBMs. Insufficient response to price increases by Mylan Furthermore, the discount vouchers and the generic version of EpiPen Mylan introduced in response to criticism were insufficient to solve the pricing problem. As previously mentioned, the savings cards are only available to families with private health insurance, and up to 97,200 a year combined income. Families with under 28,000 in income are typically eligible for Medicaid coverage. This leaves only a margin of 69,200 in income within which families are eligible for the savings card (excluding individuals covered by Medicare). Furthermore, many families and individuals who have income too high to be eligible for Medicaid or Obamacare feel they cannot afford private health insurance. In sum, the subset of patients eligible to use the savings card for EpiPen is small. In cases where patients are able to use the savings cards, insurance companies absorb most of the costs of the savings, leading to higher premiums. The generic version of the EpiPen is perhaps a more effective measure to lift the financial burden on patients. However, many commentators suggest that Mylan’s introduction of the generic EpiPen was a preemptive strategy to steal market share from Teva pharmaceuticals, which is set to release its own generic epinephrine autoinjector. It is also important to note that 300, the cost of the new generic, still represents a 200% markup of EpiPen’s price in 2009. Given that Bresch’s explanations for the dramatic increases in EpiPen pricing do not withstand scrutiny, it seems clear that Mylan’s motivation for the price increases was simply to increase profits. Having a near monopoly on the epinephrine auto-injector market, and knowing that demand for EpiPen is relatively inelastic given that the drug is an essential, life-saving treatment, executives at Mylan believed that they could raise prices without reducing sales. Clearly, Mylan’s acts fall into the category of exploitative and unethical behaviour. Conclusion and Policy Prescriptions In light of Mylan’s EpiPen price-gouging, it is clear that there is an need for reform of the US health system such that pharmaceutical companies are prevented from raising prices of essential medicines to exploitative levels. Price Controls Given the effectiveness of the PPRS in the UK, price-controls (or indirect price controls through laws which limit profits) are the most obvious solution. However, It is a matter of debate whether price controls would be beneficial overall in the context of the US pharmaceutical market. Detractors of pharmaceutical price controls argue that price controls might discourage valuable innovation in the US pharmaceutical market. The pharmaceutical industry is particularly fast-moving, so it would be a difficult market for regulators to govern effectively. Regulators may struggle to regulate drugs because they might be uninformed about valuable research, be captured by the industry given the power of lobbyists in the US, or lack the resources to keep up with changes in science or the cost of production ‘Reference pricing’, a popular form of government price controls utilised in Germany, Italy, and Spain among other countries, illustrates the difficulties regulators face in controlling pharmaceutical prices. In a reference pricing system, drugs are classified into therapeutic classes based on the way in which they attack diseases. Prices of drugs are capped based on their therapeutic class, Clearly, such a system might discourage innovations which offer therapeutic advances, as the classification system dis-incentives companies from formulating new drugs which are more effective but fall into the same therapeutic classes as existing drugs. A study by Joseph Golec and John A. Vernon reach similar conclusions, finding that the US would have never formulated 117 new medicines and would have lost 4368 research jobs had European-style price controls been implemented over a 19 year period. In addition to disincentivising companies from innovating, price controls might restrict drug companys’ financial ability to fund research and development. Ronald Vogel, researcher at the Center for Health Outcomes and PharmacoEconomic Research of the University of Arizona, finds that pharmaceutical price controls in European countries result in reduced research and development spending by drug companies. Vogel concludes that price controls ‘[reduce] the amount of profit available for further R&D, which is a detriment to consumers worldwide’ and in effect invalidates the benefits of patent protection. A study by Joseph Golec and John A. Vernon reach similar conclusions, finding that the US would have never formulated 117 new medicines and would have lost 4368 research jobs had European-style price controls been implemented over a 19 year period. Average annual real growth in US and EU pharmaceutical R&D spending between 1987 and 2004 (Golec and Vernon, 2010) Mylan’s EpiPen Price Gouging The cost of reducing development of new drugs is heavy. An econometric study by Frank Lichtenberg (2002) shows that between 1960 and 1997, every 1,345 spent on pharmaceutical research and development resulted in an additional U.S. life year (meaning a full healthy year of a person’s life). The introduction of new drugs not only improves patient outcomes, but also significantly expands the number of patients who can be treated who suffer from a given condition. The central question in the debate over whether price controls should be introduced into the US drug market, then, is whether it is worth correcting the injustice of limited cases of price-gouging at the cost of damaging patient outcomes on a somewhat wider scale. Some politicians, such as Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have voiced their support for price controls. The political will to create price control legislation does not yet exist on a large scale, however. Targeted Price Negotiation Considering the deleterious effects that wide ranging price controls could have, some analysts have suggested that limited, targeted price controls might prove more effective in controlling excessive prices while preserving innovation. Richard G. Frank, of Harvard Medical School, and Richard J. Zeckhauser, Harvard Kennedy School of Government, propose a framework for drug price negotiation designed to correct market imperfections related to ‘MISCs’. MISCs are drugs subject to a combination of a monopoly and insurance subsidised consumption and can be identified by the following characteristics: A) Being a unique product with few competitors B) Likely to be paid for under the reinsurance benefit provided by Medicare C) Represents a significant claim on spending by the Part D program of Medicare In Zeckhauser and Frank’s framework, drugs with the fulfilled criteria could be subject to a mandatory negotiated payment system, not dissimilar to the PPRS negotiation in the UK. The price negotiations would take into account a number of factors, such as the therapeutic advance offered by the drug, in calculating how much it should cost. The pricing regulations would be in effect until competitors entered the market. This particular framework is designed specifically for the market inefficiency resulting from high-cost drugs which are bought largely by State Medicare programs. The fact that Medicare buys MISCs in large quantities distorts the market, as several players in the process of distributing the drugs, including patients and doctors have no incentive to seek lower prices or adjust their buying practices because the price of the drugs are subsidised. …companies such as Mylan holding virtual monopolies over segments of the market could be required to submit to price negotiation. Zeckhauser and Frank’s framework is designed to ensure that there continue to be strong incentives for companies to create new, innovative products. It is reasonable to imagine that Zeckhauser and Frank’s framework could be implemented on a larger scale, tailored to correct a wider number of market imperfections. For example, companies such as Mylan holding virtual monopolies over segments of the market could be required to submit to price negotiation. Zeckhauser and Frank’s framework is designed to ensure that there continue to be strong incentives for companies to create new, innovative products. As such, a large-scale version of the framework could prove effective in regulating prices in a manner that does not have a significant impact on the creation of new drugs. An Alternative to Price-Controls Even moderate forms of price controls such as those discussed above would likely be strongly opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, which has significant lobbying power in the US. An alternative approach to limiting pharmaceutical prices might encompass two dimensions: (1) encouraging competition, and (2) ensuring that competition is effective in regulating price. As previously discussed, EpiPen’s high price was in part a result of its lack of competitors in the US. Increased competition in certain sectors within the pharmaceutical market might help to prevent excessive price increases. Encouraging competition in the pharmaceutical market might involve a number of reforms. Instructing the FDA to use more resources in approving drugs, especially those in the biosimilar and generic categories, in order to prevent delays would be particularly beneficial. As analysis of the practices of PBMs illustrates, competition does not always have the desired effect of decreasing prices in the US drug market. As such, encouraging competition is insufficient to solve the pricing problem. Imperfections in the market, which prevent competition from having the desired effect could be corrected through a number of reforms. The issue of PBMs, for example, might be corrected by legislation mandating that rebate rates be published by PBMs. This would prevent the pricing opacity that encourages PBMs to buy products with higher rebates rather than those with lower prices. Disadvantages to this alternative approach to limiting drug prices include its complexity, and also the fact that, since it is an indirect, ‘soft’ approach to limiting prices, it may not be effective in every case. Inevitably, there would be cases of price gouging, even if such regulations were implemented. A Need for Reform Despite the numerous challenges that face lawmakers in preventing high drug prices, there is no doubt this is an area which urgently requires reform. Just as it is wrong to price gouge during a state of emergency when essential supplies are scarce, it is wrong that companies can exploit vulnerable populations who require drugs by raising prices to extreme levels. Public outrage and even lawsuits are insufficient to solving the pricing problem as EpiPen’s case illustrates. Even in the face of reputational damage and numerous lawsuits, Mylan has not decreased the price of EpiPen. In the absence of drug price reforms, it is important that lawmakers ensure as many Americans as is possible have health insurance. Those without health insurance are affected most deeply by drug price increases, often having no choice but to buy drugs such as EpiPen at their full list price. Recent Republican proposals for healthcare reform, which cut Medicaid and risk reducing the number of insured Americans by up to 22 million, are dangerous for this reason. -x- Bibliography Bartolone, Pauline. “EpiPen’s Dominance Driven By Competitors’ Stumbles And Tragic Deaths.” NPR, NPR, 7 Sept. 2016, www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/07/492964464/epipen-s-dominance-driven-by-competitors-stumbles-and-tragic-deaths.

According to topic 1.4 of IB Business Management, stakeholders have varying interests and stakes within a company, and these interests can conflict at times. Shareholders of Mylan, classified as enterprise stakeholders, typically prioritize financial returns and may indeed pursue opportunities for innovation, growth, and competitive practices that could potentially drive up company profits. However, in the case of the EpiPen scandal, while the initial strategies for market dominance vastly increased Mylan’s revenues, the ensuing public backlash and legal challenges created a volatile situation for shareholders. The immediate response of the stock market to the scandal indicated a significant erosion of shareholder wealth, with Mylan’s stock price plummeting from a high of 48.53 to a low of 34.14, representing a decrease of approximately 30%. This trend was indicative of a crisis of confidence among investors, agitated by Mylan’s muddled response to the public outcry over EpiPen pricing. By 2016, the price of an EpiPen two-pack had soared by about 500%, leading to congressional inquiries and public opprobrium. Shareholders, while potentially benefitting from short-term profits due to increased EpiPen sales — which surpassed a billion dollars — had to contend with the long-term uncertainty of Mylan’s stock and the impact of various lawsuits, including settlements costing Mylan hundreds of millions. For instance, the","completion":"465 million settlement Mylan agreed to pay to the U.S. Department of Justice in October 2016 for overcharging Medicaid due to misclassification of EpiPen as a generic product, represented not only a direct financial cost but also a reputational blow that could affect future earnings and stock performance. It's important to note that shareholder interests are complex and often intertwined with ethical considerations. While shareholders may seek financial gains, they also have a vested interest in the stability and long-term reputation of the company. The EpiPen scandal, thus, presented shareholders with a dual dilemma: the immediate financial losses due to stock devaluation and the challenge of reconciling profit-seeking behavior with ethical business practices. The shareholder conflict in the case of Mylan reveals a struggle between short-term profitability and the long-term sustainability of the company’s public image and market position. In this context, strategies such as 'pay-for-delay' and exclusive school contracting, while initially seeming to align with shareholder interests for higher returns, ultimately proved to be risky and unsustainable practices that threatened shareholder value. In conclusion, the effects of the EpiPen scandal on Mylan’s shareholders highlight the intricate balance between the pursuit of financial objectives and the importance of responsible corporate governance. The steep drop in stock value, alongside the reputational damage and regulatory scrutiny, underscore the need for businesses to integrate ethical considerations into their strategies to safeguard both stakeholder interests and the company's longevity. Shareholders, as key stakeholders, are directly impacted by such corporate crises and must advocate for practices that ensure both profitability and ethical integrity to preserve their investments."},{"prompt":"Introduction: The Ethics and Economics of Mylan’s EpiPen Pricing Mylan N.V.'s history with the EpiPen, an essential lifesaving device for those prone to severe allergic reactions, has been marred by a controversial surge in pricing that ignited heated debates in 2016. From its humble beginnings in 1961, when founders Milan “Mike” Puskar and Don Panoz sold medical supplies from the trunk of a car, Mylan evolved into a pharmaceutical giant, a status cemented by its 2007 acquisition of the EpiPen from Merck KGaA. Originally developed for military use and FDA-approved in 1987, the EpiPen became a pivotal part of Mylan’s portfolio, peaking at 200 million in revenue prior to the acquisition. However, Mylan’s aggressive marketing strategies and broadening of the EpiPen’s target market, combined with sharp price hikes—a 500% increase over seven years—raised profound ethical and economic questions. While the device’s indispensability for an estimated 3.6 million Americans at risk of anaphylaxis is undeniable, the pricing saga surfaced underlying tensions within pharmaceutical governance and the societal responsibility of healthcare entities. This essay will delve into whether the EpiPen’s pricing by Mylan, leading up to and during the 2016 furor, was ethically and economically justifiable, consistently threading back to the ethical stance and market conditions that may or may not vindicate Mylan’s actions. Mylan’s Ethos: Probing the Mission and Vision Mylan mission is “doing what’s right is sacred to us.” Such a mantra implies a promise that goes beyond mere compliance with laws or industry norms—Mylan’s self-declared ethical high ground suggests that its conduct, even beyond public scrutiny, would prioritize purity of products, the safety of workers, and environmental stewardship. Mylan envisioned itself as a guardian of public health, creating a network where life-saving treatments such as the EpiPen would be ubiquitous in homes and schools. Their marketing and lobbying efforts following the EpiPen acquisition, geared toward raising awareness of allergy risks and ensuring the device’s widespread availability, seemed well-aligned with this vision. The company’s leadership, particularly CEO Heather Bresch, eloquently articulated a corporate social responsibility (CSR) narrative that professed a holistic consideration of stakeholders—patients, customers, employees, and investors alike were ostensibly at the forefront of Mylan’s decision-making processes.In the following segments of this essay, we will reconcile Mylan’s self-professed principles with its pricing strategy, examining the tensions that arise when corporate profitability intersects with a purportedly steadfast ethical compass. How Mylan’s mission and vision translated into their pricing model for the EpiPen will form a critical part of this ethical and economic assessment. From an ethical and economic standpoint, the reasons behind Mylan’s significant increase in the price of EpiPens—which surged from around 50 per pen in 2007 to a list price of approximately 600 for a two-pack in 2016—invite critical examination. Economically, while higher prices typically correlate with increased company profits, suspect in Mylan’s case is whether the monopolistic pricing was necessary or justifiable given the actual production and distribution costs. Additionally, the ethical implications of a life-saving medication becoming less accessible to those in need puts the adequacy of such a pricing model into question. Mylan’s monopolistic standing was supported in part by the FDA’s regulatory environment, which indirectly contributed to Mylan’s control over the EpiPen market. Between rejecting potential competitors and adhering to stringent approval processes, the FDA played a role in fortifying Mylan’s market position. The lack of competition in the US, contrasted with Europe’s eight EpiPen producers, illustrated the disparity between an open market and a monopolized one. Yet, the level of profitability remains the central concern; Mylan’s CEO Heather Bresch presented to Congress a profit figure for a two-pack of EpiPens around 100, a number later contested and revealed to underrepresent true profits by as much as 60% when tax rates were appropriately calibrated. By classifying the EpiPen as generic rather than as a brand-name product, Mylan avoided paying higher rebates, a maneuver that contributed to its ability to maintain artificially high margins at the expense of a government program designed to aid low-income families. Economic profiteering at this level suggests a clear departure from Mylan’s original mission of ensuring affordable access to medicine. Increased scrutiny revealed that Mylan’s profit on each EpiPen was significantly understated in their testimonies before Congress. When taking into account Mylan’s actual overall tax rate of 7.4% in 2015 instead of the 37.5% statutory corporate tax rate presented, the profit per two-pack of EpiPens was closer to 166, not the 100 initially claimed. The increase in price made the company surge from 200 million to 1.2 billion in worth from 2007 to 2016, proving economically adequate from a profit perspective, although ethically, Mylan exploited its monopolistic status for profits, something inalienably wrong and for which they had to pay 465 million in legal recompense. Ethically, the pricing actions of Mylan conflicted with the company’s own stated mission to prioritize people over profits. Economically, while Mylan indeed profited from its monopolistic stance, the adequacy of such profits comes into question when one considers the impact on affordability and access to essential medication. Crisis Management: The EpiPen pricing scandal tested Mylan’s crisis management proficiency profoundly, yielding significant damage to the company’s image. Effective crisis management underscores the importance of transparency, communication, speed, and control, aspects that Mylan seemingly neglected, as evidenced by the series of events that unfolded. Transparency was starkly absent in Mylan’s crisis management. When grilled by Congress in September 2016, Mylan presented conflicting profit figures, initially claiming a 100 profit for a two-pack of EpiPens, only for a later report by The Wall Street Journal to reveal profits were closer to 166 after accurate tax considerations – underscoring a stark 60% disparity. These conflicting accounts led to skepticism about the company’s transparency and integrity. Mylan’s communication strategy during the EpiPen crisis also faltered, evident in the minimal disclosure on social channels and lackluster explanations for the price hike, which jumped from approximately continue 50 per EpiPen in 2007 to around 600 for a two-pack by 2016. As the crisis ensued, Mylan’s reaction was belated and predominantly observed through a series of defensive press releases on PRNewswire. The first, on August 25, 2016, promoted CEO Heather Bresch’s television interview and existing assistance programs, while another on August 29 announced a forthcoming 300 generic EpiPen. These post communications meant to quell discontent, came well after public outrage had gained momentum, signifying Mylan’s misstep in not promptly and proactively addressing the crisis. The speed of Mylan’s engagement with the public did not meet the necessities of effective crisis management. As the scandal regarding the price increases of the EpiPen unfolded and public scrutiny escalated, Mylan’s responses were deemed too slow to stave off criticism and forestall the reputational harm. This sluggish reaction failed to demonstrate the agile and decisive crisis management needed to exert control over the evolving narrative. Contingency planning was evidently inadequate. As Mylan faced backlash culminating in their questionable handling of the heated Congressional hearing, their strategies did not seem to account for the risks and safety concerns inherent in such a highly regulated market. Such a reactive stance indicates a lack of foresight in anticipating the crisis, a departure from best practices in contingency planning which demands meticulous preparations for potential scenarios. The ramifications of the crisis on Mylan’s public image and corporate governance were severe. The adverse public response included widespread outrage on Twitter, the creation of Facebook pages calling for the CEO’s dismissal, and a petition that garnered over 50,000 signatures demanding action against Mylan’s monopoly. A sentiment analysis using Crimson Hexagon during the peak of the crisis showed that about 26% of social media sentiment was basic negative, with approximately 75% of all negative emotions expressed ranging from anger to fear. Additionally, Mylan’s third-quarter reports on November 9, 2016, revealed a loss of continue 119.8 million, a stark contrast to the 428.6 million profit of the same quarter the previous year, indicative of the financial strain the scandal had inflicted. The EpiPen pricing scandal and its aftermath illustrate Mylan’s shortcomings in crisis management and the profound impact such crises can have on a corporation’s image and financial health. Mylan’s handling of the scandal damaged the trust of stakeholders, fueled public demand for policy changes, and reinforced the notion that companies in the healthcare industry must be prepared to manage crises effectively or suffer considerable consequences. The lesson is clear: companies must have robust crisis management frameworks and contingency plans in place to respond swiftly, transparently, and ethically when facing public scrutiny. 465 million settlement Mylan agreed to pay to the U.S. Department of Justice in October 2016 for overcharging Medicaid due to misclassification of EpiPen as a generic product, represented not only a direct financial cost but also a reputational blow that could affect future earnings and stock performance.

While Mylan’s actions demonstrate a clear pursuit of economic gain, reflected in the substantial revenue growth from EpiPen sales, the ethical justifications for such a pricing strategy remain elusive. The company’s own mission statement, suggesting a dedication to accessibility and affordability, stands in stark contrast to the reality of increased costs that placed a financial burden on patients and healthcare systems alike. The significant repercussions experienced by Mylan—ranging from public outcry and plummeting stock prices to legal settlements and Congressional hearings—underscore the tangible consequences of prioritizing profit over ethical considerations. Shareholders, although beneficiaries of initial financial gains, ultimately faced a crisis that jeopardized both the value of their investments and the integrity of a company they supported. This prompts a broader reflection on the role of pharmaceutical companies in guaranteeing access to essential medications, and the importance of aligning business practices with ethical standards that foster trust and ensure the wellbeing of all stakeholders. The EpiPen scandal serves as a critical case study, reminding corporations that ethical lapses can have profound economic effects and that transparency, communication, and responsiveness are key components of effective crisis management. Moving forward, it becomes imperative for companies like Mylan to strike a balance between profitable operations and moral obligations, ensuring that strategies devised within boardrooms do not undermine the societal trust and health outcomes upon which their long-term success is ultimately built. This equilibrium is not only essential for sustaining shareholder confidence but also for upholding the foundational principles upon which companies like Mylan claim to stand."},{"prompt":"Make it a one paragraph conclusion","completion":"In conclusion, Mylan's EpiPen pricing controversy vividly illustrates the complex interplay between economic profitability and ethical responsibility. Despite the economic rationale that might justify Mylan's pursuit of increased revenues, the excessive price hikes of a critical medical device defy the ethical commitments the company professed, leading to widespread criticism and substantial reputational damage. The repercussions for shareholders, who initially benefited from profitability but were later confronted with a devaluation of their investments, highlight the profound risks associated with corporate strategies that overlook ethical considerations. The case ultimately serves as a sobering reminder that long-term success in the pharmaceutical industry is contingent upon a delicate balance between financial objectives and the imperative to ensure fair and broad access to life-saving medications, upholding both public trust and the health of the market."},{"prompt":"Try to make this essay better and more cohesive, while adding a conclusionIntroduction: Mylan N.V.'s history with the EpiPen, an essential lifesaving device for those prone to severe allergic reactions, has been marred by a controversial surge in pricing that ignited heated debates in 2016.

Once championed for its innovative drug delivery systems, Mylan's reputation suffered when it raised the price of EpiPens by 500% over seven years. These actions precipitated public outcry and regulatory backlashes that questioned not just the economics behind such a decision but its ethical implications for a company whose beginning as a supplier from a car trunk belied its eventual status as a behemoth within the pharmaceutical industry. The core inquiry of this essay is to unpack the legitimacy of Mylan's pricing strategy for the EpiPen in light of ethical standards and economic validation. Mylan’s Ethos: Probing the Mission and Vision Mylan has vocally committed to a mission of \\"doing what’s right,\\" championing principles such as purity, safety, and environmental stewardship. This ethos ostensibly underpinned its growth strategy, including marketing campaigns to underscore the risk of allergies and ensure EpiPens' availability, aligning with the company's vision. However, Mylan's strategic choices, particularly under CEO Heather Bresch, reveal a tension between its public CSR pledges and its decision to inflate the EpiPen's price point significantly. The disparity between Mylan's proclaimed values and its actions is at the heart of the ethical dilemma that ensued. Monopolistic Opportunity: Economically, increased profits often accompany monopolistic pricing, though in the case of Mylan, such gains must be weighed against the moral cost of restricting access to a potentially life-saving treatment. The FDA's regulatory climate contributed inadvertently to Mylan’s dominance over the EpiPen market, paving the way for Mylan's unchecked price hikes. Scrutiny during congressional hearings revealed practices, including Mylan's misclassification of the EpiPen as a generic, designed to exploit this controlled market for profit—which starkly contradicted the company’s mission to maintain affordability. Crisis Management: Mylan's handling of the ensuing crisis displayed significant deficits in key areas of crisis management: transparency, communication, speed, and preparedness. Mylan's delayed and defensive responses undercut the company’s credibility. A mismanaged public engagement strategy and rushed contingency measures underscored a failure in crisis foresight and agility, culminating in reputational damage, reduced shareholder value, and a loss of public trust. The fallout was magnified by widespread negative sentiment on social media and fiscal strains evidenced by a significant drop in Mylan's stock value and workforce reductions. Shareholder Perspective: Shareholders were not shielded from the crisis's repercussions. The immediate financial devaluation and questions of ethical practice presented a conundrum of reconciling the pursuit of profit with corporate responsibility. The controversy laid bare the intrinsic conflicts between short-term gains and the need for a sustainable and positive market presence. Mylan's difficult path forward involved regaining trust and re-establishing a shareholder value proposition rooted in ethical and sound economic practices. Conclusion: The ethical and economic evaluation of Mylan's EpiPen pricing strategies reveals a company that strayed from its mission to serve with integrity. The escalated price points positioned Mylan at the crossroads of immense profit and severe ethical transgression, ultimately forcing the company to reckon with the societal and fiscal consequences of its actions. This case study illustrates the necessity for pharmaceutical corporations to balance profitability with genuine ethical commitments. For Mylan, the quest for redemption lies in a return to foundational principles and alignment of business strategies with core values that consider the broader implications for stakeholders. This recalibration is not only central to re-establishing shareholder trust but also vital for the company's long-term viability in an industry where the well-being of patients must always be a priority."},{"prompt":"USe the facts for the shareholder paragraph and connect it to the thesis, then make a conclusion that says how adequate its price increase has been ethically and economically","completion":"Introduction: Mylan N.V.'s aggressive pricing strategy for the EpiPen has sparked intense debates over the ethics and economics of pharmaceutical pricing. Once a small operation from a car's trunk, Mylan acquired the EpiPen in 2007 and transformed into a pharmaceutical titan. The company's 500% price hike over seven years came with ethical backlash, presenting a complex interplay between corporate profitability and societal obligations. This essay examines the justification for Mylan's EpiPen pricing, with a lens on both ethical integrity and market dynamics. Mylan’s Ethos: Probing the Mission and Vision Mylan's ethos of \\"doing what’s right\\" suggests a corporate culture rooted in ethical practices, yet the jarring EpiPen price increase raises questions about the authenticity of this stance. A strategy focused on market dominance and risk awareness is at odds with the affordable access to medicine Mylan claims to champion. The company's subsequent actions, examined through the lens of the crisis it faced, provide insight into how Mylan's proclaimed values align with its market conduct. Monopolistic Opportunity: The considerable price escalation of EpiPens by Mylan invites skepticism regarding the necessity of such a monopolistic approach. Regulatory practices by the FDA inadvertently granted Mylan a near monopoly, which the company capitalized on, much to the detriment of accessibility—a stark contradiction to Mylan's mission statement. Congressional testimonies revealed Mylan’s substantial underreporting of profits, a strategy that further perpetuates the notion of unethical corporate conduct and monopolistic abuse. Crisis Management: The examination of Mylan's crisis management revealed significant shortcomings, particularly in transparency, timeliness, and control. Mylan's responses were not only sluggish but also defensively oriented, compromising the company's reputation and undermining stakeholder confidence essential for sustainable corporate success. Shareholder Perspective: The EpiPen scandal delivered a serious blow to Mylan's shareholders. As stock prices dropped by 25% from August to December 2016, the immediate financial impact became evident. Shareholders, whose interests lie in both financial returns and the company's reputation, encountered a moral predicament where profit motives were at odds with ethical business conduct. This ethical and financial dichotomy showcases the intrinsic conflict within shareholder interests, emphasizing the delicate balance between pursuing profitability and upholding a company's long-term integrity on the market. Conclusion: In assessing the adequacy of Mylan's EpiPen pricing, one must conclude that, economically, the company achieved short-term profitability at the expense of ethical considerations. Such gains, however, were ephemeral as legal challenges and settlements, such as the 465 million payment to the Department of Justice, illustrated the tangible consequences of prioritizing revenues over moral obligations. Moreover, the damage to Mylan’s reputation and the erosion of shareholder trust suggest that from an ethical standpoint, the price increase was wholly inadequate, breaching the company's duty to balance stakeholder interests rightfully. Economically, while Mylan's valuation increased substantially due to EpiPen sales, the subsequent fallout implicates an unsustainable business model that undermines long-term shareholder value. In essence, Mylan's EpiPen pricing saga serves as a cautionary tale of the pitfalls when corporate greed overrides communal health needs and moral responsibility."},{"prompt":"make a profound conclusion for this essay and connect it to the prompt: To what extent has the exorbitant price of Epi-pens been ethically and economically adequate?

Yet, the level of profitability remains the central concern; Mylan’s CEO Heather Bresch presented to Congress a profit figure for a two-pack of EpiPens around 100 when she stood trial in 2016, a number later contested and revealed to underrepresent true profits by as much as 60% when tax rates were appropriately calibrated. By classifying the EpiPen as generic rather than as a brand-name product, Mylan avoided paying higher rebates, a maneuver that contributed to its ability to maintain artificially high margins at the expense of a government program designed to aid low-income families. These lies and economic loopholing suggest a clear departure from Mylan’s original mission of ensuring affordable access to medicine. Increased scrutiny revealed that Mylan’s profit on each EpiPen was significantly understated in their testimonies before Congress. When taking into account Mylan’s actual overall tax rate of 7.4% in 2015 instead of the 37.5% statutory corporate tax rate presented, the profit per two-pack of EpiPens was closer to 166, not the 100 initially claimed. The price increase made the company surge from 200 million to 1.2 billion in worth from 2007 to 2016, proving it economically adequate from a profit perspective. Ethically, Mylan exploited its monopolistic status for profits while endangering prone people who couldn’t afford the drug. The massive dividends they had to pay (465 million in legal recompense) demonstrate how they breached their previous altruistic Vision and Mission. Ethically, the pricing actions of Mylan conflicted with the company’s own stated mission to prioritize people over profits. Economically, while Mylan indeed profited from its monopolistic stance, the adequacy of such profits comes into question when one considers the impact on affordability and access to essential medication. Crisis Management: To further evaluate if the surge in prices was adequate for the company, Mylan’s response to the crisis will be scrutinized for its impact to the company’s image and value.The EpiPen pricing scandal tested Mylan’s crisis management proficiency profoundly, yielding significant damage to the company’s image. Effective crisis management underscores the importance of transparency, communication, speed, and control, aspects that Mylan seemingly neglected, as evidenced by the series of events that unfolded. Transparency was starkly absent in Mylan’s crisis management. When grilled by Congress in September 2016, Mylan presented conflicting profit figures, initially claiming a 100 profit for a two-pack of EpiPens, only for a later report by The Wall Street Journal to reveal profits were closer to 166 after accurate tax considerations – underscoring a stark 60% disparity. These conflicting accounts led to skepticism about the company’s transparency and integrity. Mylan’s communication strategy during the EpiPen crisis also faltered, evident in the minimal disclosure on social channels and lackluster explanations for the price hike, which jumped from approximately 50 per EpiPen in 2007 to around 600 for a two-pack by 2016. As the crisis ensued, Mylan’s reaction was belated and predominantly observed through a series of defensive press releases on PRNewswire. The first, on August 25, 2016, promoted CEO Heather Bresch’s television interview and existing assistance programs, while another on August 29 announced a forthcoming 300 generic EpiPen. These post communications meant to quell discontent, came well after public outrage had gained momentum, signifying Mylan’s misstep in not promptly and proactively addressing the crisis. The speed of Mylan’s engagement with the public did not meet the necessities of effective crisis management. As the scandal regarding the price increases of the EpiPen unfolded and public scrutiny escalated, Mylan’s responses were deemed too slow to stave off criticism and forestall the reputational harm. This sluggish reaction failed to demonstrate the agile and decisive crisis management needed to exert control over the evolving narrative. Contingency planning was inadequate. As Mylan faced backlash culminating in their questionable handling of the heated Congressional hearing, their strategies did not seem to account for the risks and safety concerns inherent in such a highly regulated market. Such a reactive stance indicates a lack of foresight in anticipating the crisis, a departure from best practices in contingency planning which demands meticulous preparations for potential scenarios. The ramifications of the crisis on Mylan’s public image and corporate governance were severe. The adverse public response included widespread outrage on Twitter, the creation of Facebook pages calling for the CEO’s dismissal, and a petition that garnered over 50,000 signatures demanding action against Mylan’s monopoly. A sentiment analysis using Crimson Hexagon during the peak of the crisis showed that about 26% of social media sentiment was basic negative, with approximately 75% of all negative emotions expressed ranging from anger to fear. Additionally, Mylan’s third-quarter reports on November 9, 2016, revealed a loss of 119.8 million, a stark contrast to the 428.6 million profit of the same quarter the previous year, indicative of the financial strain the scandal had inflicted. The EpiPen pricing scandal and its aftermath illustrate Mylan’s shortcomings in crisis management and the profound impact such crises can have on a corporation’s image and financial health. Mylan’s handling of the scandal damaged the trust of stakeholders, and fueled public demand for policy changes, and reinforced the notion that companies in the healthcare industry must be prepared to manage crises effectively or suffer considerable consequences. Shareholder perspective: The crisis was a major hit for the shareholders, from the employees to the major shareholders. On December 7, 2016, Mylan announced a plan to restructure and cut less than 10% of its global workforce as it integrates its acquisitions and on December 6, 2016, Mylan’s shares had fallen by 25% since the crisis broke in August. It’s important to note that shareholder interests are complex and often intertwined with ethical considerations. While shareholders may seek financial gains, they also have a vested interest in the stability and long-term reputation of the company. The EpiPen scandal, thus, presented shareholders with a dual dilemma: the immediate financial losses due to stock devaluation and the challenge of reconciling profit-seeking behavior with ethical business practices. The shareholder conflict in the case of Mylan reveals a struggle between short-term profitability and the long-term sustainability of the company’s public image and market position. In this context, strategies such as ‘pay-for-delay’ and exclusive school contracting, while initially seeming to align with shareholder interests for higher returns, ultimately proved risky and unsustainable practices that threatened shareholder value.

To what extent the exorbitant price of EpiPens has been ethically and economically adequate remains a contentious issue. Economically, the substantial increase in the EpiPen's price from 50 to approximately 600 per two-pack contributed to a surge in Mylan's worth from 200 million to 1.2 billion between 2007 and 2016. This phenomenal growth, however, came under intense scrutiny due to Mylan’s monopolistic approach, a stark contradiction with its mission of affordable access to medicine. The concealment of actual profit margins and taking advantage of regulatory classifications to sidestep rebates spotlighted a blatant disregard for ethical norms in the pursuit of profitable outcomes. From a shareholder's perspective, the initial monetary gains were quickly overshadowed by the precipitous stock price fall of 25%, diminished public trust, and the looming shadow of legal ramifications. The EpiPen scandal proved that short-term profit-seeking strategies that compromise ethical principles are unsustainable and ultimately detrimental to shareholder value. The culmination of these events showcases a definitive inflection point for Mylan—highlighting the necessity for business strategies that uphold ethical responsibilities while fostering economic growth. Therefore, the extent of the EpiPen's price being justifiable, when weighed against the scales of ethical and economic adequacy, tilts unfavorably. Mylan’s trajectory through the EpiPen saga stands as a reminder that corporate conduct, unchecked by ethical considerations, is bound to encounter resistance not just from market forces but also from the very fabric of societal expectations. It underscores the imperative for Mylan and similar entities within the pharmaceutical industry to institute measures that prioritize patient welfare and operate within the bounds of ethical capitalism. For Mylan, the path to redemption lies in re-establishing trust through transparency, equitable pricing, and a recommitment to the communities it serves—a lesson that extends beyond one company to the healthcare industry at large."},{"prompt":"COLOUR BAND","completion":"A colour band is a band or strip of colour that is used to indicate or represent something. It is commonly used in various fields such as electronics, resistors, and identification. In electronics, colour bands are used on resistors to indicate their resistance value. Each colour represents a specific digit or value, and by reading the sequence of colours, one can determine the resistance of the resistor. For example, a resistor with the colour bands of brown, black, red, and gold would indicate a resistance value of 10,000 ohms or 10 kilohms, with the gold band representing the tolerance of the resistor. Colour bands are also used in identification, such as in wristbands or badges. Different colours may be used to indicate different groups or categories, making it easy to recognize and differentiate individuals or items. Overall, colour bands serve as a visual tool to convey information quickly and efficiently, allowing for easy identification and understanding."},{"prompt":"COLOUR BAND RESISTOR","completion":"A color band resistor is a type of resistor that uses a series of color bands to indicate its resistance value. These resistors are commonly used in electronic circuits to control the flow of electric current. The color bands on a resistor represent specific digits or values according to a standard color code. The number of color bands on a resistor can vary, but most commonly, there are four or five bands. The color bands typically have specific positions and meanings. The first two bands represent the significant digits of the resistance value, the third band represents the multiplier or power of 10, and the fourth band (if present) represents the tolerance or the acceptable range of the resistor. The tolerance band indicates how much the actual resistance of the resistor can deviate from the indicated value. Each color corresponds to a specific value, and by reading the sequence of colors, you can determine the resistance of the resistor. For example, a resistor with the color bands brown, black, red, and gold represents a resistance of 1,000 ohms or 1 kilohm with a tolerance of 5%. The brown band represents the digit 1, the black band represents the digit 0, the red band represents a multiplier of 100, and the gold band represents a tolerance of ±5%. The color code for resistors is standardized to ensure consistency and ease of identification. By following the color code, engineers and technicians can quickly determine the value and tolerance of a resistor without the need for complex measurements or calculations."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This tensor allows for the description of electromagnetic fields in a way that is consistent with the theory of special relativity. The electromagnetic field tensor is a rank-2 antisymmetric tensor, defined in a four-dimensional spacetime with coordinates ( x^mu = (ct, vec{x}) = (ct, x, y, z) ), where ( c ) is the speed of light. In terms of the electric field ( vec{E} ) and the magnetic field ( vec{B} ), the components of ( F^{munu} ) are given by: [ F^{munu} = left(begin{array}{cccc} 0 & -E_x/c & -E_y/c & -E_z/c E_x/c & 0 & -B_z & B_y E_y/c & B_z & 0 & -B_x E_z/c & -B_y & B_x & 0 end{array}right) ] The motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field can be described by the Lorentz force equation. In the language of special relativity, the Lorentz force is expressed in terms of the electromagnetic field tensor and the four-velocity of the particle ( u^mu = gamma(c, vec{v}) ), where ( vec{v} ) is the particle's velocity and ( gamma ) is the Lorentz factor ( gamma = 1/sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} ). The relativistic version of the Lorentz force equation is given by: [ frac{dp^mu}{dtau} = q F^{munu} u_nu ] where ( p^mu ) is the four-momentum of the particle, ( tau ) is its proper time, and ( q ) is its charge. This equation gives us the rate of change of the particle's four-momentum relative to its proper time due to the electromagnetic forces acting on it. Since the four-momentum includes both the energy and momentum of the particle, this equation allows us to determine the particle's trajectory through spacetime. For practical computations of trajectories, one would generally: 1. Express the electric and magnetic fields in the region of interest, and construct the electromagnetic field tensor ( F^{munu} ) accordingly. 2. Integrate the Lorentz force equation to find the evolution of the four-momentum over time. 3. Translate the change in four-momentum into changes in the particle's velocity and position, thus obtaining the trajectory. These steps typically require numerical methods, especially for complex field configurations or when the particle's motion becomes highly relativistic. Numerical integration techniques, such as the Runge-Kutta method, may be used to solve the differential equation and track the particle's motion through space and time."},{"prompt":"15 позиций разливного пива и около 50 крафта в бутылках и банках.

Тогда малышка в одном из гродненских магазинов среди всего новогоднего декора увидела плюшевого тигра. Каждый день Николь вместе с родителями приходила, чтобы обнять и поздороваться с полосатым красавцем. «Эта была настоящая дружба», – вспоминают родители и признаются, что думали, как выкупить тигра для своей дочери после того, как новогодний декор демонтировали. Спустя год история повторилась. Но, к сожалению, в этом году среди наряженной ёлки, подарков, мишуры и шаров маленькая гродненка Николь не увидела своего тигра. Слёзы и разочарование девочки увидела работница магазина. И дальше…. Дальше случилось настоящее новогоднее чудо. Обязательно прочитайте эту добрую историю со счастливым концом. — В 2021 году, как обычно в преддверии новогодних праздников, магазин был украшен, и одним из элементов декора являлся Тигруля, — начинает свой рассказ Катерина, мама Николь. — Дочка сразу обратила на него внимание, хотела погладить, обнять. И каждый наш поход в магазин сопровождался ритуалом: поздороваться с игрушкой, пообщаться, попрощаться. Уже тогда мы понимали, что праздники закончатся и его уберут. Мы поинтересовались у сотрудника магазина, можем ли мы выкупить его? Но нам ответили, что он часть декора и вообще личная собственность…. Тогда родители Николь пообещали, что Тигруля в следующем году обязательно снова вернётся в магазин. — Мы вообще не думали, что она его запомнит, всё же ребёнку полтора года! — признаётся Катя. Спустя год в магазине накануне новогодних праздников семья из Гродно вновь увидела ту самую плюшевую игрушку. — Николь схватила его и её словами: «Я так скучала!» Уже тогда это было невероятно мило, — рассказывает Катерина. — В прошлом году мы не старались его выкупить, просто традиционно играли с ним в магазине. В какой-то момент я даже подумала, что, если бы мы его купили год назад, не было бы этого милого момента… Но в этом году, когда магазин празднично нарядили, тигра среди украшений уже не было… — Николь долго рассматривала декор, перевёрнутого снеговика, повозку с оленями. И везде искала тигра…Я, судорожно пробежав глазами декорации, поняла, что его нет. Дочка расстроилась и начала спрашивать, где её Тигруля… Весь наш диалог услышала Завотделом Наталья Щербакова и сказала, что в этом году тигр остался дома. Взгляд Николь потускнел, а глаза наполнились слезами. Я вкратце рассказала женщине историю их дружбы. Сотрудница магазина предложила его принести, погладить и попрощаться, так как в этом году он уже не будет украшать магазин, — рассказывает Катерина. — Николь бежала со всех ног, когда увидела Тигрулю. Я рассказала ей историю, что он побежит жить в новый дом, что он будет очень скучать. Она крепкого его обнимала, но всё поняла, и мы оставили его, там, где договорились с Натальей. Зайдя за угол, Николь говорит мне: «Мама, давай посмотрим, как его заберут». Я сама еле сдерживала слезы от осознания, как уже выросла моя доченька, от этой безусловной любви через года и, конечно, от небезразличия сотрудницы магазина к нашей истории. Своей трогательной историей Катерина поделилась в своём блоге Инстаграм. И сразу же получила обратную связь от своих друзей. — Мне писали, что плачут и ждут happy end, кто-то предлагал выкупить. А наш известный в Гродно кондитер Юля Базина лично звонила руководителю пресс-центра торговой сети, просила содействия в решении вопроса. Ещё одна моя знакомая Юлия Лавцель, вокалист нашего города, писала в аккаунт магазина, делая репост и многое другое! А потом мне в личные сообщения пишет девушка, что знает женщину с видео. Я вновь просила поблагодарить её, что она не осталась равнодушной и вынесла Тигрулю, но я даже не догадывалась, что именно она является владелицей тигра. И спустя пару минут я получила сообщение: «Здравствуйте, я хозяйка этой игрушки (тигр). Это я его вам вчера вынесла. Можем встретиться? Я вам его подарю». Уже вечером Николь ждал тот самый полосатый долгожданный друг. Открыв двери квартиры, девочка увидела своего Тигрулю. А её мама рассказала ей добрую волшебную легенду: — Я рассказала, что он запрыгнул в мою машину, когда я ехала возле магазина, и попросил разрешения жить у Никольки дома. Мне кажется, она не верила до конца, так как постоянно спрашивала вечером: «А когда он уйдёт? А завтра, когда я проснусь, он будет ещё здесь?». Мы её заверили, что теперь Тигруля остаётся жить с нами навсегда. Тогда Николь говорит: «Как же хорошо! Ведь малыш скучал по маме!» и достаёт в это время из коробки игрушек маленького тигренка и кладёт его в лапки Тигруле.","completion":"🐯✨ Настоящие новогодние чудеса случаются! ✨🐯 Расскажу вам потрясающую историю, которая разогреет ваши сердца и наполнит вас волшебством. Вот уже два года назад эта история началась для маленькой гродненки Николь и её родителей. В магазине среди всего новогоднего декора девочка увидела плюшевого тигра. Это была любовь с первого взгляда! Каждый день Николь приходила в магазин, чтобы обнять и поздороваться с этим полосатым красавцем. Они стали настоящими друзьями, но когда новогодний декор убрали, родители думали, как выкупить тигра для своей дочери. Следующий год пролетел, и опять наступили праздники. Но, к сожалению, тигра уже не было среди новогодней украшенной елки. Слёзы и разочарование девочки заметила работница магазина. И тогда произошло невероятное! В этом году магазин по-прежнему украшенно готовился к праздникам, и одним из элементов декора был Тигруля. И опять Николь сразу же узнала своего друга! Но, когда они пришли в магазин с родителями, они обнаружили, что тигра больше нет среди украшений. Девочка расстроилась и начала искать его везде. Родители обратились к сотруднице магазина, чтобы узнать, что случилось с их другом. И ответ, который они услышали, просто ошеломил их. Оказывается, тигр остался дома в этом году! И всё это благодаря заботе и вниманию сотрудницы магазина, Натальи Щербаковой. Она предложила, чтобы девочка пришла в магазин, чтобы ещё раз увидеть и попрощаться с Тигрулей, потому что в этом году он уже не будет украшать магазин. Для того чтобы сделать этот момент ещё особеннее, сотрудница магазина взяла на себя ответственность за Тигрулю и вынесла его из-под украшенной елки. Николь была полна радости, когда увидела своего друга! Она обняла его крепко, и родители рассказали ей, что тигр будет жить в новом доме. Девочка с пониманием отпустила Тигрулю, зная, что он будет скучать и будет ждать её. Эта трогательная история была поделена мамой Николь, Катериной, в её блоге Инстаграм. И она сразу же стала популярной среди её друзей. Люди писали ей сообщения о том, что они плачут и ждут счастливого конца. Одна из её знакомых даже связалась с руководителем магазина, чтобы помочь в решении этого вопроса. Но самое интересное случилось после этого. Хозяйка игрушки, сама женщина, о которой рассказывала Катерина, связалась с ней. Она предложила встретиться и подарить Тигрулю дочке. Конечно, они согласились! В тот вечер Николь ждала своего любимого друга. Открыв двери квартиры, она увидела его, и это было настоящее счастье!

Согласно этому методу, мы вводим функцию Лагранжа: ( L(x, y, lambda) = f(x, y) - lambda (g(x, y)) = xy - lambda (x + y - 1) ) где ( lambda ) — множитель Лагранжа. Далее находим частные производные функции ( L ) по каждой переменной и приравниваем их к нулю: 1) ( frac{partial L}{partial x} = y - lambda = 0 ) 2) ( frac{partial L}{partial y} = x - lambda = 0 ) 3) ( frac{partial L}{partial lambda} = -(x + y - 1) = 0 ) Решая эту систему уравнений, получаем: Из уравнения (3) имеем ( x + y = 1 ). Из уравнений (1) и (2) ( y = lambda ) и ( x = lambda ), следовательно ( x = y ). Подставим ( x = y ) в уравнение ( x + y = 1 ): ( 2x = 1 ) Отсюда получаем ( x = frac{1}{2} ). Так как ( x = y ), то ( y = frac{1}{2} ) также. Таким образом, точка ( left( frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2} right) ) является кандидатом на точку локального экстремума функции ( f(x, y) = xy ) при ограничении ( g(x, y) = x + y - 1 = 0 ). Для того чтобы установить, является ли эта точка точкой локального максимума или минимума, нужно рассмотреть вторые производные или применить какой-либо другой критерий. Однако в контексте данной задачи мы обычно предполагаем, что это локальный экстремум, так как это единственная точка пересечения нашего ограничения ( g(x, y) = x + y - 1 = 0 ), и на практике мы часто видим, что это будет точкой максимума или минимума для заданной функции при заданных ограничениях.

While some see it as a potential game-changer for global connectivity and development, others raise concerns about debt sustainability, geopolitical influence, and environmental issues. Here are some key points highlighting the foreign media's perspectives on the OBOR initiative: 1. Positive Outlook: - Some media outlets view the OBOR initiative as a positive move towards improving global trade and connectivity. They highlight the potential economic benefits, such as increased trade opportunities, infrastructure development, and job creation. - Many developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe have shown enthusiasm for OBOR, considering it a chance to upgrade their infrastructure and attract foreign investment. - The initiative has been commended for its focus on enhancing connectivity, fostering people-to-people exchanges, and promoting cross-cultural understanding. 2. Debt Concerns: - One of the major criticisms raised by foreign media is the risk of debt sustainability. Critics argue that the scale and speed of infrastructure investments associated with OBOR can burden developing nations with hefty loans they may struggle to repay. - Some media outlets highlight cases where countries have faced difficulties in paying off their debt associated with Chinese-funded projects. - Concerns have been raised about the potential for economic dependence on China if countries become unable to repay loans. 3. Geopolitical Dynamics: - There is a prevalent view regarding China's geopolitical objectives behind the OBOR initiative. Media often discusses China's intent to expand its influence geographically and enhance its role as a global power. - Critics raise concerns about the impact of the initiative on the existing balance of power among nations. Some argue that it could enable China to exert control over strategically important areas and shape regional alliances. - Media outlets also discuss how OBOR may challenge the United States' influence in certain regions, creating potential geopolitical tensions. 4. Environmental Concerns: - Some foreign media outlets raise concerns about the environmental impact associated with the OBOR initiative. They highlight potential threats to ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change due to massive infrastructure development, including roads, bridges, and dams. - Reports indicate that certain projects have ignored environmental regulations and resulted in negative consequences, such as deforestation and pollution. 5. Transparency and Governance: - OBOR has faced criticism over transparency issues and perceptions of corruption. Foreign media highlights concerns of limited transparency in project bidding processes, lack of involvement of local communities, and weak governance standards. - Media outlets often discuss the need for more transparent decision-making processes, greater accountability, and the inclusion of local stakeholders. It's important to note that opinions vary across different media sources, as interpretations of the OBOR initiative depend on geopolitical, economic, and cultural perspectives."},{"prompt":"• 事務管理に関するソースのフォルダ整理の続き","completion":"前回の続きを説明します。 事務管理に関するソースのフォルダ整理では、以下のようなフォルダ構造を作成することをおすすめします。 1. メインフォルダ (例: \\"Office Management\\") -

The exact cause of the \\"Watchdog_timer_3_strike_error\\" can vary depending on the specific system, software, or context in which it occurs. Some possible causes may include: 1. Software or system malfunction: If there is a bug, glitch, or error in the software or system code, it may cause the watchdog timer to fail to reset properly, leading to the error. 2. Hardware failure: Issues with hardware components, such as a faulty processor, memory, or clock signals, can also trigger the watchdog timer error. 3. Overloaded or overwhelmed system: If the system is under heavy load or stressed, it may not be able to reset the watchdog timer on time, causing the error. 4. Environmental factors: External factors like extreme temperatures or power fluctuations can interfere with the proper functioning of the system, leading to watchdog timer errors. To resolve the \\"Watchdog_timer_3_strike_error,\\" it is recommended to check for software updates, ensure proper cooling and power supply, inspect hardware components for any signs of damage or malfunction, and consider seeking assistance from technical support or professionals if the error persists."},{"prompt":"correct email Hi Team, We got an invitation from IPS Intelligent solutions authorised channel partner for Xtrutech GmbH for plastivision expo (Global conference for plastic industry – A dive into business opportunities).

Sounds of a distant steam train whistle, followed by chuffing and puffing as the train approaches. The platform is sparsely populated with a few eccentric characters pacing back and forth. Characters: - Neddie Seagoon (Our \\"hero\\", hopelessly bumbling) - Eccles (Lovable, but dim-witted sidekick) - Moriarty (Dastardly and poverty-stricken) - Grytpype-Thynne (Scheming and snide) - Major Bloodnok (Retired military, explosive temper) - Minnie Bannister (Quaint old lady, friend of Henry Crun) - Henry Crun (Eccentric old man, friend of Minnie Bannister) - The Ghastly Gripper (Mysterious ticket inspector) Act I: The Discovery Neddie: \\"Eccles, why have we been standing on this platform for six hours?\\" Eccles: \\"I thought we were waiting for the train.\\" Neddie: \\"But the train’s come and gone five times!\\" Eccles: (pause) \\"Did it?\\" Enter The Ghastly Gripper suddenly, a shadowy figure cloaked in a heavy greatcoat, wielding an antiquated hole punch like a sceptre. His eyes gleam with a spectral light as he approaches our unwitting duo. Ghastly Gripper: \\"Tickets, please...\\" A chilling wind blows through the station as the Gripper seems to float towards them. Act II: The Gripping Tale Seagoon and Eccles learn from Major Bloodnok that The Ghastly Gripper is rumored to be the vengeful spirit of a ticket inspector who fell onto the tracks in 1899, chasing a fare-evader, only to be crushed by the oncoming Dining Express, thereby mingling his spirit forever with the railway. Moriarty overhears this juicy tidbit and schemes with Grytpype-Thynne to exploit the tale by convincing the town that The Ghastly Gripper will excuse any outstanding debts in exchange for a mysterious 'Golden Ticket.' Act III: The Hunt for the Golden Ticket Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister, bewitched by the promise of forgiven debts, craft a plan to stage an elaborate performance and summon The Ghastly Gripper to demand the Golden Ticket. Henry, disguised as a sultry siren of the rails, allures Eccles into a grand piano crate, which launches them both onto the tracks just as the ghostly train approaches, heralding the arrival of The Ghastly Gripper. Act IV: The Gripper's Grasp Neddie stumbles upon the truth that the 'Golden Ticket' is, in fact, a mere legend created by a tight-fisted railway magnate to inspire more punctual payment. With the help of the unwitting Eccles - who somehow found the right notes to play on the grand piano to summon a herd of commuter cows to barrel down the tracks - reveal Grytpype-Thynne and Moriarty's duplicitous plot to fleece the town. In the nick of time, Neddie uses a cunning ruse involving a counterfeit Golden Ticket to draw out The Ghastly Gripper, only to reveal him as nothing more than a disgruntled, very-much-alive, former ticket inspector named Herbert Noakes who missed his retirement due to an administrative error. Final Act: The Farewell The villagers, grateful to Neddie Seagoon and his hapless friend Eccles, hold a raucous celebration in their honor. The real Ghastly Gripper is laid to rest with a proper tribute of a lifetime railway pass (posthumously awarded, of course), and peace returns to Greenham End... until the next improbable adventure! FX: (Rousing horn fanfare followed by railway steam whistles.) Seagoon: \\"And so, dear listeners, remember: when traveling by train, keep a firm grip on your tickets, for you never know when The Ghastly Gripper might make his round!\\" FX: (Curtain call music and applause) CAST: Announcer: “And so ends another thrilling tale of the unexpected from The Goon Show! Tune in next week for yet another shattering narrative that'll grip your... seats. This is the BBC, home of the British Gooncast Corporation!” The specific dialogue would be infused with the surreal humor, bizarre sound effects, and absurd situations characteristic of the Goon Show, with plenty of comedic misunderstandings, non-sequiturs, and wordplay. This pitched episode remains true to the Goon Show's penchant for mixing supernatural elements with everyday peculiarities, all wrapped up in a delightfully nonsensical plot."},{"prompt":"Nice, writing. Given its the Goon Show, there might be some paraodic pastiches to \\"The Ghost Train.\\" ?","completion":"Absolutely, since \\"The Ghost Train\\" by Arnold Ridley is an archetypal ghost story based around a railway station and is a part of the cultural backdrop of the era, a Goon Show episode would likely rife with parodic references to this work. The \\"Goon-esque\\" take on the concept could inject the peculiar humor of the show into the suspenseful framework of \\"The Ghost Train.\\" Act I would open similar to before but with Neddie investigating the legend of a ghost train after hearing shrieks and spooky train whistles from the comfort of his railway carriage. Act II: After a slew of nonsensical delays and station announcements that hint at otherworldly interferences—like prompts to beware of the \\"ghosts in the buffet car\\" or platform changes that require interdimensional travel—Neddie and Eccles are set to spend the night at the station. Scene: Inside the dim waiting room with eerie organ music playing faintly in the background. Neddie: “Eccles, did you hear that bloodcurdling scream?” Eccles: “Yeah! Sounded like someone stepped on a packet of crisps!” The paranormal occurrences begin to mirror those of \\"The Ghost Train,\\" but with a Goonish twist—spectral locomotives sound their horns to the tune of popular music hall numbers, while the apparitions that haunt the platform consistently miss their train cues. Act III: As fears grow, Major Bloodnok, in a state of explosive panic, would recount the grim history of an ill-fated midnight express, only for Grytpype-Thynne to enter as a pseudo-psychic con-artist, leading a séance to communicate with the ghostly conductor, who complains about the afterlife’s poor working conditions and demands overdue wages. Scene: The waiting room has been transformed into a ghoulish séance circle, with Grytpype-Thynne, adorned with a turban and a ludicrously fake beard, hovering his hands over a crystal ball. Grytpype-Thynne: “Oh, spirits of the departed, your attendance is requested at platform...oh drat, where's the timetable?” Act IV: The Ghastly Gripper, gleefully playing into his role as the spectral antagonist, would take Neddie Seagoon and Eccles on a humorous \\"haunted\\" chase around the station, only for them to trip over a curry house delivery bike, uncovering the 'frightful' noises as a combination of a snoring commuter and steam from a pressure cooker. Final Act: As with the original pitch, the episode would culminate in the revelation that The Ghastly Gripper and the ghostly occurrences were indeed orchestrated – a mix of mistaken identity, coincidental accidents, and clever sound effects created by Minnie Bannister practicing her theremin for an upcoming talent show. Scene: The station is bathed in morning light; the once eerie environment is now shown to be the result of comically mundane happenings. Seagoon: “So, the Ghastly Gripper wasn't a ghost at all! Ha ha ha! And what of the eerie sounds, Moriarty?” Moriarty: *(coughs)* “I confess—it was me! I can't resist a theremin solo...” Cast Closer: As the cast takes their comedic bows, the sound of a train approaching reverberates once again, leaving the audience with a not-so-subtle nudge toward the supernatural to cap off the spoof. Announcer: “True or not, dear listeners, the ghost train may yet ride again through Greenham End. But fear not, for the Goons are sure to be on the next hilarious, haunted hijinks. Mind the ghoul—I mean, gap!” The program would finish with the trademark Goon Show sign-off, bringing the episode to a close with a hearty balance of laughter and a loving jab at the ghostly tropes of the time."},{"prompt":"Another Hypothetical Goon Show setup would be the \\"The overdone Mortar Haggis caper!\\", complete with a few bagpipe jokes ;)","completion":"Title: \\"The Overdone Mortar Haggis Caper!\\" Opening Scene: Fade in to the rolling hills of Scotland, with the distant sound of bagpipes playing. The air is filled with the aroma of peat fires and... something slightly more curious. Characters: - Neddie Seagoon (Our indefatigable \\"hero\\") - Eccles (The simple-minded, lovable fool) - Moriarty (A French scoundrel with a wild moustache) - Grytpype-Thynne (The suave mastermind) - Bluebottle (Enterprising boy scout, ready for adventure) - Major Bloodnok (Brash and bombastic with a penchant for explosions) - The Laird of McGoon (The proud Scottish landowner, with a dire haggis problem) Act I: The Highland Howl Neddie Seagoon, wearing a kilt and sporran that leaves the Scottish winds rather drafty, meets with the Laird of McGoon, who implores him to resolve the mystery of the overdone haggis that threatens the sanctity of their annual Highland Games. Laird of McGoon: \\"Ach, Neddie! 'Tis a disaster! The haggis for the Games, they’ve turned hard as a caber tosser's bicep! Ye must find the culprit!\\" Neddie: \\"Fear not, Laird! I shall solve this overly cooked conundrum!\\" Act II: The Bagpipe Clue Eccles, acting on behalf of Neddie, attempts to follow the sounds of the bagpipes, believing that the source of the music will lead them to the source of the heat. Eccles: \\"Listen, Neddie! The pipes! They're playing a tune called 'Ye Burnt My Haggis!'\\" Neddie: \\"A clue, Eccles! Onward... But why do you have that strange look on your face?\\" Eccles: \\"I swallowed one of those drone thingies.\\" The duo tracks the overcooked haggis epidemic across the Highlands using an oversized magnifying glass, only to be temporarily sidetracked by the allure of a piping-hot deep-fried pizza. Act III: The Mortar Mishap They stumble upon Moriarty and Grytpype-Thynne operating a black market for reinforced haggis, now in high demand as both a foodstuff and building material due to its mortar-like resilience. Moriarty: *(with Scottish inflection)* \\"Aye, we've cornered the market on hard haggis, right, Grytpype?\\" Grytpype-Thynne: \\"Quite right. We're building an entire castle from overdone haggis. Gun turret to go, please!\\" Act IV: The Bagpipe Breakthrough Bluebottle stumbles upon the operation, mistaking the fortified haggis for rare geological specimens. Bluebottle: \\"Eh? I'll earn a science badge for discovering the Haggisaurus Rock. I'll be careful not to touch anything marked 'explosive'...\\" Major Bloodnok appears in kilted glory, followed by an accidental discharge of his military-issued bagpipes that double as a bazooka, blowing a hole in the haggis pile and revealing the sabotage: a mischievous clan of wild haggises with miniature welding torches. Bloodnok: \\"There's nothing worse than a wild haggis with a blowtorch, Neddie! It's like Burns Night gone ablaze!\\" Final Act: The Piping Down Neddie, with the aid of a fleet of trained highland terriers and Bloodnok's bagpipe bazooka, corrals the renegade haggises and uncovers Grytpype and Moriarty’s plot to corner Scotland's building supplies. Grytpype and Moriarty are chased off into the distance, to the tune of a triumphant bagpipe medley played by none other than the reconciled haggises, revealing a talent that eclipses their welding skills. Scene: The Highlands are restored to peace, the haggis appropriately squishy once more, and the Highland Games commence with Eccles competing for the title of 'Haggis Hurling Champion.' Announcer: \\"And so, the Highlands are saved by Seagoon and the Goons, the haggis free to juggle rather than to join the masonry trade!\\" The episode would wrap up with traditional Goon Show absurdity, punctuated by the skirl of bagpipes and the characters' reflections on Scotland's newly minted heroes, with a running gag about Neddie's unfortunate kilting mishaps. CAST: Announcer: “Tune in next week for another Goon Show, where the scripts are tighter than Neddie’s kilt and the laughs as plentiful as Eccles’ misunderstandings!” As the curtain falls, listeners would be treated to the strains of an outrageously off-key bagpipe rendition of \\"Goodnight Sweetheart,\\" fading out as the cast joins in with mock-Scottish warbles."},{"prompt":"\\"The Final Ascent of Wimbledon Common\\" (In the early 50's the conquest of Everest would still be a memory. Sellers also later did a Travelouge spoof called \\"Balham-Gateway to the South!\\" ...)","completion":"Title: \\"The Final Ascent of Wimbledon Common!\\" Opening Scene: We open on a blustery day on Wimbledon Common, with the sound of the wind gusting and the distant bark of a solitary dog. Neddie Seagoon, dressed for Himalayan adventure in thick parkas, goggles and carrying an ice pick, stands before a small molehill, mistaking it for a mountain due to his frozen goggles. Characters: - Neddie Seagoon (Our \\"mountaineering\\" protagonist) - Eccles (Cherubic, cheerful, and a few sandwiches short of a picnic) - Moriarty (The conniving French villain) - Grytpype-Thynne (The sophisticated scam artist) - Major Bloodnok (The gassy military man with vertigo) - Bluebottle (The fearless boy scout perpetually unaware of his impending doom) - Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister (Elderly eccentrics and \\"mountain guides\\") Act I: The Molehill Montage Neddie proclaims his intention to conquer the world-famous 'Wombellian Alps' as eccentric retirees Crun and Bannister approach, posing as seasoned sherpas ready to guide him up the treacherous terrain of what is clearly a modest hill. Henry Crun: \\"Yes, young man, Minnie and I have scaled the mighty molehill of Wimbledon Common every fortnight since '39. Right, Minnie?\\" Minnie Bannister: \\"Oh, yes, Crun. But I lost my sherpa-snood somewhere on that beastly bunny slope!\\" Act II: The Confounded Climb Eccles, having been hired as the expedition's pack mule, struggles with his load: an assortment of unnecessary equipment, including a stuffed yeti lent by Major Bloodnok for \\"authenticity\\". Eccles: \\"Here's where I put me foot, and here's where I put me other foot, and... Hey! Who took the Common?\\" Neddie: \\"It's beneath you, Eccles.\\" Eccles: \\"Yeah, I know that, but where is it?\\" Act III: Fictitious Frostbite Seagoon's party encounters Moriarty and Grytpype-Thynne running a make-shift supply shack teetering atop the molehill, peddling fur-lined oxygen tanks and spiked Wellington boots for the climb. Grytpype-Thynne: \\"Stock up here for your final push, gentlemen! We're having a special on 'Eau de Yeti', bottled directly from the source–of the Thames.\\" A muffled Bluebottle bursts out of a nearby tent, nearly trampled by a line-dance of 'yetis' (Major Bloodnok's regiment in costume)—a devious decoy planned by our resident rogues to bilk climbers out of their tuppence. Act IV: The Summit Suspense Amid falling fake snow (courtesy of Bloodnok's defective snow machine), Neddie battles a sudden onset of altitude silliness, believing himself to be dangling over precipitous cliffs, only to be calmed by Eccles’ timely offering of his 'emergency custard'. Neddie: \\"Eccles! I see the peak! Onward!\\" Eccles: \\"No, that's a seagull, Neddie.\\" The pesky Grytpype and Moriarty attempt to saw off the 'summit' with Neddie on it, to claim the 'first ascent' for themselves, only to fall victim to their own plan as a rogue seesaw sends them catapulting into the nearby pond. Final Act: The Dubious Descent With the Wimbledon Common 'peak' conquered, a grand flag-planting ceremony takes place as Neddie proudly claims the 'summit' for... the local garden club. Neddie: \\"I hereby name this peak... Molehill Monty!\\" Bluebottle, unhinged from his yeti suit, bursts forth and gives an overeager salute, causing the ‘mountain’ to deflate with the escape of a mole, revealing the true height of their folly. Announcer: “And so the heights of heroism are scaled on Wimbledon Common with our valiant Goons conquering the unconquerable Molehill Monty!” CAST: Announcer: “Join us next week when our Goons might just discover another geographic faux pas to challenge their indomitable spirit. For now, it’s over and...out?” Bombastic fanfare plays ironically against the backdrop of the very flat Wimbledon Common, complete with the distant but unmistakable echo of a mole whistling victoriously."},{"prompt":"\\"The Stone Scone caper\\".

A voiceover, in the style of a pulpy radio thriller, shrouds the beginning of our tale in mystery. Voiceover: \\"In an age of intrigue and pastries, one man stands against the encroaching shadow of a baked goods blunder most foul...\\" Characters: - Sherlock Seagoon (Our intrepid sleuth, clad in deerstalker and magnifying monocle) - Doctor Eccles (Seagoon’s unshakably daft companion) - Moriarty (The Napoleon of crime—has a penchant for pilfered pastries) - Grytpype-Thynne (The upper-crust conspirator) - Major Dennis Bloodnok (A military man with an insatiable appetite for scones) - Miss Minnie Bannister (The elderly jam and cream keeper) - Constable Bluebottle (The ever-eager bobby on the beat) Act I: Dastardly Deeds at Dawn Sherlock Seagoon is roused by the hurried rappings of Constable Bluebottle at the door of 221B Baker Street, bearing news that threatens the very foundation of the upcoming coronation tea—The Stone of Scone has vanished, replaced deftly with a cleverly disguised stone scone! Bluebottle: \\"Mr. Seagoon, sir! The Stone of Scone—it’s... it’s gone, sir!\\" Seagoon: \\"Gone? Impossible! That scone had enough fruit in it to feed the Household Guard!\\" Act II: The Quest for the Crumbs Doctor Eccles, with a magnifying glass, traces a trail of currants and pastry flakes across London’s cobblestone streets, stopping only to munch on what he believes to be ‘wayward evidence.’ Eccles: \\"Sherlock, I've solved it!\\" Seagoon: \\"You have?\\" Eccles: “Yes! The trail ends here... because I ate it. It was delicious!” Act III: Scone Subterfuge Infiltrating a high society tea party by disguising themselves as aristocratic ornithologists, Sherlock Seagoon and Doctor Eccles eavesdrop on Moriarty and Grytpype-Thynne’s hushed conspiracy. The villainous duo plots to serve the stone scone to a foreign dignitary, igniting a scandal that would rock the Empire! Grytpype-Thynne: \\"Imagine, Moriarty, the diplomatic debacle when the Duke of Dithering breaks his royal tooth on our rocky replica!\\" Act IV: The Culinary Conundrum At Buckingham Palace, in the midst of a frenzy to find a fitting substitute, Miss Minnie Bannister confesses that her secret recipe magically turns stone scones soft when sung to—yet she's lost her voice from hollering for Henery. Seagoon: \\"We must find a songstress to serenade the scone at once, or all will be crumb—er, I mean, lost!\\" Act V: A Tonic for the Tea With minutes to spare, Sherlock Seagoon locates a retired opera diva who bats her eyelashes at Major Bloodnok. Her powerful voice causes the stone scone to quake, revealing the true Stone of Scone hidden within its flaky depths! Seagoon: \\"A-ha! It was a scone within a scone! The double bluff!\\" Moriarty: (crying out) \\"Curses! Foiled by fat and flour!\\" Final Act: Tea-Time Triumph The coronation tea is back on track, with Sherlock Seagoon earning the gratitude of the Crown and a lifetime supply of jam and clotted cream. As the dignitaries nibble on properly prepared pastries, the jubilant sound of \\"Rule Britannia\\" transitions into a medley of hysterical hiccups—courtesy of Major Bloodnok overindulging once again. Announcer: “And so the case of the Stone Scone Caper crumbles to a close, with Sherlock Seagoon and his ever-so-slightly edible sidekick saving the coronation and the crust of England!” CAST: Announcer: “Join us next week for another round of Seagoon-shenanigans—but for now, keep calm and scone on! This is the BBC, broadcasting a recipe for relief, mirth, and a spot of tea. Pip-pip!” Muffled bagpipe music plays us out, interspersed with giggling from Eccles, who remains oblivious to the crime but deeply aware of the leftover scones."},{"prompt":"\\"The Naffi Saucers affair\\" - Seagoon has to respond to reports of Unidentified Frying objects, in a RAF stations canteen.

Below stands Eccles, the only one unconcerned and casually flipping an unsuspicious pancake. Bloodnok: \\"Seagoon, you must act! The saucers—they're out of this world!\\" Seagoon: \\"Major, this is no time to hang about! Eccles, report!\\" Eccles: \\"Yok-yok, I just saw a flying saucer!\\" Seagoon: \\"Where?!\\" Eccles: \\"There it goes again!\\" (Sounds of a pancake flipping) Act II: The Supplier's Scheme Moriarty, capitalizing on the canteen’s paranoia, slinks in offering an exclusive contract for “anti-UFO” kitchenware as catering staff Private Bannister and Corporal Crun flutter around trying to swat away the so-called 'alien invaders' with soup ladles. Moriarty: \\"Step right up for your UFO-proof frying pans—guaranteed to deflect any and all radar signals!\\" Crun: \\"Do they come in medium-size, young man?\\" Act III: The Boy Scout's Blunder Bluebottle, equipped with binoculars and a sketchpad, attempts to gather evidence. However, his \\"unearthly observations\\" only record the continuous sight of Eccles's backside as he bends over to retrieve dropped batter. Bluebottle: \\"Eek! The alien is moonscaped and has googly eyes!\\" Act IV: The Plot Thickens Grytpype-Thynne, in a bid to sell sensationalist stories to the press, orchestrates a grand spectacle using hubcaps and strategic lighting, plunging the canteen into a mock extraterrestrial invasion, complete with eerie 'space music' blasting from a gramophone. Grytpype-Thynne: \\"Now watch as the NAAFI becomes the first victim of the impending saucer occupation!\\" Act V: The Great Revelation Seagoon, having recruited the help of Eccles and his oddly non-stick frying pan, discovers the root cause of the disturbances: a mischievous band of misfit pigeons playing in the grease traps, their shiny plumage reflecting light and casting saucer-like shadows. Grytpype-Thynne and Moriarty's plots crumble with the pigeons' coos heard as testimony. Seagoon: \\"Gentlemen, we’ve been invaded—not by creatures from space, but from the aviary realm! And there's the culprit—Eccles' pancake toss!\\" Final Act: Canteen Calm Restored With the real \\"saucers\\" identified and the canteen cleared of feathery troublemakers, Seagoon heroically reinstates peace, encouraging homing pigeons as the latest recruits for RAF message delivery. Major Bloodnok, relieved, descends from his bulbous haven, though his descent is rather ungracious due to a well-placed frying pan.

The ecosystem consists of a river, which is modeled as a relatively large list. Each element of the list should be a Bear object, a Fish object, or None. In each time step, based on a random process, each animal either attempts to move into an adjacent list location or stay where it is. If two animals of the same type are about to collide in the same cell, then they stay where they are, but they create a new instance of that type of animal, which is placed in a random empty (i.e., previously None) location in the list (if there is no empty location in the list, the newly generated animal will be discarded). If a bear and a fish collide, however, then the fish dies (i.e., it disappears). Write an initializer for the ecosystem class, the initializer should allow the user to assign the initial values of the river length, the number of fishes and the number of bears. Before the simulation, fishes and bears should be allocated randomly into the river. The ecosystem class should also contain a simulation() method, which will simulate the next N steps of the random moving process. N should be inputted by the user.

It is often used as a measure of the overall health and prosperity of a country. One of the primary benefits of economic growth is an increase in the standard of living for the population. As an economy grows, incomes tend to rise, allowing individuals and families to afford higher quality goods and services. This can lead to improvements in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which can further contribute to overall well-being. Economic growth also has positive effects on employment. As businesses expand and invest in new projects, they create job opportunities for the population. This can reduce unemployment rates and provide individuals with stable incomes, reducing poverty levels and promoting social stability. Furthermore, economic growth often leads to an expansion of the tax base, which can provide governments with increased revenue to invest in public services and infrastructure. This can lead to improved education systems, healthcare facilities, transportation networks, and other social services, benefiting the entire population. However, there are some potential drawbacks to consider. Rapid economic growth can sometimes result in negative externalities, such as pollution and environmental degradation. Expanding industries may increase carbon emissions, contribute to deforestation, or deplete natural resources. Additionally, economic growth can exacerbate income inequality if the benefits primarily accrue to a small portion of the population. Another concern is the sustainability of economic growth. If growth is driven primarily by unsustainable practices, such as excessive borrowing or overreliance on fossil fuels, it may lead to economic imbalances and eventual crises. For long-term economic stability, it is important for growth to be balanced, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable. Overall, economic growth is generally seen as a positive development for countries as it can improve living standards, reduce poverty, create job opportunities, and provide governments with the resources to invest in public services. However, policymakers should carefully consider the environmental and social implications of growth to ensure its sustainability and inclusivity in the long run."},{"prompt":"give me one exmaple of Needs and aspirations of consumers for amazon","completion":"One example of needs and aspirations of consumers for Amazon could be the need for convenience and quick delivery.

Step 2: Write the Laplace transform function as a product of two simpler fractions. Step 3: Apply the convolution theorem to compute the inverse Laplace transform. Let's go through each step in detail: Step 1: Factorize the denominator of the Laplace transform function. The denominator (s^2(s^2 + 4)) can be factorized as (s^2(s - 2i)(s + 2i)), where (i) represents the imaginary unit. Step 2: Write the Laplace transform function as a product of two simpler fractions. Now, we can express the Laplace transform function as: (frac{1}{s^2(s - 2i)(s + 2i)} = frac{A}{s} + frac{B}{s^2} + frac{C}{s - 2i} + frac{D}{s + 2i}), where (A), (B), (C), and (D) are constants that we need to determine. Step 3: Apply the convolution theorem to compute the inverse Laplace transform. To apply the convolution theorem, we need to find the inverse Laplace transforms of the terms on the right side of the equation above. Converting (frac{A}{s}) back to the time domain gives (A). Converting (frac{B}{s^2}) back to the time domain gives (Bt). Converting (frac{C}{s - 2i}) back to the time domain gives (Ce^{2it}) (assuming (C) is a complex constant). Converting (frac{D}{s + 2i}) back to the time domain gives (De^{-2it}) (assuming (D) is a complex constant). Finally, we can apply the property of linearity to add up the individual inverse Laplace transforms, resulting in the inverse Laplace transform of the original function. Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of (frac{1}{s^2(s^2 + 4)}) using the convolution theorem would be: (A + Bt + Ce^{2it} + De^{-2it}). Note that the specific values of (A), (B), (C), and (D) would need to be determined based on the original function and any initial or boundary conditions provided."},{"prompt":"evaluate invers laplace {1/s^2 (s^2 +4)} by use of the convolution theorem line by line","completion":"Sure! Let's evaluate the inverse Laplace transform of (frac{1}{s^2 (s^2 +4)}) using the convolution theorem line by line: Step 1: Factorize the denominator: (s^2 (s^2 + 4) = s^2 (s - 2i)(s + 2i)). Step 2: Write the Laplace transform function as a product of simpler fractions: (frac{1}{s^2 (s - 2i)(s + 2i)} = frac{A}{s} + frac{B}{s^2} + frac{C}{s - 2i} + frac{D}{s + 2i}). Now, let's find the values of the constants (A), (B), (C), and (D). To find (A), we multiply both sides of the equation by (s) and then set (s = 0): (1 = A(s - 2i)(s + 2i)). Plugging in (s = 0): (1 = A(-2i)(2i)). (1 = 4A). (A = frac{1}{4}). To find (B), we multiply both sides by (s^2) and then set (s = 0): (s = frac{B}{s}). Plugging in (s = 0): (0 = B). To find (C), we multiply both sides by ((s - 2i)) and then set (s = 2i): (1 = A(s + 2i)(s + 2i)). Plugging in (s = 2i): (1 = A(2i + 2i)(2i + 2i)). (1 = 16A). (A = frac{1}{16}). To find (D), we multiply both sides by ((s + 2i)) and then set (s = -2i): (1 = A(s - 2i)(s - 2i)). Plugging in (s = -2i): (1 = A(-2i - 2i)(-2i - 2i)). (1 = 16A). (A = frac{1}{16}). Step 3: Apply the convolution theorem to compute the inverse Laplace transform. The inverse Laplace transform of (frac{1}{s^2 (s^2 +4)}) is: (frac{1}{4} + 0t + frac{1}{16}e^{2it} + frac{1}{16}e^{-2it}). Simplifying further, we can write it as: (frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{16}(e^{2it} + e^{-2it})). Thus, the inverse Laplace transform of (frac{1}{s^2 (s^2 +4)}) using the convolution theorem is: (frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{16}(e^{2it} + e^{-2it}))."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},z={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],B={key:0},R={key:1};function O(n,e,l,m,o,r){const u=f("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",z,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(i(!0),a(b,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(i(),k(u,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
