concise summary of the main points presented in this text: &quot;good morning good day and good evening welcome back to the show today we have a returning guest welcome back to the show Li kivy how you doing hello I&#39;m doing great I&#39;m going to put you on the spot cuz you did do that uh that uh whole video in Japanese give us an intro in give give us just an intro off the top of your head in Japanese yes let&#39;s God just let&#39;s see how we go [Music] uh when when was our last I think like a year ago yeah about a year ago I reckon so I I it was two years ago I was wrong no wait no that first one was two years ago wait yeah yeah yeah okay first one was two years ago there was one after that a year ago jeez you you&#39;re on really early I completely forgot about that one yeah time flies it seems pretty long ago I understood about I&#39;m going to say about 75% of that and I I Hest it enough to follow along um but I have not put in as much effort as you have in uh learning Japanese well that&#39;s still pretty good are you still learning yeah yeah I I am still uh I know you did that the the most popular video on your channel is the DU lingo video I actually started going through du lingo and oh the it&#39;s it&#39;s a weird it&#39;s a weird app because there&#39;s a lot of things about it where I feel like it&#39;s it&#39;s perfectly fine for like picking up vocab but then it as it does some weird sentence structure especially when it&#39;s trying to get you to do the English version of a sentence where it&#39;s like why do you want it in this very specific form or one really annoying thing whenever it does names it will say like um if it&#39;s like panaka Ken it will then want you in the English version to do it the other way around it&#39;s like what are you doing it it&#39;ll like tell you you&#39;re wrong if you do it like in the way it doesn&#39;t expect you to do it yeah I haven&#39;t used dualingo for like a really long time now I haven&#39;t even really like checked it out because I know that it has changed so much since I used it like um I started using it like in it&#39;s quite early form and as I was using it it went through like two like three to four like extensions and Renovations but um like from my from what I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s like completely different now like they completely revamped the tree uh I haven&#39;t even seen anything so I I&#39;m not sure what what it&#39;s like now but yeah dualingo is one of those things that I can&#39;t believe that I used it for so long to be honest at this stage I don&#39;t know if like it&#39;s kind of one of these things like um it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like Rosetta Stone where people are sort of memd it into this this position where nobody actually has like a a proper opinion on it anymore like there&#39;s very few people like you who actually used it for like you know 800 plus days who actually formed a a proper opinion a lot of what people say about it is very much just repeating what other people have said yeah it&#39;s like um I like like I&#39;ve always said in my videos when it comes to language learning is that when you&#39;re a beginner or like um when you&#39;re you know not in the like 3,000 hour Club already um then it&#39;s like it really doesn&#39;t matter what you use because it most of the time most of it is going to be pretty much the same in the sense that you&#39;re going to get the base vocabulary some level of grammar and things like that it doesn&#39;t really matter what you use for that and about it being efficient or you know time efficient or whatever if you&#39;re talking about something that&#39;s going to take you like 100 to let&#39;s say even 500 hours in the grand scheme of things that is a really short amount of time in terms of what it actually takes to reach a high level of fluency in a language like um um well okay I think I used dualingo I don&#39;t know exactly and I don&#39;t remember exactly but I think it was like definitely under 200 hours in total even though I used it for 800 days like I had a stre streak of 800 days but like the 200 hours is such a small amount of time in compared to what I put into for example Anki which is almost like close to 2,000 hours for example as well as like immersion and things like that y y I think for me the most important thing and I&#39;m sure this applies to most other people finding something that you can actually do consistently like it&#39;s all well and good to say like you know an is really efficient and all of these things like really efficient but if you do it once and then you just don&#39;t ever get back to it you can&#39;t get yourself into a habit where you&#39;re doing it every single day it doesn&#39;t matter how good the resource actually is because you&#39;re not going to really learn anything from it yeah absolutely in the sense that the most important thing is consistency when it comes to uh for example learning a language because because learning a language at the end of the day is a cumulative skill in the sense that as long as you keep adding bricks to your you know house that you&#39;re building of the language then you are going to make progress but if you suddenly just stop adding those bricks so if you quit or don&#39;t use those tools then there&#39;s no point because you&#39;re not learning right yeah so it&#39;s good to use something like dualingo to establish um consistency if that&#39;s the way that you know if that&#39;s what works and you know eventually once you you know finished everything that that there there is in the tree and that you&#39;re confident that you can continue using other tools or just you know immersion and whatever consistently then that&#39;s totally fine I think yeah I let&#39;s see I I actually don&#39;t know how many um modules there are at this point let me just check um so at this stage there are six modules or six sections they call them and I&#39;m on the second one uh but I think it skipped me halfway through the first one like when you first started up it like gives you a language test like what did your level currently at and then it like jump you ahead yeah yeah I guess they started doing something like that cuz if I guess I I guess they realize like if you you know you know the the basics like you know a cou Kani you know like you know for example there&#39;s no point ring you herana if you already know it yeah I know I for me I I found it to be quite useful um cuz I was doing the whole like going over um going over vocab stuff but my issue was I couldn&#39;t find a I couldn&#39;t find a way that I consistently like dealt with grammar for whatever reason the resources I was I was dealing with just I couldn&#39;t find anything that clicked with me and I just I was getting the vocab down just fine but if you don&#39;t have the grammar to string it together like that&#39;s not entirely useful yeah Japanese grammar is interesting in the sense that um when I started learning I remember that I used dualingo for like since the beginning as the first thing that got me into learning Japanese then a few weeks weeks later I started using gki and the day Kims grammar guide or like the complete guide to Japanese or whatever that you can find online for free and but you know I learn I did understand like I did learn the basics from it you know like the particles and stuff like that but um most of the time I read through the book as well through the grammar guide but I didn&#39;t really like even though I read through those things I didn&#39;t you know they didn&#39;t particularly click with me or stay with me for the most part the only thing that you know the main benefit was that I knew some that I knew that something existed that might be in that book if I ever need to look it up in the future but truth is the truth is that I actually haven&#39;t looked up that many things like that many times as people might expect in the sense that even now I don&#39;t feel like my grammar is perfect but just over time through immersion and you know sentence Mining and stuff like that I&#39;m like I don&#39;t really worry about grammar anymore I feel like it it just naturally I naturally just started to understand it over time so you had sort of enough a foundation where you could understand the context things being used in and then sort of piece it together yeah pretty much and it&#39;s like um Japanese grammar is kind of like vocabulary in the end like uh if you have what&#39;s a good example for example when I try to like recall something like my mind goes completely blank in situations like this um so for example oh my god seriously I can&#39;t remember anything um for example NE like uh for example that grammar point I&#39;ll just write it down just in case it&#39;s like um it&#39;s a technically a grammar point but it it&#39;s essentially a word like you can look it up from the dictionary and you&#39;ll understand what it is but technically it&#39;s a grammar point but it acts just like a word in a way so it essentially means like um well it&#39;s hard to translate English but it&#39;s like uh in terms of that for example oh okay and just there&#39;s there&#39;s a ton of those and they are pretty easy to learn through context like um the only like true true grammar things in my opinion are things like conjugations and it&#39;s okay to I think memorize them but it&#39;s not super necessary like you Pro you can probably you know learn the T form and stuff like that pretty easily so um when when you want to do output early on though then it&#39;s definitely good to practice them I didn&#39;t and well I did a little bit through an anid deck but even now I mess up conjugation sometimes in my output but it has gotten better when I like actually started practicing output over time and I don&#39;t really worry about it like I&#39;m not going to bother with doing extra practice of like memorizing or like using conjugations because I&#39;m just going to use them so many times through output anyway naturally so over time it will fix themselves by itself that is one thing I think du linga does kind of do or it kind of helps me out with at least actually doing the output and I feel like for me that helps me piece other things together like it&#39;ll give you a sentence and then it like it makes it very clear on the loading screen like hey you should probably say this out loud and I would tend to like play around with whatever sentence it gives me as well like slot in other words try to like piece things together and I I feel like for me that&#39;s that&#39;s really helped me start like trying to really I I guess grasp it you know in a way that I just wasn&#39;t before like I I&#39;ve gone through some of the takim stuff as well and yeah when when I first read out a lot of the stuff like I I got some of like the the basic examples like I I I worked out how like w worked but then when it started to get like some of the more complex examples I&#39;m like I I I&#39;m sure the resources here are good but I it&#39;s just not clicking with me for some reason H like um like different um grammar points and stuff like that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I like I feel like it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t like it just doesn&#39;t click in the sense that um that&#39;s normal in the sense that like it&#39;s so hard to completely understand something that isn&#39;t you know entirely logical and that requires you know so much experience in the language like I feel like it&#39;s just something that people might worry too much over like um even when you get better Advanced there can be some level of vagueness in for example the difference between Thea and G article and that&#39;s fine in the sense that there is some specific Nuance to it but it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to approach it entirely logically in some languages grammar definitely works more like that in the sense that for example conjugations in Estonian and comma rules in Estonian but Japanese doesn&#39;t really have those like the comma stuff and uh rules like that like really strict rules so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely hard to approach it in the sense that you need to perfect the grammar before you can move on because you kind of can&#39;t is what I feel like you have to accept some level of like vagueness essentially I think that&#39;s a good way to put it yeah I think I think that might have been what I was my issue early on I wanted to make sure I like fully got it and then yeah I just I think because I was just bashing my head against the wall so much I just got bored with going through that method but H yeah no no I I I do agree there I think with with this having some sort of I think I&#39;d also probably do fairly well if I did classes as well because there&#39;s sort of a I guess a plan to go forward like if I&#39;m left with just the resources that are just out there I tend to just hyperfocus on a part until I fully get it and yeah it seems like that might not be the most effective way to go about it yeah like classes actually might have benefits like that in the sense that you have a test you learn that um you learn those Concepts in for the test in the sense that you you either pass or you don&#39;t you pass or you don&#39;t essentially but if you don&#39;t have a grade for example if you use Duolingo you don&#39;t really know if you pass or don&#39;t it&#39;s more like do I feel confident that I completely understand this or not but it&#39;s difficult to feel that confidence sometimes with with this language so with classes there is the you know progression is more like streamlined you know in a sense also I also logged into du lingo for the first time in like years and it&#39;s completely different like the tree and I suppose that&#39;s how far I currently have the tree unlocked so what that would I can&#39;t I guess it&#39;s section three unit 28 yeah okay like I&#39;m not sure how like um translated it is or like uh migrated it is from the old tree to this one but I guess I can scroll quite a lot before like I reached the point where it&#39;s like uh still locked I suppose also I think may maybe this is just my my gamer brain just having a leaderboard there also just makes me just keep going as well like yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of fun like people talk about like you&#39;ll see people criticize the idea of gamifying everything but for me at least like I will get to like 30 minutes before the um like the reset of the leader board and there will be someone who is just creeping up to the experience I&#39;ve got like no you were not taking my place I just do like a couple of extra lessons that I otherwise wouldn&#39;t have done that day and yeah in that way I think it it works pretty well for me it might not be the system that works for for everyone but I don&#39;t know at least at least for me and doing extra things outside of what like is just required like if you&#39;re just you know mindlessly filling in like in what it says maybe you won&#39;t get as much out of it um but if you&#39;re trying if you&#39;re trying to actually use as a resource and learn from it I think then at least as I said at least for me it&#39;s it&#39;s been it it&#39;s felt like a a positive learning experience yeah definitely like uh it can be fun like it&#39;s definitely less like it&#39;s something that you can build a habit with because it&#39;s like even if you it has like these small things that aren&#39;t necessarily a part of the language learning um you know Paradigm like the gamified approach and stuff like that and even though they&#39;re not necessary it&#39;s still like U whatever works essentially is how I view it uh by the way like do you have any idea how many words you might know or do you have like no data on that um I&#39;m not it it tells me how many words I&#39;ve gone through I&#39;d actually know if it gives you the number anywhere um I do remember remember that it used to like show something at one point probably does somewhere but goes uh no I wouldn&#39;t it also might be like only on the mobile app or something like that because I know I&#39;m on the mobile app right now oh okay I don&#39;t see it on the website either yeah may maybe they don&#39;t have the number not sure yeah I wouldn&#39;t be surprised they constantly add and remove stuff so um but yeah well my point what I wanted to say was like um have you ever tried like sentence mining yet well uh no I haven&#39;t messed around with that no well I suppose if you don&#39;t like using Anki then you can&#39;t really do sentence mining unless you like when I did it the first time I I didn&#39;t really enjoy it maybe now that I have more more context around how the words can be used maybe then I would have a different experience with it I&#39;m not sure yeah it&#39;s try possible because um using cards that you make yourself from your own immersion is quite a different experience than using pre-made cards I&#39;ll be honest like um it&#39;s difficult to do when you have a you know a like zero comprehension but when you have like some level of um knowledge in the language already then like let&#39;s say even minimum 1,000 words if you start using like really easy media for sentence mining I think it&#39;s a really really good way um a really good thing to try in the sense that in my opinion for increasing your comprehension I feel like sentence mining is by far the best thing that I&#39;ve ever done like um it&#39;s just it&#39;s just like before and after uh starting sentence running uh I felt like the the way my Japanese like started improving was just on a completely different level because you can learn the words in isolation and that will increase your comprehension like your Baseline and grammar stuff like that as well but when you start like sentence Mining and you know learning those words and grammar points in context uh first of all the anky reviews are going to be much easier you can learn more words in a much higher pace and it&#39;s like um you can keep track of your progress and stuff like that as well and I feel like there&#39;s just something about having the context and that helps um like increase your comprehension so much more and confidence in the language like that you understood what it meant because for example if you have a grammar point in a textbook or a word in an ony deck that has some random example sentence I feel like the issue is that you it might create more questions than it answers MH but when it&#39;s in a context for example some subtitle from an anime some word it&#39;s like okay in that anime in that context that&#39;s what it meant and you move on basically and there&#39;s like no additional worries or anything like that but the hardest part about sentence mining is getting started I think like once you understand how to do it then it&#39;s like extremely simple but I mean all it really takes is like uh you use eny you make a eny deck for your cards you make a and you just start watching something for example uh some anime you get Japanese subtitles for that anime and then you just uh when you don&#39;t find when you have a word that you don&#39;t understand then you just look it up for example with yomi Chan or you can also use migaku and stuff like that and then you just every word that you don&#39;t understand you just try to look up and add into Anki if you don&#39;t know it and I feel like that&#39;s extremely easy once you get it and I feel like it&#39;s extremely good for learning as well but it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not like the only way in the world but that&#39;s just my personal favorite way of like improving really will you mentioned um simple media and I&#39;m blanking on who it was now I I I want to say I want to say it was ladybeard who said that uh the way they learned Japanese was the Japanese dub of pepper pig yeah I&#39;ve heard I&#39;ve heard it before that people use Peppa Pig for learning languages and the funny thing is door the explor some one of these kids show where they constantly repeat a word and like and make it very clear exactly what they&#39;re talking about yeah but well like it&#39;s not necessary in the sense that there is like there can be Advanced you know media for like more you know adult audiences that isn&#39;t like super difficult in the sense that um you know media that doesn&#39;t have much dialogue for example uh things like that as well and there&#39;s also like jpd b. a website and you can recognize that one sort any and manga and stuff like that oh okay difficulty I haven&#39;t used it myself but like it might be really good for you know Finding content that might be fun to watch and easy as all essentially oh I was aware with this one for sence Mining and stuff like that um yeah I think it&#39;s a difficult a good way to find content let&#39;s let&#39;s not go of the galactic heroes that seems like a bad idea yeah that or like monog both seem like a really bad idea to go with the one problem with that site is though that the difficulty rating for example the 10 out of 10 or n out of 10 it&#39;s heavily biased towards the length of um the content in the sense that if it has a long length you can bet that it&#39;s going to be on the top essentially uhuh um essentially especially for like novels and stuff like that on that website but it&#39;s still fine especially the um one out of 10 difficulty stuff mhm but the funny thing is that speaking of like ch shows and stuff like that one of those is Ms you know I&#39;m not sure if you ever watched or heard about it um no I don&#39;t know that one I&#39;ll just paste like a a screenshot maybe you maybe you can recognize the character very possibly like this um it kind of rings a bell but I&#39;m not certain oh well it&#39;s like like a Finland Finnish Sweden um origin cartoon but it&#39;s like animated in Japan and it has well it&#39;s like an anime in Japan but it&#39;s like the origin is like from Finland and Sweden and like in in those areas like everybody knows them essentially especially here in Estonia and stuff like that but I tried watching it in Japanese and like already a long time ago and it&#39;s pretty watchable but the funny thing is that I watched some episodes again like after I reached 20,000 uny cards so like half a year ago or something and in like one or two episodes I encountered like 20 new words that I hadn&#39;t ever seen in my life which is like pretty funny because it&#39;s supposed to be like a children&#39;s show but still there were so many words that I didn&#39;t know but it&#39;s like it&#39;s like really specific things like um a specific way to call a river in Japanese or a specific way to call a boat in Japanese and stuff like that okay well I guess that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of the fun in in language learning like you&#39;re never going to know like you no matter how much you you learn the language you&#39;re never going to learn every single word like even even I am a native English speaker and every soften I will come across the word I&#39;m like what in the world do that what are you saying open up the dictionary like a I see just use a use a normal word please yeah it&#39;s like um and the words that are like more commonly used in like British English or like perhaps Australia and stuff like that but like not so commonly and in America and things like that yeah yeah yeah and and yeah it&#39;s like if you if you do sentence mining you are essentially the way the path you take to learning the language is going to be completely unique in the sense that um for example let&#39;s say you start off with some easy anime but suddenly you feel like watching berserk or something like that or like some um anime that&#39;s really using like medical vocabulary a lot and things like that it&#39;s like the vocabulary you build is going to be like completely personalized to yourself through the content that you watch which is pretty fun but I there would still be like you know General stuff it&#39;s just if you started watching um I know you start watching some yakaza anime that seems like a a good way to skew you the way you speak very quickly yeah it&#39;s uh you&#39;re most likely the fun thing is that even Yakuza stuff has like specific vocabulary for example I think Yakuza call normal people so like um people that that are not Yakuza is like katagi for example instead of you know just something like iin or something it&#39;s like uh the Yakuza world has like a specific vocabulary as well so there&#39;s like such a huge vast range range of vocabulary both in you know English but especially in Japanese as well that so it&#39;s like even if you reach a high number of you know words from sentence mining you&#39;re still going to have a bunch of words that you don&#39;t know which you know can sound really demotivating in a way overwhelming but it the the funny thing is that once you reach a certain point you completely stop caring about that anymore like there&#39;s nothing like for example the same way if you&#39;re a native in English I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t really care if you see see a word that you don&#39;t know yet like it&#39;s like whatever I&#39;ll just look it up when necessary yeah like uh it&#39;s going to be the same with foreign languages at one point once you like actually reach that point yeah once you have enough to understand once you have enough language knowledge to be able to use a dictionary uh then it becomes a lot easier to actually look up words yeah and it&#39;s like um at some point it&#39;s just it stop feels it stops feeling like a chore and it&#39;s just going to be more like you know just like okay there&#39;s a word I don&#39;t know I&#39;m just going to look it up there&#39;s not a big deal and it&#39;s it&#39;s totally fine like I personally like I said it&#39;s like I reached 20,000 words after like five years of learning like 2,000 hours of an and stuff like that but it&#39;s like I can still find words that I don&#39;t know from simple content and even though for some people it might sound like really depressing but personally I don&#39;t care at all like if if anything it&#39;s like almost exciting to see like holy [ __ ] there&#39;s like a new word in this really simple anime that&#39;s pretty cool I can you know learn even more essentially from such a simple piece of media M I don&#39;t know if I asked you the last two times you&#39;re on but why did you start learning Japanese I might have asked you but I don&#39;t remember it uh I&#39;m not sure if you did but it&#39;s it&#39;s quite simple in the sense that I was learning um Russian for fun essentially uh on my own for in like before learning Japanese MH and the most the furthest I got was like a 100 day streak on dualingo and then I lost it and then I stopped for a while and then I started learning again and then I started doing like Anki for Russian and I like did that for like a month and after that month I made a friend with a Japanese person and my other friend was learning Japanese for a while already um and I was like I want to try out learning a Asian language as well because it&#39;s like um I want to know how like kanji work and stuff like that it seemed like interesting essentially and because I made a Japanese friend I decided that okay I&#39;m going to try out you know learning a little bit of Japanese so I tried open the Japanese course on dualingo and essentially I&#39;m still learning to this stay from that point on yeah that&#39;s a simple enough story yeah it&#39;s like there&#39;s like no other specific reason that I started learning just out of curiosity essentially and T TS the language for the most part and then it just continued from there like all the things like anime and stuff like that came after that and I haven&#39;t watched much anime to be honest uh only like I think 32 or like 35 seasons in total mhm so if Jo has like I don&#39;t know like I don&#39;t know Five Seasons or something then that&#39;s like part of that 35 in that sense well I&#39;m happy that JoJo is part of that yeah yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting because most most people I would assume probably learn probably do it in the opposite order like you know they&#39;ll watch anime and then you know at some point they&#39;re like oh I&#39;m going to sit down and learn Japanese that yeah go on that definitely seems to be more common like um most of the agad people like all Japanese all the time which is like a learning method U that used to be really popular at one point which is like you learn well like the name says all Japanese all the time so you&#39;re constantly consuming Japanese content all the time and you try to avoid using other languages and a lot of people who were into that learning method were all like like hardcore weebs in the sense that um they watched a ton of anime before and now they were essentially now had a way to you know make it productive even by learning the language which is a great way to like you know um make watching anime productive at least convince yourself as productive yeah for funny funnily enough uh for me learning Japanese has been like the perfect excuse to like uh make anything productive essentially if I really want to so that in that sense it&#39;s a really fun skill MH to learn like watching whatever YouTube videos or you know anime or movies or stuff like that like you can even watch like I don&#39;t know let&#39;s say you want to watch Shrek or something but you don&#39;t want to waste time on it so you watch it in Japanese and sentence mining so now it&#39;s suddenly productive you know now I kind of want to go watch Shrek and Japanese I wait I wonder who hold up Shrek J I want to know who did the the voice for Shrek hold up let me see it&#39;s really good I watched it actually like I actually watched it it&#39;s really good like the voice is like it literally sounds like uh Eddie Murphy was Japanese for donkey at least masi ham why you don&#39;t really have that money roll did the voice of Sling in Pokémon okay sure what a random role what about Dy let&#39;s see okay um oh okay that&#39;s a lot bigger of a of a list uh wait the voice of Pikachu in detective Pikachu okay sure okay I&#39;m seeing some fun rolls on here I know I definitely want to go watch it I think uh Shrek was voiced by some uh Japanese comedian like some famous com like that exp that explains why he doesn&#39;t have many anime roles okay yeah probably okay but yeah it it was really like uh I was surprised it was like really good quality the do yeah that&#39;s that seems to often be the case with um with Japanese dubs thing I think it&#39;s because voice actors actually get you know paid whereas um in a lot of English dubs for things especially in anime uh from my understanding pay is not very good so when pay is not very good people tend to gravitate away from the field like you get a lot of good you know game English dubs and movie uh like voiceovers but when it comes to anime like the pays low so the quality tends to also uh follow in the same way yeah and there&#39;s also something like there there&#39;s like a specific um vibe that I suppose people want when it comes to English dobs or anime like they they all sound the same but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s on purpose because um like the same goes for Japanese stops for the most part like there are exceptions to it for example uh Shrek is a good example of like a proper like actual dub mhm but there are a ton of Japanese dobs which are essentially like for example documentaries or let&#39;s say something like Breaking Bad MH the dub sounds exactly like it was an anime so it feels like extremely unnatural and it&#39;s hard to watch and things like that um so yeah Japanese stops are like most of them can be really bad because um it&#39;s like Western content so they try to like well not not because it&#39;s Western content but it&#39;s like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a English dub and if it&#39;s just I mean it&#39;s an English show but if they dub it Japanese unless it&#39;s like a really high quality production then it&#39;s most likely going to sound like like anime and so it&#39;s going to be really unnatural like you&#39;re going to have like old characters are going to you know all sound like Goofy and speak in a certain way and stuff like that I instead of like acting like real people essentially I just looked up um I just looked up the uh Breaking Bad Japanese dub and yeah I I see why it sounds like anime um the voice for Walter it is just an anime voice actor yeah probably he he voices the same character and everything it&#39;s like gray old man like that&#39;s that&#39;s his that&#39;s his character type yeah like the a lot of dobs are exactly like that and it&#39;s like it it&#39;s really like you have if you want to have tops for like Japanese tops for Western content you you have to get lucky that it&#39;s not for like uh if it&#39;s something actually actually good well I guess part of it is that people have an expectation of like on what it&#39;s going to sound like like similar to how um you know you did the that video entirely in Japanese and you just did like the Japanese YouTuber voice yeah yeah um the thing is that even news in Japan for example if there&#39;s a news of a foreigner giving an interview or something like that even like in serious situations like uh for example you have news of uh Ukraine in Japan and interviews with the people living in Ukraine they are all going to sound like anime characters like like they&#39;re all going to have that if it&#39;s a female it&#39;s going to have like uh like uh they just all sound like anime characters because that&#39;s just how Western people are often or like uh Foreigner people are often doed in Japan huh it&#39;s like it&#39;s not like a negative thing in a sense like it&#39;s not like um they&#39;re trying to be like derogatory or anything against foreigners but it&#39;s like it&#39;s just a staple but I suppose some people like say that that it&#39;s disrespectful because all foreigners are going to sound like clowns essentially like it&#39;s going to give that uh subconscious vibe to a lot of people personally I don&#39;t care though no i&#39; I&#39;ve not sat down and watched any Japanese news I I didn&#39;t know that was a thing that happened but I guess like along with you know all the rest of the the dubbing that exists I guess it does make sense like it fits in with the way that voice acting is typically done so it would be it would be odd if that was like the one area where it didn&#39;t sound like that yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just like it&#39;s when when you have something like media like M anime or games or news I not news uh movies M then you expect it you expect there to be some kind of you know um it&#39;s not reality so you expect it to be kind of like that but when it comes to like news it&#39;s like real people that are interviewing like but even making them sound like anime characters is kind of like it you&#39;re not used to it when you see it for the first time but it&#39;s like it&#39;s such a staple that you get used to it over time when you watch Japanese content hm we&#39;ve uh probably scared away most people by this point uh I wasn&#39;t planning to turn this into a let&#39;s talk about Japanese for 40 minute episode um yeah I kind of didn&#39;t expect that myself as well but it&#39;s fine let&#39;s talk about uh let&#39;s talk about the other thing uh that you&#39;ve been doing so you have been uh messing around with Linux again yes um it&#39;s not the first time you&#39;ve done so no um I&#39;ve actually used l a lot in a way in the sense that um I don&#39;t remember exactly year by year but I already used Linux like um like not on my P like not like daily dried but I&#39;ve used Linux already like way back in like way back no it&#39;s not that long ago in like I remember using it in 2015 for example and I used I put it on my own laptop in like 2018 or something and I used it at work daily driving it at work for a really long time and I tried making a Linux challenge which I made into a video and I had some serious issues there in the sense that the thing that was the worst was that I couldn&#39;t use Discord in the sense that I couldn&#39;t use voice calls in Discord because my voice sounded like like unacceptably low quality essentially with the same mic I&#39;m using right now yeah I don&#39;t understand what what happened there cuz I this my yeah I I don&#39;t know how that happened I&#39;ve never heard of anyone else having that problem it seems like whenever anyone does a Linux challenge video like somehow extra problems just crop up that nobody else mentions yeah like when normies do Linux challenges they only they have problems for some reason uh but the issue was probably something to do with the mod boards like audio chip like alc what was it like that makes sense one two something something I think but that was most likely the cause and it had nothing to do with the Dr because I tried it on uh I tried it on multiple disos back then and then recently like just a few months ago I tried it again on Fedora on whatever else and it was exactly the same issue every single time with that Hardware probably some sort of wonky audio driver then I guess yeah most likely there&#39;s my I don&#39;t know if that matters or not but like is there a difference if like I&#39;m not sure if I okay it couldn&#39;t be um I don&#39;t know if back then it used pulse audio or pipe wire for the transmission uh when was that uh for example in 2020 what was it two um on Dora uh on Ubuntu I think no definitely pulse on Ubuntu back then I think Fedora might have swapped I can&#39;t on right now with the Fedora 39 I tried it with that as well and it had the same issue on that Hardware but like as I yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m not sure what that spoiler like with my current Hardware I don&#39;t have that issue though with the same mic hm um also I don&#39;t know if you saw my Macos video uh I probably watched it I did watch it actually it&#39;s yeah the bar&#39;s red um oh yeah I don&#39;t remember anything from it it was a long time ago that it came out yeah well yeah it was a really big video it was a 50 minute video and and I can like I to make it short mhhm it was like I put so much time into Mac to make it like usable for me uh I had so many issues with it because um one was usability which was you know um I just came to the I discovered that Mac OS by default so without any third party software is quite Limited in terms of what you can do in terms of window management yep yep um like some people say that so many people say that actually it&#39;s just that that using Mac OS like it was Windows or something like that which maybe is true in the beginning but now I know exactly how to use Mac OS and it&#39;s still limited it&#39;s like you can&#39;t use shortcuts to move Windows around for example and things like that like you can&#39;t resize windows or snap them into anything with shortcuts only for example uh natively unless you download third party applications so essentially in the end I downloaded um or I installed yabai which is a tiling Window Manager on Mac OS and essentially I started using Mac OS as if it were a tiling Window Manager based um setup essentially well it was m and I actually quite liked it in the end like the final setup I had was pretty good uh I would still use it happily every day but there were a few other issues as well with Mac OS that I had well still have I still have the computer but I just have uh I bu a different computer by now as well but um I just won&#39;t go too dep deep into it in this video because I made the video If people want to check it out and essentially the main issue I have is that if I&#39;m using Mac a Macbook I need to have two computers because I can&#39;t do everything on a MacBook because it does not support for for example 32bit applications even if they are native to Macos and I didn&#39;t know that when I actually bought the MacBook and sure I could live without 30 32bit applications um I actually use some like older games and stuff like that for recording footage for my videos sometimes and I would need to use a different computer for that even like emulators like uh parallels which is like a Windows emulator don&#39;t run certain software for example if I want to make a VR chat segment for my Japanese learning videos I can&#39;t because um easy anti-che was added to VR chat which does not support a like arm architecture even on like um the windows emulators and stuff like that so I need to have two computers and the other issue was that for video editing the the performance is really good it really is good but it&#39;s not good enough like for me because essentially my video editing is a bit different from most people in the sense that I I use a lot of screen recordings and a lot of assets and a lot of Motion Graphics in my videos and the even if it is really good for like performance- wise really good for like editing 4k camera footage it&#39;s still going to be really bad when I try to like um to do a lot of Motion Graphics where I need to like for example do a small animation that I need to key frame and I perhaps need to like um change the timing of the G keyframe by a few milliseconds and see what kind of a difference it makes like a 100 times until I&#39;m happy with it and if I need to like if it lags every single time unless I like cach it which is going to take a really long time because um thein solve doesn&#39;t have completely manually controllable caching unfortunately then it&#39;s a really it&#39;s a huge pain to work with um Hardware that&#39;s not as powerful as possible and I&#39;m just going to say this right now because I know there&#39;s every time I say this there are going to be comments about this um there are people who say that on D Sol there is manual caching because if you set the caching mode to user then it&#39;s you know user based caching hence the name but the thing is that I&#39;ve actually read the manual and user based mode C like user caching does not cach uh certain effects it doesn&#39;t cach like Motion Graphics effects at all only the automatic quote unquote smart caching does that and it&#39;s not like direct enough so I essentially need Hardware that&#39;s as powerful as possible mhm so I had two choices um I need I need two computers if I want to keep the Macbook so I need to either have a Windows computer like a desktop or I should get a Windows laptop MH and the reason I need a laptop is because maybe I&#39;m going to go abroad very soon and for a long time and I&#39;m going to need to have a laptop for that because I need it to be portable so I decided like at one point I started researching Windows laptops because the 4 4,000 series like Nvidia 4,000 uh graphics card Series Laptops came out like a few months after I had them bought the MacBook but the issue with those was that they were so incredibly expensive when they came out like I&#39;m talking the 4090 ones were minimum 4,000 to well over 5,000 Euros here and yeah okay yeah they were like so expensive like literally they made MacBooks look like budget devices like I&#39;m not even joking when I say said that like MacBooks genuinely had really good price to Performance compared to those Windows laptops and my issue with that is with those with the price is not only that like it&#39;s not the best price to Performance but it&#39;s also like the build quality and design of most of those Windows laptops is like horrible in the sense that they&#39;re like yeah they are actually like budget gaming laptops that you know are really plastically plasticy and RGB but the price is still like or 4,000 which is like really like it&#39;s just sad in a sense a lot of the the gaming companies especially they have these shs they use for their entire product skew all the way down from the bottom to the top with no additions exactly and that&#39;s why it&#39;s like it&#39;s just so painful to even think about buying a powerful Windows laptop the only one that I liked uh like a like a lot was the Mercury White uh razor blade laptop but the issue is that the 490 version of that starts from like 5,200 or something like that and the 480 version costs uh 4,400 minimum here I am scrolling through laptop prices right now and I&#39;m seeing ridiculous prices ho my god there are like they are just ridiculously expensive especially in Europe in like the us there are some insanely well priced deals now like um there was some HB Omen with a 490 that cost like 2,400 maybe it&#39;s even less by now um but you know I can&#39;t really I actually I I spend so much time looking up Windows laptops I researched so much like the prices and stuff like that and at one point I almost wanted to uh buy plane tickets to travel to the us to just buy something from there because it&#39;s going to be cheaper than buying from here or ordering from the US and paying U the tolls fees and stuff like that um I even discovered that there are uh think bads with 409s but the problem with them is that the CPU is like um extremely weak compared to like the gaming ones because if you have like uh I9 13,900 uh H which is the one that the think pads use then the H version is so much weaker than the HX version that the gaming laptops use uh so unfortunately that&#39;s not a choice Ider even though I think think bats do look pretty nice like they are actually completely acceptable in my opinion I would like to have one but unfortunately they&#39;re just not powerful enough once again and so Windows laptops just don&#39;t really seem to be a choice I actually found a website in Europe which sold uh Windows laptops for pretty cheap because they what they did was they bought them from the US paid the import fees and then just resold them in the EU EU and that was the cheapest way to get them which was like uh after months and months and months uh the price was something like € 2,700 for a 49d Lenovo um gaming laptop which is actually decent but it&#39;s still really expensive um well I I&#39;d say it&#39;s a fair price but the thing is that um Windows laptop Windows laptops have their own issues for example fan noise uh extreme power draw um like overheating issues termal Trot throttling things like that so even if I pay like €3,000 for a powerful Windows laptop it&#39;s not going to be a great experience essentially this goes back to what I said earlier where they use the same chassis for the bottom of the stack and the top of the stack uh exactly yeah like exactly and that&#39;s the issue like I I it&#39;s just sad like that there is just nothing like actually good in the windows market right now for like highend powerful laptops unless you&#39;re going like paying like over 5,000 to like razor or something like that yeah and so I decided that okay I need to go abroad M but I need a computer and it&#39;s much cheaper to buy something from here than it is to buy from Japan well it&#39;s really expensive here as well but I decided that I&#39;m going to build a desktop in this smallest case possible and I&#39;m going to take that desktop with me on the plane and fly to Japan I [ __ ] I didn&#39;t want to say that but you already said it twice already you didn&#39;t notice oh I did yes oh okay okay well whatever uh I think I&#39;ve already said it in the past anyway so um I built a computer with a 490 and a 7 950x uh AMD CPU so uh the best GPU and arguably the best CPU for you know consumer grade um desktops M and I actually got it working it&#39;s like in a tiny case so uh NRP 200 Max by cool Cooler Master um I&#39;ll just link a picture and oh I think I just found 200p I think this is it you said nrp2 uh wait NR 200p yes hear wrong yes yeah NR 200p Max like a tiny case like this and it barely fits the 4090 it&#39;s like from edge to edge it&#39;s like it&#39;s essentially that PC is completely full of stuff MH and but technically speaking it should fit in the luggage that uh you put like under the plane so I&#39;ll have to like make sure that it doesn&#39;t get like destroyed during the shipping I have to take like the G probably into my backpack uh onto the plane and like um I mean into like the place where I&#39;m going to be sitting and stuff like that but I have to make sure that the PC itself is like super protected in the because they&#39;re going to be tossing around like the pack like the luggages and stuff like that with no respect to like the stuff inside so it&#39;s pretty dangerous uh but I got it working and it&#39;s pretty nice except that I wish it I still wish that it was more powerful like um like it it&#39;s really disappointing in the sense that it&#39;s really good it&#39;s really powerful but it&#39;s I I still have like even simple editing like um situations where it&#39;s lagging in the sense that this already might be like um well it most likely is like U optimization issues with like thein solve and stuff like that but the solve is like supposedly the most optimized piece of software for like General editing there is so and like I mentioned there is no like proper manual caching like direct caching for the vure Sol so I have to rely that on like um to I have to make sure that the like when I edit I have to rely on the fact that the hardware is powerful enough to play everything real time without lag but it&#39;s just not possible yet uh with this build most of the things I can do with no lag but for example um if I do a fade like just a fade transition between two 4K 60 FPS Clips uh for some reason in certain scenarios that lags uhuh and like for example uh some motion graphic based uh transition effects and things like that most of the time they&#39;re fine but occasionally they lag and for example recently I&#39;m editing uh a clip for the five years of learning Japanese video and it&#39;s just a 4K 60 FPS OBS recording that&#39;s like an hour long and I&#39;m like cutting it into smaller pieces and okay like when I try to like scrub through it or like jump to certain places it&#39;s some I&#39;m sometimes need to wait like 0.5 to like three seconds for it to like respond and the it might not seem like a big deal but when I&#39;m going between like short clips like potentially like 0.3 seconds long mm and jumping between those then every single piece of lag is going to slow me down so much that it&#39;s whenever the 5090 is going to come out I&#39;m probably going to instantly buy it and yeah I I made a proxy for that clip but the issue with proxies is that first of all they take time to make right and they take so much space like it&#39;s an hour long clip and the proxy uh I made it like a low quality proxy and it took like one terabyte of data from my hard drive and imagine I have like U like the project itself is like uh has like hundreds of 4K clips and stuff like that so I&#39;m not going to make a proxy for every single one of those yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s just unfortunate so the reason I&#39;m telling this is not not just to rent but it&#39;s just to lay out the standards that I need for performance essentially because now I want to like mention the Linux stuff so essentially I&#39;m using Windows 11 right now for this hardware and it&#39;s fine for the most part um I had to now that I came from the Mac OS I was so used to Mac like the setup I had on Mac OS that I was actually I was having trouble using Windows which is pretty funny because I was so used to it before um but I&#39;m pretty much used to it now because I set up a ton of like custom shortcuts and stuff from power toys which is like a almost native um program developed by Microsoft which gives like a ton of extra features into windows and one of the things I&#39;m missing is a tiling Window Manager for sure Windows has some options like gbi which is like developed by mostly one person uh like a Windows tying man manager I guess I can link it or people who might be curious I feel like I heard about this one yes yes I do know about that one and I mean it it tiles it does what it&#39;s supposed to but the I I had some issues with it like some things like bug out a bit and the other thing is that even if that&#39;s fine like if it occasionally bugs even if that&#39;s fine the issue is that I&#39;m using the I want to use the super key or the Windows key for my shortcuts on the tiling window manager but it&#39;s extremely hard to do that on Windows because apparently the Windows key is disable AED from the API uh that you know you can hook into like the windows API that it&#39;s reserved for Windows features essentially so right right makes sense yeah and there is an option to like um disable the builtin Windows key shortcuts like uh like Windows plus d for example that&#39;s reveals the desktop you can disable those from reg edit and I suppose like uh set set up a power tools um a power toys shortcut for something like control control shift alt number nine or something to like uh uh Windows plus d like it&#39;s essentially a proxy shortcut essentially you can make do something like that I think because uh if when I tried that I think it was broken like uh it like it&#39;s a still couldn&#39;t get it working properly and it&#39;s just too much trouble for it to be worth it and even if like I do get it working I&#39;m I&#39;m sure that it&#39;s not going to be like the perfect experience anyway because of the box and stuff like that so essentially what I&#39;m trying to say is that even though you know everything works what I need on Windows right now it could be even better if I could do like um make it exactly how I wanted if wanted to customization control that wasn&#39;t locked behind registry edits and other fiddling around that might just break with a Windows update exactly and if I ever need to like for example I bought a faster SSD but um I have Linux on it currently but like if I wanted to put my Windows onto that faster SSD I would have to do all of those customizations again from what I understand and that&#39;s kind of a pain and things like that because I can&#39;t just like copy paste a config file it&#39;s like a ton of stuff that I do in drag edits and stuff like that um so I decided that it would be fun to try Linux again because I now have new hardware that is perhaps better supported than my previous Hardware was uh Linux has probably evolved since the last time you know like Wayland and stuff like that and you know I always want to go back to Linux just to like try it out and stuff it&#39;s just fun essentially uh so I wanted to try it again and what what I decided to start with was once again you want to which you know everyone hates and the reason why was because uh the 23.10 looked really nice I just genuinely think it that that it&#39;s look that it looks really good personally uh so I decided to try installing that uh onto the new SSD I bought and by the way I had to like because this PC is so small it&#39;s I had to you know remove the graphics card and stuff like that to install the SSD but removing the graphics card is so hard and putting it back is so hard because it it barely fits like I have to like push the cables in a certain way and like put a quite a lot of force for it to actually close and stuff like that so that was pretty annoying but I installed dantu on it or rather I I tried to install yanto on it but came out that for the RTX 490 it doesn&#39;t boot into the installer with an RTX 490 because the card is too new or something and finally I got it working after putting into safe Graphics mode uh like multiple times and it finally worked that one point and I installed it I would have thought 2310 would be fine but maybe maybe wait maybe huh I didn&#39;t I yeah it would have made sense if you still on 22 to4 that I could understand but the fact that they haven&#39;t updated their drivers enough for that yeah there was like um um I&#39;ll get my phone I can even like uh send a screenshot of the issue it I Googled it and it was like really common um maybe I can just Google it yeah if you can find the link that you used I definitely want to see it I I&#39;m not surprised that uh it&#39;s like that cuz the buntu does tend to move fairly slowly um like fairly conservative changes but I would have thought by now surely I think it was this issue um there were multiple ones like that for some of them weren&#39;t even for uh the 4090 but it was the unknown chipset error essentially when I tried putting into the installer it was just like um it gave me that error and nothing happened um I have it all recorded as well because I wanted to like uh potentially make the second part for the uh video for Like A Part Two l challenge video wait so it was trying to noo oh why yeah why I even the picture I&#39;m so wait I&#39;m so confused why I tried yeah no that makes sense why the hell is it trying to use noo that barely works with old GPU like what I I had is like is it like the open source version of yeah um that&#39;s the open source drivers I had one of the developers on recently um they are in the process of supporting um I I think they&#39;re working on the 30 series right now but there&#39;s a lot of firmware issues inidia isn&#39;t really working super closely with them so it&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a lot of reverse engineering stuff they have to do um I think with an upcoming version of the konel it should be better but you wouldn&#39;t be seeing that in the bundu until 24 to 04 anyway yeah and well it was like um like right off the bat that seemed like a pretty bad Omen essentially for but luckily I got it like uh installed when I went to safe Graphics um and everything was really nice I really like the default um appearance if of you BTO like all the fonts and stuff like that on my 4k monitor were were like really nice and I&#39;ll be honest I actually like gnome quite a lot especially with the yanto skin um and the small customizations that they&#39; made uh but then I started having like like massive graphical box like uh I think I messaged you and sent you some of like you did send images before yes um uh uh where is it is it that one is it the video yeah I rep it yeah okay ah yep yep it is uh can I open this in a thing no let&#39;s download the video oh God okay I think I sent multiple these are a bit hard to see but I had like extremely like apparent ones okay here we go um let&#39;s open that in my browser yeah that&#39;ll work that there here we go okay okay perfect so anyone just listening wait what&#39;s happening this one oh one was after I installed the new driver but one was like before that I&#39;m might be that would explain why I&#39;m confused why nothing&#39;s happening I had like really bad ones and I I have videos of them but I didn&#39;t send them ah here we go yeah the other one there&#39;s like this clear line flickering yeah just goes but I had like I have like other Clips when it&#39;s like huge massive black boxes over like the browser and stuff like that and it&#39;s like it&#39;s essentially like it looks completely broken and then I had like I don&#39;t remember if this was on I think this was on X11 uh when I these clips I sent on Wayland I had some other issue I think I wrote what happened oh oh okay I I did send you the video with the black boxes it was the first um it was the first video oh actually sent three I miss that one okay yep um here we go that one put that there ah yep yep yep okay I yep that&#39;s definitely the one I remember originally then cool um yeah I had issues like this soone just listening there&#39;s like a giant black line just in the middle of the screen it sometimes goes away but then comes back a couple seconds later yeah and this is X11 I think oh yeah by defa it still uses X11 no wait hold on uh wait no no Nvidia it uses Nvidia I think it might default to X11 I don&#39;t remember uh I I don&#39;t exactly remember but both were installed wayand and X11 were both like an by default installed options essentially yeah yeah they are definitely on new and on vand I had some other issue on vland my like um Firefox like had extremely bad performance on youto like it essentially like crashed uh it got really laggy and crashed when I was scrolling like heavier sites for example Pinterest or something like that so I tried using X11 and X11 had those graphical bugs and long story short I decided to try I3 instead of known because of those issues and it worked fine for the most part there and I don&#39;t remember what I was doing I was customizing multiple things and eventually I was having some issue that I thought that would maybe be like I installed the newest Nvidia driver that isn&#39;t even like opt like an option in by default in yanto so I installed five4 five instead of 535 and it worked for the most part but I had some issues and I decided that maybe if I downgrade the driver then it&#39;s going to be fine again M so I went to the um youto has this app called uh additional software and drivers or something like that and you can install NVIDIA drivers from there and so I had 545 selected and I selected 531 to downgrade so I inst I hit install and it said installation successful and I restarted my PC and suddenly it looked like I had no drivers at all and I mean they were completely gone like uh even though it said installation successful like the drivers were completely gone but not a big deal right I mean I can just install them again but the issue is that my uh Network driver was also gone I couldn&#39;t I had no internet essentially with a cable uhhuh and that is also a common issue apparently is it what is going on over on auntu uh I I&#39;ll Google it like like I can do a screenshot thanks it&#39;s apparently really common and like one of the fixes was to run a like older kernel and then try again but I tried and I like I think from the boot menu when you first put into the computer but that didn&#39;t like change anything for me so I just like okay I wiped everything and I installed Fedora 39 or I installed nobara I think which is like um yeah Fedora 38 but it has like a ton of like NVIDIA drivers and the in all like fixes by the fault and stuff like that yeah that&#39;s glor EG rolls project yeah it was pretty nice like uh it it really does like work in the sense that um I can install the V all really easily and media drivers are pretty much installed by default and stuff like that but that one had the same issue as it had the same graphical issue on gnome that I had like I showed before some things were better though but it also had like my microphone wasn&#39;t working at all and long story short I got that fixed by installing the newest ala driver so like like um I don&#39;t know what also like uh what it was again but essentially I had to like research quite a bit and install newer ala drivers manually and after that I got my microphone working and everything seemed pretty good except um uh the wi all didn&#39;t record audio which is probably just like a just another issue with um that the V solve has on Linux because it&#39;s not like super properly supported yeah and then I also couldn&#39;t get uh Japanese input with anti working at all with um nobara for some reason even though I got it working on yanto and Fedora in some like other boot I tried before and I was also I just played around with I3 again for a while and I tried even like putting F xfce to combine it with I3 and stuff like that uhuh um but like I don&#39;t remember exactly what issue I had because I had so many like different things So eventually I just wiped it again and I tried xfc Fedora uh spin by default Then I wiped that again and now I am at just the Fedora 39 work workstation like the default system essentially and everything like now Wayland when I go to Wayland it&#39;s super nice it&#39;s like um okay the browser is extremely performant I really like it uh gnome is also quite nice I mean doesn&#39;t have the you know styling that you want to it but I still like it but the issue with Wayland is that on Fedora that I experienced was that all xvand applications I think are extremely laggy so for example Discord when I try typing on Discord it&#39;s like U some characters just um essentially the input is lagging and sometimes like what I&#39;m typing isn&#39;t like U some letters will just you know not get typed or for for example Visual Studio code when I try using that like um it&#39;s it&#39;s unusable because I can&#39;t properly type essentially um and that&#39;s apparently quite common as well um it shouldn&#39;t be that bug&#39;s supposed to be fixed it&#39;s supposed to be fixed two years ago there was problem with X wh and Nvidia for a while where they just were not to GPU accelerated um ah I I don&#39;t know how that&#39;s happening again maybe it&#39;s a 4090 thing if verone could be 40 cuz I know when the 490 came out it wasn&#39;t super well supported even with like the proprietary drivers um I&#39;m I&#39;m not sure cuz you know there&#39;s not like a massive pool of people running 409s on Linux yeah like uh I I definitely heard that 490 had some problems like long time ago M but like apparently this issue is like um uh people say that it&#39;s a Nidia thing essentially um this is six months ago those comments there the top comments and stuff like that so I don&#39;t know it&#39;s it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s a proper fix to this unfortunately this on wh but the problem goes away if I have if I have OBS open what what okay that&#39;s um I fixed by clearing all notifications within Discord with Mark&#39;s red thing as lus 12old said Fu Nvidia yeah like I think everything comes back to Nvidia that&#39;s just just the sad state of things yeah like it&#39;s really unfortunate like I even thought about like buying an AMD card like uh the what was it like 7 9,000 xdx or something like that the most powerful one entally and I was like okay uh I need to buy a 49 like I I I need like I I don&#39;t mind buying an extra card even if it&#39;s just for like the video for trying out Linux or something like that and but the issue is that hold on I&#39;ll Google this I know okay well if you already know then it&#39;s like like the wiol is apparently the only thing on AMD that&#39;s like unusable like I found this tread so it&#39;s like okay nothing works on Nidia except D all and everything works on AMD except thein as all yeah so with da Vinci my understanding with AMD cards is you need to be running the pro drivers but the pro drivers are completely useless for anything outside of Da Vinci but even then the open C implementation is just not good um there is a project called rust DCL being worked on right now that is going to be a part of the open source AMD drivers it&#39;s not done yet but I would imagine within maybe like a year or so it&#39;s probably going to be in a good state right now you can use it and D Vinci will open um but you&#39;re not going to get performance from it that&#39;s usable yeah and that kind of sucks because like I said before like the reason I R like rented so long about the performance thing is that I genuinely need all the performance I can get so even if AMD worked perfectly fine it&#39;s still going to be a sacrifice because the 490 is just much more powerful in like GPU effects essentially yeah in the all yeah and but unfortunately even that&#39;s not a proper Choice it seems because like DN all and AMD aren&#39;t you know on Linux getting along too well it seems no so it&#39;s really like I want to use Linux but I&#39;m really like stuck between a rock and a hard place in a way so okay I can use X11 M and let&#39;s say I&#39;m I I use something that isn&#39;t gnome so I3 for example MH uh so so now I don&#39;t have those flickering bugs Firefox still has like um screen tearing issues for some reason and many applications like Discord as well I have like screen screen tearing issues even on X11 uh X11 yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s going to happen there is um yeah actually no I don&#39;t now that I think about I don&#39;t know if there is there is a way to disable screen tearing I don&#39;t know if it works with Nvidia oh yeah I I do remember something uh when I Googled it myself as well but it was like like it was something like force sow freeze or why I don&#39;t know what called but ESS that um yeah and people said that yes it works but you&#39;re going to have other issues when you do that essentially and just use veent and stuff like that but yeah um okay I can live with the screen tearing I mean if I really want to but then it&#39;s like um on I&#39;m having issues with like um this is all customiz customizable I&#39;m sure if I like uh put another like multiple hundred hours of into like perhaps learning different uh window managers and stuff like that as well but like uh so my first of all scaling like fractional scaling and stuff like that I have a 4K what is it 29 inch display and without scaling it&#39;s kind of unusable and yeah on with on next L you have essentially a choice for example on gnome you have a choice between 100% And 200% y so too small or Too Big M on wayand you have fractional scaling but it has like it had its own issues like um like some applications were just completely blurry when I did that like uh it really looked really ched you finish what you&#39;re saying and I can explain why the fractional scaling is a mess okay so what essentially it&#39;s like if I use fractional scaling on Wayland first of all I can&#39;t use Wayland seemingly I actually had issues with the wi Sol one Wayland as well so whand is completely out of the question for me it seems unfortunately and if I use fractional scaling on Wayland then some applications are like completely blurry and so the best option I found was on gnome I think there is an option for increasing the font scaling that sort of works like fractional scaling in a way like um it&#39;s it&#39;s similar but it&#39;s not completed the same and on X I mean on I3 the issue is that like my main monitor is like scaled in an okay fashion but my secondary monitor is like like it looks like it&#39;s a 2K 2.5k display but um it looks like 1080p in terms of scaling like it&#39;s everything is too big MH and I&#39;ve seen some like issues like potential fixes when you like change the DPI option for uh true rander and stuff like that but it&#39;s like I haven&#39;t gotten far enough for everything like that to be solved yet and it&#39;s like like I&#39;m really trying to use Linux but at at on at the back of my head I&#39;m feeling like holy [ __ ] I should actually just get some work done like I&#39;ve already spent like 100 hours on this and how like how much time do I have to spend to you know get it like working in a nice state in which I&#39;m happy with which I mean it can be fine in the sense that maybe in the future it&#39;s like uh I&#39;ll save a lot of time by or like be more motivated to do work if my setup is you know perfect in the sense that uh my shortcuts and everything work exactly how I want to but at the same time it&#39;s like H it&#39;s really conflicting it&#39;s really conflicting see this is why I made a YouTube channel where I try to get things working so I can pretend like I&#39;m being productive by messing around with Linux um like I I really I really T about that like the the excuse I have have is that if I make the second uh Linux challenge video the previous one got quite a lot of views so maybe maybe I&#39;m being productive if I&#39;m doing this right now yeah so okay the fractional scaling thing because this has been one of my this have been one of my pet problems for a while okay so gnome does support fractal scaling right now it is hidden beh uh hidden behind a um a environment variable because it&#39;s very experimental and kind of a mess so the whand blurriness there is a good reason for that um it&#39;s not actually fractional scaling so it&#39;s taken a long time to convince the developers that fractional scaling is a good thing there is giant gitlab threads arguing with the developers that fractional scale is a good thing and major developers on the project being like no no one wants fractional scaling this is impossible to do how could how could anyone possibly do this so the way okay there&#39;s two there&#39;s two problems here problem number one on whan there is no way to share the metadata for the scale with the application so there is a protocol that&#39;s in progress to share that data uh before that happens though there is a another method that is being done so w you can&#39;t tell the application to scale properly what they do is scale to the next nearest integer so if you&#39;re say you want to do a 1.5 time scale it&#39;ll scale up to two uh two times and then raster scale it down ah so what you get is incredibly blurry applications yeah I I the thing is that I think Mac OS does something similar in the sense that for example when I have a 4K display on Mac OS then when I have it set to um I think 150% they don&#39;t have like percentages in mechos they have just like pictures that you choose from and um when I for example open OBS then the screen like I have the options to choose uh resolutions right that I want to record at then what it does is that it scales it up to two times as well so it&#39;s like like I don&#39;t know like over 5,000 resolution or something like that uh and then it scales it back down to I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a 2K or three 4K then like uh internally but um I guess they do something different because on Mac OS it&#39;s not nothing is blur very like like okay there&#39;s like a little bit of like um like when you get like really close to the monitor the for example Dex does looks a little bit like it&#39;s um not like Blurry or smudy but it it there&#39;s like not something going on essentially that isn&#39;t going on on skating but overall it looks totally fine like applications and stuff aren&#39;t BL like inherently mhm but I&#39;m not really sure what Linux is doing or or like um wait and is doing differently by I guess rer you said the rer yeah my understanding is is doing a rter scale back down yeah I I imagine mest is probably doing like filling in the gaps in places and doing some anti-aliasing or something to make things look a bit nicer um oh yeah they probably don&#39;t have like uh they probably have much more like um the whatever the quartz or whatever their window server is is probably has all of those things like built in from the beginning or something like that yeah um fractional scaling is a mess oh there&#39;s also the problem that uh gnome does technically support fractional scaling now but the toolkit doesn&#39;t so they actually do support the protocol but it&#39;s not actually going to be used until gtk 5 comes out which could be I don&#39;t know 5 years from now sometimes in the future I guess um yeah yeah it&#39;s unfortunate like uh it&#39;s really like it I think like people who like I I&#39;m not that well worsed into what the actual like uh Turf bars is between like U the fractional scaling and no fractional scaling but if you have a monitor that&#39;s 4K and like rather small like 29 or 27 inches then it&#39;s really unpleasant to use either 100 or 200% so yeah yeah yeah I and I imagine it can be even worse on laptops oh no it&#39;s it&#39;s unusable on a laptop I&#39;ve tried to use a 1440p laptop and I I can&#39;t even use that uh you know especially if you got like a 13inch laptop like 1080p is hard enough to deal with them 13 inch yeah I can imagine yeah I I have specifically avoided buying 4K displays like I I could get one I could get it working I just I just don&#39;t want to deal with it right now and like fractional scaling is bad enough on Windows let alone dealing with it on on Linux yeah I&#39;m actually using fractional scaling on Windows right now and I can say like my experience is like it&#39;s completely fine except there are certain like dialogue like certain like old installed screens for example um that that that have deex which is blurry but like everything is fine except for those like specific dialogues from like old installers or something like that that&#39;s the experience I&#39;m having on windows with scaling my understanding with the old installers is they just weren&#39;t built around like going over a certain resolution yeah it&#39;s definitely something I like noticed when I start using 4k on Windows like if you go back and you know you boot up something like uh EverQuest for example like that game is just it&#39;s just not going to work on a 10p display like things are just it was designed around a way lower resolution and it&#39;s going to be the same thing with those dialogues as well uh I see yeah like I think maybe Windows 11 does it a bit better because Windows 10 I remember when I got this monitor before this new computer so I tried it a bit on Windows 10 on my old computer as well and it looked worse there like a lot of things were really messy but on Windows 11 it it looks like most of the stuff like the file explorer and stuff handle it like natively in a sense but but yeah the installation dialoges and stuff like that do get pretty blurry sometimes I haven&#39;t messed around with 11 like I I stopped using Windows back when 10 came out so I I really don&#39;t have any context to like what the experience is like now so I would hope it&#39;s gotten better um but what what has been your general experience with 11 uh yeah so H when I got started I remember that I didn&#39;t like it and I it wasn&#39;t like a lot of people you know when there&#39;s something new they&#39;re always like ah this sucks yeah like but is like it&#39;s always like that with Windows Vista and whatever as well but overall things get better like um but I had to use like a lot of customization to get it working the way I like it right now for example the new desk bar in Windows 11 I don&#39;t like so apparently there&#39;s some kind of a RIT hack once again MH that once you enable you get the old taskar from Windows 10 back or it was like a third party script or something like that that has like customization for it the reason I didn&#39;t like the windows 11 one was because uh for example you cannot separate applications from like the into separate tabs so for example if you have like five Firefox windows open I want all of them to be separate on the taskar so I can see exactly what is where or for example but you can&#39;t do that on 11 it&#39;s not a feature yet they might be they might implement it in the future but it doesn&#39;t really matter now that I have the old test bar once again MH um overall other than that there were some other things that were annoying as well I think but I think it&#39;s uh it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely an improvement in the sense that you have just you know more modern things like Windows 10 is starting to look kind of antiquated I&#39;m not going to lie like um in some ways so I think it&#39;s fine for the most part when you customize it a little bit you know um some things are a bit annoying like uh when I try to move a window from one screen to another some like some applications like get stuck really badly in the like between two monitors until I like force it to the other one like Windows 10 did it better somehow MH uh I I actually kind of like the tiling feature that you can like um grab a window and uh drag it up to the top to like have a bunch of different tiling options and stuff like that but uh if it was just a tiling Window Manager I mean it wouldn&#39;t matter much much but there isn&#39;t that much of a difference other than those small things to be honest between 10 and 11 you&#39;ve mentioned tying win managers a couple of times um when did you first try one out and why like what about Tyler&#39;s appeal to you uh so like I mentioned well that was also my first time like I mentioned the reason I started using a Tiding window manager was because of Macos um like the window Management in Mac just wasn&#39;t good enough for me like um even with the third party applications such as you know things that try to mimic the um Windows style application snapping they they&#39;re just they&#39;re like that but they&#39;re a bit less featured a bit less feature less Rich compared to the Windows Experience or something like you know gnome and a bunch of other things as well so the T the window management stuff was just really bothering with me with macw because it really like made using the computer difficult so I discovered that the creator of OSU was using Mac OS in his live streams and he was using uh this tying window manager called yaai and he had like his setup looked like completely different from default Macos because he had like U some kind of a like a bar like the Bly bar type things on Mac OS uh and then the tying window manager and a bunch of shortcuts and stuff like that and that gave me like some hope that I might be actually able to use Macos and I tried out I tried out the uh yabai window manager which is apparently similar to I3 but I there are some differences which I noticed but I actually really liked it in the sense that it actually I it took me some time to get used to it but after I did it genuinely was like really nice to have like when I open a browser or some application that it full screens and when I open a new tab or detach a tab or something like that that it put it side by side and stuff like that I don&#39;t have to um it&#39;s I like the automatic nature of it and you know it&#39;s just easier to use a computer when it&#39;s um when when it it does things like that automatically and once you get used to it it&#39;s hard to go back to a floating style Window Manager for sure I keep telling people this like no no tiling is not that great try it try it it&#39;s something you have to try yeah it it because like I was also like before I was essentially forced to use tying a timing window manager I was also like like H like like when I saw those uh you know screenshots and stuff like that there&#39;s this um you know you have the Unix porn subreddit right and then it&#39;s like you have a Counter Culture sub to that which is a productivity I don&#39;t know if it was something like uh usability porn or something like that which was supposedly the same thing except it&#39;s supposed to be more usable and when I looked at it it was like what is the difference both of them are just you know you have no buttons on the windows and stuff like that it&#39;s like it feels so like these setups seem so unfunctional to me and Tiding window managers felt like like okay they&#39;re probably nice but they seem so complicated and I need I know that I need to use a floating tying like floating type windows in these scenarios and stuff like that so it&#39;s probably not worth it for me but once I once I actually tried it then there&#39;s like there&#39;s genuinely nothing to lose like um unless you need to have like certain features from desktop environments MH um that you lose if you use a um window manager that doesn&#39;t have those features so what really helped me was that when I installed your on Macos it was still everything was still exactly the same as on default Mac except that it&#39;s just tiled so I still have the dock I still have all the buttons on the Windows all of the default shortcuts still work for the most part you know um so everything is exactly the same except I can now use a few shortcuts to you know control the tiling and things tile out automatically in that kind case of a in that scenario there truly is nothing to lose there&#39;s only to gain from having a tiling window manager and once I got used to it it&#39;s like it&#39;s so easy to use as well like it&#39;s just like for example for resizing a window I just use the Super Key plus WD it&#39;s like it can&#39;t get any easier than that essentially often times I still use my mouse to resize but there are nice as well yeah like um I I still use my mouse a ton like a lot of like one of those things which people are scared about is that uh I want to use my mouse you know but you you can still use your your mouse like I use my mouse just as much as I did before in a way because for example when I do video editing I need to use my mouse like all the time so the way so like um but even if I use my mouse if I have my hand on the mouse I can like I said my um window shortcuts on are on W ASD my other hand is still on my keyboard so I can use my mouse and the Tyler in conjunction so it&#39;s like Best of Both Worlds essentially I don&#39;t have to use my mouse to move Windows around or to like resize Windows even though I still do that sometimes because like I don&#39;t always have my hand on my keyboard for example I might be drinking water with my keyboard hand and moving things around with my mouse hand and so on so like you can still use your mouse just as much as as before even more in some ways because it&#39;s it&#39;s even going to be easier to use your mouse when you can like you know change the position of two windows just by dragging one window on top of the other and then they automatically switch positions and stuff like that yeah yeah um there is this weird I guess you would call it like tiling purism thing and I guess it kind of comes from it it sort of comes from like the the people who use Vim as well where everything has to be a key bind you have to use your mouse as little as possible never take your hands off the home R sort of thing um when I got out of that mindset I started finding Tyler&#39;s like way way more useful uh one thing I want to ask is um so with your buy does it do like Dynamic tiling or is it like I3 where it&#39;s manual where you have to like pick the direction the split is going to happen uh it&#39;s Dynamic it&#39;s like um um I think it&#39;s called the Golden Ratio ah okay that&#39;s just the default that everything uses if it does dyam yeah it&#39;s I just saw it in like I think awesome WM as well which is actually something I tried before before trying I Tre but it was like um there was something in awesome that um that set me off U I think like writing L code if you like writing L Awesome&#39;s great yeah the config was pretty crazy like um yeah I thought it was in CP at first or at least I heard something like that that&#39; be nice that&#39;d be nice an easy to configure nope no it&#39;s Lu and I don&#39;t know Lu so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an experience to play around with it um if I was going to jump to another one I&#39;d probably go to something like um I&#39;m forgetting the name now not xmonad uh qtile qtile you configure with python which I find a lot easy to work with I did hear about that like uh I watched a few a few days ago I watched the video by that one guy who makes videos about tying window managers a lot uh the all the names are so similar I don&#39;t remember what it was uh the Linux something Linux cast maybe ah yeah yeah okay uh let me just make sure that it isn&#39;t someone else yeah Matt did do a video yeah yeah yeah yeah it was uh it was a video by him that talked about customizing things in Python and I&#39;m very well versed in Python but for me I&#39;m at the point where I don&#39;t really see why I need to write custom stuff for tying window managers yet myself even though that would be nice but like uh what just to go back a bit um one thing about awesome WM which which made me switch away was that well first of all it was a bit complicated at first but um the there was something like I don&#39;t remember what command it was I think it was I wanted to move a window up so let&#39;s say I have M um two windows or like one window on the left like from top to bottom and then two windows stacked on top of each other yes on the right and I wanted to move the bottom window up to where the you know the upmost position but I think when I Googled it there was no command for it and when I I don&#39;t remember if it was that exactly or if it was something else but like the response was something like well it&#39;s technically possible if you use this third body script for it or something like that and then I was like just like okay maybe you&#39;re explaining it weirdly cuz I&#39;m I&#39;ve got a hotkey to do that no problem maybe I am doing something different um um I I don&#39;t remember exactly what it was but it was something like that and I was surprised that I couldn&#39;t like maybe it was something that like like like some that I can do it outside of an adjustment mode or something like that I don&#39;t remember exactly but it the point is that there was something that was a bit you know um confusing at first so I decided to try I3 because I actually had tried it like um I mean I had already tried it a long time ago but like back when I back when I knew what back before I knew what Ting window managers were I just saw I Tre mentioned a lot so I just installed it and I couldn&#39;t do really do anything on it because you know um I had like like no like no clue what to expect I thought it was just another desktop environment so I decided to try I3 and that worked pretty similar to yaai um in terms of configuration for example but um it didn&#39;t have the that Dynamic tiling thing yeah yeah that&#39;s my manual um yeah there is scripts to deal with that like um Auto what it called I3 Auto what the hell is it called Auto yeah something like that auto yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s um I I actually haven&#39;t minded it that much because I mean I I can somewhat handle it like um the manual timing this like it hasn&#39;t bothered me too much but what something that did bother me was that when I want to resize windows it&#39;s a bit unintuitive it was like if I try to resize a window to the left MH then I press you know uh super plus d yeah but in some scenarios it like it resized window the if the window is in the middle it resizes the window like both ways it resizes it both to the left and to the right and the shortcuts are like they&#39;re like upside down sometimes like reversed depending on where I am um so I just used like a script by someone that made it work exactly like I wanted like uh exactly like it worked on yay as well so luckily I was able to solve that with a script um also related to that as well as U what you mentioned before like the tiling um what was it um the people who tiling purism there was something like I wanted to have one workpace that was always floating because there was an application or something that broke with the automatic tiling at startup yeah uh so I wanted to make a space that&#39;s entirely floating and I was surprised to see like there were so many comments and responses which are which were like you shouldn&#39;t do that this is a tying Window Manager you shouldn&#39;t have floating windows like like why do you have floating why do you want a floating work workspace this is not like uh this is this is not per the float like tying Window Manager Paradigm rule book or whatever like mhm that was a bit surprising to see I mean luckily I I was able to do it but um yeah I guess some people are like that in terms of the tiling stuff but speaking of like no mouse the maos I mean the Macos Tyler the person stream I found it in the Pepe stream the creator of OA stream he actually doesn&#39;t use a mouse like um he has like um um like some kind of software that he controls with the keyboard that is essentially a virtual mouse that you know you have like a mouse cursor on the screen and then you move it around with the arrow keys and like it&#39;s um it&#39;s fine because he I suppose doesn&#39;t want to move his uh hands at all because he has like a really small keyboard as well that he never moves his like um wrists into a different position but like when I looked at the way he used it it seemed so like it seemed pretty painful because he was like yeah developing the game also and it has like those sliders and um like settings settings menus and stuff like that and he went through all of those with the virtual Mouse essentially and like at that point I&#39;d personally rather just use a mouse but who knows maybe it&#39;s something that you got to try once again like the same way with tying who knows my understanding is that software is sort of it&#39;s intended as like an accessibility thing for people that you know physically cannot use a mouse but yeah I guess if if it works and you just want to use it I I&#39;m not going to stop you like it&#39;s it&#39;s cool that you&#39;ve made it work I don&#39;t know how the hell you test also using that for for video editing it would be unusable though like uh the amount of like like Mouse movements and like I I&#39;m just constantly jumping across my screen and uh like uh using different menus and stuff like that with my mouse so it&#39;s essentially impossible to edit a video like a huge video with like a ton of like footage assets and effects and stuff with without a mouse so but luckily you can still use a mouse with a tiling window manager so that&#39;s nice yep absolutely just use the thing you&#39;re comfortable with yeah or you know step step out of your comfort zone and try a Tiding window manager and if you don&#39;t like it then you can always you know move back but um in like some more stuff on the Linux experience like I have not tried editing a video yet I feel like it&#39;s possible to make an entire full high quality video on Linux right now um I&#39;d have to use a different program for recording my voice because it doesn&#39;t seem to work on Linux in denture all even though it should work and I don&#39;t know what other features there are that might not work because last time I tried like a few years ago I couldn&#39;t get the um time adjustment menu like uh like speeding up or slowing down Clips I couldn&#39;t get that menu working in Linux for some reason which was you know already unusable essentially but right now that worked and I was able to render the video that like huge projects that I had made I was able to render them in Linux and I didn&#39;t have any problems after you know I got installed the fonts and stuff like that so that&#39;s really nice I&#39;m really glad about that because it already means that technically speaking Linux is usable um too bad that my current Fedora install was the first one where I couldn&#39;t get uh the wiol installed at all uh well I did get it installed but the issue is that uh when I launch it it says like GPU not detected or something like that and I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know why because it worked I was able to get it working on xfce version of Fedora and you know yantu and well nobara works out of the box essentially but all these other dros but for for some reason the Fedora one I couldn&#39;t get it working or well I haven&#39;t looked into it more than that right now but uh in terms of the per performance uh this is hard to say because I have a much faster SSD in the Linux install compared to my windows install so it should be faster by default and unfortunately on Wayland when I was able to use it um like because it sometimes didn&#39;t even start up on Wayland but I was able to get it working at one point on Wayland And on veent the performance was much worse it was like the render time was like like um at least 50% worse compared to X11 MH and compared to Windows the performance was slightly worse for the most part but when I used when I rendered a video on I3 so you know it&#39;s as as lightweight as it gets then it was a little bit bit faster and I mean it&#39;s hard to tell because I I&#39;m using a faster SSD like I don&#39;t know how much it impacts it but essentially the performance is up to par so that&#39;s nice I suppose or if not a little bit faster but I&#39;ve tried some other things as well and like I&#39;m this is not like Linux fault I&#39;m not trying to you know dis Linux or anything but if anything this is Media F fa but like a lot of things like I always see that people say that you know Linux is faster than Windows which on the Kernel level is probably true I don&#39;t know um and maybe for older computers that can&#39;t handle a lot of background tasks or have you know low Ram or something but like when I use Linux it&#39;s for the most part I have to accept that most likely things aren&#39;t as optimized as they would be on you know the place where all the optimizations go to AKA Windows mhm like especially on media and stuff like that yep so so it&#39;s it&#39;s a really conflicting experience in a way but I I&#39;m really hopeful in the sense that I you know the performance was decent if I got everything working right and yeah right now I&#39;m still having a lot of issues you know like the gnome is having those graphical issues on X11 vand is unusable unfortunately and I3 has its own you know things like I mentioned with like the scaling stuff and you know my mouse DPI being inconsistent between displays and stuff like that um so there&#39;s a lot of configuration I need to do but maybe maybe it&#39;s possible that um one day I could daily drive Linux like uh completely fine if Nidia would fix their stuff then it would already be possible have you considered trying out KD just to see if it&#39;s going to be a different experience yeah that&#39;s some that&#39;s the one thing I haven&#39;t tried yet like um I would definitely like to try KD as well because maybe it doesn&#39;t have that flickering issue that X11 has on gome MH um and maybe it&#39;s a bit more customizable it&#39;s definitely more customizable that&#39;s for sure okay that&#39;s good because well one thing is why I haven&#39;t tried it yet is that I think KD plasma 6 is going to be releasing soon uh February 28th I want to say okay so I guess there&#39;re still a few months to go but five um the there&#39;s I&#39;ve actually never liked KD for some reason though like um just aesthetically speaking and maybe because like when I installed it like back in the day then there&#39;s like you have the KD desktop environment and then you have like the KD suit I think which is which has like all those applications and stuff like that MH and you know when I was like uh when trying out things for the first time then like all the way back in like 2018 or something then I remember when I installed KDE I installed like the full version so it installed like all the applications and stuff I didn&#39;t need and stuff like that and um I don&#39;t know like design wise it it looks kind of like it&#39;s not my cup of D in a way but maybe KD6 is going to be different um it is going to be what KD use right now in a different toolkit it is a very evolutionary upgrade not revolutionary ah I see is it like better performance or is it like uh I will I guess it I did see that it has like new features like um in terms of like workflow at least yeah so OB it&#39;s getting a lot more like features it&#39;s it&#39;s the the thing that&#39;s not changing really is the design like they&#39;ve sort of they&#39;re sort of sitting with this design for now there&#39;s a couple of things like floating taskbars and things like that that are being done um but the general like look of it is still going to be pretty much the same uh the other thing that&#39;s happening with plasma 6 or KD6 um is better whan support that like that&#39;s one of their big things they&#39;re working on they are moving towards like making whan the default for d for example is actually uh not shipping X11 KD they&#39;re only going to ship the whan version H yeah I actually watched the video about that but I guess some people got quite upset about that yeah yeah can&#39;t you just like install X11 manually after like uh I they are not going to like they&#39;re not actually going to be building the X11 side when they compile I&#39;m not entirely sure what Neil&#39;s doing for it um yeah it I think it&#39;s going to be a bit of a mess uh but we&#39;ll have to wait and see what happens yeah I guess but I guess I&#39;ll I&#39;ll give that to try as well um and see how that is because one of the things that I would really like is actually I like the environment I had in the end with Mac in the sense that I have a Tiding window manager but they have the entire OS uh alongside so essentially imagine you have gnome M and with built-in tiling Window Manager support essentially well you have pop shell for that I even tried that again today but pop shell has like um issues in the sense that it&#39;s not very customizable right now so it for example you cannot resize Windows without entering the uh adjustment mode which is like for so if you want to resize a window you have to first you know hit uh super plus enter Then you have to resize it and then you hit enter again or something to apply it essentially and you can&#39;t rebind it and but you might be able to in the future when Pop Cosmic comes out or something like that so I am worried about the pop shell extension because Cosmic is its own uh stand own thing so I I would imagine they&#39;re going to just abandon the code base yeah pretty like maybe someone like Forks it and then keeps maintaining it um but um we&#39;ll have to yeah the cosmic still a while away for now it&#39;s fine um but I&#39;m I&#39;m definitely curious to see what happens when when they when they do drop it as for the KD side there is also an extension over there as well uh pre previously it was bismuth the developer of that I don&#39;t know vanished uh and there&#39;s a fork of it now called um polonium which is the exact same thing it&#39;s just actually working oh well if it works then it might be really nice then I&#39;ll most likely try it out because I&#39;ll try out KD and then try that Tyler as well uh here we go uh there it is yeah okay okay last commits last month ago well that&#39;s nice I there are like yeah uh there are like gnome uh like some it tree plus gnome combinations and I think it was I just looked it up yesterday I forgot what it was called but essentially you have like dros in a way that are like I tree plus gnome combined and stuff like that but most of them are like sort of abandoned seemingly so that&#39;s kind of unfortunate yeah they used to make it a lot I I don&#39;t even know if you can change out the window manager nowadays um but you used to be able to completely remove mutter and just replace it with I3 like you can on xfcu oh I see yeah back in the early days um you could swap in a project called compes which I don&#39;t know if you know that one it&#39;s uh I I I&#39;ve only heard it in the context of it being a compositor I think that people use for I3 or maybe that was something else um yeah so compers was a compositor Window Manager combined together um and the reason people liked it was this Effect called the cube nice so that was that was your like workspace switch you like spin a cube yeah that would be pretty cool if I&#39;d had that if I&#39;d have that right now yeah like I remember like those old like uh Linux customization videos and stuff like that always had like some crazy animations and stuff like that yeah yeah yeah a lot of that was probably compers yeah probably yeah a lot of those I think the cube does yeah the cube just got fixed in KDE so you actually can use it there as well Ah that&#39;s nice use the users who who were angry when the cube got broken um but got to fix that absolutely yeah well I guess on it Tre most of the stuff works but yeah yeah like I said I have some functionality issues but the other thing is also that like uh one of the reasons why I actually like having a desktop environment inside my you know timing window manager or like the other way around is that uh I use so much uh I use screen recordings a lot in my videos and you know screenshots of Windows and stuff like that in my videos and I want them to be you know aesthetical in the sense that I want fonts to be really nice I want you know the uh them to be sharp and so on and you know the window decorations and stuff like that to be nice and I&#39;m sure I can customize it like rice the i3e setup as well um but I&#39;m like already I&#39;m happy with the way gnome looks essentially essent especially on like you want to and stuff and like that but so it would it would already be ready to go if I could like um use gnome perfectly and have the um tying Window Manager stuff working as well then it would already be like I would I&#39;d be satisfied with that already M but I guess if I want to get I3 working perfectly as well uh then I still have to do quite a lot of work if I want to yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s very much a work in progress right now but I know some of the gome devs were talking about doing native tiling um they&#39;ve got sort of a I guess uh not not prototype more like a how I how would I say it like a a visualization of it it&#39;s not a tech demo it&#39;s like they&#39;ve got PowerPoint slide animation basically to demo like sort of what they&#39;re trying to do um oh yeah I I watched the video a little bit that you made on it oh uh yeah that was a while back yeah yeah yeah um I we have no idea if or when it&#39;s going to happen um but I am curious to see what they end up doing with it because that would be nice it would be very nice to have native tiling and gnome I I stand by what I said tiling is just look it&#39;s nice to have floating windows but there is a lot of mental energy you waste worrying about where windows are placed rearranging windows that are tier just it just takes away from you and you just don&#39;t need to think about it yeah it&#39;s uh it&#39;s really something that once you try and get comfortable with then it&#39;s like uh then you then then you see OD so this is why people like it essentially yeah yeah uh like I was so happy with the way windows handled its windows in the sense that I can like uh I can send Windows to different monitors and stuff like that with uh Windows key shift plus arrow keys and stuff like that and you know snap them into different places but you can&#39;t use but you can&#39;t use a keyboard shortcut to uh resize a window that has been tiled in Windows by default you can resize the window with a rather uncomfortable shortcut key actually um which is um alt plus enter or something like that or I I don&#39;t remember I discovered it yesterday but if you resize a window the other windows are not going to be resized uh with a if you do it with a keyboard shortcut is what I mean so that&#39;s pretty annoying uh when you don&#39;t have native tiling in that sense um I wanted to say something else as well but I forgot um yeah I forgot well we&#39;ve passed the 2hour mark anyway so it&#39;s about time we should probably like wrap this up yeah probably um I guess uh as the final word on Linux for me is that I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to be making a second part to my video on it and and if I&#39;m like um actually going to be trying for much longer than I currently have but at least every time I use Linux I know what the I know what&#39;s holding me back essentially from using it and I can keep an eye on on if those issues have been fixed or not for example currently it&#39;s Nidia drivers um and things like that so I&#39;m always looking forward to that hopefully I I doubt it will be like this but hopefully noo is in a better State then maybe maybe that&#39;ll do something but um no is at the point now where it can play a video game at 2 FPS which is more than zero which is where it was at a couple of months ago ah well that&#39;s an infinite amount of increase I suppose yeah um but I I I hope the Nvidia stuff gets better um CU they&#39;re kind of is a there is a time limit there&#39;s an expiration date we&#39;ll say set on X11 cuz it&#39;s being maintained by red hat and red hat is probably going to drop it sometime early 2030 uh which is a while away still but when they drop it entirely from Red Hat like from their their Dro uh no one&#39;s going to be maintaining exor anymore so is is the reason they drop it because they are going to start using Wayland themselves or they&#39;ve already folded to Wayland oh okay uh I see yeah oh yeah I remember the thing I wanted to ask as well it was a how do you change um what was it language input layouts on your system like uh do you use a shortcut key to like cycle between layouts or do you have a shortcut key for a specific layout for each short like a specific shortcut key for each layout uh I&#39;m not even sure what layout you use though um so for example Japanese and English and so on I actually don&#39;t have something set up on my desktop right now I had something a while back and it bugged out um when I was doing stuff I was using I was using fcitx at the time and I I don&#39;t remember what H I had oh I uninstalled it I think I had it on like control space to swap and then I was playing ano uh MMO and there were times where I press control space I&#39;d be doing like I&#39;d be jumping and trying to use a control modifier ability and then I uninstalled in instead of just changing the whole key um because I I do most of my Japanese input on my phone um yeah I see but yeah so I I got sidetracked there what was the problem you were having uh well I haven&#39;t mentioned it yet but essentially the way I discovered was that I&#39;ve always you know on Windows I&#39;ve always um I have three layouts so I have Estonian English and Japanese and I always cycled through them because I use all of them every day Yeah Yeah by now at least and it&#39;s really annoying especially on Windows it was really annoying now it seems to be fixed somewhat but for years and years and years I had this the biggest issue had with Windows was that for some reason it keeps adding random ass like layouts to my input list and I don&#39;t know why why it does that I&#39;ve disabled all of those like uh like uh I I just I&#39;ve researched this in the sense that I know that there are options that you can disable but none of them fixed it permanently at least like for example I&#39;d have English then I&#39;d get like a secondary English layout for no reason at all now it seems to be okay but it was really annoying because I was cycling through them and then like the list got longer uh in inconsistently so I had wrong layouts and I need to cycle more and stuff like that uh but on Macos when I started using Yi I also had this idea that what if I&#39;d have a shortcut for each layout a specific shortcut which was really easy to do with this program called Cava on Macos I guess I&#39;ll link it in the somebody is interested in that and I set it to uh Super Key aka the Windows key plus z x or C depending on the language and that is extremely comfortable to use for me I even set up um set it up on Windows the same way in the sense that Windows actually lets you do that uh you can set a shortcut for each layout a separate shortcut but it&#39;s something like you can&#39;t use the Windows key for it so I used power toys to remap a Windows key shortcut to you know like a really multim modifier key that I will never press in my life for each layout and I wanted to get that working on Linux as well M and on I3 it was rather simple with X11 it was something like uh set XP key map or something something essentially something specific in X11 that allowed me to control the um input method but then for Japanese on ibus I&#39;m using ibus so if I want to use anti for the Japanese input I first have to like change the engine like ibas engine to anti and stuff like that which I got working for the most part but like it it&#39;s kind of weird like I couldn&#39;t get it working on uh nobara for some reason and I couldn&#39;t get it working on xfce either until I changed the system language to Japanese but when I Chang it back to English then it didn&#39;t work anymore or rather if I switched to I3 it didn&#39;t work anymore but now I somehow got it working and I don&#39;t know it&#39;s like it&#39;s kind of messy but thing is what that when I tried setting it up the same way in Gnome as an experiment in wayand it&#39;s apparently kind of not possible like um because you can&#39;t change the layout in veent through the terminal terminal in Gnome very easily it seems and it was like I I searched for the question how to do it in Wayland and it was like okay use this just use this command then a year later this command has been deprecated use this command okay now this command has also been deprecated use this command and then it doesn&#39;t work the last command either and like it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty hard to get stuff like that working for some reason um but I don&#39;t know it&#39;s um I guess it&#39;s just all a matter of experimentation and learning and researching in Linux but it definitely takes a lot of time yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of the big problem um I when I was swapping over the Japanese input I didn&#39;t have any issue well obviously besides the issue I mentioned where I had hot Keys overlapping each other because I&#39;m an idiot um besides that problem I didn&#39;t have any problem swapping into Japanese input um the hotkey would enable it just fine and it would just let me start typing so um yeah maybe it&#39;s better with the mosque but I used anti uh I didn&#39;t try out mosque because I think well I well maybe it&#39;s fine on mosque as well but the way I have it on Mac OS is that when I hit um the Windows key or like the shortcut for that I have for Japanese or layout it&#39;s in the H hiragana mode right away so it&#39;s not like uh it doesn&#39;t type English letters it types Japanese essentially right away and on um on Windows I have this issue that I need to act have the ime activated for each window because um if I have it um if I switch to the if I&#39;m on the English layout and switch to the Japanese layout it&#39;s the same until I activate sep the Japanese input separately and it&#39;s really annoying in some applications because in some applications it doesn&#39;t save the state which it was in for example in the wi old so right now I&#39;m writing subtitles for both English and Japanese in my with video in Dent all and I have to spend a lot of time switching the layout shortcuts essentially because I have to do it with like I need three to four uh key presses to switch between layouts and I wanted to get it working the same way on Linux as well where it&#39;s like immediate and anti worked like that out of the box but I&#39;m not sure if mosque does as well so I haven&#39;t tried it yet yeah I said I I haven&#39;t messed around with stuff in a little bit um also I wasn&#39;t using ibus so yeah I&#39;m not entirely sure about ibus configuration yeah I haven&#39;t tried using FC EXT or whatever it was FCX um yeah yeah I don&#39;t even know why I used that one I I don&#39;t recall at all it&#39;s probably more modern or something like that but um it&#39;s just that every issue I have could potentially well at least least in this regard it could be potentially also solved if I just used uh mosque or if I used FC instead of uh ibus and stuff like that but like yeah if I want to have the perfect opper like uh environment it&#39;s definitely going to it&#39;s it&#39;s at this point it needs to be a hobby or something that you know I get something in return because uh at least in terms of like uh not um in terms of Ethics but in terms of like practicality and stuff like that yeah yeah yeah um that&#39;s why I have the channel yeah honestly a lot of my early videos were just I&#39;m going to make a video about something that I that I broke and then I fixed um and even now that still occasionally happens uh and now you have over a thousand videos yeah I&#39;m see I I would like to do the you know one highly edited video and I&#39;m sure like if I did that it&#39;d probably be better for the channel I just have this problem where I have a lot of things I want to talk about yeah it&#39;s so like in some ways I&#39;m like uh I really wish I could make videos like that myself as well because I clearly I have so much to talk about because I even we were supposed to end this podcast a while ago like 20 minutes ago yeah but like uh I can&#39;t do that in my videos because every minute of like sometimes it takes me an entire day like 10 hours to edit one minute of a video and just like you know recording voice lines takes me like also a really really long time so the longer a video takes uh gets the longer it takes essentially and I have established a certain level of uh format or a certain level of you know um editing effort in all of my videos so if I suddenly break a away from that it&#39;s um it feels a bit weird so and like it&#39;s going to be the more videos I make it&#39;s going to be hard for viewers to find videos that are of that previous of the current format and and you know hide away the videos that are you know essentially unedited and stuff like that but the problem is that YouTube as a career choice heavily depends on quantity over quality essentially because even if you make a thousand videos that get 1K views each that is a million views overall uh but if you make let&#39;s say 12 videos a year so one video a month there&#39;s a high chance that you only get like 100,000 views in total even though it took you like about the same amount of time to make so yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a difficult choice in that sense out of curiosity how long did that um 15 minute Mac OS video take you to make like multiple months like uh if I take the video that that I made before that and then takes the video I made after then it was I made the video before on Fe February 20th and after that it was uh April 13th so yeah like a few months Jesus and right now it&#39;s been almost a month since my um last video and actually I was already making the video I made the last video in like a few days which is extremely rare uh I made it in between making the current video so in reality the current video has been taking me like MH almost two months right now so and it&#39;s like 24 minutes long right now so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s like like it&#39;s really hard to balance because like all the time I&#39;m thinking like man I want to make I want to make I have so many videos I want to make but I can&#39;t because I&#39;m stuck to this format unless I break the format so but at the same time I&#39;m like I&#39;m glad that all of my videos are of a certain type of you know are consistent in a way yeah I my my my editing is very very simple I don&#39;t I do not take a month to make a video um I take uh it&#39;s usually about in like the hour hour and a half range like my my editing is super basic I might Chuck a couple of jpegs on top of stuff uh most of my editing is just cutting out my inability to string a sentence together yeah I I&#39;m also like uh like I said it takes me really long to to voice line so it&#39;s like not common for a one minute of voice recordings to take me like an hour or two hours because like uh even if like it takes me like 15 tries to get a sentence like properly pronounced so it&#39;s articulated properly and so on but then it has like a click in in somewhere that I can&#39;t get out of the audio and it&#39;s so noticeable that I have to do it again and things like that and like y if I like start making the if I start the voice lines my voice is not warmed up and it takes me like a like 30 minutes to an hour to get warmed up and then it&#39;s like okay the voice clips that I did a minute ago sound completely different to the ones I do did now so I had to do all of them again or it&#39;s going to sound really weird and stuff like that I know the feeling all too well luckily I do things in like well either the another problem where I&#39;ll get to the end of my recording session I&#39;m like now my voice is kind of tired sounding cuz I be like 6 seven hours into recording for that day and it&#39;s like I I it&#39;s taken a while to get to the point where it&#39;s it&#39;s less noticeable that I&#39;ve recorded something later in the day yeah it&#39;s uh it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of things that go on behind the scenes that seem like they don&#39;t take any time but actually are like quite complicated yeah yeah for sure um we probably should end this off at some point yeah yeah probably um I don&#39;t know when this will be out but maybe you have another video out by then cuz I my my plan is I&#39;m recording like a bunch of podcasts before Christmas and then uh release them over that time so this is probably going to be out I don&#39;t know probably mid December maybe late December um okay so there&#39;s your excuse to get a video done check out the channel see if there&#39;s a video there that&#39;s new yeah um I suppose I guess this is now outside of the episode already the it&#39;s not being recorded right uh no finish off the outro and then tell me what you don&#39;t wanton be recorded um oh no I was just wondering uh it&#39;s nothing like that outro yes outro can you can can you do your part of the outro oh am I supposed to do an outro yes oh tell me where they can find your stuff you&#39;ve been here two times already okay I misunderstood what you said uh yeah you can find my YouTube channel on my YouTube I mean on YouTube and I I you can I suppose subscribe to me on Twitter as well and follow me on YouTube it&#39;s completely in Reverse but I mean I don&#39;t use Twitter that much I just announced videos yeah but yeah that&#39;s it and for for my viewers I suppose like I said before like I genuinely like Pro this channel is the only Linux channel channel that I&#39;m subscribed to and I actually watch the videos sometimes so I really recommend that channel for learning stuff as well thank you I appreciate it um yeah uh guess my outro your videos are also really good I just don&#39;t find time to watch them because there is they&#39;re long um no that&#39;s that&#39;s totally fine like I have like a bunch of channels that I sometimes interact with as well but it&#39;s like I feel bad because I never watch their videos anymore because I don&#39;t have time either like I&#39;ll

conversation from a show or podcast where the host welcomes a recurring guest named Li Kivy. The discussion begins with greetings in various languages, including Japanese, and reflects upon the guest&#39;s last appearance on the show, which was about a year ago. They discuss Li Kivy&#39;s experience with learning Japanese, mentioning how the Duolingo app has its quirks, especially with sentence structure and certain translations. The conversation reveals Li Kivy&#39;s extensive use of Duolingo and other learning tools like Anki, and they explore the concept that consistency is more important in language learning than the specific tools used. The guest also touches on the challenges of sentence mining and how different language learning resources have their limitations. Li Kivy notes the unique vocabulary one acquires from sentence mining, depending on the media consumed, like anime. The discussion also includes personal anecdotes about language learning journeys, the advantages of establishing a routine, and how language learning is a cumulative process. Toward the end, they shift the conversation to Li Kivy&#39;s recent experiences trying out Linux, dealing with hardware and software compatibility issues, especially concerning Nvidia drivers and video editing software like DaVinci Resolve. The conversation concludes with Li Kivy expressing the desire to possibly daily drive Linux but recognizing the current impediments such as driver issues and the need for further configurations.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-f10f9263 data-v-17f8dd4a><div class="review" data-v-17f8dd4a><div class="review-title" data-v-17f8dd4a><span class="icon" data-v-17f8dd4a>question:</span>In estonian, for estonians write an article on how to make it out a bad financial situation.

Võib-olla oled Sa hetkel olukorras, kus rahalised mured varjutavad igapäevast elurõõmu. Ära heida meelt – olukordi, kus rahaasjad on keerulised, kogeb pea igaüks meist elu jooksul. See artikkel pakub Sulle mõningaid võib-olla vähemlevinud, kuid tõhusaid viise, kuidas raskustest välja tulla. Järgnevad nõuanded ei ole tavapärased &quot;kuidas kulusid kärpida&quot; tüüpi soovitused. Selle asemel keskendume sellele, kuidas teha oma finantsseis veelgi tugevamaks. 1. Suurenda sissetulekuid, ära koonda kulusid Kõige olulisem reegel halvast finantsolukorrast väljumiseks on keskenduda oma sissetulekute suurendamisele, mitte ainult kulude kärpimisele. Jah, eelarve ülevaatus ja liigsed kulutused maha kriipsutamine on kasulikud, aga tõelise muutuse toob sissetulekute tõus. 1.1 Palu palgatõusu – kõige hullem, mis juhtuda saab, on &quot;ei&quot; Võid mõelda, et palgatõusu küsimine on ebamugav või isegi mõttetu, aga ära alahinda selle küsimuse jõudu. Kõigepealt uuri, millised on sinu töötasu põhjendused ja millised on sektori palgastandardid. Seejärel põhjenda oma ülemusele, miks just Sina väärid palgatõusu – sea sisse oma saavutused, kogemused ja lisaväärtus, mida firmale tood. On täiesti võimalik, et Sinu ülemus on Sinu panusest niivõrd teadlik, et on valmis palgatõusu võimaluse üle arutlema. 2. Sotsialiseerumine – inimesed töötavad paremini ühtsuses Inimestevahelised suhted on edu võtmeks igas eluvaldkonnas, kaasa arvatud finantsmaailmas. Tekita enda ümber võrgustik inimesi, kes toetavad üksteist nii heas kui halvas. Ära karda küsida nõu või jagada oma kogemusi. See võib lahti harutada võimalusi, mis varem tundusid kättesaamatud. Lisaks tööalastele kontaktidele tasub silmas pidada ka sõpru ja pereliikmeid – koos on kergem ideid genereerida ja teostada. 3. Stressi juhtimine enesearenguga Rahaline surve võib tekitada suurt stressi, mis omakorda pärsib võimekust olukorraga toime tulla. Just seetõttu on oluline leida viise oma stressitaseme maandamiseks. Alusta lihtsatest asjadest nagu regulaarne kehaline aktiivsus – näiteks jooksmine, ujumine või jooga. Need tegevused aitavad vähendada stressihormoone ja annavad energiat ning selgust mõtetes. 4. Õpi väärtuslikke oskusi Eesti kiirelt areneva majandusega koos kasvab ka nõudlus spetsiifiliste oskuste järele. Infoajastu võimaldab igaühel omandada uusi teadmisi – kasuta seda enda kasuks. Õppides näiteks programmeerimist, müügitöö nõkse või muid väärtuslikke oskusi, avardad oma tööturu võimalusi. Tänapäeval on paljudel platvormidel (nt Coursera, Udemy jms) kursuseid, mis on loodud kiireks ja efektiivseks õppeks. 5. (oma lisatud teema) Eelarvestamine ja rahavoogude haldamine Kui sissetulekute suurendamine on eesmärk, siis ei tohiks tähelepanuta jätta ka oma rahavoogude tarka haldamist. Koosta põhjalik eelarve, kus on kirjas Sinu sissetulekud ja väljaminekud. Mõistlik on pöörata tähelepanu ka säästmisele ja investeerimisele, et raha sinu jaoks tööle panna. Kui oma rahaasjade planeerimine tundub keeruline, otsi abi finantsnõustajatelt või haarata kadu kasulikest veebirakendustest, mis aitavad sel teemal silma peal hoida.

This time, he is not falsely accused but purposely incarcerated with a hidden motive. As he unravels the truth, he discovers that the person responsible for this elaborate setup is also behind the murder of his brother, Lincoln Burrows. Now, Michael must break free, expose the real killer, and seek justice for Lincoln. Episode 1: &quot;The Great Betrayal&quot; Michael, using a different identity, is framed for a crime he didn&#39;t commit. He&#39;s sent to Fox River State Penitentiary, where he discovers his fellow inmates are loyal followers of the true mastermind. He must find a way to gain their trust while formulating an escape plan. Episode 2: &quot;Reunions and Revelations&quot; Michael reconnects with T-Bag, Sucre, and C-Note, who have infiltrated Fox River to keep an eye on him. They reveal that they received a cryptic message from Lincoln before his death, hinting at a conspiracy involving high-ranking officials. Together, they begin investigating the truth while avoiding suspicion. Episode 3: &quot;Behind Bars, Unveiling Clues&quot; Michael puts his engineering skills to use once again, devising a plan to uncover hidden evidence scattered throughout Fox River. Meanwhile, he earns the trust of a prison guard who is secretly seeking redemption for being manipulated by the mastermind. Episode 4: &quot;Sinister Connections&quot; Michael discovers a connection between an influential politician, corrupt guards, and the true killer. With each new piece of evidence, he realizes that Lincoln&#39;s murder was more than just an assassination but part of a broader conspiracy to protect powerful interests. Episode 5: &quot;The Key to Freedom&quot; Michael orchestrates a daring escape plan with the help of his fellow inmates and external allies, including Sara Tancredi, Lincoln&#39;s former girlfriend, and a renowned lawyer determined to bring down the hidden puppet master. Their plan is disrupted when one of their own double crosses them. Episode 6: &quot;The Shadows Unveiled&quot; While on the run, Michael uncovers a confidential file that details the corruption within the justice system. Along the way, he learns that his own family members were coerced into assisting the mastermind. With newfound determination, Michael vengefully sets his sights on exposing the true culprits and avenging Lincoln&#39;s death. Episode 7: &quot;Betrayal of Loyalty&quot; Michael&#39;s vendetta against the mastermind leads him to a surprising revelation: the true killer was someone he once considered an unbreakable ally. This betrayal shakes him to the core, leaving him questioning everything and everyone around him. Episode 8: &quot;Unmasking the Mastermind&quot; Michael initiates an elaborate plan to expose the mastermind&#39;s true identity and bring him to justice. He realizes that the conspiracy reaches far beyond just Fox River State Penitentiary and decides to expose them on a national scale, using his engineering genius as leverage. Episode 9: &quot;Final Showdown&quot; The battle between Michael and the mastermind reaches its climax as shocking truths, hidden alliances, and devastating sacrifices are revealed. Michael uses his intricate knowledge of the prison system to outwit the conspirators, ultimately uncovering the full extent of their evil machinations. Episode 10: &quot;Justice Served&quot; In the aftermath of the final confrontation, the mastermind is unmasked, and the truth about Lincoln&#39;s murder is exposed for all to see. Michael ensures that everyone involved, from corrupted officials to prison personnel, faces the consequences of their actions. With justice finally served, Michael can at last find solace and closure, honoring Lincoln&#39;s memory.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-f10f9263 data-v-17f8dd4a><div class="review" data-v-17f8dd4a><div class="review-title" data-v-17f8dd4a><span class="icon" data-v-17f8dd4a>question:</span>In estonian, for estonians write an article on how to make it out a bad financial situation.

Kuid ei tasu heita meelt – siin on mõned konkreetsemad ja praktilisemad nõuanded, mis aitavad teil leida tee majandusliku kindlustundeni. Need ei ole teie tavalised &quot;kõigile sobivad&quot; nõuanded, vaid realistlikud sammud, mida paljud inimesed sageli ei kaalu. 1. Suurendage sissetulekuid, mitte ärge ainult kärpige kulusid. Kui olete harjunud mõtlema, et ainus viis rahaliseks stabiilsuseks on kulude kärpimine, siis on aeg mõtlemist muuta. Sageli on lihtsam ja tõhusam suurendada sissetulekuid. 1.1. Paluge palgatõusu. Selles polnud mingit kõhklust – küsige julgelt palgatõusu. Halvim, mis juhtuda võib, on see, et ülemus ütleb &quot;ei&quot;. Kuid isegi see &quot;ei&quot; annab teile väärtuslikku tagasisidet. Võib-olla on aeg otsida uusi väljakutseid või parandada tööalast sooritust. Igal juhul olete astunud sammu ettepoole. 2. Suhelge. Inimesed on loomult sotsiaalsed olendid, ja tihtipeale saavutame koos rohkem kui üksi. Ärge alahinnake tutvuste võimu. Võrgustikud ei ole mitte ainult suurepärased uute töökohtade või ärivõimaluste leidmiseks, vaid võivad pakkuda ka emotsionaalset toetust ja nõuandeid. 2.1. Looge enda ümber tugev tugivõrgustik. Olgu selleks sõbrad, perekond või kolleegid – leidke inimesed, kes teid toetavad ja inspireerivad. Suhtlemine aitab mitte ainult leevendada emotsionaalset stressi, vaid avardab ka teie silmaringi. 2.2. Võtke osa ühistegevustest. Käige kogukonna sündmustel, ärge kõhelge liitumast klubide või organisatsioonidega, mis vastavad teie huvidele. Need on suurepärased kohad ideede vahetamiseks ja uute oskuste omandamiseks. 3. Hallake stressi enesearengu kaudu. Stress võib olla suurim takistus edu saavutamisel, kuid iga raskusega tuleb kohaneda ja õppida seda kontrollima. 3.1. Alustage treenimist. Füüsiline aktiivsus ei aita ainult parandada tervist, vaid ka vabastab meele pingeist. Regulaarne liikumine parandab keskendumisvõimet ja tootlikkust. 3.2. Mediteerige või leidke muid lõõgastumisviise. Stressihalduse tehnikad on igaühe jaoks erinevad – leidke enda jaoks sobiv ja pidage selle juurde. 4. Õppige väärtuslikke oskusi. Tänapäeva kiirelt muutuvas majanduses on elukestev õpe hädavajalik. 4.1. Programmeerimine, müük, turundus ja reklaam on valdkonnad, mis nõuavad spetsiifilisi oskusi ja pakuvad palju võimalusi. Investeerige aega ja ressursse, et õppida midagi uut, mis võiks teie karjääri edendada ning tõsta teie turuväärtust. 4.2. Kursused ja sertifikaadid. Eneseareng ei pea olema kulukas – tänapäeval on palju võimalusi õppida tasuta või väikese tasu eest online-kursustel. Boonus: järgige 80/20 reeglit. Tuntud ka kui Pareto printsiip, see reegel tähendab, et umbes 80% tulemustest saavutatakse 20% tegevustest. Fokuseerige oma energiat ja aega tegevustele, mis toovad suurima tasu. 5.1. Analüüsige tegevusi, mis toovad enim tulu – kas on tegu projektiga, mis võiks tuua lisasissetulekut või mõne oskusega, mille parandamine suurendaks teie tööväärtust. 5.2. Ärge kõhelge loobumast neist tegevustest, mis kulutavad rohkem teie aega ja ressursse, kui nad väärt on. Kui teil on tõsine soov oma rahalist olukorda parandada, siis on esimene samm tunnistada, et see nõuab aega, kannatlikkust ja järjepidevat tööd. Need nõuanded aitavad teil suunda määrata, kuid peate olema valmis ka tegutsema. Ükskõik milline olukord on, ärge kaotage lootust. Soovitan teil liituda meie e-posti listiga, et saada regulaarseid nõuandeid ja ressursse, mis aitavad teil saavutada rahalise iseseisvuse. Me kõik vajame väikest tuge ning meie kogukond on siin selleks, et toetada teid sellel teel. Registreeruge kohe ja astuge esimene samm oma majandusliku tuleviku kindlustamiseks.
